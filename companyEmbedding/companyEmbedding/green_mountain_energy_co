Did you know that the traditional production of electricity from fossil fuel sources is the leading industrial cause of air pollution and the #1 contributor of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the U.S.? Purchasing cleaner energy, made from renewable resources like wind and solar, is one of the easiest things you can do to help reduce your household’s CO2 emissions…even easier than recycling!
Thanks for choosing Green Mountain™ electricity products.

History[edit]
Green Mountain Energy began in Vermont in August 1997 as an offshoot of Green Mountain Power to take advantage of electricity deregulation around the country.[3] The company moved its headquarters to its current location in Austin, Texas, in September 2000. Green Mountain began serving the Texas competitive market in January 2002 and was the first retailer to offer alternative energy in the state.[4] In August 2009, Green Mountain Energy expanded to the New York City market, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the Con Edison service territory.[5]
In November 2010, Green Mountain Energy was acquired by NRG Energy for $350 million.[3] Green Mountain Energy once operated as a standalone subsidiary of NRG, but now operates as one of NRG's many brands. With the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy’s renewable offerings, NRG became one of the largest retailers of green power in the nation. NRG derives 93% of its energy from burning fossil fuels.[6]
Green Mountain Energy made national headlines in January 2011 by signing a two-year agreement to provide 100% renewable energy to the Empire State Building, making this the largest commercial green power purchase in New York City at that time.[7] The following year, in February 2012, the company partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to power Super Bowl XLVI with 15 million kWh of renewable energy.[8] In June 2012, Green Mountain Energy expanded to Pennsylvania, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the PECO and PPL service territories.[9] As of July 2013, Green Mountain Energy Company serves customers in all seven Pennsylvania service territories.
Residential services[edit]
In Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania, Green Mountain Energy directly serves residential electricity customers who live in a deregulated utility service territory.[9][10] Green Mountain Energy also partners with utilities in regulated markets in the U.S., such as Portland General Electric (PGE) in Oregon, to offer renewable energy products to their customers. Additionally, Green Mountain Energy participates in multi-supplier utility partnering programs in New York and New Jersey.
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s flagship residential electricity product is "Pollution Free electricity", made from 100% renewable sources. Another product, "Pollution Free Gold", offers 95% PA-sourced wind and 5% PA-sourced solar energy to residential customers in Pennsylvania. This product also includes a monthly donation to the Sun Club, a Green Mountain program which donates solar energy to non-profit organizations. Green Mountain Energy also offers renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offset products to individuals nationwide. In May 2009, the company launched the "Renewable Rewards" Buy-Back program, which credits customers with renewable generation facilities on their homes for excess energy their facility sends back to the electric grid.[11] In April 2011, the company also launched a solar leasing program for residential solar panels.[12]
In April 2011, Green Mountain Energy announced "Pollution Free EV", a 100% wind electricity product exclusively for electric vehicle owners. This product can be used in conjunction with NRG Energy’s eVgo program for unlimited EV charging.[13] In June 2013, Green Mountain launched a new product called "Pollution Free Efficient", which is the first and only 100% pollution-free energy product to be paired with the Nest Learning Thermostat.
Commercial services[edit]
Green Mountain has a commercial and industrial division that offers cleaner energy products to business customers in Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania.[9] The commercial division began in 2004 and offers business customers the opportunity to reduce their CO2 emissions footprint by purchasing renewable energy or carbon offsets. Green Mountain Energy Solutions is a new division launched in 2011, which offers "sustainable business solutions"[clarification needed] to companies nationwide.[14]
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy offers commercial and industrial customers renewable energy products, including renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets,[15] and sustainable business solutions through the Green Mountain Energy Solutions group.
Renewable facilities[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s customer demand has helped spur the development of over 50 wind and solar facilities around the U.S., including more than 35 solar facility donations funded by Green Mountain Energy Sun Club members (previously Big Texas Sun Club).[16] Green Mountain Energy also purchases 100% of the renewable generation from the Green Mountain Energy Winds Farms—Langford and Elbow Creek to supply their consumers and businesses. Jointly, these two West Texas wind farms can produce up to 270 megawatts (MW) of clean power.[citation needed]

Green Mountain Energy made national headlines in January 2011 by signing a two-year agreement to provide 100% renewable energy to the Empire State Building, making this the largest commercial green power purchase in New York City at that time.[7] The following year, in February 2012, the company partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to power Super Bowl XLVI with 15 million kWh of renewable energy.[8] In June 2012, Green Mountain Energy expanded to Pennsylvania, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the PECO and PPL service territories.[9] As of July 2013, Green Mountain Energy Company serves customers in all seven Pennsylvania service territories.
Residential services[edit]
In Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania, Green Mountain Energy directly serves residential electricity customers who live in a deregulated utility service territory.[9][10] Green Mountain Energy also partners with utilities in regulated markets in the U.S., such as Portland General Electric (PGE) in Oregon, to offer renewable energy products to their customers. Additionally, Green Mountain Energy participates in multi-supplier utility partnering programs in New York and New Jersey.
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s flagship residential electricity product is "Pollution Free electricity", made from 100% renewable sources. Another product, "Pollution Free Gold", offers 95% PA-sourced wind and 5% PA-sourced solar energy to residential customers in Pennsylvania. This product also includes a monthly donation to the Sun Club, a Green Mountain program which donates solar energy to non-profit organizations. Green Mountain Energy also offers renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offset products to individuals nationwide. In May 2009, the company launched the "Renewable Rewards" Buy-Back program, which credits customers with renewable generation facilities on their homes for excess energy their facility sends back to the electric grid.[11] In April 2011, the company also launched a solar leasing program for residential solar panels.[12]
In April 2011, Green Mountain Energy announced "Pollution Free EV", a 100% wind electricity product exclusively for electric vehicle owners. This product can be used in conjunction with NRG Energy’s eVgo program for unlimited EV charging.[13] In June 2013, Green Mountain launched a new product called "Pollution Free Efficient", which is the first and only 100% pollution-free energy product to be paired with the Nest Learning Thermostat.
Commercial services[edit]
Green Mountain has a commercial and industrial division that offers cleaner energy products to business customers in Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania.[9] The commercial division began in 2004 and offers business customers the opportunity to reduce their CO2 emissions footprint by purchasing renewable energy or carbon offsets. Green Mountain Energy Solutions is a new division launched in 2011, which offers "sustainable business solutions"[clarification needed] to companies nationwide.[14]
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy offers commercial and industrial customers renewable energy products, including renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets,[15] and sustainable business solutions through the Green Mountain Energy Solutions group.
Renewable facilities[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s customer demand has helped spur the development of over 50 wind and solar facilities around the U.S., including more than 35 solar facility donations funded by Green Mountain Energy Sun Club members (previously Big Texas Sun Club).[16] Green Mountain Energy also purchases 100% of the renewable generation from the Green Mountain Energy Winds Farms—Langford and Elbow Creek to supply their consumers and businesses. Jointly, these two West Texas wind farms can produce up to 270 megawatts (MW) of clean power.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Green Mountain Energy began in Vermont in August 1997 as an offshoot of Green Mountain Power to take advantage of electricity deregulation around the country.[3] The company moved its headquarters to its current location in Austin, Texas, in September 2000. Green Mountain began serving the Texas competitive market in January 2002 and was the first retailer to offer alternative energy in the state.[4] In August 2009, Green Mountain Energy expanded to the New York City market, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the Con Edison service territory.[5]

            Learn about ConsumerAffairs for Brands!Consumer Complaints and ReviewsWill of Atascocita, TX on July 3, 2017Consumer Increased Rating!2I concluded my 12-month residential electricity contract with Green Mountain Energy Company on June 22, 2017. I needed a Letter of Credit from Green Mountain to avoid paying a deposit to my new provider. I called Green Mountain and requested the letter. I received the letter on June 23, 2017, and it stated that I had two late payments in the previous twelve months. This came as a surprise to me considering I was on "Auto-Pay" with Green Mountain and my monthly bills were submitted to my Chase Visa routinely without incident. I spoke with a representative from Green Mountain on June 27, 2017, to resolve this issue. The Green Mountain representative informed me that my July bill was due on August 11th and Chase paid it on August 12th, and my September bill was due on October 11th and Chase paid it on October 12th. Thus, my Letter of Credit stated I had two late payments. The Green Mountain representative suggested I contact Chase about this apparent discrepancy and she refused to remove the two late payments from my letter. Later that day, I spoke with a representative from Chase Visa and was told that they only have a record of the process dates (8/12/16 and 10/12/16) and no errors were recorded. As a consumer, I feel I am at a distinct disadvantage because I cannot prove when these requests for payment were actually made by Green Mountain. This seems like a simple matter that could be resolved with little effort. Both bills were paid, and I had no control over when Green Mountain submitted them.Helpful?YesNoLynette of Laurel, MD on June 26, 2017Consumer Increased Rating!2I signed up with Green Mountain Energy at a Sears near me because I wanted a less expensive rate than BG&E. It was sometime last year. There seemed to not be any problems with my account until I received the June bill from BG&E. I was charged $55.76 for BG&E electric delivery! I sent an email to Green Mountain to cancel and to switch me back to BG&E. I received a response stating that they will. I am so sorry for those who associated themselves with this company. I hope all issues will be resolved.Helpful?YesNoMichael of Houston, TX on June 23, 2017Satisfaction RatingI talked to a Green Mountain sales person at a trade show. He fed me the sales pitch. I told him I was only interested in more information, not switching. He asked for some basic info which he entered into a tablet. A few days later I get a card in the mail saying I have authorized switching my energy account over to Green Mountain. I call in to let Green Mountain Energy know I did not authorize the switch. The customer service reps give you a run around type confirmation. I called back to make sure I was not switched. Then I am told I will be returned to my original provider after two business cycles.The sales person I spoke with is Jay **. He lied and he is crooked. I think the entire organization might be crooked. Don't walk away from Green Mountain Energy, and their "renewable and affordable" service. Run! And learn from my mistake, don't give out personal info at trade show booths or to any sales people at stores, events, etc.Helpful?YesNoShannah of Houston, TX on June 9, 2017Satisfaction RatingOn May 13th, 2017 I went to the Houston Pet Expo and stopped to chat with Green Mountain Energy. The representative told me they had a promotion going on; he wanted to know if I was interested in switching providers. I was interested and told him I was on contract with my current provider until 6/22/17. He extended their promotion, took down my information and said I had until 6/22/17 to join with them. Then I received an e-mail the next day talking about the promotion in the subject title. I never opened it. Until today. When I wanted to investigate their rates now that my current contract is expiring soon.That. A-hole. He signed me up for their service to begin 6/22/17. I don't know even know how that is legal or possible. I signed no paperwork other than entering my contact information. I called and canceled. I didn't seem to have any problems with that. I did demand that they e-mail me proof of my cancellation. I haven't received it yet. But I'll never in my lifetime mess these con artists again. If I hadn't finally read that e-mail I'd be paying double electric companies. Wth?Helpful?YesNoRobert of Harlingen, TX on June 8, 2017Satisfaction RatingI was pressured into signing up for Green Mountain while shopping. This company is a ripoff. My bill is almost 300 dollars. I live in a small one bedroom; hardly use electricity. Plus they have a AEP delivery fee which is in the 50/60 dollars price include in my bill. I was never told of this fee every month. I never payed this high with any other company. Green Mountain is a scam and a ripoff. Be safe and choose a different company.Helpful?YesNo

They will tell you that "we are providing same rate like ComEd does" and they will say you are saving environment by using green energy blah blah and then suddenly they will increase the rate and if you do not notice your bills then you are paying high rate and they will not refund single penny also.Helpful?YesNoIsaac-Tracey of Severna Park, MD on May 12, 2017Satisfaction RatingI was approached by a representative from the Green Mountain Energy Co. while shopping in a Kmart store. I listened to what the girl had to say and said NO several times. I didn't want to change anything with my current carrier. I expressed my concern about my bill getting all screwed up and told her that is why I didn't want to do any changes. I was reassured that nothing was going to change on my bill. It would be exactly the same just my supplier. I got my electric bill today and just as I was afraid of happened. My bill is over a 130 dollars more. I called the company and was told that it's because I have budget billing. I am very disappointed that the girl never once mentioned anything about the way the billing would be if I was on budget billing. I think that is something very important the representatives need to mention when they are asked several times "is anything going to change with my bill". I am on budget bill for a reason and to have a surprise extra 130 show up on my bill doesn't make me very happy. I have since cancelled with them and plan on filing a complaint with the company as well. I hate being lied to. I would have never done the change in the first place if I knew this would happen because of being on budget billing. I will be sure to let everyone know that I can not to go with them. I was lied to just to get me to change. This is very misleading and wrong to take advantage of people this way and catch them while at a store and a lot of people are in a rush as I was that day. I was told it does mention the budget billing in the paper work but I didn't even think about looking for that because I was reassured several times nothing was going to change on my bill. Just very disappointed.Helpful?YesNoNorma of Alice, TX on Jan. 17, 2017Satisfaction RatingThis company took advantage of an 83 year with dementia. They lied about giving her a lower bill & $300 bill credit. The con man that went to my mom's house didn't hear her say "this isn't my house". She's not mentally competent to make a decision like switching light company. Till this day her light bill was higher than the other company she was with & hasn't received the $300 bill credit that was promised. Worst company ever.Helpful?YesNoRonda of Houston, TX on Nov. 7, 2016Satisfaction RatingMy mother has this service and we have been fighting since July 2016 on a fraud/identity theft issue. She is elderly and on limited income. Someone apparently used her identity at another address and did not pay the bill. Rather than contracting her and asking her about it, they automatically charged her on her account for the past due balance and said that if she did not pay, she would have her lights turned off. She was afraid and paid. When I found out what happened we started fighting to get her money credited back. We have been round and round. They have asked us to fax information. Which we have done twice and then they say they never received it. Yet I have the fax confirmation. This is causing undue stress on an elderly woman! All over a measly amount. At this point, it is the principle of the matter for me. What in the heck are they doing adding something without confirming that it is her! The customer service at this company is beyond poor.Helpful?YesNoErica of Vernon, TX on Oct. 11, 2016Satisfaction RatingThese people came knocking on my door one day. I was a Just Energy customer. I was not dissatisfied with my provider but GME sold us a line of crap! I don't remember what the kwh usage was but it wasn't more than what I was already paying being they told me my bill was too high with them and that I would never have a bill that high with them GME. Free weekends on electric which meant less on a bill. One would think!? Right? Well I was wrong! First few bills were pretty cheap then they gradually just kept going up and up to almost 500.00 for a 4 br house. I never paid over 300 with Just Energy. I do live in a large house that is two story and I do have kids who leave things on. I've been paying about 300 for some years now so that is normal to me. But these people are crooks and will rip you off! I am not the type of person to not pay my bills but I will say thanks for the last month for free electric because you won't be seeing a dime from me. They screwed me and basically made it difficult for me to pay other bills. Please be aware of these people. Don't use them! I don't know how people live with themselves doing this type of thing to people! It's awful!Helpful?YesNonigel of Sugar Land, TX on Oct. 7, 2016Satisfaction RatingThey allowed the tenant in my property to transfer the service, cancelled mine and then charged me a termination fee for my contract without any reference to myself. I offered them to connect service and transfer the service at my new address. They did not provide service in that area and therefore, in full contravention of the agreement I signed, have continued to charge me the cancellation fee. The customer service person called Victoria ranged from rude to then issuing threats about collection agencies. Don't go near them. They are crooks.Helpful?YesNoZeke of Houstont, TX on Sept. 24, 2016Satisfaction RatingI am used to paying under 150 a month normally, but once I bought a house my energy usage was lower than what I used in apartments and with Green Mountain it seems my rate rises EVERY MONTH. Now my bill are coming in at over $220 a month and also their FEES ARE STUPID HIGH! BEWARE!! For being late they can charge you up to $70 extra added to your bill. Then they have tons of different ways to raise the bill. I tried calling to get help even though I am not on a plan and pay month to month. You would think they would help me since I pay more a month for their service but no. I feel no love from this company and they are giving it to me with no lube on my wallet! I will cancel ASAP. And will never deal with them again.Helpful?YesNoMarisela of Alice, TX on Nov. 15, 2015Satisfaction RatingYes, I've been a happy camper with Green Mountain for a little over two years now. Last week or maybe the week before I've been experiencing problems making an online payment on my cell phone - submitting online payments with my debit card I've had over 8+ yrs and making payments consecutively with the same card, giving me an error that the three security numbers in the back of the card to the right side where invalid. And, I did try it a couple times after just in case I was entering numbers incorrectly on my end. Well earlier that morning I had just made a payment online using the same device and I experienced no problems.Well I've spoken to many reps concerning my issue informing me it is nothing on their end, but yet I've made plenty other purchases online with the same card and I have zero issues or complaints. And gets me a little mad when they're explaining to me that it is something wrong on my end, but yes I've also spoken to my debit card Corporation (Netspend) assured me everything was carefully reviewed my personal info on their end. So it's a little frustrating they can't figure out this simple issue. Very disappointed customer.Helpful?YesNosamuel of Weslaco, TX on Sept. 27, 2015Satisfaction RatingI closed my automatic payment but it does not reflect on their system right away. I paid using my credit card prior to my due date but on my due date their system withdrew on my bank account. I was promised that they will pay my overdraft fee - 5 days later, they didn't. I called them back and they refused to pay me back.Helpful?YesNoRaul of Odessa, TX on Aug. 13, 2015Satisfaction RatingThis company will rip you off!!! I live in a one bedroom apt that is approx 500 sq ft which has NO washer/dryer. It only has a fridge, microwave, and stove (don't use since I don't cook) in TX. I am rarely home, I work all day and don't get here until about 10 pm. My bill kept going up every month. It started out at $100.67 which wasn't bad but then it went up to $187, so I called them and they said it was what it was and that I was spending all that electricity and that I had to pay such amount. I explained to them how this wasn't possible and told them that it was outrageous and if this continued I was going to leave, to what they replied that I was a month-month customer and I could do as I pleased. Anyway I still stayed and the next bill was for $212, and when I saw what their predictor for my next bill (230.54) I decided to cancel. To summarize RUN AWAY from this company. They will try to draw you in with cheap rates but it's all a scam. I decided to change to TXU. Hopefully they treat me better. I will post as soon as I get my first TXU bill.Helpful?YesNoFreda of Bronx, NY on Aug. 8, 2015Satisfaction RatingThey told me that my bill would be cheaper than what I was paying with Con-Ed and it ended up being twice what I was paying. Please people stay away from Green Mountain if you want more money in your pockets. My supply cost is @16.4000. They been ripping me off and every time I paid my bill I would pay twenty-forty dollars extra than what my bill was... and I live in a one bedroom apartment.Helpful?YesNoS of Corpus, TX on Aug. 3, 2015Satisfaction RatingCalled two times to start my power. My apartment charged me $50 for the delay in switching of power. I should have listened to the bad reviews and other claims of unfairness. Run for the hills!Helpful?YesNoJackie of Irving, TX on July 21, 2015Satisfaction RatingI also had to call them to cancel and use the "ID number" on all communication, spoke to 3 reps today. None knew this number. After 40 minutes, I find they are in Mexico. I am so tired to trying to CANCEL! Hopefully others don't have this issue.Helpful?YesNoMaritza of Dallas, TX on Nov. 10, 2014Satisfaction RatingI have been contacting Green Mountain since September regarding a discrepancy on our business account. Every time I called, they said they were escalating to billing. We didn't get word that our contract had expired until November. The person that finally noticed said we are liable for our month-to-month rate which is double the amount we were paying. If I would have been told in September of this, it would have been taken care of immediately. Now 2 months later with an answer, almost a 2,000 bill, and they say we are liable for it. We don't deny we owe the money but the ball was dropped on this.Helpful?YesNoYacob of Katy, TX on Sept. 9, 2013Satisfaction RatingBeen with this company for over 2 yrs now. I get their bill inconsistently. 4 weeks ago I called to check my balance (since I received no bill) and was told I had 0 balance. I went online to see now my bill is almost $800. This company is a rip off and fraud.Helpful?YesNoBobbie of Spring, TX on Jan. 3, 2011Electric bill shot up. Appealed to Reliant Energy to read meter, they replaced without giving me a meter test as requested. Appealed to Green Mountain to look into charges, was refused information, as I had turned in a change of provider, on the grounds that I was no longer a customer when in fact I still was. New provider goes into effect tomorrow, Tuesday, July 13, 2010. New meter reading scheduled for tomorrow. Last month meter reading, estimated by Centerpoint Energy, was very high (@ 150% of avg.). How will I get reimbursed overage charges from Green Mountain?

            Electricity is an essential service and part of daily living. In the past, consumers had no choice in providers and simply connected to the power grid through the existing, local electric company.However, in Texas, energy was deregulated in 2002, meaning that consumers are now able to choose from several electricity companies that will provide electricity to their home or place of business. Texas electricity companies allow Texans to opt for a provider with whom they align philosophically and with the best deal for them financially.

        	Top
        	Company legacyMany Texas electricity companies have been around for decades, and each has a reputation that precedes it. Customers may want to take into account a company’s history and how they have handled providing electricity in the past.Legacy providers: The oldest Texas electricity companies, called legacy companies, have been around the longest, and they have provided electricity in the state since long before energy was deregulated.
                                    New electricity companies: Many electric companies came about after energy was deregulated, and most offer the same quality of service as the older providers in the state.
                                    Plans offeredOne of the most important features of an electric company is the type of electricity plan offered to consumers. This is often the most important deciding factor for customers choosing a provider.Fixed rate plans: Some electricity companies charge consumers a flat rate for electricity throughout the entirety of their electricity plan.
                                    Variable rate plans: Variable rate plans charge consumers a different rate from month to month, and these plans often lack contracts and allow consumers to take advantage of changes in the market.
                                    Green plans: Green electricity plans in Texas allow consumers to choose electricity generated from eco-friendly sources, like solar power.
                                    Environmental consciousnessThere’s no doubt that electricity uses up some of the Earth’s natural resources. However, some energy companies in Texas are more eco-friendly than others, using different sources of power and dispersing different amounts of emissions into the environment.Green companies: Electricity providers focused on eco-friendly power often generate electricity from sources other than natural gas, such as solar power, hydroelectric power (water) and wind.
                                    Traditional electric companies: Traditional electric companies in Texas generate electricity from more traditional sources that are not renewable, such as coal or natural gas.
                                    Contract termsMany electricity companies in Texas require consumers to sign a contract. The terms of this contract spell out how long a customer must stay with the company and how much they will pay, among other specifications.Non-contract companies: Some of Texas’ electricity providers do not make consumers sign a contract, and they provide power on a month-to-month basis.
                                    Minimum terms: Texas electricity companies with minimum terms require residents to commit to a certain amount of time buying energy from them, and these companies often charge a cancellation fee if service is ended before the contract expires.
                                    Rewards offeredBecause there are many electricity companies in Texas, companies may attempt to win customers over by offering extra rewards. These can include many types of promotions for signing up or rewards for using the service.Rewards programs: In Texas, some electricity companies offer customers cash and gift rewards in exchange for using their service.
                                    Sign-up promotions: Some electric companies in Texas offer consumers incentives for signing up for service, including gift cards, donations to charity, or a promise of a lower bill.
                                    Additional services: Another extra incentive offered by many Texas electricity companies is the added bonus of extra helpful services, like a moving service that will help take care of ending electricity service when leaving and finding a new electricity provider in a new location.
                                    Payments acceptedElectricity in Texas can be paid for by cash, credit card or check, depending on the company. Customers can choose a company that accepts the payment type that is best for them.Bank account payments: Many Texas Electricity companies allow people to automatically debit the amount of their electricity each month from their bank account.
                                    Credit card payments: Some electric companies in Texas accept credit cards as a payment for electricity used.
                                    Cash payments: In Texas, some electric companies allow consumers to pay their electric bill directly with cash.

History[edit]
Green Mountain Energy began in Vermont in August 1997 as an offshoot of Green Mountain Power to take advantage of electricity deregulation around the country.[3] The company moved its headquarters to its current location in Austin, Texas, in September 2000. Green Mountain began serving the Texas competitive market in January 2002 and was the first retailer to offer alternative energy in the state.[4] In August 2009, Green Mountain Energy expanded to the New York City market, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the Con Edison service territory.[5]
In November 2010, Green Mountain Energy was acquired by NRG Energy for $350 million.[3] Green Mountain Energy once operated as a standalone subsidiary of NRG, but now operates as one of NRG's many brands. With the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy’s renewable offerings, NRG became one of the largest retailers of green power in the nation. NRG derives 93% of its energy from burning fossil fuels.[6]
Green Mountain Energy made national headlines in January 2011 by signing a two-year agreement to provide 100% renewable energy to the Empire State Building, making this the largest commercial green power purchase in New York City at that time.[7] The following year, in February 2012, the company partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to power Super Bowl XLVI with 15 million kWh of renewable energy.[8] In June 2012, Green Mountain Energy expanded to Pennsylvania, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the PECO and PPL service territories.[9] As of July 2013, Green Mountain Energy Company serves customers in all seven Pennsylvania service territories.
Residential services[edit]
In Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania, Green Mountain Energy directly serves residential electricity customers who live in a deregulated utility service territory.[9][10] Green Mountain Energy also partners with utilities in regulated markets in the U.S., such as Portland General Electric (PGE) in Oregon, to offer renewable energy products to their customers. Additionally, Green Mountain Energy participates in multi-supplier utility partnering programs in New York and New Jersey.
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s flagship residential electricity product is "Pollution Free electricity", made from 100% renewable sources. Another product, "Pollution Free Gold", offers 95% PA-sourced wind and 5% PA-sourced solar energy to residential customers in Pennsylvania. This product also includes a monthly donation to the Sun Club, a Green Mountain program which donates solar energy to non-profit organizations. Green Mountain Energy also offers renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offset products to individuals nationwide. In May 2009, the company launched the "Renewable Rewards" Buy-Back program, which credits customers with renewable generation facilities on their homes for excess energy their facility sends back to the electric grid.[11] In April 2011, the company also launched a solar leasing program for residential solar panels.[12]
In April 2011, Green Mountain Energy announced "Pollution Free EV", a 100% wind electricity product exclusively for electric vehicle owners. This product can be used in conjunction with NRG Energy’s eVgo program for unlimited EV charging.[13] In June 2013, Green Mountain launched a new product called "Pollution Free Efficient", which is the first and only 100% pollution-free energy product to be paired with the Nest Learning Thermostat.
Commercial services[edit]
Green Mountain has a commercial and industrial division that offers cleaner energy products to business customers in Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania.[9] The commercial division began in 2004 and offers business customers the opportunity to reduce their CO2 emissions footprint by purchasing renewable energy or carbon offsets. Green Mountain Energy Solutions is a new division launched in 2011, which offers "sustainable business solutions"[clarification needed] to companies nationwide.[14]
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy offers commercial and industrial customers renewable energy products, including renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets,[15] and sustainable business solutions through the Green Mountain Energy Solutions group.
Renewable facilities[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s customer demand has helped spur the development of over 50 wind and solar facilities around the U.S., including more than 35 solar facility donations funded by Green Mountain Energy Sun Club members (previously Big Texas Sun Club).[16] Green Mountain Energy also purchases 100% of the renewable generation from the Green Mountain Energy Winds Farms—Langford and Elbow Creek to supply their consumers and businesses. Jointly, these two West Texas wind farms can produce up to 270 megawatts (MW) of clean power.[citation needed]

History[edit]
Green Mountain Energy began in Vermont in August 1997 as an offshoot of Green Mountain Power to take advantage of electricity deregulation around the country.[3] The company moved its headquarters to its current location in Austin, Texas, in September 2000. Green Mountain began serving the Texas competitive market in January 2002 and was the first retailer to offer alternative energy in the state.[4] In August 2009, Green Mountain Energy expanded to the New York City market, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the Con Edison service territory.[5]
In November 2010, Green Mountain Energy was acquired by NRG Energy for $350 million.[3] Green Mountain Energy once operated as a standalone subsidiary of NRG, but now operates as one of NRG's many brands. With the acquisition of Green Mountain Energy’s renewable offerings, NRG became one of the largest retailers of green power in the nation. NRG derives 93% of its energy from burning fossil fuels.[6]
Green Mountain Energy made national headlines in January 2011 by signing a two-year agreement to provide 100% renewable energy to the Empire State Building, making this the largest commercial green power purchase in New York City at that time.[7] The following year, in February 2012, the company partnered with the National Football League (NFL) to power Super Bowl XLVI with 15 million kWh of renewable energy.[8] In June 2012, Green Mountain Energy expanded to Pennsylvania, serving residential and commercial electricity customers in the PECO and PPL service territories.[9] As of July 2013, Green Mountain Energy Company serves customers in all seven Pennsylvania service territories.
Residential services[edit]
In Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania, Green Mountain Energy directly serves residential electricity customers who live in a deregulated utility service territory.[9][10] Green Mountain Energy also partners with utilities in regulated markets in the U.S., such as Portland General Electric (PGE) in Oregon, to offer renewable energy products to their customers. Additionally, Green Mountain Energy participates in multi-supplier utility partnering programs in New York and New Jersey.
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s flagship residential electricity product is "Pollution Free electricity", made from 100% renewable sources. Another product, "Pollution Free Gold", offers 95% PA-sourced wind and 5% PA-sourced solar energy to residential customers in Pennsylvania. This product also includes a monthly donation to the Sun Club, a Green Mountain program which donates solar energy to non-profit organizations. Green Mountain Energy also offers renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offset products to individuals nationwide. In May 2009, the company launched the "Renewable Rewards" Buy-Back program, which credits customers with renewable generation facilities on their homes for excess energy their facility sends back to the electric grid.[11] In April 2011, the company also launched a solar leasing program for residential solar panels.[12]
In April 2011, Green Mountain Energy announced "Pollution Free EV", a 100% wind electricity product exclusively for electric vehicle owners. This product can be used in conjunction with NRG Energy’s eVgo program for unlimited EV charging.[13] In June 2013, Green Mountain launched a new product called "Pollution Free Efficient", which is the first and only 100% pollution-free energy product to be paired with the Nest Learning Thermostat.
Commercial services[edit]
Green Mountain has a commercial and industrial division that offers cleaner energy products to business customers in Texas, New York, and Pennsylvania.[9] The commercial division began in 2004 and offers business customers the opportunity to reduce their CO2 emissions footprint by purchasing renewable energy or carbon offsets. Green Mountain Energy Solutions is a new division launched in 2011, which offers "sustainable business solutions"[clarification needed] to companies nationwide.[14]
Products[edit]
Green Mountain Energy offers commercial and industrial customers renewable energy products, including renewable energy certificates (RECs) and carbon offsets,[15] and sustainable business solutions through the Green Mountain Energy Solutions group.
Renewable facilities[edit]
Green Mountain Energy’s customer demand has helped spur the development of over 50 wind and solar facilities around the U.S., including more than 35 solar facility donations funded by Green Mountain Energy Sun Club members (previously Big Texas Sun Club).[16] Green Mountain Energy also purchases 100% of the renewable generation from the Green Mountain Energy Winds Farms—Langford and Elbow Creek to supply their consumers and businesses. Jointly, these two West Texas wind farms can produce up to 270 megawatts (MW) of clean power.[citation needed]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
