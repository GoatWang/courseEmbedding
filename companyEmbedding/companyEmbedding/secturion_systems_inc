TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

Captain Brian Collins
New Orleans Paddlewheels



"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

TESTIMONIALS "We are very happy with our compactor on our riverboat the Creole Queen. We've had this machine on board for the past few years and it's the most reliable piece of equipment I've ever seen. We use it every day, it still looks brand new and it has had a revolutionary impact on our operation. You offer a wonderful product."

"I never hesitate to recommend our Vertical Trash Compactor because it does everything your brochure represents it to accomplish. I can't imagine anyone in the restaurant business not utilizing this apparatus. It really has become one of my proudest restaurant possessions. It works so smooth that I almost feel smug when I see all the gigantic trash containers for other restaurants."

Altera FPGAs Selected by Secturion Systems
June 29, 2015


June 29 — Altera Corporation today announced that network security pioneer Secturion Systems, Inc., has chosen Arria 10 FPGAs for its DarkStor secure network storage appliance product lines. Secturion Systems and Altera are showcasing the appliance at the NSA IAS 2015 from June 29 to July 1 at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C. (Secturion booth #524).
The DarkStor secure network storage appliance is capable of meeting the rigorous requirements for storing, retrieving and communicating secure data in high-bandwidth network and storage applications and is implemented using Altera’s family of high-performance 20 nm Arria 10 FPGAs. It features storage network packet processors, key handling and XTS-AES-256 encryption rates of 40-Gbps and 100-Gbps “full duplex” using unique patent-pending, systolic matrix architectures suitable for big data storage and IP network applications. In addition, the appliance features multi-tenancy and multiple independent levels of security features that eliminate the need for separate storage areas for each customer or each data type, improving security and saving on infrastructure costs.
“With Altera’s Arria 10 FPGA architecture, we have pushed big data network storage security to the next level of protection, performance, and flexibility,” said Richard Takahashi, Secturion Systems CEO and Founder. “We will migrate these capabilities to Stratix 10 FPGAs to take advantage of high-performance HyperFlex architecture routing and the new innovative security architecture to enable even more secure encryption at 400 Gbps and higher.”
“Secturion Systems is using Arria 10 FPGAs to achieve not only rapid prototypes, but also production-quality systems,” said Ian Land, senior manager, Military, Aerospace and Government business unit at Altera. “Altera’s state-of-the-art silicon and superior software tools, IP cores and libraries, combined with a close partnership and support, allowed Secturion Systems to take this innovative solution to market quickly.”
NSA IAD SIG Documentation Update
Altera recently announced completion of the NSA’s Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) Secure Implementation Guidelines (SIG) document for 28 nm FPGAs and SoCs, which provides unified government recommendations on the use of security settings in Altera FPGA and SoC products and how these products can be used most securely to mitigate security threats in system designs. The NSA IAD SIG describes design and data security features unique to Altera 28 nm FPGAs and SoCs and provides guidelines for security policies based on typical scenarios. Altera is also working with the NSA IAD on SIG documents for 20 nm and 14 nm FPGAs and SoCs.
For information on Altera’s comprehensive FPGA and SoC product portfolio, Enpirion power solutions, and the industry’s most extensive set of military system solutions, visit www.altera.com or contact a local Altera sales representative.
About Secturion Systems      
Secturion Systems provides data centers and medium-to-large corporations with high-grade protection and security without compromising network performance.  The company has developed a family of ultra-high-performance “Big Data” secure network storage appliances at rates of 100 Gigabits/sec full duplex and beyond using a unique systolic matrix architecture (patent pending) suitable for big data storage and IP networks for both government and commercial markets.  For more information, please visit www.secturion.com.

“Our disposal costs have dropped which at least covers the cost of the compactors. Aside from the monetary aspect, the compactors allow the stores to be considerably cleaner.Clean-up at night is much easier because we have no trash cluttering up the back room of the store. All in all, we are very pleased with the compactors.”
Doug GehrigMcDonalds

“We would like to thank the great service of Compactors Inc. We currently have on board the Vertical Trash Compactor model 4500SS. It has been a tremendous help with the recycling of our trash. The machine works great and is very friendly to use. We have been using this equipment for about four of five years now. When we need parts due to this machine being used over 30 times on a daily basis, Compactors Inc. is there for logistic support and they even give credit back for certain parts. My experience working with Compactors Inc. is a very reliable company to do business with. So thank you again for the great service from the USNS Laramie (T-AO 203) crew!”
