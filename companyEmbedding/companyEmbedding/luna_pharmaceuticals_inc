Luna Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Key Developments

Premama® Introduces Digestive Aid to Support Digestion & Healthy Immune System During Pregnancy
Feb 25 16
Premama® announced the launch of Premama Digestive Aid, a new prenatal fiber and probiotic soft chew. Premama will unveil Premama Digestive Aid, the first non-powdered drink mix product to join its award-winning brand portfolio, at Natural Products Expo West 2016 in the Anaheim Convention Center, booth #1090 in Hall A, from March 11-13, 2016. Formulated to help maintain digestive balance and boost the immune system naturally, Premama Digestive Aid delivers a daily probiotic solution in a delicious vanilla caramel-flavored chew. Each chew contains 2g of dietary fiber and 1 billion+ CFUs of probiotics, which have shown through research to help maintain a healthy intestinal balance and support immune function, and may also help ease constipation, bloating, and other minor digestive discomforts associated with pregnancy. The vegetarian, naturally flavored chews can be eaten 1-4 times daily and are available in packs of 28. Premama Digestive Aid joins a growing range of Premama maternity wellness products, including Premama Fertility reproductive powdered drink supplement, Premama Essentials and Premama Essentials + DHA prenatal vitamin drink mixes, and Premama Lactation support powdered drink supplement. A pioneer in maternity wellness, Premama has appeared in Pregnancy & Newborn, BevNET, Fit Pregnancy and other media, and has garnered numerous industry recognitions from babyMaternity Magazine and SupplySide (2015), among others. Most recently, Premama Fertility was named one of three finalists in the Best New Supplement Delivery Format category for the 2016 NEXTY Awards. Premama will make Premama Digestive Aid available for pre-orders during Expo West 2016, with its retail launch rolling out this spring. Visit drinkpremama.com for more information.

Impress investors with how far you’ve come on a low cash burn rate. 

Dan Aziz, President of Luna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., is originally from Toronto, ON, Canada. Dan left his home country to study commerce, entrepreneurship and organizations (CEO) at Brown University. While there, Dan developed the idea for a powdered prenatal vitamin to replace the current prenatal vitamin “horse pill,” as researched showed nearly 96 percent of woman who took these essential vitamins hated the pill delivery system. Dan’s concept, Premama, went on to win the 2011 RI Business Plan competition. The company has gone from one product and six stores in 2012 to four products and 3,000 stores in 2015, as well as international sales. Follow him @drinkpremama.
Who’s your hero? (In business, life, or both.)
My father is my hero. I’ve never met a smarter, wittier and more thoughtful person whom I try my best (and fail) to emulate each day.
In business, my hero is Richard Branson. No one else has started so many successful companies in so many different fields. His passion for extreme sports is something I can relate to, and aside from Donald Trump, I don’t think anyone has better hair!
What’s the single best piece of business advice that helped shape who you are as an entrepreneur today, and why?
Try to always stay even-keeled. Do not get too excited when things are going great, and don’t get down when things don’t work out as planned. Entrepreneurship is full of a lot of ups and downs, but moving forward is all that really matters.
What’s the biggest mistake you ever made in your business, and what did you learn from it that others can learn from too?
I went too big, too quickly. I brought on an account that I knew I could not support, but I relied on others to come through in the time of need with an investment. The investment took six months longer than promised, and we lost the vendor. So do not count your chickens before they hatch, and do not rely on others to come through for you.
What do you do during the first hour of your business day and why?
I always start by going to my local coffee shop for a large dark roast red-eye, and then I scroll through my emails (sometimes I have 100+ new ones a day) to see what takes priority. Then I begin tackling my plans I set for the day from the night or week before while attending to those most crucial emails.
What’s your best financial/cash-flow related tip for entrepreneurs just getting started?
Keep general and administrative expenses very low as long as possible. Don’t take a salary or a very big one until you can afford it. Don’t rent expensive space or put money into trivial things that don’t directly increase the value of your business until your business has significant value.
I worked my first year with no salary and the following two below minimum wage. It was not until I raised over $1 million that I took a salary, and not until then that I brought on anyone who deserved a high salary. I find you can get a lot done by being scrappy, so by the time you take a real salary, your investors feel you deserve much more and are shocked by how far you’ve gotten with such low cash burn rate to date.
Quick: What’s ONE thing you recommend ALL aspiring or current entrepreneurs do right now to take their biz to the next level?
Start it! So many people have ideas, but only a very few actually take the action to bring it to market — whether that means designing your app, having prototypes of your consumer goods made or bringing on your first clients in a service industry. Stop discussing and start doing.
What’s your definition of success? How will you know when you’ve finally “succeeded” in your business?
Success for me will be giving my investors a return on their investment and improving myself as an entrepreneur and person. If I can make some money in doing so as well, I won’t complain!

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

"You Get An A+"
"Thank you. I did receive the credit back on my credit card. You often promote your "money back guarantee" with your literature. Well, you certainly deliver on your promise!!!.
I judge a company on Quality, Price and Service (you pass on all three) but the ultimate test comes when you have a "problem". Your company scored an "A+"!!!!!! You have earned my business forever. Thank you for your outstanding service and problem resolution!"
Patrick M., Colorado

Frank Shallenberger, MD
Dr. Shallenberger has practiced medicine for more than 41 years, after earning his M.D. degree from the University of Maryland, School of Medicine, and receiving post-graduate training at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco. Dr. Shallenberger is
also certified by the American Board of Anti-Aging Medicine (A.B.A.A.M.) as an anti-aging physician and has also been trained and certified in other areas of alternative medicine.
This makes Dr. Shallenberger one of a small minority of doctors in this country licensed in conventional as well as alternative medicine. But more importantly, it allows him to integrate the best of both approaches for optimal results at his wellness
clinic, The Nevada Center of Alternative and Anti-Aging Medicine.
Dr. Shallenberger has been on the forefront of integrative medicine for several years with his involvement with the American College for the Advancement of Medicine (ACAM), The American Preventive Medical Association, and the American Academy
of Anti-Aging Medicine. He currently serves as an officer for the Orthomolecular Medicine-Health Society (OMH), founded in honor of two-time Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling.
Dr. Shallenberger has trained hundreds of physicians on his innovative medical treatments and published numerous scientific papers. He is a past Clinical Instructor of Family Medicine at the University of California-Davis School of Medicine. He
is also the author of two health books, Bursting with Energy and The Type 2 Diabetes Breakthrough. 
Dr. Shallenberger also writes the monthly newsletter Second Opinion.
