Page ContentEddy W. Hartenstein
  Businessman/PublisherCalifornia State Polytechnic University, PomonaRead virtually any biography of Eddy W. Hartenstein and you will see the word pioneer. It is a fitting description of the man who revolutionized consumer electronics in the 1990s with the development of satellite TV, which forever changed home entertainment. He remains a pioneer in his current role as publisher and chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Times, where he has shown unwavering determination to navigate a demanding and ever-changing media landscape.Mr. Hartenstein has left an indelible mark in the engineering and business worlds—from his work on the Pioneer Venus probe for Hughes Aircraft in the 1970s to his leadership of the company's commercial satellite division to his visionary role at DirecTV to his steady hand and keen foresight at the Times. Along the way, he received his master's degree from Caltech, earned induction into four halls of fame as well as membership in the National Academy of Engineering, and was presented a lifetime achievement award from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.Those impressive accomplishments are rooted in his time as a student at Cal Poly Pomona, where he arrived in the late 1960s in the midst of the race to the moon between the United States and the Soviet Union. The university, with its learn-by-doing ethos and well-respected aerospace engineering program, proved to be a natural fit, and it was in the engineering labs and classrooms where he honed the critical thinking skills that would be the hallmark of his distinguished career."We say that our graduates enter the workforce ready to make a difference on Day One," Cal Poly Pomona President J. Michael Ortiz says. "Eddy Hartenstein is the quintessential difference-maker." In recognition of his accomplishments as a leader and innovator, the Board of Trustees of the California State University and California State Polytechnic University, Pomona are proud to confer upon Eddy W. Hartenstein the honorary degree of Doctor of Science.

Tribune Company[edit]
Main article: Tribune Publishing
Eddy W. Hartenstein is Chairman of Tribune Publishing; he was formerly President and CEO of Tribune Company from May, 2011 to January 2013. Hartenstein was named publisher & chief executive officer of the Los Angeles Times in August, 2008. In that role oversaw all aspects of the print and digital operations of the largest metropolitan daily newspaper in the U.S.[7][8]
Pre-Tribune Company[edit]
Previously, Hartenstein was involved in the satellite television business. As the first executive of DirecTV, Hartenstein served as the company’s chairman and CEO, and was responsible for strategic planning.
Hartenstein earned Bachelor of Science degrees in aerospace engineering and mathematics from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona).[1] He then joined Hughes Aircraft in 1972, and in 1974, earned a Master of Science degree from Caltech. By 1981, Hartenstein had become vice president of Hughes Communications, where he was responsible for expanding Hughes' acquisition and deployment of commercial communications satellites and directed the development and marketing of the original Galaxy satellite fleet.
In 1990, Hartenstein was named president of the new Hughes-owned subsidiary to develop direct-to-home satellite TV service. Hartenstein organized the new business, and formed DirecTV.
Under Hartenstein's direction, DirecTV began commercial service in 1994. He served as DirecTV chairman and CEO from inception to 2004.
During his tenure, Hartenstein also led the regulatory push to change U.S. law to allow local broadcast stations to be rebroadcast into their markets over direct broadcast satellite and, through DirecTV, led the industry into digital television. Hartenstein retired as vice chairman of the DirecTV Group after the company's sale to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in December 2004.[7]
Early life[edit]
Born in Alhambra, California, like many students of the era, Hartenstein's interest in technology and aerospace/technology were sparked by the space race. Hartenstein earned Bachelor of Science degrees in aerospace engineering and mathematics from Cal Poly Pomona . He then joined Hughes Aircraft in 1972, and in 1974, earned a Master of Science degree in applied mechanics from Caltech.[4]
Recognition[edit]
Hartenstein was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) Class of 2001 and into the Broadcasting & Cable Hall of Fame in 2002. In 2007, Hartenstein received an Emmy from the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for lifetime achievement, and was inducted into the Consumer Electronics Association Hall of Fame in 2008.[7]

Tribune Co. names new CEO: L.A. Times publisher Hartenstein






			
			Eddy Hartenstein
		


(Crain's) — Tribune Co.'s board of directors has chosen the publisher of the Los Angeles Times to lead the company, naming its first CEO outside the company's Chicago headquarters.Eddy Hartenstein will replace a four-person council that has led the company since the ouster last October of then-CEO Randy Michaels following revelations of mismanagement.(Read Crain's premium content: "L.A. Times publisher Hartenstein angles for top corporate post at Tribune.")"The board feels strongly that it is in Tribune's best interests to have one person providing strategic vision and day-to-day direction for the company and its employees as we prepare to emerge from the Chapter 11 process," Tribune Chairman Sam Zell said in a news release. The company filed for bankruptcy in December 2008. Still, Mr. Hartenstein told the Times that the management change didn't signal a geographic shift for the company. Tribune's headquarters will remain in Chicago, and he "will be racking up a lot of frequent-flier miles," Mr. Hartenstein told the paper. He declined to comment to Crain's.“Tribune is likely in a better position than its competitors to adapt to the rapid change going on across the media industry,” Mr. Hartenstein said in a memo to employees. “But we must continue to emphasize forward-looking thinking, development and investment in technology in order to be successful.”Tribune has been striving to exit bankruptcy, but warring creditors have kept a battle going over two competing reorganization plans. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection a year after real estate magnate Mr. Zell took the company private in a leveraged buyout. The LBO saddled the company with debt just before an economic downturn that exacerbated difficulties for a print media industry already struggling to compete against online rivals.The Times was brought into the fold in 2000, when Tribune bought Times Mirror Co., effectively doubling the size of the company. Since then, there have been occasional strains between the Times, the biggest paper in the Tribune family by circulation, and the No. 2 Chicago Tribune. The company also owns the Baltimore Sun and the Sun Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., as well as 23 TV stations, including WGN-TV in Chicago, KTLA in Los Angeles and WPIX in New York.Mr. Hartenstein, 60, was appointed publisher of the Times in August 2008. Prior to joining Tribune, he was CEO of El Segundo, Calif.-based DirectTV, a digital TV company he founded in 1990.He said in the memo Friday that he and the other three council members agreed that the company needs a single leader. The other three members — Chicago Tribune Publisher and CEO Tony Hunter, Chief Restructuring Officer Don Liebentritt and Chief Investment Officer Nils Larsen — will continue in their posts, he said. "Don, Nils and Tony are extremely talented, and it has been a privilege to work closely with them on the Council," Mr. Hartenstein said. "I will be looking for additional ways to tap into their abilities, experience and commitment to the company as we move ahead." Mr. Hartenstein will have help in remaining publisher and CEO of Los Angeles Times Communications LLC from Kathy Thomson, who was named Friday to the newly created post of president and chief operating officer of that paper, the company said. She is returning to the Times after serving as the vice-president of busines operations at FLO TV Inc., a unit of Qualcomm Inc., for the past 18 months. She was chief of staff at the Times from 2008 to 2009.Tribune has made a bid to buy the Orange County Register, a paper owned by Freedom Communications Inc., which has been seeking to sell all or part of the company, according to sources familiar with the auction. Buying that paper would allow Tribune to knit together two major papers in Southern California, creating what could be a more powerful base for attracting advertisers.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
