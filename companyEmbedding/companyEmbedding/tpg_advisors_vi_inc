Series A Preferred Units
 
Under Amendment No. 1 to the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Copano, dated July 21, 2010 (“LLC Agreement Amendment No. 1”), commencing on July 21, 2013, the Series A Preferred Units will be convertible into Common Units of Copano on a one-for-one basis, provided that unless and until Copano’s unitholders approve the Series A Proposal (defined below),  (i) the Series A Preferred Units will be convertible into Common Units (on a one-for-one basis) in an amount not to exceed 19.9% of Copano’s then outstanding Common Units, and, with respect to any amount of such conversion that would exceed 19.9% of Copano’s then outstanding Common Units, the Series A Preferred Units will be convertible into new Class B Units of Copano on a one-for-one basis, and (ii) Copenhagen’s voting
power will be limited to not more than 19.9% of Copano’s then outstanding Common Units (the “Common Unit Cap”).
 
Copano has agreed to cause its unitholders to consider the approval of: (i) the full convertibility of Series A Preferred Units into Common Units, and, if any Class B Units are then issued and outstanding, the automatic conversion of Class B Units into Common Units, and (ii) full voting rights for holders of Series A Preferred Units beyond the Common Unit Cap (the “Series A Proposal”).  If the Series A Proposal is approved by Copano’s unitholders, then the Series A Preferred Units will be fully convertible into Common Units when conditions described below are met and will vote with the Common Units (on an as-converted basis) without regard to the Common Unit Cap.
 
Copenhagen will be able to convert Series A Preferred Units into Common Units or Class B Units at any time after July 21, 2013, except that conversion will be prohibited to the extent that it would cause (on a pro forma basis) Copano estimated quarterly distributions over any of the succeeding four quarters to exceed its total distributable cash flow in that quarter (the “Pro Forma Restriction” and, together with the Common Unit Cap, the “Conversion Restrictions”).
 
Commencing on July 21, 2013, Copano also will have the option at any time to convert all or some of the Series A Preferred Units (including Series A Preferred Units issued as in-kind distributions) then outstanding into Common Units or Class B Units if (i) the daily volume-weighted average trading price of the Common Units on the national securities exchange on which the Common Units are listed or admitted to trading is greater than 130% of the Unit Purchase Price for 20 trading days out of the trailing 30-trading-day period prior to Copano’s notice of conversion and (ii) the average daily trading volume of Common Units on the securities exchange exceeds 500,000 Common Units for 20 trading days out of the trailing 30-day period ending two trading days before Copano’s notice of conversion.
 
Under LLC Agreement Amendment No. 1, subject to the limitations described above, the Series A Preferred Units have voting rights identical to the voting rights of the Common Units and will vote with the Common Units as a single class, such that each Series A Preferred Unit is entitled to one vote for each Common Unit into which such Series A Preferred Unit is convertible on each matter with respect to which Common Unit is entitled to vote.
 
Commencing with the quarter ending on September 30, 2010, Copenhagen, as of an applicable record date, shall be entitled to receive distributions (each, a “Series A Quarterly Distribution”), prior to any other distributions made in respect of any other securities of Copano, in an amount equal to the Series A Distribution Rate on all outstanding Series A Preferred Units. The “Series A Distribution Rate”  means (i) with respect to any portion of a Series A Quarterly Distribution for any quarter paid in any additional Series A Preferred Units issued in kind as a distribution (“PIK Units”), the amount per Series A Preferred Unit equal to 10.0% per annum (2.5% per quarter) of the Unit Purchase Price ($0.72625
per unit per quarter) (“Series A 10.0% Distribution Rate”) and (ii) with respect to any portion of any Series A Quarterly Distribution for any quarter paid in cash, an amount per Series A Preferred Unit equal to the greater of (a) the distribution per Common Unit declared by the Board with respect to such quarter and (b) the Series A 10.0% Distribution Rate.
 
For the quarter ending September 30, 2010, through and including the quarter ending June 30, 2013, Series A Quarterly Distributions shall be paid in PIK Units.  For the quarter ending September 30, 2013, through and including the quarter ending June 30, 2016, the Series A Quarterly Distributions may be paid in cash, in PIK Units or in a combination thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, but shall be paid in PIK Units absent an affirmative determination otherwise by the Board.  For any quarter ending September 30, 2016 
 


  


Page 6 of 10





  


or thereafter, each Series A Quarterly Distribution shall be paid in cash except to the extent (i) a holder of record of Series A Preferred Units (“Series A Unitholder”) requests (in a written communication received by the Company no later than fifteen (15) days after the end of the quarter in respect of which such Series A Quarterly Distribution is payable) that its Series A Quarterly Distribution be paid in PIK Units and (ii) the Board determines, in its sole discretion, that the Company will pay all or a portion of the requesting Series A Unitholder’s distribution in PIK Units.  The number of PIK Units to be issued in connection with any Series A Quarterly Distribution paid in PIK Units shall be determined by dividing (i) the product of the Series A 10% Distribution Rate multiplied by the number of Outstanding Series A Preferred Units, by (ii) the Unit Purchase Price.  Cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional
PIK Units with the value of the fractional PIK Unit determined by reference to the Unit Purchase Price.
 
In the event of any liquidation and winding up of Copano or a sale, exchange or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Copano, either voluntary or involuntary, the Series A Unitholders shall be entitled to receive, out of the assets of Copano available for distribution to the members of Copano or any assignees, prior and in preference to any distribution of any assets of Copano to the holders of any other class or series of securities of Copano, the positive value in each such holder’s capital account in respect of such Series A Preferred Units.
 
Class B Units
 
The Class B Units are a new class of non-voting equity security in the Company.  The holders of the Class B Units will be entitled to a quarterly distribution per Class B Unit equal to 110% of the quarterly cash distribution amount paid per Common Unit.  The Class B Units will rank junior to the Series A Preferred Units and pari passu with the Common Units of the Company with respect to distribution rights, and junior to the Series A Preferred Units and senior to the Common Units of the Company with respect to rights upon liquidation.
 
The Class B Units are non-voting, except that the Class B Units are entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter that adversely affects the rights or preferences of the Class B Units in relation to other classes of interests in the Company or as required by law.  The approval of a majority of the Class B Units will be required to approve any matter for which the holders of the Class B Units are entitled to vote.
 
 If the Series A Proposal is approved by the Company’s unitholders, then any outstanding Class B Units will convert automatically into Common Units.
 
 Composition of Copano’s Board of Directors
 
Pursuant to the Director Designation Agreement, effective as of July 21, 2010 (the “Director Designation Agreement”), by and between Copano and Copenhagen, the size of the board of directors of Copano was expanded by one member, and Copenhagen was granted the right to designate one person to be appointed by Copano to fill the vacancy.
 
 Copenhagen’s initial designee is Michael G. MacDougall, a partner of TPG Capital, L.P.  Mr. MacDougall was appointed to Copano’s Board of Directors on July 21, 2010.
 
Registration Rights Agreement
 
In connection with the Purchase Agreement, Copano and Copenhagen entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated July 21, 2010 (the “Registration Rights Agreement”). The Registration Rights Agreement provides that Copano will prepare and file up to two shelf registration statements for the resale of the Common Units into which the Series A Preferred Units and Class B Units may convert as soon as practicable following receipt of written notice from Copenhagen.  In addition, Copano has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each shelf registration statement to be declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission no later than 180 days after its filing.  The Registration Rights Agreement also provides Copenhagen with rights that allow Copenhagen to include its Common Units in certain registered offerings for the Company’s own
account.  The Registration Rights Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities that are customary for private placements by public companies.
 
As a result of these activities, one or more of the Reporting Persons may suggest or take a position with respect to potential changes in the operations, management, or capital structure of Copano as a means of enhancing
