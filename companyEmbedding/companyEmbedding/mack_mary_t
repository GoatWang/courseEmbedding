Advisor Channels Q&A: Mary Mack, President, Wells Fargo Advisors
Megan Leonhardt | Nov 30, 2014


































WealthManagement.com.: You’ve mentioned in the past the importance of making the client experience simpler. What do you mean?
Mary Mack: There are a couple of things to that. One of them, in a big way, is simplifying the way we deliver, the way we inform clients, the way we ensure they understand, and even the way they sign. We introduced this year a consolidated signature page. We took out unnecessary disclosures. We also just rolled out e-signature for clients, across all of our channels.
 
WM: How is WFA’s SmartStation 2.0 migration going?
MM: I think we just completed the last phase of rollouts. We just did probably our biggest platform upgrade—certainly outside of a merger. And we did it without training, because it’s so intuitive. Along the way, we’ve also had to go through a systematic upgrade of bandwidth and some systematic infrastructure improvements that have gone really well in terms of speed of delivery, easy navigation and execution.
 
WM: What is the timeline for rolling out the expected Smart to Go tablet app? What is that going to be like for the advisor?
MM: The full rollout is slated for the second quarter of next year. It will enable an FA to lock down the client data so that they can do a more dynamic client presentation on their tablet. It will give them the most-frequently used applications in a truly mobile format.
 
WM: What’s been Wells’ approach with its high-net-worth partnership referral program between the banking and brokerage channels? How does Wells’ strategy differ from other firms in this space?
MM: The strategy here is very client-centric, advice-driven. The client deserves access to the best we have to offer across our firm. We began to think about the private bank as not just a relationship manager—which is what they do for many clients—but also as a product provider. We asked, “How can those private bankers provide customized banking product to a Wells Fargo advisor’s relationship?”
 
WM: How do you address advisor concerns about handing off their clients to private bankers?
MM: Advisors have an incredible amount of passion for their client relationships. I love that. We’ve said that it’s your client relationship. We’re not asking anybody to hand off a client to anybody. Instead, you’re bringing somebody in as a member of your team. You’re still the quarterback of that team, the financial coach for your client, but you bring somebody into your team to add to a relationship, as opposed to turn over a relationship.
 
WM: WFA doesn’t offer as rich of a recruitment compensation package as some of its competitors. Why is that?
MM: What we try to do is talk to a financial advisor about the entire value proposition, with the transition bonus being just one part of it. I believe another part of that is the tremendous value in the brand. To be associated with the Wells Fargo brand has a real tangible value that we can demonstrate to a recruit.
 
WM: No plans to bring that in line with other firms and the checks they’re cutting?
MM: We’ve looked at it and we track it. There are no plans, necessarily, to change ours in response to that, because we’re really pleased with our results if you look at the whole. Don’t get me wrong, I think that transition bonus is very important to financial advisors, but it’s one element of a broader relationship.
 
WM: Raymond James seems to be targeting WFA for potential recruits. What is your strategy to address this?
MM: I would say, in terms of recruiting, one of the things we’ve been working a lot on is the development and empowerment of our managers. A lot of what financial advisors are looking for is the support of their local manager. So how do we empower our managers? We’ve just added another region. We think that enables our regional leaders to have more interaction with FAs. They still have large regions, but they’re smaller than they were to enable them to be closer to the field, closer to complexes, closer to the FAs. That’s one of our best retention strategies—that we have great managers.
 
WM: You’ve said the traditional methods of incentivizing and motivating NextGen recruits are not working. How is the firm bringing in the next generation of advisors?
MM: We’re piloting some different ways of training. This year we’re getting ready to start the third class in the associated financial advisors program. It’s more of a mentorship program that’s a combination of St. Louis-based classroom training and then curriculum-based field training. The formal curriculum will be at least two years, longer than our traditional financial-advisor-in-training program, which was only about seven weeks. In addition, the program provides an apprenticeship model ensuring that every associate is paired with an experienced, successful advisor. Each associated financial advisor has a dedicated performance coach who provides accountability, oversight and support throughout their development. They receive two to three years of a stable salary, along with the ability to increase their compensation through revenue-sharing opportunities.
 
WM: How big is the associated financial advisor pilot program?
MM: We will hire a total of 100 this year that are in pilot, and are targeting 100 or more next year. That’s just one element of our training. We’ve still got our other financial advisor training going on.
Then there's another program that David Kowach is starting in the Private Client Group (PCG) branches. Advisors who are evaluating their business and thinking about how they begin to rationalize their book to a more manageable client base can work with another Advisor (even Trainees skilled in Best Practices) who are looking to add clients.  Ultimately, the goal should be an improved client experience, one where the Advisors, both the one looking to transfer the account and the other looking to take on more clients, accomplish their goals too.”
 
WM: There’s been ongoing discussion regarding WFA’s hybrid legacy profit formula model, that has actually been discontinued but under which some advisors still operate. What is the firm planning to do with these advisors?
MM: Many of our really successful financial advisors in the private client group are in profit formula. Profit formula is a part of PCG. It’s not a separate business. It’s populated with many of our best practice advisors, our highest growth advisors, so it’s a successful part. It’s been supported as a part of the private client group, and continues to be supported. We have no plans to shut it down.
 
WM: Will there be any kind of hybrid offering for new teams that are interested?
MM: We want to continue to support the advisors who are in profit formula because they’re terrific advisors. There wasn’t any plan to change that element. But if we’re looking at what advisors are looking for, we need to ask if there are solutions already in our existing channels. We have a lot of conversations, between PCG and FiNet, to see if that’s a better fit.
 
WM: With Devon McConnell coming aboard as head of WFA Digital, how is that helping to evolve the firm's technology?
MM:  We are really excited to have Devon. Right now, she's doing a lot of direct client research. What do full service clients expect in their relationship with their advisor? How are other influences in other parts of their lives now begun to impact the way they think about their digital financial experience? As we go into next year, you'll begin to see those similar impacts on the client side of technology. They notice now the service experience through their advisor's ability to more quickly deliver. What we'd like to see is for them to see their advisor through digital technology.
 
WM:  Speaking of digital, Wells Fargo had a pilot program for Twitter and social media. Are there plans to continue that? What’s up next for the firm in that area?
MM:  We have been running a pilot, a Twitter pilot, a social media pilot. We've got plans to expand that infrastructure, things that we need to look at. We've got to think about it as an industry: how do we think about retention and capture in the social media space differently? It goes back to that digital experience. I really think that it's not just a generational thing. There is a prevalence of it as the generations get younger. We have certainly thought of technology as functional. Now, we've got to begin thinking of technology as relational, and that's very different from the way our industry has interacted in the past.
WM: You’ve been busy in this first year, visiting branch offices on an almost weekly basis. What do you do during your downtime?
MM:  I'm training for a half‑marathon for some crazy reason. It started on a dare. I work out with a couple of friends, and they did it. I told them they were crazy. I decided that maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all.
 
WM: What's the most played song on your playlist?
MM:  Do you know what I listen to? I listen to podcasts. What I listen to is The Bob and Sheri Show, which is a syndicated radio talk show out of Charlotte. I listen, every morning, to yesterday's podcast.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As chief executive of Wells Fargo& Co., Carl Reichardt said he thought of himself "not as a banker but as a businessman who happens to be running a bank." The typical banker, he said in a 1994 interview with the Los Angeles Times, "has the mind-set of a civil servant, in terms of cost control and having a guaranteed income for life.

US TSYS/TIPS: Traders expect reasonably good demand at 1pm ET US$13B 10Y TIPS auction, which should draw about a 0.4200% level. "I think they will go well: July TIPS auction tend to go well," said one trader. "It's a new issue, and we have a little bie of a TIPS index extension this monoth" at the imminent month-end, July 31st. - "The TIPS already reflect the benign inflation environment: the Fed wants 2% inflation, and these have a breakeven around 1.77% for the 10-year," the trader said. - BMO's Ian Lyngen: "Still positive on the TIPS auction." - Wells Fargo's Boris Rjavinski, Zachary Griffiths expect "healthy" end-user demand as "investment funds have been consistent auction buyers since Nov. 2016," taking "impressive 67%" at May reopening. US investors "continue to add exposure to inflation funds, while redemptions by foreign investors slowed in June." - HISTORY: Strong May 10Y TIPS reopening: 80% indirects (most since 2003), 8.37% direct, left only puny 11.33% dealers; 0.420% high yield, a 2.56 bid/cover.

US TSYS/TIPS: Wells Fargo (WFC) strategists Boris Rjavinski and Zachary Griffiths expect "healthy" end-user demand at 1pm ET $13B new 10y TIPS auction. "Investment funds have been consistent auction buyers since November 2016," they said, taking down "an impressive 67%" at May reopening. US investors "continue to add exposure to inflation funds, while redemptions by foreign investors slowed in June. Despite conservative bidding by dealers, overall demand in 10y TIPS auctions has remained fairly steady. Bid-to-cover ratios have been 2.20-2.60 throughout 2016-2017." - They add US "long-term real yields shd look attractive to strategic investors. US inflation has moderated while growth is uninspiring. Fed rhetoric turned more cautious recently, specifically around the soft inflation run. The change in tone may not be the proverbial 'central bank put,' but we think it signals that real yields have more room to fall than rise for a few months." They see 10y breakevens in 175-180 bps range as "fairly inexpensive options on inflation upside. Falling fuel prices have dragged down headline CPI, but the 'sticky' CPI, viewed as a better estimate of future inflation, remained above 2%."

US TSYS/RESEARCH: /TIPS: Wells Fargo (WFC) strategists Michael Schumacher, Boris Rjavinski and Zachary Griffiths eyed US govt bond fund flows saying US Tsys "are in vogue. Flows into Treasury-focused funds were $2.9 billion in June, marking the largest monthly influx since February 2016. More recent weekly data suggest the trend is continuing, as $962 million flowed in for the week ended July 12." - But they added "foreign investors flee from TIPS. Inflation-focused funds experienced the third straight month of outflows by non-US investors. In contrast, US investors again increased their holdings of inflation-linked funds, despite soft domestic inflation data." - They added "for the week, short- and long-term funds received solid inflows. Intermediate maturity funds suffered modest outflows." They also said that "ETFs and open-end funds go hand-in-hand again. June Treasury inflows were consistent across ETFs and open-end funds. This is after ETFs enjoyed inflows while funds saw redemptions for most of 2017. Open-ended funds experienced a small outflow on a weekly basis, while June monthly data reflected inflows in all but short-term-focused funds."

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.

Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

US TSYS/TIPS: Wells Fargo (WFC) strategists Boris Rjavinski and Zachary Griffiths expect "healthy" end-user demand at 1pm ET $13B new 10y TIPS auction. "Investment funds have been consistent auction buyers since November 2016," they said, taking down "an impressive 67%" at May reopening. US investors "continue to add exposure to inflation funds, while redemptions by foreign investors slowed in June. Despite conservative bidding by dealers, overall demand in 10y TIPS auctions has remained fairly steady. Bid-to-cover ratios have been 2.20-2.60 throughout 2016-2017." - They add US "long-term real yields shd look attractive to strategic investors. US inflation has moderated while growth is uninspiring. Fed rhetoric turned more cautious recently, specifically around the soft inflation run. The change in tone may not be the proverbial 'central bank put,' but we think it signals that real yields have more room to fall than rise for a few months." They see 10y breakevens in 175-180 bps range as "fairly inexpensive options on inflation upside. Falling fuel prices have dragged down headline CPI, but the 'sticky' CPI, viewed as a better estimate of future inflation, remained above 2%."

US TSYS/RESEARCH: /TIPS: Wells Fargo (WFC) strategists Michael Schumacher, Boris Rjavinski and Zachary Griffiths eyed US govt bond fund flows saying US Tsys "are in vogue. Flows into Treasury-focused funds were $2.9 billion in June, marking the largest monthly influx since February 2016. More recent weekly data suggest the trend is continuing, as $962 million flowed in for the week ended July 12." - But they added "foreign investors flee from TIPS. Inflation-focused funds experienced the third straight month of outflows by non-US investors. In contrast, US investors again increased their holdings of inflation-linked funds, despite soft domestic inflation data." - They added "for the week, short- and long-term funds received solid inflows. Intermediate maturity funds suffered modest outflows." They also said that "ETFs and open-end funds go hand-in-hand again. June Treasury inflows were consistent across ETFs and open-end funds. This is after ETFs enjoyed inflows while funds saw redemptions for most of 2017. Open-ended funds experienced a small outflow on a weekly basis, while June monthly data reflected inflows in all but short-term-focused funds."

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.
