		LARGE CAPACITIES








								Dependable personnel and equipment. We have some of the largest capacities on the West Coast: the largest robotic weld cell for a job shop, with a 28’swing and multiple 6500lb positioner capacity; laser cutting envelopes of 160”x80”; large precision forming with accuracies of .00004” on a 8-axis 242ton 14’ Pressbrake; machining envelopes of 120”x40”x30” with full 4th axis capabilities.
							







		DONE IN ONE








Being able to produce a finished part on one machine with one setup is invaluable to achieve low lot quantities and maintain accuracies on the first part. This can be seen throughout our shop. Our Laser/turret combination machine allows us to form geometry right into the finished parts.
This also allows us to use the speed of the turret to put in common holes and use the dexterity of a laser to finish it off. One of our machining examples is our 12-axis lathe, with capabilities to make difficult components a reality in even small quantities. We can literally load raw stock into one side of the machine and have finished deburred product come out the out feed conveyor untouched.
Our large vertical machining center can hold very large and heavy work in its 4-axis. It uses a touch probe to locate the exact position of the work, (before machining), to process the work on all sides, then measure the part for accuracy before it is removed from the machine after it is machined. We aspire to have the first part correct and accurate as efficiently as possible.








		REDUNDANCY








								We take pride in knowing that when, not if, one of our machines or personnel goes ill that we are still able to produce the components that you need on time. This is one of the key reasons for our high on time delivery record.

WELCOME TO STEVENS PRODUCTS

Stevens Products Inc. has been in business for over 70 years manufacturing quality electronic insulation. We are expert, niche manufacturers of custom tight tolerance rigid thermoset tubing from high temperature dielectric resistant resins and woven fiberglass cloth. Fiberglass epoxy, Nema grade G-10, G-11 is class F-rated for 155ºC continuous operating temperatures and has FR4 flame retardant properties. Fiberglass silicone, Nema grade G-7, is class H-rated for 180ºC and fiberglass polyimide material, Nema grade G-30, our highest temp material is 230ºC rated.
All material are Mil-Spec approved. Stevens’ expertise can interleave various substrates to provide higher dielectric resistance, RF shielding and moisture-proof barriers in tubing.

Lengths of tubing manufactured from these materials can be supplied in bulk size or cut to specific customer sizes for coilform winding. We bond custom coil bobbins and transformer housings. Custom made “header plates”, or endcaps, can be bonded to tubing or supplied loose for encapsulation cup applications. In addition, tubing can be cut into angles, “U” and “C” channels or other specific shapes per your structural  requirements.
Tubing is available from thousands of stock mandrels eliminating costly tooling charges. We offer everything from .049" round ID micro miniature sizes up to 13" plus ID. Square and rectangular offerings start at .020" X .079" ID and go up to 8" square in size.
In addition to tubing we have custom molding facilities as well. Match metal dies and custom steel rule trim dies produce a variety of motor winding end turn insulators and caps.
Stevens Products has developed a custom line of printed circuit board manufacturing aides. Our “gold finger gloves” cover gold contacts can eliminate use of costly Kapton tape. PCB stiffeners clip on board edges and incorporate our proprietary fiberglass epoxy pultruded rod. The rod has 150,000 PSI flexural strength and prevents board twist and warp through wave solder, re-flow and other processes. PCB board “carriers” clip on board edges to facilitate leveling and conveyor belt contact issues. An infinite array of “connector covers” can be fabricated to fit specific needs from our vast open stock tooling.
Call Ross Stevens or Robert Cantellino today at 973-672-2140 and let us exceed your expectations by resolving your custom requirements with our 70 years of expertise and cost-effective solutions!

Our History
Leadership
Mission and Values







1933 - 1945

1946-1955
|
1956-1969
|
1970-1985
|
1986-2000
|
2001 - Present







A New Venture
During the Great Depression, when confidence in the U.S. financial system was gravely shaken, W.R. “Witt” Stephens takes a chance on the future of America.


Building Prosperity
As America begins to focus on post-war production, Stephens invests in — and contributes to — a new era of expansion and prosperity.


Investing in the Future
During the 1960s, the postwar boom begins to slow and doubts begin to grow about the future of the economy. Nevertheless, Stephens remains resolute. The firm begins trading corporate securities and investing in businesses that would become the firm’s private equity strategy.


Growing with Our Clients
With the dawn of the 1970s, Stephens expands its investment banking capabilities. Raising capital for companies in Arkansas and beyond, Stephens expands during a tough economic environment by focusing on enduring relationships.


Second-Generation Leadership
The 1980s usher in a new era of innovation, setting the stage for the technology boom of the 1990s. Warren Stephens leads the firm into an era of strategic growth and expansion, establishing Stephens as a truly national, independent financial services firm.


Capitalizing on Independence
A global economic crisis, triggered by the meltdown of the housing market, severely impacts financial markets and poses a grave threat to all financial institutions. Having avoided the over-leveraging that brought down other investment firms, Stephens remains sound and continues to grow.












1933
Witt Stephens establishes the firm to trade Arkansas Highway bonds, then selling for as low as pennies on the dollar. By the time the bonds paid off at par in the early ‘40s, Stephens has gained a reputation for both municipal bond expertise and for providing sound financial counseling.













1946
Jackson T. “Jack” Stephens joins his brother upon his graduation from the U.S. Naval Academy. Together they form Stephens Inc. on a handshake partnership that lasts over 45 years. That philosophy of partnership continues to guide the way Stephens does business today.






1945
Stephens purchases the Arkansas Oklahoma Gas Co.


1948
Allied Telephone begins a decades-long relationship with Stephens. The company will ultimately evolve into global telecom giant Alltel.


1953
Stephens acquires the Oklahoma Producing Co., renaming it Stephens Production Company.


1954
Stephens purchases the Arkansas Louisiana Gas Co. (ArkLa).









1956
Jack becomes President of Stephens Inc. Witt leaves the firm to become President and Chairman of Arkansas Louisiana Gas Company, where he stays until 1973.






1968
Anticipating the coming revolution in bank data processing, Jack Stephens deploys excess computing capacity at Union Life, which was owned by the Stephens family. With $400,000 in start-up capital, Stephens created Systematics, which would become a leader in the bank data processing industry. This relationship continued over 40 years, with Systematics eventually acquired by Alltel, and later acquired by Fidelity National Information Systems.









1970
Stephens takes a small Arkansas-based discount retailer public. Not only does the capital help fund Walmart’s growth, it is part of a long and constructive partnership between Sam Walton and Jack — the kind of partnership Stephens continues to build with clients today.






1971
Together with the First National Bank of Commerce, Stephens underwrites $113 million in municipal bonds to help build the Louisiana Superdome. At the time, this is the largest single municipal bond issue in the history of the Southern states.


1983
The Stephens family invests in Worthen Banking Corporation. In April 1985, the bankruptcy of Bevill, Bresler & Schulman wipes out Worthen’s capital. Led by Jack Stephens, the shareholders provide the funds necessary to recapitalize the bank and keep it solvent.









1986
Warren A. Stephens is named Chief Executive Officer of Stephens Inc., carrying on the tradition of family values and leadership begun by his father, Jack, and his uncle, Witt.





1987
Stephens Insurance is established.


1989
With Stephens’ guidance, Tyson Foods acquires Holly Farms for $1.5 billion in a hostile takeover.


1989
Stephens Inc. becomes a member of the New York Stock Exchange.


1992
Stephens invests in Viking Range, providing the growth capital needed to expand into a leading international brand.


1993
Stephens purchases Donrey Media, renaming it Stephens Media Group. Today, SMG’s holdings include 11 daily newspapers, 64 weeklies, magazines, specialty publications and more than 100 websites operating in nine states.


1998
The Private Client Group is established to serve the wealth management needs of high net worth families, and the first Stephens branch office is opened in Conway, AR.









2014
Stephens has 24 offices in 13 states and London, England (through its London affiliate, Stephens Europe Limited).






2001
Stephens invests in Hotchkis & Wiley, a leading Los Angeles- based investment management firm.


2004
Stephens Investment Management Group (SIMG) is founded.


2006
Warren Stephens acquires 100% of Stephens Inc.


2008
Warren Stephens addresses the impact of the financial crisis in a memo to all Stephens employees. Click to read memo.


2009
Stephens launches a new brand captured in a new tagline: Capitalize on Independence.











Leadership with a Focus on Teamwork
Our leadership has worked together for decades, instilling a sense of stability, teamwork and dedication throughout the firm.

Our Mission and Values
The Mission of Stephens Inc. is to become a trusted advisor to our clients in all aspects of their business and personal investments. We assist our clients as they interact with the financial markets, consider capital formation and preservation, and analyze strategic alternatives.

Relationships
Our clients come first. It is this philosophy that ultimately enhances our reputation and profits. On the other side of every revenue-generating transaction, there is a customer who must be dealt with fairly and with the highest of ethical standards. On the other side of every investment are partners, fellow shareholders and a management team who deserve the most candid reflection of our thoughts, opinions and advice. In dealing with these varied interests honestly and fairly, we will build trust in our judgment and integrity. This will forge relationships, the likes of which have been, and will continue to be, the cornerstone of our success.
Extraordinary people create extraordinary companies, and we will make it our business to maintain relationships with as many extraordinary business people as is possible all over the world. From these relationships and from our commitment to the minimization of missed opportunities will come the future revenue flow of Stephens Inc. This is our corporate definition of “rain making” — extensive relationships and no missed opportunities.
Strong Capital Position and Principal Mentality
Our long-term relationships, our strong capital position, our principal mentality, and the level of professionalism with which we approach decisions set us apart in the financial services industry.
With full awareness that many firms around us are in the process of developing massive scale, we define our future in terms of quality and profitability. This trend toward massive scale will make Stephens increasingly unique in our industry, and we will meet our competition with creativity, agility, integrity, intelligence and a commitment to exceptional execution.
We understand and appreciate that the most innovative and distinguished financiers in the history of the world have not always operated from the largest-scale platforms. As Stephens Inc. continues its tradition of producing some of the most exceptional financial minds in the country, our vision for ourselves will be realized.
Creating Distinctive Opportunities
Our investment banking and principal investing businesses operate in close organizational proximity. This is by design. We think and act like owners whether we are acting as principal or agent. We feel that this gives us a unique perspective in our business and creates distinctive opportunities for us and for our clients.
This approach has paid substantial dividends beyond return on investment. Many of our investments have become clients of our investment banking services, and many investments started out as investment banking clients. We will continue this course that differentiates Stephens Inc. within the securities industry. We are unique.
