Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for FleetMatics Group PLC (NYSE:FLTX) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 9 Hold RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: $59.75 (0.42% downside)

        Easy And effective dashboArd

        With a simple-to-read dashboard, you’re clicks away from identifying opportunities to improve, comparing driver performance, seeing changing trends and creating benchmarks on key fleet metrics. 
    






        Give customers  something to smile about 

        With Fleetmatics REVEAL, you’ll be able to respond to customer needs with more accuracy and at a faster rate. That means your fleet may be able to beat competition to prospects. Oh, how sweet victory can be.
