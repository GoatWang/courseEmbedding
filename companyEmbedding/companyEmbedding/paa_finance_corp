Results on the quarter benefited from the partnership's robust Permian footprint as well as the recently placed in service Saddlehorn pipeline. Management provided an update to its FY17 guidance and expects $2.36 billion of Adjusted EBITDA, up from $2.17 billion in FY16. Although management had positive commentary around the partnership's long-term outlook in the Permian, we believe near-term challenges persist such as a stretched balance sheet and equity needs. We retain a positive outlook on the partnership's growth plans and operational leverage, but believe units are fairly valued. At this time we are maintaining our Hold rating." (2/9/2017)

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
