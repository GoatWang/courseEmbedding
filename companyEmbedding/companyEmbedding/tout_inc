The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Tout is an online social networking service and microblogging service that enables its users to send and view 15-second videos, known as "touts". The service's core technology was created at SRI International by Michael Downing based on two patents owned by that company.[2][3]
In April 2010, Tout spun off as its own company with SRI taking an equity stake.[3] Tout gained popularity in June 2011 when basketball player Shaquille O'Neal used the service to announce his retirement. As of early 2012, Tout has had over 12 million visitors since its launch, and 75 million Touts have been created and shared by users of the service.[4]

Investors[edit]
On July 11, 2012, WWE invested $5,000,000 in Tout Industries, Inc.'s ("Tout") Series B Preferred Stock and in July 2012, WWE entered into a two-year strategic partnership in Tout. WWE will be eligible to receive up 11,250 shares of Tout common stock per quarter for the life of the two-year agreement that is if certain performance metrics are met during the two years of the agreement.[5][6]
During WWE CEO Vince McMahon's quarterly conference call with investors held on the morning of August 2, WWE CFO George Barrios disclosed the amount of that investment to have been $5 million but would not disclose what percentage of the company that sum represents.[7][8][9][10] Stephanie McMahon, CBO of WWE, would appear on the Board of Directors for Tout.[11] Starting with the 1000th episode of its weekly flagship television program Raw on July 23, WWE began airing Touts of both fans and wrestlers at certain points during episodes of the show.[6] Brock Lesnar used the service to announce his kayfabe retirement in August 2012.[12] The WWE's partnership with the company expired in 2014 and they stopped using it afterwards.[13]
Starting in 2017, on-screen General Manager of Smackdown Live Daniel Bryan started referencing Tout when filmed by Renee Young for a video on Twitter prior to the WWE Network show Talking Smack, which Bryan and Young co-hosted. After more references were made of Tout by Bryan on his official Twitter account, on July 25th, 2017, WWE once again used Tout to broadcast "Smacking Talk" on Twitter, a "special edition" of Talking Smack, which had been cancelled two weeks prior as a weekly show on the Network.

KAREN FOLEY, CEO & FOUNDER
Karen was anointed a foodie in 1991 when Time Magazine published a cover story on the former fashion executive’s choice to leave New York City and the fashion world for the simple life: Owning a historic grocery store in St. Paul, Minnesota. Karen soon purchased a second grocery store on the golden shores of Lake Minnetonka, a business which she quickly grew into eight restaurants and the launch of her first website in 2000.
But it was Foley’s passion for sales and marketing in the food industry that led her to Wine Country. After selling her Internet company in 2002 she became the General Manager handling all Operations for Oakville Grocery Company where she implemented systems, procedures and best practices while growing the company through focused marketing implementation. Foley moved on to become Senior Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Tulocay and Co., a Napa, Ca. based gourmet food manufacturing company. It was there Foley honed her skills for product creativity, conceptualization, development, marketing, sales, distribution, and finally, branding. In her six years at Tulocay, Foley tripled company sales and launched licensed brands for Tyler Florence and Good Housekeeping, developed Vineyard Pantry, Nature’s Habit brands and worked closely with key food-related retailers across the country on developing private label programs. Foley’s expertise and leadership skills directly coincide with her instinctive sales and marketing vision.
Foley works closely with emerging brands (a personal passion) to incubate and position them within the marketplace and retail stores, building their private label store brands. Her foodie expertise directly coincides with her instinctive sales and marketing vision, developed through her key leadership roles in product development, branding, sales, marketing and distribution.

When we began Foodie Tout in 2013 we realized the small-batch co-packing model needed to be disrupted. Historically, food manufacturers have been in the business of co-packing products for Artisan Purveyors but have done nothing to help these small businesses grow and prosper. Essentially, Artisan Purveyors have been left standing on the loading dock with cases of product and nowhere to go.
Foodie Tout took a different approach. With the purchase of a food manufacturing facility (formerly Mad Wills), we have broadened our ability to provide clients consistent services from conception to market. We assist with financial/strategic planning, marketing and brand building, reputation management and social media programs that accelerate food brands.
 
 
 




Foodie Tout is the parent company to each of our divisions that assist our clients in brand-building, sales and distribution processes for our Artisan Purveyors, co-packers and private label clients through our suite of Artisan Purveyor-focused platforms: Purveyors Kitchen, Foodie Media, Foodie Daily and Purveyors Pantry.
 
 
 












 
 
 






For experienced producers, PK offers a collaborative manufacturing environment with multi manufacturing capabilities and a suite of supportive services. Are you an Artisan needing to start at the beginning? We recreate your unique sauce or beverage recipe for market-readiness, achieving the same flavor profile, mouth-feel, viscosity and sense of quality as the original. We work with a wide variety of ingredients.
We can also help you complete the package without extensive knowledge of containers, label design and printing.
 
 
 




With ever-changing FDA Regulations and Guidelines for product and nutritional labeling, Purveyors Kitchen will work one-on-one with you to create a label that’s not only professionally designed but also accurate and compliant.
Most important, our Accelerator services for early-stage Purveyors provide the business and marketing tools to assist you with your launch in entering a very competitive market place.
 
 
 












 
 
 






Foodie Media focuses on building your brand and expanding your market through our suite of media services. Whether it’s digital or print, we deliver content that gets you noticed by grocers and customers alike. We offer marketing for your brand and products alone or co-branded material with retailers, which is great leverage for getting onto grocery store shelves.
 
 
 




See our Foodie Media site for details on our vast spectrum of marketing services, which include videography, PR, web, social media and more. VISIT SITE
 
 
 













 
 
 






Recipes are some of the most-shared content on the web. Purveyors Pantry, an Artisan Purveyor recipe-focused online shop, is the perfect place for your product to gain traction.
The platform integrates many of the Foodie Media services as well, including recipe videos, product shots and more.
 
 
 




PurveyorsPantry.com is the online component to our brick and mortar shop, Purveyors Pantry, in Nevada City, CA, where visitors love to come sample local Artisan Purveyor creations at our intimate tasting bar. VISIT SITE
 
 
 












 
 
 






An online magazine with a formidable following, Foodie Daily features stories and information about the world of food. Our focus is on the small-batch manufacturer and Artisan Purveyor. It’s not only a good read but also a platform for the content we create for your brand through Foodie Media.
 
 
 




For the Artisan Purveyor, reasonable advertising in a food-focused publication has been almost impossible to find. But, for example, a brand-building ad in Foodie Daily is one of the most reasonable media buys in today’s market. Or, a feature on your brand’s story with a Facebook Live interview is a great source of infinitely shareable content. VISIT SITE
