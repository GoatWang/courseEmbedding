WM Coffman adds Kevin Conley as VP of SalesWM Coffman Press Release – April 14, 2017
WM Coffman Resources is pleased to announce the addition of Kevin P. Conley as Vice President of Sales.
We are very excited to have the opportunity to add Kevin to our management team.  Dale Reutter, President of WM Coffman stated, “Kevin’s 30 years of industry knowledge and respected leadership in sales management is exactly what we have been searching for. His addition to our company is just another step in taking our business to the next level.”
 



A Modern LookWM Coffman Stair Parts has recently released the most innovative new baluster in the market;
Brushed Nickel.
Stainless Steel is everywhere.
WM Coffman Stair Parts spoke to numerous customers and found that Stainless Steel IS a look that homeowners want, but CAN’T afford.  After months of meeting with customers and hearing the same story, we decided there had to be a better way.
 
We went to work in developing a state of the art process for creating a Brushed Nickel baluster that has the look of stainless, but at a quarter of the price.
We worked tirelessly for 16 months in developing this baluster and we are proud to offer it ONLY at WM Coffman Stair Parts.

 
Contact us at sales@wm-coffman.com for samples and pricing!



WM Coffman acquires Stair Crafters in New JerseyWM Coffman acquired Stair Crafters Supply in Rahway, New Jersey as of May 23, 2016.
Stair Crafters has been a regional distributor of wood and iron stair parts to lumber yards and stair builders for the last 10 years servicing the New York Tri-State Area. They have been a customer of WM Coffman since 2008.
Over the next ninety days, we will move into a larger facility in the area to accommodate our combined growing business in the region. This facility will act as a third distribution center of WM Coffman so we may better service our customers in the North East and New England Markets with next day deliveries. It will also allow us to better service the existing Stair Crafters customers by increasing inventory levels and order fulfilment.
Together we look forward to enhancing our service and growing our market share in the region.
