Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
5. 9 out of 10 fixed income funds. Ranking based on Class Z share fixed income funds with 10-year history. Rankings for Class Z share fixed income funds that rank top 50% or better within their respective Morningstar Categories over the trailing 1-, 3-, & 5-year periods are 12/18 funds, 14/15 funds, and 11/13 funds, respectively. Source: Morningstar as of 3/31/17.
6. P&I/Towers Watson Top 300 Pension Funds ranking as of 12/31/16, published 9/30/16.
7. Based on U.S. Plan Sponsor rankings in Pensions & Investments as of 12/31/16.
Morningstar rankings are based on total return, do not include the effects of sales charges, and are calculated against all funds in each fund's respective Morningstar category. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Performance by share class may vary.
Star ratings shown are for Class Z shares, which are available to individual investors through certain retirement and wrap fee programs, and to institutions at an investment minimum of $5,000,000. Performance by share class may vary. In addition to the ones shown above, other classes, which contain either a sales load or a contingent deferred sales charge, are also available. These expenses will generally lower total fund return. Please see the prospectus for additional information about fees, expenses and investor eligibility requirements.
The risks associated with investing in these funds include but are not limited to: derivative securities, which may carry market, credit, and liquidity risks; short sales, which involve costs and the risk of potentially unlimited losses; leveraging, which may magnify losses; high yield (“junk”) bonds, which are subject to greater market risks; small/mid cap stocks which may be subject to more erratic market movements than large cap stocks; foreign securities, which are subject to currency fluctuation and political uncertainty; real estate, which poses certain risks related to overall and specific economic conditions as well as risks related to individual property, credit and interest-rate fluctuations; and mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to prepayment and extension risks. Sector funds and Specialty funds may not be suitable for all investors. Such funds are non-diversified, so a loss resulting from a particular security will have greater impact on the Fund's return. Fixed income investments are subject to interest rate risk, and their value will decline as interest rates rise. The risks associated with each fund are explained more fully in each fund's respective prospectus. There is no guarantee a fund's objectives will be achieved.
Some Morningstar Ratings may not be customarily based on adjusted historical returns. If so, an investment's independent Morningstar Rating metric is compared against the retail mutual fund universe breakpoints to determine its hypothetical rating for certain time periods. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
For the overall, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods, respectively, as of 3/31/17: Prudential Balanced Fund was rated 5 stars out of 721 funds, 5 stars out of 721 funds, and 5 stars out of 616 funds, and 4 out of 424 funds, respectively; Prudential High Yield Fund was rated 5 stars out of 596 funds, 5 stars out of 596 funds, 4 stars out of 471 funds, and 5 stars out of 318 funds, respectively; Prudential Short-Term Corporate Bond Fund, Inc. was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 444 funds, 4 stars out of 359 funds, and 5 stars out of 257 funds, respectively; Prudential Total Return Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 851 funds, 5 stars out of 750 funds, and 5 stars out of 538 funds, respectively; Prudential California Municipal Income Fund was rated 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 69 funds, 5 stars out of 65 funds, and 5 stars out of 52 funds, respectively; Prudential National Muni Fund was rated 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 256 funds, 5 stars out of 224 funds, and 5 stars out of 150 funds, respectively; Prudential QMA Small-Cap Value Fund was rated 5 stars out of 353 funds, 5 stars out of 353 funds, 4 stars out of 309 funds, and 5 stars out of 199 funds, respectively; Prudential Short Duration Multi-Sector Bond Fund was rated 5 stars out of 444 funds, and 5 stars out of 444 funds, respectively.

Shareholder Reports

The FMI Large Cap Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation through the purchase of a limited number of large capitalization value stocks. The Fund extends the core philosophy of the management company (Fiduciary Management, Inc.), buying good businesses at value prices, beyond the small to mid-capitalization range. Some of the characteristics of good businesses may include strong recurring revenue and attractive returns-on-investment capital. A strong orientation to low absolute or relative valuation is key to the execution of the investment strategy. As a non-diversified fund, the FMI Large Cap Fund tends to concentrate its investment on fewer companies than a diversified mutual fund. The Fund holds approximately 20-30 stocks, with most major industry groups represented.
Please refer to the Prospectus for a more detailed explanation of the FMI Large Cap Fund, the management, and an Application.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

10 BEST MUTUAL FUNDS
The best mutual funds for the rest of 2016 will likely share two overlapping themes — defense and diversification.The worst enemy of capital markets is uncertainty. We know this from history, but the markets received a stark reminder of this reality via a swift shift to risk-off mode in the wake of the surprise Brexit result.The initial shock and uncertainty faded, with stocks resuming the modestly positive climb we saw prior to the Brexit. But more uncertainty is looming ahead — namely, whether we will see another interest rate hike in 2016, not to mention the result of November’s presidential election.There’s plenty to make investors jittery.In this kind of environment, it’s wise not to make big bets on any one asset type, industrial sector or niche area of stocks or bonds. And moving everything to cash won’t likely be the best move either.With all that advice in mind, here are (in no particular order) the best mutual funds for the rest of 2016.Best Mutual Funds for the Rest of 2016:Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund (HSTRX)Expenses: 0.69%Minimum Initial Investment: $1,000Uncertain times and the volatility and downside pressure that come along with them are the right kind of conditions for hedge fund-like mutual funds, such as Hussman Strategic Total Return Fund(MUTF:HSTRX).HSTRX is one of the best mutual funds in times of economic uncertainty and challenging market conditions — which sounds an awful lot like most of 2016 — and may continue to excel for the foreseeable future. Portfolio manager John Hussman is ahead of 97% of tactical allocation funds with a gain of more than 11% near the end of 2016’s first half.The portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities, but Hussman’s hedge fund-like tactics will have him moving significant amounts of fund assets to cash, stocks or commodity-based securities when he sees opportunities for gains in volatile markets. Right now, he likes minersNewmont Mining Corp (NYSE:NEM) and Barrick Gold Corporation (USA) (NYSE:ABX).Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund (VWINX)Expenses: 0.23%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000If you’re looking for a more conventional means of limiting downside pressure while still capturing decent gains should the market continue its climb in the second half of 2016 … well, Vanguard Wellesley Income (MUTF:VWINX) is a solid choice.With the broad market stock indices mostly sitting on low-single-digit gains on the year and the Federal Reserve’s next move looking more and more uncertain, a fund with the right mix of stocks and bonds can produce market-beating returns.A conservative blend of high-quality bonds and large-cap stocks like MicrosoftCorporation(NASDAQ:MSFT), Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has VWINX beating the S&P 500 in 2016.If the remainder of the year looks anything like the first six months, or if the market turns negative, VWINX should prove to be among the best mutual funds you should be holding on to for 2016’s second half.Fidelity Select Healthcare Portfolio (FSPHX)Expenses: 0.73%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500While it won’t usually pay to be too concentrated right now, there are a couple of specific shots that investors can take right now.The healthcare sector has had a tough 2016, but don’t let that dissuade you from defensive stock funds like Fidelity Select Health Care Portfolio (MUTF:FSPHX).Healthcare products and services are essential to most consumers, which is why the health sector is considered be a defensive one. Although the sector has been beaten down by falling biotechnology stocks, and the tough political talk on pharmaceutical pricing has pushed down prices, the long-term attributes of an aging population and advances in medical technology remain attractive.Therefore, now can be a good time to pick up bargain-priced shares of funds like FSPHX, which focuses on healthcare stocks like Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), Amgen, Inc.(NASDAQ:AMGN) and Boston Scientific Corporation (NYSE:BSX).Vanguard Mid Cap Index (VIMSX)Expenses: 0.2%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000If you’re looking to avoid large caps because of a strong dollar and small caps should the market shift back to risk-off mode, one of the best mutual funds to hold now might be right in the middle: theVanguard Mid Cap Index (MUTF:VIMSX).As plenty of research has shown, mid-cap stocks are in the “sweet spot” of the market capitalization spectrum when it comes to risk-adjusted returns. And if the bull market has more room to run, mid-cap stocks tend to beat large-caps in the latter phase of the business cycle.If you already hold a large-cap stock fund, a passively managed mid-cap stock fund like VIMSX won’t have much overlap with it. But keep in mind that in a big market correction, mid-cap stocks like top holdings Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Fiserv Inc (NASDAQ:FISV) andElectronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA) can decline as much or more than large caps.Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (VTSMX)Expenses: 0.16%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000In uncertain times, diversification is key, and Vanguard Total Stock Market Index (MUTF:VTSMX) is one of the best funds on the market to diversify a portfolio.Although S&P 500 index funds are great diversifiers and solid core holdings, a strong dollar will weigh heavier on the large-cap stocks that dominate the S&P 500. Therefore a low-cost total stock index fund like VTSMX looks like a better idea in 2016.Yes, VTSMX does hold large-cap stocks like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), AlphabetInc(NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft, but it also holds mid- and small-cap stocks for a more diverse, complete coverage of the U.S. total stock market.Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (FSAGX)Expenses: 0.94%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,500As the Brexit and the first half of 2016 recently reminded us, when investors are fearful about the global economic environment, they increasingly buy gold bullion and funds like the Fidelity Select Gold Portfolio (MUTF:FSAGX).Conditions that can support higher gold include a weak U.S. dollar, weak global economies, high demand for physical gold and low or falling interest rates.But one overriding factor that trumps all of them is uncertainty … and that should be in largesupply in the second half of 2016.Uncertainty over the strength of the European economy, uncertainty over interest rates and currencies, uncertainty over the result of the U.S. presidential election. These could press more investors into buying more tangible assets like gold, which means higher prices for FSAGX top holdings Randgold Resources Ltd. (ADR) (NASDAQ:GOLD), Goldcorp Inc. (USA)(NYSE:GG) and Newmont Mining.Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (VBMFX)Expenses: 0.16%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000To extend the diversification theme to the fixed income portion of your portfolio, Vanguard Total Bond Market Index (MUTF:VBMFX) may be the best bond fund to do it.VBMFX tracks the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index, which covers more than 8,000 bonds in the U.S. bond market.Some investors and many financial media pundits don’t like bond index funds when rates are expected to rise, but how many times have the pundits, and even many of the best fixed income portfolio managers in the world, predicted what rates would do over the past three or four years?The conventional thinking is that active fund managers can shift their portfolios to bonds with lower sensitivity to interest rates or even to cash, whereas index funds are forced to passively fall off of the proverbial price cliff as rates rise.For recent history on the failure of active bond fund managers, VBMFX has beaten nearly two-thirds of intermediate-term bond funds for past three years and nearly 90% for the past year.Vanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (VFSTX)Expenses: 0.2%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000Investors betting that the Fed will continue their tightening in the second half of 2016 may want to consider buying a mutual fund likeVanguard Short-Term Investment-Grade (MUTF:VFSTX).If rates resume their rise, it’s an indication that the U.S. economy is still in growth mode, albeit at a modest pace. And since, in a rising interest rate environment, bonds of longer duration usually fall in price more than those of shorter duration, short-term bond funds like VFSTX can do better than the long-term bond funds and probably better than bond index funds.And with a moderately strong economy, investment-grade bonds that make up the VFSTX portfolio can perform better, or at least put up higher yields, than high-quality bonds.USA Mutuals Barrier Fund Investor Class Shares (VICEX)Expenses: 1.44%Minimum Initial Investment: $2,000One of the best mutual funds that focuses on defensive stocks isUSA Mutuals Barrier Fund Investor Class Shares (MUTF:VICEX) — more commonly known as the Vice Fund.The Vice Fund holds stocks that can fall under the unofficial equity categorization of “sin stocks” because they include companies in the gaming, tobacco and alcoholic beverage industries, though VICEX also includes aerospace and defense stocks.VICEX makes a solid defensive stock fund because sin stocks can hold up better than the major market indices during challenging economic times thanks to widespread underpricing thanks to the less-than-desirable nature of their businesses — and in the case of tobacco stocks, high dividends. Year-to-date, VICEX is beating well more than 90% of category peers and is crushing the S&P 500 index.Top holdings for the vice fund were recently Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM),Reynolds American, Inc. (NYSE:RAI), and Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO).Vanguard Energy (VGENX)Expenses: 0.37%Minimum Initial Investment: $3,000Oil and energy stocks have seen some volatility in 2016, especially in the wake of the Brexit, but energy sector funds like Vanguard Energy (MUTF:VGENX) can be good buys now.2016 has been the best year to buy oil-related stocks in the past seven years or so. With the price of oil hitting a multiyear low in 2015, and strong performance in 2016 that looks to provide more momentum in the coming months, the best energy funds could outperform major market indices for the rest of 2016.Also, VGENX doesn’t hold the riskier small-cap energy stocks, and instead the portfolio consists of high-quality large-cap names like Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
