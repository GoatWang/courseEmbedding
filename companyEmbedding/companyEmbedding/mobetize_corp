(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  PRELIMINARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q (the "Report"). This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.  In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors which may cause our actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements. Although we believe that the predictions reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason.  We are considered a development stage company. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion on the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2015.  GENERAL  We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 23, 2012. Our business office is at 8105 Birch Bay Road, Suite 205, Blaine WA 98230. Our telephone number is (206) 347-4515.  Our original business was to provide service to international students who want to study in Canada. We have not generated any revenues and our principal business activities had consisted of creating a business plan and entering into a Referral Agreement dated May 7, 2012 with Novy Mir, Ltd., an independent contractor who was to refer international students to us.  Our business plan was to help international students enroll in appropriate universities, institutes, colleges or schools in Canada. We also had planned to help students obtain student visas and find accommodations in the cities of study. Our service was to start from preliminary consultation and end when the client was enrolled to the program, entered to the destination country and accommodated at a desired place.  Unfortunately, we were not able to raise sufficient capital to fund our business development and consequently our management began considering alternative strategies, such as business combinations or acquisitions to create value for our shareholders.  On July 9, 2013, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with Mobetize Inc. ("Priveco"), a State of Nevada corporation and formerly "Telupay Inc.".

In accordance with board approval, we filed a Certificate of Change dated August 8, 2013 with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to a forward split of our authorized, issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 7 new for 1 old basis, such that our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 525,000,000 shares of common stock and, correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock was increased from 3,290,000 to 23,030,000 common shares, all with a par value of $0.001.  Further, effective August 13, 2013, in accordance with approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), our company changed its name from "Slavia, Corp." to "Mobetize Corp.". The name change and forward split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening of trading on August 14, 2013 under the symbol SAVID". Effective October 1, 2013, our stock symbol changed from "SAVID" to "MPAY" to better reflect the new name of our company.

Page 20  BUSINESS OVERVIEW  Our original business was to provide service to international students who want to study in Canada. We did not generate any revenues and our principal business activities consisted of creating a business plan. Our business plan was to help international students enrol in appropriate universities, institutes, colleges or schools in Canada. We also had planned to help students obtain student visas and find accommodations in the cities of study. Our service was to start from preliminary consultation and will end when the client is enrolled to the program, entered to the destination country and accommodated at desired place.  Unfortunately, we were not able to raise sufficient capital to fund our business development and consequently our management began considering alternative strategies, such as business combinations or acquisitions to create value for our shareholders.  As such, we purchased all or substantially all of the business assets of Mobetize Inc. on September 4, 2013 and our new business offers us the opportunity to become a leading online and mobile commerce platform provider for telecom operators, payment service providers and banks. Our platform is brand-able and enables telecom operators, employers and prepaid card issuers to simplify the delivery of mobile financial services. We ensure end-to-end integration for services such as retail/online payments, air-time top ups, international remittances/money transfer, P2P transfers and Visa/Mastercard programs on mobile devices. We seamlessly integrate and white label our secure mobile money platform with our delivery partners to help increase their average revenue per customer (ARPU), decrease customer service costs, and increase loyalty to existing offerings.  Telecom Products and Solutions:  Adoption of the smart phone has created an unprecedented increase in the use of the mobile devices for financial transactions. This paradigm is changing the way people receive financial services across the globe. MFS are part of a long-term strategy for telecom operators worldwide to enhance their relationship with their subscribers and increase Average Revenue Per User ("ARPU"). For telcos with predominantly prepaid customer bases, we assist them in significantly increasing their enterprise value, as we effectively convert pre-paid subscribers in to post-paid subscribers. We have commenced operations with our first products designed and ready for sale and/or implementation.  smartWallet:  Our smartWallet solution is provided via mobile web and web OS Apple and Android app to the desktop, iPad or mobile phone of our users.  The smartWallet is the core of our mobile financial services offerings and allows users to load funds in to their mobile wallet and access global services such as prepaid top-ups for themselves or for gifts for family members, Person 2 Person money transfers, international money transfer remittances, bill payments and bill management, with other financial services being added.

We have extended our existing partnership with DCR to offer Mobetize mobile financial services and products to the many millions of existing DCR prepaid card users in North America.  On September 8, 2014 we entered into an agreement with Impact Telecom, a global provider of voice, messaging, and data services, to offer the Mobetize mobile wallet platform to deliver international money transfer, mobile airtime top-up, and bill payments to Impact Telecom's extensive customer base in the United States and Canada.  Page 23  U.S. and Canada currently remit over $100 billion annually, and most of that money is transferred utilizing traditional storefront methods.

We accelerate the migration of traditional e-commerce to mobile payment. Our smart solutions platform provides telecommunications operators and payment gateways unparalleled mobile functionality in bill management, payments, recharge, domestic money transfers, international remittances, point-of-sale functionality, and numerous other related technologies.
