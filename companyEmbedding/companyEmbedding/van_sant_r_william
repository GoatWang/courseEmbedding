BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; Chief of Lukens Quits Before Planned Date


By JONATHAN P. HICKS


Published: December 6, 1991









                    Lukens Inc., a big steelmaker embroiled in a two-month-old strike, said yesterday that its chairman and chief executive, William R. Wilson, resigned six months before his previously announced retirement date.        

                    His duties will be assumed by R. William Van Sant, who has been president and chief operating officer since October.        

                    The company had announced Mr. Van Sant's promotion months ago. But Mr. Wilson's retirement was not expected until he reached age 65 next May. W. Evelyn Walker, a spokeswoman for the company, said the resignation was not related to the labor dispute, though she added that the reason for Mr. Wilson's early departure was unclear.        

                    Lukens, based in Coatesville, Pa., is the nation's third-largest producer of plate steel used in construction, shipbuilding and transportation. While other steelmakers were battered by the recession, Lukens remained strong because of its niches in highly profitable corrosion-protective steel and high-quality steel. The company also developed a growing business in highway products and in goods and services for the mining and energy industries.        

                    Mr. Van Sant, 53 years old, has been a director of Lukens since 1988.  He has extensive experience in manufacturing, aerospace and construction. He rose to vice president for manufacturing and engineering at Deere & Company, where he worked for 26 years. Then he served as president and chief operating officer of the Cessna Aircraft Company.        

                    He joined Blount Inc., a Montgomery Ala., construction company, in 1987 and had been president and chief executive since 1990.        

                    Mr. Van Sant holds bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Iowa. He is married and has three sons and two daughters.

BUSINESS PEOPLE
BUSINESS PEOPLE; Lukens Looks Ahead In Naming a President


By JONATHAN P. HICKS


Published: October 16, 1991









                    Lukens Inc., which specializes in making plate steel, said yesterday that R. William Van Sant, a former president and chief executive of Blount Inc., a construction company that also makes power equipment, would become the steel producer's president and chief operating officer.        

                    Lukens also said that Mr. Van Sant, a director since 1988, would become chairman and chief executive after W. R. Wilson retires next June.        

                    The company, based in Coatesville, Pa., is the nation's third-largest producer of plate steel, which is used in construction, shipbuilding and transportation. The company has also developed a growing business making highway products, as well as providing goods and services for the mining and energy industries.        

                    Lukens's financial health has been notably stronger than most steel producers. But a strike that began two weeks ago by the United Steelworkers union might affect results for the rest of the year. Despite the company's lower sales and earnings for the first half of this year, analysts say its performance should improve along with the economy.        

                    Mr. Van Sant, 53 years old, who has extensive experience in manufacturing, aerospace and construction services, replaces Harry I. Skilton, who resigned in September. The company said Mr. Skilton left "to pursue other business interests."        

                    In a telephone interview yesterday, Mr. Van Sant said his primary objective would be to "continue the strategy that has been set for growth and value." He added: "Lukens is a very strong company that is positioned for continued growth. The company's financial health and strength is an asset that we want to be sure to build upon."        

                    Mr. Van Sant joined Blount in 1987 and had been president and chief executive the company, based in Montgomery, Ala., since 1990. Before that, he served as president and chief operating officer of the Cessna Aircraft Company. He had eariler served as vice president of manufacturing and engineering at Deere & Company, where he worked for 26 years.        

                    He holds bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Iowa. He is married and has three sons and two daughters.

Sant Marilyn Van's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Philadelphia Inquirer
Job Details
               The Philadelphia Inquirer is a daily morning newspaper that serves the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area. The newspaper was founded by John R. Walker and John Norvell in June 1829 as The Pennsylvania Inquirer and is the third oldest surviving daily newspaper in the United States.[1] Owned by the local group Philadelphia Media Holdings L.L.C., The Inquirer has the eighth largest weekly U.S. newspaper circulation, and has won eighteen Pulitzer Prizes. Throughout The Inquirer's history, the paper has risen and fallen in prominence. The Inquirer first became a major newspaper during the American Civil War where The Inquirer's war coverage was popular on both sides. After the war the paper's circulation dramatically dropped, but was reinvigorated by the end of the 19th Century. While founded with support towards the Democratic Party The Inquirer's political affiliation eventually shifted towards the Whig Party and then the Republican Party before officially becoming politically independent in the middle of the 20th Century. By the end of the 1960s The Inquirer trailed behind its chief competitor and lacked modern facilities and experienced staff. However, new owners and editors in the 1970s turned The Inquirer into one of the most prominent newspapers in the country, winning seventeen Pulitzers in fifteen years. Since then, the prestige The Inquirer found in the 1980s has mostly disappeared because of cost cutting and a shift of focus to more local coverage.
