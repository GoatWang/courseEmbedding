Kadmon Holdings, Inc. Key Developments

Kadmon Holdings, Inc. Announces Supplemental Interim Phase 2 Data of KD025 in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease
Jul 25 17
Kadmon Holdings, Inc. announced supplemental clinical data from the first cohort (KD025 200 mg QD) of an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial (KD025-208) of the company’s lead Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (ROCK2) inhibitor, KD025, for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD). The Company first announced clinical data from the study on July 11, 2017. The data points, which were pending at the time of the prior data release, are as follows: An additional responder sustained a response through 24 weeks of KD025 treatment. Of responders remaining on KD025 through 24 weeks, 8 of 9 (89%) sustained responses, up from 7 of 8 patients (88%) previously reported; An additional patient achieved stable disease at week 24. This finding brings the number of patients with stable disease at week 24 to three patients, up from two patients previously reported, and increases the overall clinical benefit (response and stable disease) to 88% (15/17) of patients, up from 82% (14/17) of patients. The full data from the first cohort have been updated to reflect these points as follows: KD025-208 is an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of KD025 in adults with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory cGVHD and active disease. The dose-finding study includes 48 patients divided into three cohorts at different dose levels (KD025 200 mg QD, 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD), enrolled sequentially following a safety assessment of each cohort. In a preliminary analysis of data from the first cohort, KD025 200 mg QD (n=17), KD025 demonstrated clinically meaningful responses in cGVHD patients, with an Overall Response Rate (ORR) of 71% (12/17), which includes complete and partial responders. Of responders remaining on KD025 through week 24, 8 of 9 (89%) sustained responses. In addition to the 12 responders, three patients have stable disease and remain on KD025 through week 24. Overall clinical benefit (response and stable disease) occurred in 88% (15/17) of patients.

Kadmon Holdings, Inc. Announces Interim Phase 2 Data of KD025 in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease
Jul 11 17
Kadmon Holdings, Inc. announced positive interim results from its ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating KD025, the Company’s Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 (“ROCK2”) inhibitor, in patients with previously treated chronic graft-versus-host disease (“cGVHD”), a serious complication following allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. In a preliminary analysis, KD025 demonstrated a favorable safety and tolerability profile in all patients and an overall response rate (“ORR”) of 71%. KD025-208 is an ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety, tolerability and activity of KD025 in adults with steroid-dependent or steroid-refractory cGVHD and active disease. The dose-finding study includes 48 patients divided into three cohorts at different dose levels (KD025 200 mg QD, 200 mg BID and 400 mg QD), enrolled sequentially following a safety assessment of each cohort. In a preliminary analysis of data from the first cohort, KD025 200 mg QD (n=17), KD025 demonstrated clinically meaningful responses in cGVHD patients, with an ORR of 71% (12/17), which includes complete and partial responders. Of responders remaining on KD025 through week 24, 7 of 8 (88%) sustained responses. In addition to the 12 responders, two patients have stable disease and remain on KD025 through week 24. Overall clinical benefit (response and stable disease) occurred in 82% (14/17) of patients. 67%; 8/12 of responders saw an improvement in symptoms as measured by the Lee cGVHD Symptom Scale score. To date, no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs) have been recorded, and no drug-related elevations in liver function tests have been observed. Importantly, 67% (8/12) of responders had reduction of steroid doses and 67% (4/6) of patients had reduction of tacrolimus doses.

Pipeline





Pioneering a new paradigm for drug development
Our goal is to develop first-in-class, innovative therapies for indications with significant unmet medical needs, including autoimmune and fibrotic diseases, oncology and genetic diseases.







	      			Autoimmune and Fibrotic Diseases	      		


	      			Oncology	      		


	      			Genetic Diseases	      		





Pre-Clinical
Phase 1
Phase 2
Phase 3






KD025 in Psoriasis Vulgaris			        	


KD025 is an orally available, selective small molecule inhibitor of ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2), a molecular target in multiple autoimmune, fibrotic and neurodegenerative diseases.
Phase 2
Ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and activity of KD025 in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis.









KD025 in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis			        	


KD025 is an orally available, selective small molecule inhibitor of ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2), a molecular target in multiple autoimmune, fibrotic and neurodegenerative diseases.
Phase 2
Ongoing study of KD025 in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.









KD025 in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease			        	


KD025 is an orally available, selective small molecule inhibitor of ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2), a molecular target in multiple autoimmune, fibrotic and neurodegenerative diseases.
Phase 2 
Ongoing study of KD025 in chronic graft-versus-host disease.












Tesevatinib in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer			        	


Tesevatinib is an oral, reversible and potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with demonstrated clinical activity against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Tesevatinib is highly penetrant of the blood-brain barrier, which separates the circulating blood from the brain, and accumulates in the leptomeninges (membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord) and kidneys.
Phase 2 
Ongoing study of tesevatinib in subjects with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations and brain metastases or leptomeningeal disease.









Tesevatinib in Glioblastoma			        	


Tesevatinib is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed to block key molecular drivers of tumor growth, metastases and drug resistance. Tesevatinib has been observed in preclinical studies to cross the blood-brain barrier, which separates the circulating blood from the brain. In preclinical and early clinical studies, we have observed tesevatinib’s activity against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a cell surface receptor, and its accumulation in the lungs, leptomeninges (membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord) and kidneys.
Phase 2
Ongoing study of tesevatinib in glioblastoma.












Tesevatinib in Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease			        	


Tesevatinib is an oral, reversible and potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with demonstrated clinical activity against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Tesevatinib is highly penetrant of the blood-brain barrier, which separates the circulating blood from the brain, and accumulates in the leptomeninges (membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord) and kidneys.
Phase 2a
Ongoing safety, pharmacokinetics and dose-finding study of tesevatinib in subjects with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease.









Tesevatinib in Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease			        	


Tesevatinib is an oral, reversible and potent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with demonstrated clinical activity against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Tesevatinib is highly penetrant of the blood-brain barrier, which separates the circulating blood from the brain, and accumulates in the leptomeninges (membranes that protect the brain and spinal cord) and kidneys.
Phase 1
Planned study of tesevatinib in autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease.









KD034 in Wilson’s Disease			        	


KD034 is our portfolio of trientine hydrochloride formulations for the treatment of Wilson’s disease.
ANDAs Submitted
Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for a bottled generic formulation and a room-temperature stable product were submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2016 and in March 2017, respectively.
Stability and Bioequivalence Studies
Completed stability and bioequivalence studies of KD034.
