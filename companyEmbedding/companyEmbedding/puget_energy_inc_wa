Puget Energy, a subsidiary of Puget Holdings LLC, is a Bellevue, Washington-based company whose core business 
  is Puget Sound Energy, a regulated utility, providing electric and 
  natural gas service to Western 
  Washington.
Puget Energy's focus is to concentrate on its core business: retail electric and natural gas utility service within a regulated environment. The company's strategy emphasizes meeting the energy needs of the growing PSE customer base through incremental, cost-effective energy conservation, low-cost procurement of traditional energy resources (including by producing and generating electricity and  natural gas), and far-sighted investment in energy-delivery infrastructure.
As Washington state's oldest local energy company, with a 6,000-square-mile service area stretching across 10 Washington counties, primarily in the Puget Sound region, PSE serves 1.1 million electric customers and 790,000 natural gas customers.

      statements appear in a number of places in this Web site
      together with any documents issued by the company and available
      through this Web site and can be identified by the use of
      forward-looking terminology such as "believe," "expect,"
      "plans," "may," "will," "should," "anticipates" or similar
      statements or the negative thereof or other variations thereof.
      Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation,
      statements made as to future operation costs, capital
      expenditures, cash flow, improvements in infrastructure,
      distribution and replenishment systems and operating
      efficiencies, sales and earnings estimates or trends and
      expansion plans and projections. Such forward-looking
      statements are based on current expectations and by their
      nature involve known and unknown internal and external risks,
      uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual
      results, performance or achievements to be materially different
      from those expressed or implied. The information contained in
      the company's most recent annual reports to shareholders,
      including information included under the section captioned
      "Management's Discussion and Analysis," as well as other
      information included under the caption "Risk Factors" in other
      company filings with the Securities and Exchange
      Commission, identifies important factors that could cause such
      results, performance or achievements not to be realized. The
      company undertakes no obligation to update forward-looking
      statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date
      such statements were made.

      The information contained within press releases issued by the
      company should not be deemed accurate or current except as of
      the date the release was posted. The company has no intention
      of updating, and specifically disclaims any duty to update, the
      information in the press releases. To the extent any
      information therein is forward-looking, it is intended to fit
      within the safe harbor for forward-looking statements, and is
      subject to material risk.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Readers are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made in this report and in Puget Energy's and PSE's other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect Puget Energy's and PSE's business, prospects and results of operations.  Overview  Puget Energy is an energy services holding company and all of its operations are conducted through its subsidiary PSE, a regulated electric and natural gas utility company. PSE is the largest electric and natural gas utility in the state of Washington, primarily engaged in the business of electric transmission, distribution and generation and natural gas distribution. Puget Energy's business strategy is to generate stable cash flows by offering reliable electric and natural gas service in a cost-effective manner through PSE. All of Puget Energy's common stock is indirectly owned by Puget Holdings LLC (Puget Holdings). Puget Holdings is owned by a consortium of long-term infrastructure investors including Macquarie Infrastructure Partners I, Macquarie Infrastructure Partners II, Macquarie Capital Group Limited, FSS Infrastructure Trust, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the British Columbia Investment Management Corporation, and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation. Puget Energy and PSE are collectively referred to herein as "the Company." PSE generates revenue and cash flow primarily from the sale of electric and natural gas services to residential and commercial customers within a service territory covering approximately 6,000 square miles, principally in the Puget Sound region of the state of Washington. PSE continually balances its load requirements, generation resources, purchase power agreements, and market purchases to meet customer demand. The Company's external financing requirements principally reflect the cash needs of its construction program, its schedule of maturing debt and certain operational needs. PSE requires access to bank and capital markets to meet its financing needs.  Factors and Trends Affecting PSE's Performance The principal business, economic and other factors that affect PSE's operations and financial performance include:   PSE's ability to recover power costs that are included in rates which are based on volume;   PSE's ability to manage costs during the rate stay out period through January 17, 2017;   Weather conditions, including snow-pack affecting hydrological conditions;   Regulatory decisions allowing PSE to recover purchased power and fuel costs, on a timely basis;   PSE's ability to supply electricity and natural gas, either through company-owned generation, purchase power contracts or by procuring natural gas or electricity in wholesale markets;   Equal sharing between PSE and its customers of earnings which exceed PSE's authorized rate of return;   Availability and access to capital and the cost of capital;   Regulatory compliance costs, including those related to new and developing federal regulations of electric system reliability, state regulations of natural gas pipelines and federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations;   Wholesale commodity prices of electricity and natural gas;   Increasing depreciation and amortization;   Bonus depreciation and the impact on rate base;   General economic conditions in PSE's service territory and its effects on customer growth and use-per-customer; and   Federal, state, and local taxes.  Further detail regarding the factors and trends affecting performance of the Company during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 is set forth below in this "Overview" section as well as in other sections of the Management's Discussion and Analysis.  Regulation of PSE Rates and Recovery of PSE Costs PSE's regulatory requirements and operational needs require the investment of substantial capital in 2016 and future years. As PSE intends to seek recovery of these investments through the regulatory process, its financial results depend heavily upon favorable outcomes from that process. The rates that PSE is allowed to charge for its services influence its financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. PSE is highly regulated and the rates that it charges its retail customers are approved by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Washington Commission). The Washington Commission has traditionally required these rates be determined based, to a large extent, on historic test year costs plus weather normalized assumptions about hydroelectric conditions and power costs in the relevant rate year. Incremental customer growth and sales typically have not provided sufficient revenue to cover general cost increases over time due to the combined effects of regulatory lag and attrition. Accordingly, the Company will need to seek rate relief on a regular and frequent basis in the future. In addition, the Washington Commission determines whether the Company's expenses and capital investments are reasonable and prudent for the provision of cost effective, reliable and safe electric and natural gas service. If the Washington Commission determines that a capital investment does not meet the reasonable and prudent standards, the costs (including return on any resulting rate base) related to such capital investment may be disallowed, partially or entirely, and not recovered in rates.  2013 Expedited Rate Filing, Decoupling and Centralia Decision PSE filed a settlement agreement with the Washington Commission on March 22, 2013. The agreement was intended to settle all issues regarding decoupling, a power purchase agreement with TransAlta Centralia and the Expedited Rate Filing (ERF) which includes the property tax tracker. The Washington Commission placed the ERF and decoupling filings under a common procedural schedule. On June 25, 2013, the Washington Commission issued final orders resolving the amended decoupling petition, the ERF filing and the Petition for Reconsideration (related to the TransAlta Centralia power purchase agreement). Order No. 7 in the ERF/decoupling proceeding approved PSE's ERF filing with a small change to its cost of capital from 7.80% to 7.77% to update long term debt costs and a capital structure that included 48.0% common equity with a return on equity (ROE) of 9.8%. This order also approved the property tax tracker discussed below and approved the amended decoupling and rate plan filing with the further condition that PSE and the customers will share 50.0% each in earnings in excess of the 7.77% authorized rate of return. In addition, the rate plan (K-Factor) increase allowed decoupling revenue per customer for the recovery of delivery system costs to subsequently increase by 3.0% for the electric customers and 2.2% for the gas customers on January 1 of each year, until the conclusion of PSE's next General Rate Case (GRC) which was to be filed before April 1, 2016 and was later extended to January 17, 2017, as discussed below. In the rate plan, increases are subject to a cap of 3.0% of the total revenue for customers.  Decoupling Filings  General Rate Case Filing Postponed to 2017 On March 17, 2016, the Washington Commission approved a joint petition postponing the filing of PSE's GRC until no later than January 17, 2017. As part of the petition, PSE agreed to update power costs on December 1, 2016 in conjunction with the Centralia PPA compliance filing and to include a plan for Colstrip Units 1 and 2 shutdown in its GRC filing. Monthly allowed revenue per customer values, which include an automatic annual increase, will continue through December 2017 until new rates go into effect from PSE's 2017 GRC.  Electric Rates Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the recovery of power costs from customers or refunding of power cost savings to customers in the event those costs vary from the "power cost baseline" level of power costs. The "power cost baseline" level is set, in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydroelectric conditions. Excess power costs or power cost savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism. The graduated scale currently applicable is as follows: Annual Power Cost Variability Company's Share Customers' Share +/- $20 million 100% -% +/- $20 million - $40 million 50 50 +/- $40 million - $120 million 10 90 +/- $120 + million 5 95  On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving the settlement proposing changes to the PCA mechanism. The settlement agreement will not take effect until January 1, 2017. Key components of the settlement will include the following changes to the PCA mechanism:   Over Under Over Under +/- $17 million 100% 100% -% -% +/- $17 million - $40 million 35 50 65 50 +/- $40 + million 10 10 90 90   Reduction to the cumulative deferral trigger for surcharge or refund from $30.0 million to $20.0 million;   Removal of fixed production costs from the PCA mechanism and placing them in the decoupling mechanism, assuming the decoupling mechanism continues as part of the next GRC. If decoupling was not to continue, those fixed production costs would be treated the same as other non-PCA costs unless permission to treat them in another manner is obtained from the Washington Commission. These fixed production costs include: (i) return and depreciation/amortization on fixed production assets and regulatory assets and liabilities; (ii) return on, depreciation, transmission expense and revenues on specific transmission assets; and (iii) hydro, other production and other power related expenses and O&M costs;   Suspension of the requirement that a GRC must be filed within three months after rates are approved in a Power Cost Only Rate Case (PCORC), and agreeing, for a five-year period, that PSE will not file a GRC or PCORC within six months of the date rates go into effect for a PCORC filing; and   Establishment of a five-year moratorium on changes to the PCA/PCORC.  Pursuant to the PCA Settlement approved on August 7, 2015, effective January 1, 2017, PSE's fixed costs will no longer be tracked in PSE's PCA mechanism.  Property Tax Tracker Mechanism  Conservation Rider  PCORC Compliance Filing  Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff  Natural Gas Rates  Conservation Rider  Cost Recovery Mechanism  Property Tax Tracker Mechanism  Other Proceedings  As a result of mediation, on September 30, 2016, PSE and all parties filed a Prefiled Joint Testimony with the Washington Commission supporting a Settlement Stipulation. The Washington Commission approved the stipulation on October 31, 2016 allowing PSE's parent company, Puget Energy, to create a wholly-owned subsidiary, named Puget LNG, LLC (Puget LNG). Puget LNG will have the sole purpose of owning, developing and financing the non-regulated activity of the Tacoma LNG facility.  Other Factors and Trends  Customer Demand  Access to Debt Capital  Regulatory Compliance Costs and Expenditures PSE's operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations. These regulations cover electric system reliability, gas pipeline system safety and energy market transparency, among other areas. Environmental laws and regulations related to air and water quality, including climate change and endangered species protection, waste handling and disposal (including generation by-products such as coal ash), remediation of contamination and siting new facilities also impact the Company's operations. PSE must spend significant amounts to fulfill requirements set by regulatory agencies, many of which have greatly expanded mandates on measures including, but not limited to, resource planning, remediation, monitoring, pollution control equipment and emissions-related abatement and fees.  Other Challenges and Strategies  may lose a number of customers in its service territory. Further, PSE faces increasing competition for sales to its retail customers.
