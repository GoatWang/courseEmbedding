Paychex raises quarterly dividend by 9% to 50 cents a share
Payroll processing company Paychex Inc.  said Thursday it is raising its quarterly dividend by 9% to 50 cents a share. The new payout will be made Aug. 24 to shareholders of record as of Aug. 1. Shares were not yet active premarket but are down 6% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Paychex shares fall 3% after company offers below-consensus guidance
Shares of payroll services company Paychex Inc.  fell 3% Wednesday, after the company offered guidance for its next fiscal year that lagged estimates. Rochester, N.Y.-based Paychex said it had net income of $175.3 million, or 54 cents a share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, up from $178.1 million, or 49 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenue rose to $798.6 million from $753.9 million. The FactSet consensus was for EPS of 53 cents and revenue of $798 million. The company said it now expects total revenue to rise about 5% in fiscal 2018 and for adjusted EPS to rise by 7% to 8%. Current FactSet consensus numbers are for EPS growth of 8.2% and revenue growth of 6%. BMO Capital Markets analyst Jeffrey Silber said the guidance implies slowing growth, and would likely weigh on the stock price. "Adjusted EBITDA margin of 42.7% was much better than the consensus 40.5%, but in line with our 42.7% estimate," he wrote in a note. "The upside (we believe vs. consensus) was driven by leverage from both operating expense and SG&A expenses." Shares have fallen 6% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
