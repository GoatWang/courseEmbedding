Impax Generics
Our Generics Division
View website
Impax has developed a portfolio of generic pharmaceuticals through the internal filing of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) and through partnerships on alternative dosage form products. Our generic product development strategy is based on a combination of speed to filing and a legal strategy primarily predicated upon non-infringement of established brand name pharmaceuticals. We are focused on targeting high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form ANDAs that are difficult to develop and that bring sustainable profitability.
Global’s multi-source product line consists of a growing range of solid oral and alternative dosage form prescription pharmaceuticals, distributed primarily through drug wholesalers, distributors, warehousing chains and managed healthcare organizations.
The organization continues to invest in order to provide the highest level of research and development, manufacturing and customer service. Our quality assurance team works closely with our suppliers to ensure purity, consistency and quality of products, and we strive to bring value to our customers with innovative products in key therapeutic areas.
We have a dedicated team of experienced professionals handling customer orders and inquiries that work to not only meet the expectations of our customers, but consistently deliver beyond expectations. Every member of our team is committed to the success and profitability of our customers. We have set the highest standards for our products, services and people, and are proud of the organization we are building.
We develop, manufacture, sell and distribute generic pharmaceutical products primarily through three sales channels:

Product sales channel, for generic pharmaceutical prescription products we sell directly to wholesalers, large retail drug chains, mass merchandisers and mail-order pharmacies
Rx Partner sales channel, for generic prescription products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities pursuant to alliance agreements
OTC Partner sales channel, for sales of generic pharmaceutical OTC products sold through unrelated third-party pharmaceutical entities pursuant to alliance agreements.


Product Development Strategy
Our generic product development strategy is based on two opportunities we've identified in the generic pharmaceutical marketplace:

Controlled-Release Generic Products
Through our controlled-release drug delivery technologies and formulation skills we develop bioequivalent versions of selected brand name pharmaceuticals. Controlled-release pharmaceuticals generally have technically challenging drug delivery requirements. We employ our proprietary processes and formulation expertise to develop products that reproduce the brand name product’s physiological characteristics, but do not infringe upon the brand product’s patents.
Specialty Generic Products
Products that present one or more competitive barriers to entry, such as difficulty sourcing raw material, complex formulation or development characteristics, or special handling requirements.

Our Products
We currently manufacture and market 207 generic pharmaceutical products, which represent dosage variations of 72 different pharmaceutical compounds through our Generics Division; another five of our generic pharmaceutical products representing dosage variations of two different pharmaceutical compounds are marketed by our alliance agreement partners.
Our Pipeline
We currently have more than 20 Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDA) pending at the FDA. We are also working on a number of products in various stages of development for which applications have not yet been filed.

Our Two Corporate Divisions
We have two platforms that offer the right balance for future growth. Our vision is to target key areas of growth that reflect both our internal strengths, and a strong market, treatment or product need.

Our Generics Division
In the generic pharmaceuticals market, we utilize our core competency in drug delivery expertise and formulation development to target high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form (ADF) ANDAs that are difficult to develop and that bring sustainable profitability. This includes products with the potential for six months of exclusivity for being first-to-file or products that are difficult to develop. Externally, we are aggressively looking at Strategic Alliances and Collaboration Agreements, as well as opportunities to acquire products, technologies or companies with strategic value mainly in the alternative dosage area, such as injectables, creams and ointments, inhalers or patches.
Continue reading

Specialty Pharma Division
In the brand name pharmaceuticals market, we are focused on internally developing Central Nervous System (CNS) disorder products where we can deliver meaningful patient benefits and develop strong intellectual property positions. We believe the successful development of our brand business is critical to our future growth as brand products provide longer product life cycles with the potential for higher profits. Our strategic initiatives for growth include continuing our internal R&D focus on neurology by building a strong pipeline. In addition, we are searching for external growth opportunities through partnerships and M&A in CNS.

Research Areas
We have a dual strategic focus that stretches across our generic division and our branded division.
Our generic business strategy is focused on targeting high-value solid oral and alternative dosage form ANDAs that are difficult to develop and that bring sustainable profitability. We explore a broad range of therapeutic areas that have technically challenging drug delivery mechanisms or other niches, including products with the potential for six months of exclusivity for being first-to-file or first-to-market.

Growth Strategy
We are focused on adding to the growth our own innovations will bring with acquisitions of external growth opportunities. Our business development activities are focusing on technologies in new dosage forms, or products or companies where our core competency in creative technologies and methods can result in synergies from further technical innovation. These could be in either generic or proprietary opportunities complementary to our own creative efforts.

 A food puzzle for dogs! PAW5 Rockin' BowlThe PAW5 Rock 'N Bowl is a great way to turn meal time into an enriching and rewarding challenge for your dog!  What looks like a standard bowl is actually a unique puzzle feeder that will have your dog thinking, problem solving and having fun all at once. By adding environmental enrichment to mealtime, you turn a routine part of the day into a fun brainteaser.  Just pour food directly into the top (as easy as a normal bowl), the food runs through a hidden compartment, and your dog has to paw, nudge, and play her way through mealtime.

About Impact
For a full third of a century, since its founding in 1981, Impact Technologies Group, Inc. (Impact®) has been ahead of its time when it comes to making insurance agents, financial advisors – and, most important, their clients – financially successful at every key stage in their lives.  The key to Impact’s results is reflected in our management – seasoned experts from the financial services, legal and insurance industries, in government compliance, and in software technology, attested to by the multiple patents issued to us by the United States Patent and Trademark Office; as well as in our clients – who include many of the world’s leading financial services firms; and countless independent agents and advisors who trust the endorsements of these industry giants.
Today, as financial advisors move out from behind their desktops and their desks and into the field armed with iPads and smartphones, and as advisors’ clients become more independently educated – and skeptical, too – Impact delivers through its software tools and applications Technology For Wealth™ – the most advanced mobile applications and analytics to increase advisors’ closing rates while helping to maximize their clients’ wealth.  At Impact, Technology and Wealth go hand-in-hand, but neither exists solely for its own sake.
We always update our software analytics to support the latest compliance requirements and regulations, but our 360˚ software solutions go well beyond that, touching every point of the product provider-financial advisor-client value chain. Our presentations and reports are recognized for being tunable by target audience: easy-to-understand, direct and actionable.  This means that whether advisors have clients unfamiliar with financial planning lingo or skilled in using it themselves, our customers can generate a report that speaks directly to that precise level of sophistication, all with just a few mouse clicks or screen touches. Impact’s state-of-the-art software solutions, as exemplified by our iPad application for Social Security Explorer, embody modern sales psychology without sacrificing the rigor of compliance.






Management 







Howard L. Keziah
Founder, Chairman
An entrepreneurial visionary who is both a technology and an adrenaline enthusiast, Howard not only founded Impact in 1981 (his 16th business and 2nd technology company), but he has driven innovation throughout the entire financial services industry during his 33-year tenure at Impact. He was the first to advocate adding graphics to present life policy illustrations as well as the first to introduce the hand-held computer to the insurance industry as a whole.
Howard has dedicated his personal drive and passion to inventing and deploying positively disruptive technologies.  This is why every single Impact product has been ahead of its time and why today, the company is pioneering financial advisors’ needs for true 360˚ software solutions that enable advisors to address their clients’ needs at every life stage.







Heather Vaartjes, MCP, MCPS
President, Chief Operations Officer
How does Impact deliver 360˚ software solutions while competitors with more employees offer only point solutions? In a word – or, more properly, a name: Heather Vaartjes. Heather is Impact’s internal knowledge and business process wizard. It is safe to say that no one knows as much about the internal organizational workings and processes of Impact than Heather, who defines the term self-starter. Heather began her career in Direct Sales, and along the way, she held positions of Manager of Direct Sales and Technical Support, Corporate Sales Consultant, President of Maxcess Policy Illustration Division, Marketing Director, and Enterprise Project Manager. The combined wisdom and acquired hard-knocks experience led to her being named Impact’s Chief Operating Officer.
Whether the subject is software, internal IT, management or business process reengineering, Heather is at the forefront, ensuring that the organization runs smoothly and profitably to enable the swiftest, most innovative product development and releases.  Heather is a Microsoft Certified Professional and Microsoft CRM certified. She received a Certificate for Managing Technical Professionals & Organizations from MIT’s prestigious Sloan School of Business and, attesting to her dedication to quality, she also earned a Six Sigma Green Belt.







Gretchen K. Smith, CLU, ChFC
Vice President, Financial Engineering
When you make complex software for financial advisors and their clients as well as for some of the biggest financial services companies in the world, innovation, product design, smooth operations and compliance are not enough. You also need a bonafide financial and mathematical whiz – which is why Gretchen was the first employee Howard ever hired. The chief architect and lead for all of Impact’s calculation engines, Gretchen has been the algorithmic and programming backbone of Impact since its inception.  But her expertise only begins with mathematics: it continues into financial planning, where she holds both ChFC and CLU certificates.
Unsurprisingly, Gretchen has been the Chief Software Architect for Impact’s entire Wealth Planning Suite product line, as well the designer of Impact’s Estate Tax Analysis calculation engine for both DOS and Windows®. She was Team Leader of the Maxcess® Illustration System Development, Impact Needs, Classic Concepts and SalesLor sales tools. Most recently, she has been instrumental to the development and release of Impact’s premier platform: PlanLab®. Prior to working for Impact, Gretchen was a Research Assistant to the Vice President of Finance and Institutional Research at Francis Marion University in South Carolina. She earned her bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Winthrop University.
When it comes to the literal meaning of Technology For Wealth, no one embodies that spirit better and more fully than Gretchen, who is another one of Impact’s many United States Patent holders.  Gretchen is also an avid competitive bridge player.  She eagerly awaits acceptance of her standing invitations to Warren Buffett and Bill Gates.







Ken Leibow 
Senior Vice President 
Ken’s career spans more than 29 years with an extensive background in distribution technology and back office systems. He previously worked for Genworth Financial, Mutual of Omaha and VP of Operations at Diversified Underwriters Services, Inc. As COO of Integrated Insurance Technologies, Ken had built the largest life insurance data exchange hub in the industry processing over 1 million policies a year and 30 billion dollars of annuities. Innovation in Quoting & Illustration tools, CRMs, Agency Management Systems, eApp platforms, and ePolicy Delivery are some key initiatives implemented by Ken during his career.







Derek Sanderson
Chief Technology Officer
In today’s technology-driven world and technology-driven companies, it is impossible to succeed without a world-class CTO and resident networking geek. Fortunately, in Derek Sanderson, that is precisely what Impact has.  Derek, who has wired his home to operate like a remote-controlled spaceship, has done no less with Impact’s network.  Among his accomplishments: virtualizing Impact’s network of 100 physical servers to utilize cloud technologies, thereby cutting the number of physical servers to fewer than 10, all while improving performance, reliability and maintainability; migrating over 50 database-driven web applications to the private cloud to dramatically improve support, security and reliability to levels of over 99.99% uptime; and establishing partnerships with network consulting vendors and datacenters to optimize Impact’s IT operations and performance.
Prior to Impact, Derek created mobile iOS (Apple), Android, and web-based “Competition Dining” apps for professional chefs; was the Grand Prize winner in a national competition for Microsoft SharePoint and Office product development; created and deployed a Skype-driven messaging system that commanded Arduino devices for household purposes; and was the lead SharePoint developer on a school system-wide, 2-year-long, Business Intelligence project.

            UNC North Carolina Startups Directory        

Printable Version
At Carolina, the research, discoveries, and creative activity of our faculty and students translate into new businesses and jobs. Today over 150 UNC-CH startup companies call North Carolina home, providing jobs to nearly 8,000 state residents.
UNC startups are nurtured, incubated, and accelerated through departments and offices across the university, including the UNC Office of Technology Development, the Kenan Institute of Private Enterprise, the Kenan-Flagler Business School, the Chancellor’s Office of Innovation & Entrepreneurship, and the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences (NCTraCs) Institute.

 UNC Technology-Transfer Startups are businesses created by UNC faculty who license intellectual property created from their scientific discoveries and research.
 Independently Launched UNC Startups are new businesses created by faculty and students that arise directly or indirectly from their work and experience at Carolina.
 UNC-Assisted Startups are businesses created by UNC faculty, staff, and students who received direct institutional support through UNC business-plan competitions, entrepreneurship programs and courses, hands-on business mentoring, and incubators and accelerators for startup ventures.
