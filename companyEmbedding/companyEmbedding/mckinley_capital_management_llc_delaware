What are analysts saying about Sucampo Pharmaceuticals stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Sucampo Pharmaceuticals stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Sucampo is focused on expanding its sole marketed product, Amitiza’s label and penetrating into new markets. Moreover, the company’s collaborations with firms like Takeda and Mylan for the commercialization of Amitiza is a big positive. In addition, through the agreement with Cancer Prevention Pharmaceuticals, the company acquired an exclusive option to develop and commercialize its combination, CPP-1X/sulindac, in North America. Moreover, with acquisition of Vtesse, Sucampo added a late stage program in Niemann-Pick Disease type C1 to its pipeline. However, Sucampo’s dependence on Amitiza for growth is concerning. Also, some companies are trying to market and sell generic version of Amitiza. Any decline in Amitiza's sales will adversely impact the top-line. Moreover, it is no stranger to pipeline setbacks. The company has lowered its earnings guidance to incorporate the Vtesee acquisition." (7/4/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "Sucampo has acquired privately owned Vtesse Inc. and its lead orphan drug candidate for Niemann-Pick Type C1, VTS-270, for $170M in cash & the rest in stock: total of $200M. There is also a contingent earn-out (payments in the mid-single digit to double-digit royalties on global net sales) of the product at increasing net sales levels." (4/3/2017)
3. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Post the Q4 results and guidance we have revisited our assumptions and are making two changes to our model reflecting ' 1) likely Amitiza mandated price erosion in Japan and 2) our switch projections for the alternative formulation of Amitiza. We also fine-tune our FY17 revs and EPS estimates. We continue to view potential business development/M&A as critical to the longer term outlook given the finite life of Amitiza and await mgt's plans." (3/17/2017)
4. Mizuho analysts commented, "We reiterate our Buy rating and $16 PT into the 4Q:16 print on March 8. The near-term Amitiza outlook remains favorable in both the U.S. and Japanese markets, which we believe may support additional optionality for the company in front of its 2021 patent cliff."

Did you know?

Some companies sell their services as a package and offer what seems to be an irresistible price, but later they attach fees they did not initially disclose or explain.
By not fully revealing the true nature of their fees, the actual cost of their services adds up quickly and you wind up paying much more than you expected, or wanted, to pay.
Learn  how other business  formation companies  hide their fees.
At Harvard Business Services, Inc., you can rest assured there are no hidden fees. We do not conceal the additional costs you will discover with other business formation companies.



My Promise to you

If you form your Delaware Company through Harvard Business Services you will experience the fastest and friendliest way to start your business that you can imagine. We're special- ists in just this ONE thing, and we take pride in our desire and ability to do it BETTER than anyone out there.

How Do I Pay My Franchise Tax?
What Is Delaware Franchise Tax?
When Is It Due?
How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?




What Is Delaware Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax is the fee imposed by the state of Delaware for the right or privilege to own a Delaware company. The tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of Delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company.
 
The term "Franchise Tax" does not imply that your company is a franchise business. 



When Is It Due?
The due date of your tax varies, depending on your company type.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is due by March 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before March 1, the state imposes a $125 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware LLC is due by June 1 of every year. The limited partnership (LP) Franchise Tax is also due by June 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before June 1, the state imposes a $200 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
Corporations, LLCs and LPs are taxed in arrears, meaning the tax due by each due date is for the previous calendar year.



How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware limited liability company (LLC) or Delaware limited partnership (LP) is a flat annual rate of $300 as of July 1, 2014.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is a little more complicated. It is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has. The total cost of the Franchise Tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due.
 
A non-stock/non-profit company is considered exempt with the state of Delaware. This type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee. The annual report fee is $25 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,000 authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax is $175 as of July 1, 2014, for a total of $225 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,001 authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax would be somewhere between $200 and $180,000 per year.
 
There are two methods to calculate a maximum stock company's Franchise Tax. They are:


The Authorized Shares Method
 
The state of Delaware uses this method to initially calculate your taxes. This method is calculated based on the number of authorized shares. The calculation is as follows:

5,000 shares or less: $175 (as of July 1, 2014)
5,001 - 10,000 shares: $250 (as of July 1, 2014)
Additional 10,000 shares or portion thereof: add $75
The maximum annual tax is $180,000

 
Don't forget to add the $50 annual report fee to the Franchise Tax after it is calculated.
 


The Assumed Par Value Capital Method
The state of Delaware allows you to pay the lower of the two calculation methods. Therefore, if you receive a bill from Delaware for tens of thousands of dollars, it may be in your best interest to try calculating your Franchise Tax with the assumed par value capital method.
 
In order to utilize this filing method, you will need to provide the company's total gross assets (as reported on the Form 1120, Schedule L) and the total number of issued shares. Many times the tax is then calculated to the minimum payment of $350 Franchise Tax plus the $50 annual report fee.
 
The calculation used for this method is more complex. Please contact our office if you would like a copy of the calculation emailed to you. We will be happy to help you with this calculation.



How Do I Pay My Franchise Tax?
We make it easy to pay your Franchise Tax online.
 
As your Registered Agent,we will send you tax reminders both by mail and email, well in advance of the due date. We offer a tax filing service for a small fee of $49 plus your Franchise Tax. We also offer an online discounted filing fee that ranges from $29 to $59, depending on when the online payment is submitted.
 
Payments can be submitted via our online Franchise Tax payment form.
 
You can also email or fax (302- 645-1280) us your LLC/LP Franchise Tax worksheet or your corporation Franchise Tax worksheet. If you would like to make your payment by phone, call us at 800-345-2677, Ext. 6904.
 
 
 




 
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Yes. Corporations must complete an annual report along with their Franchise Tax payment. This report must list the company's physical address (not a P.O. box and not your Registered Agent's address); the name and physical address of at least one director; and, if there are any officers, the name, title and physical address of one of the officers.
 
If the tax is being calculated with the assumed par value capital method, the gross assets and issued shares are also to be listed. If you decide to pay your Delaware Franchise Tax for a corporation with us over the phone, the annual report would then need to be separately submitted to us by email, fax or mail.



Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
The Delaware Franchise Tax and the Registered Agent Fee are two separate, unrelated fees. The annual Franchise Tax is imposed by the state of Delaware. The annual Registered Agent Fee is paid to Harvard Business Services, Inc. to act as an agent for your entity in the state .
 
Our annual Registered Agent Fee is $50 per year, and is due on the anniversary month of the formation of your company.  It is the lowest Registered Agent fee in the industry, and it is guaranteed to remain fixed at $50 per year, as long as the fee is paid on time and your company remains in good standing with the state of Delaware.
 
Learn more about the Delaware Franchise Tax in this short video:
 




 
What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?
After paying Franchise Tax, many business owners require a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing.
 
A Certificate of Good Standing is a document sent directly from the Delaware Secretary of State certifying the date the company was formed in the state of Delaware, that the company is current with all Delaware taxes and that the company is in good standing.
 
This is not the same as your annual report and will not mention internal company information, such as director or officer details.
 
We can assist you in obtaining this document. To purchase a Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Good Standing order page.
 
If you have any additional questions or concerns about the Delaware Franchise Tax, please feel free to call 1-800-345-2677, Ext. 6904 or email us.

Delaware Certificate of Good Standing

Order Your Certificate Now 
The Delaware Certificate of Good Standing is also known as a Certificate of Existence.
 
It is a letter provided by the Delaware Secretary of State that declares that a company is in good standing with the state. It specifically lists the incorporation date, good standing status for a corporation or LLC and whether taxes are current for a corporation or LLC.
 
 Order Your Certificate Now  
(If you already know you need to order a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Delaware Certificate of Good Standing order page. If you'd like to learn more, read on.)
 
Typically, a Certificate of Good Standing is required in order to open a corporate bank account, purchase or sell real estate, obtain a loan, obtain a Certificate of Authority to operate in another state, merge with another company and more.
 
Since the certified document verifies that a company is in good standing on the date it was issued, authorities will generally accept it as proof that the business is valid for 30-60 days after the issue date. Beyond 60 days, however, a new Certificate of Good Standing may need to be ordered.
 
Please click the buttons below to view a sample of a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing—with and without an Apostille.
 

 

Due to the time sensitivity of the Certificate, it is better to order one when you know you'll need it. If you are in a hurry, we can obtain a Certificate for you in two hours if necessary.
 
This certificate can be issued only for companies in good standing with the state of Delaware. If your company owes Delaware Franchise Taxes, they must be paid in full before we can order your Certificate of Good Standing.
 
You may email customer support, call 1-800-345-2677 or live chat with a specialist to determine if your company owes a tax balance.
 
To order a Certificate of Good Standing for your corporation or LLC, please view our pricing options, which start at $99, and then click on the yellow button below:

Form an LLC in Delaware.

$49 + State Fee & 1st Year FREE Registered Agent
Start My LLC













Start Your Delaware LLC in 3 Simple Steps
The state of Delaware is home to half of all public and Fortune 500 companies, but that doesn’t mean that small businesses miss out on all its big benefits. As the most popular business entity, the LLC offers Delaware-based owners many tax advantages and asset protections in a state heralded for its strong case law. First, however, it’s vital to know the legal side of getting your business off the ground. Here’s how to form an LLC in the Diamond State.


Step One: Choosing Your LLC’s Name
The first step in starting a new LLC in Delaware is to choose a name. Your new Delaware LLC’s name must be sufficiently different for people to tell it apart from other business entities already on file (registered and reserved) with the state of Delaware. Is the name you want available? You can do a name search at the Delaware Division of Corporations.
The LLC’s name must include at its end “Limited Liability Company,” “L.L.C.,” or “LLC.”
The LLC name is allowed, however, to contain the name of a member or manager, as well as one of the following terms: “Company,” “Association,” “Club,” “Foundation,” “Fund,” “Institute,” “Society,” “Union,” “Syndicate,” “Limited,” or “Trust” (or abbreviations of the same).

Step Two: Creating Your Articles of Organization

After your Delaware LLC is named, you must write your articles of organization and file a certificate of formation with the Delaware Secretary of State, along with a $90 filing fee. Incfile canprovide these services for you.

The certificate must be executed (signed) by one or more authorized persons as laid out in the LLC operating agreement. Organizers may be either natural persons or legal entities, and there must be at least one organizer.
The certificate of formation for your new Delaware LLC must include the following information:

The LLC’s name.
The name and street address of the LLC’s resident agent. See below for Delaware’s rules for registered agents.
The duration of the LLC, either perpetual or for a set amount of time.

The certificate may also include other items that the members wish to include (as long as they don’t conflict with state law), even if they are also included in the operating agreement.
Delaware Registered Agent Rules
All Delaware LLCs are required to have a registered in-state agent. This agent is the person or office designated to receive official state correspondence, including notice if the LLC is served with a lawsuit. A registered agent in Delaware may be an individual state resident; a domestic corporation, limited partnership, LLC, or statutory trust; or a foreign corporation, limited partnership, or LLC authorized to do business in the State of Delaware.
The registered office may be (but is not required to be) the LLC’s place of business. The registered agent must have a business office identical to the registered office, which should generally be open during normal business hours.
Incfile offers registered agent service for your Delaware LLC, if needed.
Your LLC is officially “organized” once the signed original of the certificate of formation is received by the Secretary of State’s office, and is determined to be in compliance with state requirements.
Step three: Writing Your Operating Agreement
Almost as critical for the LLC as the certificate of formation and articles of incorporation is the operating agreement. There isn’t an official state requirement to have an operating agreement, but it’s a vital internal document that specifies how your LLC will operate on both the day-to-day and strategic levels. If there is more than one member, the operating agreement must initially be approved unanimously in writing by the members.
The operating agreement should list:

The LLC’s members (see below for how membership works).
Specify how much each member has invested.
Explain how profits will be divided.
State how much proportional “weight” each member has when issues are voted upon. Unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement say otherwise, voting power in a member-managed LLC is vested in each member according to his or her current capital account balance with the LLC.
The operating agreement may also set forth meeting requirements such as the amount of required notice, what constitutes a quorum, voting rules, and so on, but they are not necessary.
Most operating agreement list requirements for the LLC that are already listed in Delaware state law and regulations. It can also include such items as restrictions or constraints on the power of the members to adopt, amend, or repeal the operating agreement.

Unless the certificate of formation or the operating agreement itself state otherwise, unanimous consent of the LLC’s membership is required to amend the operating agreement.
How Membership Works in a Delaware LLC
An LLC is required to have at least one member. Members may become a member of or acquire an interest in the LLC when it is first started, or when the new member’s admission is recorded in the LLC’s records.
To join the LLC, the prospective member usually needs to make some kind of contribution — for example, pay cash or transfer property to the LLC — or undertake a binding obligation to do so.
A member can only resign from the LLC in a manner allowed by the certificate of formation and/or the operating agreement. One or both of these documents will also usually state the minimum amount of time a member can maintain membership before being allowed to resign.
When a member resigns, he or she is entitled to receive the fair value of the membership interest within a reasonable time after the resignation (unless, of course, either the certificate of formation or operating agreement specify otherwise).
If the resignation or withdrawal of a member violates the provisions in the operating agreement, then the amount payable to the former member is the fair market value of his interest reduced by the amount of damages sustained by the LLC or its other members as a result of the violation. In this case, the LLC may also defer the payment for as long as needed to prevent unreasonable hardship to the organization.
Delaware’s Ongoing Requirements and Taxes
Compared to many other states, Delaware has minimal reporting and disclosure requirements for LLCs, and most of those come in the form of taxes and fees.
All LLCs and corporations formed in the State of Delaware are required to file an annual report and to pay a flat annual franchise tax for a total cost of $300. The annual report filing fee is $25. Taxes and annual reports are to be received by March 1st of each year. The minimum tax is $75, with a maximum tax of $165,000. The filing due date for an LLC is June 1, and corporations are due March 1. Franchise tax fees vary based on entity type.
When you use Incfile services, we send you reminder emails at the approach of each ongoing requirement due date.
Dissolution of an LLC in Delaware
An LLC is dissolved when any one of the following events occurs:

Event(s) specified in the certificate of formation or operating agreement.
A unanimous member vote to dissolve (unless a certain percentage or proportion is stated in the certificate of formation or operating agreement).
An event that makes it unlawful for the LLC to continue.
The LLC’s duration as specified in the certificate of formation or the operating agreement expires (if the LLC is not perpetual).
A court order ordering dissolution.

If the sole remaining member of the LLC resigns or withdraws, the Delaware LLC will automatically dissolve. This dissolution may be prevented if, within 90 days, the personal representative of the last member agrees to continue the LLC. The representative must also consent to serve as an LLC member or appoint another person in his or her place.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.
