Whetsell will join Loews Hotels as President and Chief Executive Officer effective January 17.  He succeeds Jack Adler, who is retiring from the company. 
(Photo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20120103/NY28272) Whetsell, who holds a Bachelor of Arts from Davidson College, has more than 35 years of experience in the hospitality industry.  Most recently he served as a member of the Board of Directors of Virgin Hotels, providing strategic guidance in its operations and property acquisition activities.  In 1987 he founded the original CapStar Hotel Company, which became one of the industry's largest owners with over 110 hotels and $3 billion in assets.  In 1998, CapStar was divided into Meristar Hospitality Corporation and Meristar Hotels and Resorts, which became Interstate Hotels & Resorts in 2002.  Mr. Whetsell served as Chairman and CEO of Meristar Hospitality Corporation until the company was sold in 2006.  He served as Chairman and CEO of Interstate Hotels & Resorts until 2003, remaining Chairman until 2009. 
"With Paul's tenure and experience in the industry, and now in his role as our new President and CEO, we will continue to operate the unique properties in our portfolio, while also looking for additions to the company through acquisition, development and management," said Tisch.  
"I am extremely excited to be joining Jon and the Loews Hotels team.  Loews has a long tradition of owning and operating high quality hotels and delivering great guest experiences," said Whetsell.  "Working in partnership with Jon, our objective is to further develop and grow the brand while delivering superior financial operating results."

Enjoyment that waits for no one.       Corporate Officers    Jonathan M. Tisch Chairman and CEO     Matthew Brenner Chief Financial Officer     John Cottrill Chief Operating Officer     Greg O'Stean Chief Investment Officer        Jonathan M. Tisch, Chairman and CEO Jonathan M. Tisch is Co-Chairman of the Board and a member of the Office of the President of Loews Corporation, one of the largest diversified financial holding companies in the U.S., and is also the Chairman and CEO  of its subsidiary, Loews Hotels & Resorts. As Chairman & CEO of Loews Hotels, Tisch engineered the company's expansion and emergence as a leading luxury hotel brand by infusing the properties with a widely praised corporate culture that places a high value on partnerships that empower employees, satisfy customers, contribute to communities, and improve the bottom line. Tisch initiated the Loews Hotels Good Neighbor Policy over 20 years ago, the first of its kind in the hospitality industry. Today, the Good Neighbor program underscores his enduring commitment to good corporate citizenship, social responsibility, and the health of our environment and communities. The Loews Good Neighbor Policy is a recipient of the U.S. President’s Service Award. Believing you can do well and do good at the same time, Tisch is a champion of corporate responsibility and has devoted a lifetime to active citizenship—an idea that uses the power of partnerships and grassroots participation to solve seemingly intractable problems. The author of three bestselling books, Tisch has written extensively about his leadership philosophy, the customer experience and civic engagement. They are The Power of We: Succeeding Through Partnerships; Chocolates on the Pillow Aren’t Enough: Reinventing the Customer Experience; and Citizen You: Doing Your Part to Change the World. Tisch is also the host of the Emmy-nominated television series, Beyond the Boardroom with Jonathan Tisch, where he speaks with some of America's preeminent CEOs and business luminaries in one-on-one interviews. Viewers discover that business is about more than just numbers, rather, it's the successful combination of people, hard work, guts and imagination. Widely recognized as a passionate advocate on behalf of the multi-billion dollar travel and tourism industry, Tisch works tirelessly to educate elected officials and the public at large about the industry’s significant economic, social, and diplomatic contributions. He founded and served as Chairman of the Travel Business Roundtable until 2008, and now serves as Chairman Emeritus of its successor organization, the United States Travel Association, the national non-profit association representing all segments of the travel industry. He is committed to a vibrant tourism industry in New York City, where for nearly six years he served as Chairman of NYC & Company, the city’s official tourism marketing agency and convention and visitors bureau. Concurrent with his national efforts to help stimulate travel and tourism in the aftermath of September 11th, Tisch served as Chairman of New York Rising, a task force committed to reviving tourism and the economy in New York City. In recognition for his leadership and civic involvement, Crain’s New York Business named Tisch one of the “Top Ten Most Influential Business Leaders” and was named “CEO of the Year” by the Executive Council of New York in 2006. Tisch also served as the Vice-Chairman of The Welfare to Work Partnership, and currently serves on the Board of Trustees for Tufts University, where he is also the naming benefactor of the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Citizenship and Public Service. He is also on the Board of the Tribeca Film Institute. Tisch is a co-owner and a member of the Board of Directors of the New York Football Giants and the team’s Treasurer. Tisch was instrumental in bringing Super Bowl XLVIII to the metropolitan area and was a co-chair of the 2014 NY/NJ Super Bowl Host Committee.    Matthew Brenner, Chief Financial Officer Matthew Brenner is Chief Financial Officer for Loews Hotels & Co.  Brenner oversees all aspects of finance, accounting, reporting, strategic planning, risk management and IT for the Company. He also has oversight of the Company’s financial shared services center located in Nashville, Tennessee.  Brenner joined Loews Hotels in 2014 as Senior Vice President and Corporate Controller, where he quickly made strong and positive impacts by enhancing stakeholder relationships and developing the multi-year strategy for the company.  Prior to joining Loews Hotels, he spent more than 13 years working for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in both the Chicago and New York offices, in a variety of senior leadership positions. Brenner’s last role with PwC was as a member of the company’s investment management and real estate practices. Previously he also worked within the Accounting Services Group and the SEC Group.  He is a graduate of the University of Illinois, where he also received a master’s degree in accounting. Brenner resides in New Jersey with his wife, Natalie and two children.    John Cottrill, Chief Operating Officer In his role as Chief Operating Officer at Loews Hotels & Resorts, John Cottrill oversees the day-to-day operations of 20 hotels throughout the U.S. and Canada. He returned to the industry he is passionate about after serving as the Executive Vice President of Operations at Brooks Brothers, where he was recruited to develop a hospitality atmosphere within the traditional retail environment. Cottrill started his career in 1978 with Hyatt Hotels before accepting a job with Ritz-Carlton in 1983, where he eventually progressed to a general manager role. He remained in this position until 1996 before joining Westin Hotels & Resorts. In 2000, he returned to Ritz-Carlton, once again as a General Manager, before becoming a Senior Vice President. Cottrill held this role in Product and Brand Management and additionally in the Club and Residence Operations. Cottrill holds a degree in hotel administration from the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.    Greg O'Stean, Chief Investment Officer Greg O’Stean brings nearly three decades of leadership experience in commercial real estate, including hotel development and acquisitions.   As Chief Investment Officer, his role is to understand, manage and monitor the company’s portfolio of assets, devise strategies for capital and growth, act as the liaison with investors and recognize and manage risk.
