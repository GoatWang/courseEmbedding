Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior 












Expertise: Evolutionary quantitative genetics, Plant population biology


Ph.D., Duke University, 1983Graduate Faculty MembershipsApplied Plant Sciences; Conservation Biology; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior; Plant Biological Sciencesgo to research websiteStatementIt has been known for about 40 years that natural populations harbor considerable genetic variability. However, understanding of the processes that generate and maintain genetic variation has been limited. Moreover, the evolutionary consequences of this variation has been understood mainly in general terms. To address these fundamental issues in evolutionary genetics, I employ quantitative genetic approaches in studies of natural and experimentally generated plant populations. Currently, my focus is on the evolutionary consequences of severe and abrupt framentation of prairie plant populations of Echinacea angustifolia. In the course of this research, I have participated in development of a new statistical approach for analysis of life history data to obtain estimates of fitness, fitness surfaces and population growth rates (http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/aster/). Beyond this, graduate students I have recently advised have assessed the potential of native plants to adapt to ongoing climate change, the evolutionary consequences of gene flow from a crop to its wild relatives, and evolutionary change in introduced species. In support of these and related projects, I have worked on statistical problems in quantitative genetics. This has led to development of Quercus, a collection of computer programs for analysis of quantitative genetic experiments. I actively participate in the University's Center for Community Genetics, a group of graduate students, postdocs and faculty with mutual interests in the interplay of ecology and genetics in the evolution of interacting species.Selected PublicationsKittelson,P.M., S.

Welcome to Ruth G. Shaw’s Research Group in the Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior at the University of Minnesota! 

We study evolutionary processes in contemporary plant populations. A central goal of our research is to clarify the dynamics of evolutionary change in nature, using a combination of quantitative genetics, population biology, and field experiments. Recurring and ongoing themes of our research include adaptation to climate change and evolutionary consequences of severe fragmentation of populations. Explore this site further for descriptions of our current work.

Ruth G. Shaw 
to service and learning. This greenway extends from Mallard Creek Greenway to University City Boulevard (NC Hwy 49), completing an important connection to and through the UNC Charlotte campus. The addition of Toby Creek Greenway to the Clarks-Mallard Greenway system provides a total of 9 miles of greenway connectivity.  A greenway connector trail has also been provided from Toby Creek Greenway to North Tryon Street through the campus woods of the Preserve.  This connector allows greenway users to reach additional retail and dining opportunities.  Active transportation commuters can be seen continuously biking and walking their way across campus.Directions:This greenway crosses UNC Charlotte campus and connects to Mallard Creek Greenway. -I-85 to Exit 45 (WT Harris Blvd) -Take WT Harris West to Mallard Creek Rd -Turn Right on Mallard Creek Rd -Follow Mallard Creek Rd until you see Mallard Creek Elementary School on Left. Parking allowed at the school in lots closest to streetParking:210 East Mallard Creek Church Road Charlotte, NC 28262 (Kirk Farm Fields)Click here for Google MapsLength: 1.60 milesNearby Amenities:UNC Charlotte CampusNature Facts:The greenway winds through a floodplain forest, under a canopy of mature Sugarberry, Box Elder, Tulip Poplar and Sycamore trees.  Many species of butterflies can be observed here including azures, mourning cloaks, question marks, tiger swallowtails, and zebra swallowtails.  Watch for groups of tiger swallowtails “puddling” together in wet spots and zebra swallowtails in the occasional patches of papaw, the “host plant” they require to lay their eggs.   Squirrels are abundant and raccoon can be found on the edge of the creek in the mud and sand.  Quiet observers will possibly catch a glimpse of coyotes as they make their way along the forested corridor in the early mornings and evenings.Toby Creek Greenway – Phase 2 Proposed Features: Proposed Paved Greenway = 1 mile This project is a partnership with NCDOT, City of Charlotte and the Carolina Thread Trail Overview: Toby Creek Greenway – Phase 2 will extend the existing Toby Creek Greenway that runs through UNCC Campus by another mile. This new section of greenway will parallel University City Blvd under Harris Blvd as an overland connector. The greenway will then traverse under Chancellor Park Drive and along Toby Creek through a variety of vegetated areas, wildlife, steep terrain and rock formations at the creek banks. The South Newell Neighborhood Improvements Project will provide a wide sidewalk to serve as a multi-use trail connector to Autumnwood Lane. This greenway extension project will provide pedestrian and bicycle connectivity for the adjacent residential communities to Towne Centre Plaza, UNCC, University Place and the Mallard Creek Greenway. Public parking will be available at Kirk Farm Fields on Mallard Creek Church Road part of the Mallard Creek Greenway for access to this new portion of greenway.
