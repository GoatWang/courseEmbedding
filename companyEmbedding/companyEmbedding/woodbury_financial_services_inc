Built for Flexibility
Woodbury Financial combines strength, service and support to help ensure that advisors are well-positioned to meet the needs of their clients while building long-term, sustainable practices. And we do it your way.






Advisors First | High-Powered Resources | Common Sense Support | Transition Services




Advisors First
Woodbury Financial takes the concept of broker-dealer support to another dimension. We do this both through our approach to the advisors we serve and the resources we bring to the table. For nearly 50 years, this has proven to be our formula for success.
Support in the Trenches
It begins with a unique three-dimensional system that includes local field leaders, a regionalized support team, and elite service for top producers that is unmatched in the industry. By providing proactive and comprehensive sales support, we’ve helped advisors realize their vision of business growth.
We do this through our RVP support network by having boots on the ground right where you live and operate. We get to personally know you and your practice in order to help you partner with industry resources, develop business contacts, and forge strategic alliances. This includes ongoing regional training and networking opportunities and practice development strategies that can help increase your revenue stream.
Unique Access and Resources
Woodbury also provides you with internal sales support through the Sales Desk and the Advanced Sales and Qualified Plans team. This two-tiered structure provides you with solution-driven, product-agnostic resources to rely on for assistance across the spectrum—from simple product recommendations to intricate case design.
Together, this group includes ten experienced professionals who average more than 20 years of experience in the financial services industry.
Proactive, Priority Service
Top producers also receive support and resources through our Elite program. This includes proactive, priority service through dedicated consultants and unique access to customized resources, training, administrative support, business-tracking, and managed accounts information.
The bottom line is that we put our advisors first with real people delivering real solutions. If you are considering a change, put Woodbury on your short list. We are committed to providing a better way.



Advisor Group means QUALITY. And this is exactly what quality means to us.
Ready to Talk?



High-Powered Resources
If you are considering making a change from your current broker-dealer, then we invite you to take a closer look at Woodbury. We offer a unique blend of high-powered resources and middle-American sensibilities that just feels right for many financial advisors who are committed to building and protecting the futures of their clients.
Independence We pride ourselves on listening closely to ensure that being independent doesn’t mean being alone. Our advisors are not tied to restrictive contracts and they control their own destinies as we provide the resources.
Home Office OSJ Our unique supervision model eliminates the requirement for our advisors to be an OSJ. We also allow them to recruit individuals to their firm and earn an override without having to perform the duties of a supervisor.
Insurance Services We take great pride in our unique expertise in insurance and retirement planning services. A distinct strength of Woodbury Financial, we deliver case-by-case support to help grow your practice while giving you the edge on the competition. We are industry leaders in this sector.
Regional Sales Support We provide Regional Vice Presidents who work closely with advisors from the time they consider joining us and then throughout their careers. Their job is to bring the entire resources of the firm to the advisor to help them achieve their goals.
Payout & Compensation We offer competitive payouts with a simple grid structure that allows our advisors to maximize their compensation. In addition, top producers are eligible for membership in our exclusive Eagle’s Circle rewards and recognition program.
Investment Advisory Platform Our fee-based platform is powered by Envestnet. This integrated, web-based approach features third-party strategist portfolios as well as an option for advisor-managed portfolios, SMAs and UMAs. It’s also perfectly synced with our complete online services suite.
Award-Winning Technology Access our Advisor Portal which is a dynamic, integrated online system that is fully customized with our advisors’ individual preferences and needs in mind, including a CRM solution, e-forms library and digital form capabilities.
Succession Planning When it’s time for you to retire or move on, Woodbury’s expert team helps you protect what you’ve worked hard to build, maximize its value, and prepare to leave your business and clients in good hands. These are real, dollar-based options that can assist you in planning your own future after a lifetime of doing that for others.



Advisor Group means SUPPORT. And this is exactly what support means to us.
Ready to Talk?



Common Sense Support
We pride ourselves in bringing Midwestern sensibilities to our approach of helping you help your clients. We think common sense goes a long way in this industry and the advisors that choose us know that we think like they do.
To that end, in addition to competitive payouts, we offer a full range of support and solutions. And because your workday doesn’t necessarily end when the sun goes down, we offer extended hours with live and experienced telephone customer service.
Extensive Resources
Woodbury features an extensive list of services and systems that are designed to help you in your daily operations. We partner with you to maximize the strengths of your practice and assume the responsibilities you want us to in order for you to spend more time building your practice. Among other more specific resources, we deliver:

Coaching programs designed for immediate impact that give you the tools you need to significantly grow your business
Training for your entire team on our advanced technology solutions that simplify the “business side” and strengthen the “client side”
A liberating open architecture approach that maximizes your flexibility and supports the way you want to do business
Specialized business conferences to advance your knowledge and create supportive networks among advisors
Customizable, client-approved advertising and marketing materials
A relevant and robust library of financial services content that is updated daily
Case-specific consultation to locate and present optimal investments for any client and any situation
An Online Registration Center to help on-board new advisors easily and efficiently to your office
Leveraged buying power on software and services with pre-arranged discounts
A focus on “your voice” through advisor-led committees that offer early input on important issues

Develop a customized business plan with your Regional VP that can you significantly grow your practice
An Office Automation Suite that allows you and your staff to effortlessly streamline your office functions to become more efficient and profitable
Our teams provide suggested product-independent solutions—from simple comparisons and recommendations to intricate and complex case design




Advisor Group means POWER. And this is exactly what power means to us.

Transition Services
When you’ve reviewed all of the facts and made the decision to join Woodbury Financial, we will do everything possible to ensure a seamless transition. Throughout the years, we’ve helped thousands of advisors like you successfully make this all-important change and, although it requires careful attention, it is easily accomplished.
To begin with, you’ll have the services of a team of transition professionals, including a dedicated transition liaison. These experts will work closely with you to thoroughly plan your transition process according to your unique requirements and needs and then will guide you through it every step of the way.
Four Easy Steps
Through our exclusive approach to onboarding, the experience is neither daunting nor time-consuming. In just four steps, you can easily transition your practice into Woodbury Financial. In short, the process is as easy as this:
Step 1: Talk After some introductory conversations, we will start gathering information to make for a smooth transition. Our team will get to know your business and, through our online pre-registration forms, will determine how best to supervise and transition your business.
Step 2: Track Together we will create a customized game plan for your transition, give you a link for forms and registration, and provide you with dedicated assistance.
Step 3: Transition Our transition team will help move your book of business while providing training on key website tools and systems. Based on your GDC level, a liaison will also simultaneously submit your advertising pieces for initial review and input.
Step 4: Takeoff! In the final stage, our transition team reviews any outstanding issues and accounts not yet transferred. You will then be introduced to our service group that will be available for ongoing support and assistance.
Individual Office Support
Woodbury has even simplified the process for affiliation by allowing you to complete the majority of your paperwork online, saving you time, and sparing you frustration. Through our Online Registration Center, incoming advisors create a personalized profile and complete the necessary forms on their own schedule because it’s designed to save progress and return at any time. Instant feedback is available throughout the process to ensure that you have our full support.



Advisor Group means STRENGTH. And this is exactly what strength means to us.

Stability







Unconditionally Committed to Advisors for Over 45 Years
Since our early days as a firm in 1968, we have been unconditionally committed to strengthening and supporting the advisors we serve. In fact, it’s an uncommon commitment. To ensure that you have what you need to succeed in today’s environment, we do something radical in the industry—we listen. Your input tells us what needs to be done and then we go out and do it. Our advisors help shape Woodbury and we are the better for it.
Perhaps that’s why more than 1,200 advisors are pleased to call Woodbury home. Together they represent $29 billion in total client assets with an average annual GDC of $226,000. And with a tenure of 8.5 years and a 97% retention rate on average, we know that when advisors choose us they tend to stay for a long time. That not only makes us proud, it makes us work harder on their behalf.

When an advisor decides to choose Woodbury as their broker-dealer, we find they want to stay—8.5 years on average in fact and often to the end of their career.

Top producers—and ours average over $226,000 in annual GDC—like what they’ve found with us because we deliver the tools, support and stability they are seeking.



You Are in Total Control with Flexibility, Tools and Options
We want you to do business your way. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place and the bottom line is that only you know the best way to manage it. And that’s why Woodbury puts advisors like you in control by delivering flexibility to run their business the way they want with affiliation options designed around you, not us. We simply come alongside to strengthen what you’ve already built.
Your ability to excel in your practice is also tied to having the right tools to get the job done. That’s why Woodbury is dedicated to developing the programs, systems, advanced technology, and products necessary for success. These include a suite of solutions for business planning, streamlined offices, portfolio management, and a wide range of powerful resources integrated into one dynamic resource center.

First-Class Support
Woodbury Financial has made an art of listening to advisors in order to deliver the first-class support that top producers require. Our teams come alongside you to help ensure that you can deliver the service your clients expect.






Personal Attention | Open Architecture | Sales Support | Pro-Business Compliance




Personal Attention
We are confident that the advisors we serve enjoy the best of both worlds—big-firm resources with small-firm attention. As a member of Advisor Group, one of the largest truly independent broker-dealer networks in the industry, we have the tools you need to excel in today’s business environment. Importantly, we also deliver hands-on, customized service.
And it starts at the top. Every member of our senior management team has decades of experience in the industry and promotes an open door policy. When you need to talk to anyone about any issue, you have the complete assurance you will be heard.
We Listen and Respond
But we go further than that. We also have a number of advisory boards that keep us well connected to our advisors. Some of our most significant advances each year come from listening carefully to them and taking the appropriate action as a result. Our advisors help direct our path.
At the end of the day, we put advisors first in all of our thinking and planning. If you’ve ever felt abandoned or ignored by your home office, be prepared for a new and refreshing collaborative experience with Woodbury Financial.



Advisors in Their Own Voice: Craig Wiklund, Woodbury Financial

Open Architecture
For years, broker-dealers have been forcing their advisors into their mold. Making them change their own proven approaches and systems to conform to corporate structures that were set years ago, but possibly no longer effective. We know that what works for one advisor might not be a good fit for another. It’s the reason our advisors appreciate our steadfast commitment to an open architecture platform. And it informs every decision we make.
The bottom line is that we believe you know the best way to manage and grow your business. Because of that belief, we embrace your vision and want you to do business your way. While many broker-dealers offer narrow definitions of what open architecture means to them, Woodbury Financial is focused on what it means to you. We understand that you have a vision to take your already successful practice to an even better place.
Flexibility & Customization
To us, open architecture is more than a philosophy. It’s an everyday reality. One that lets you define your ideal approach to business and then delivers powerful options that make it happen. Our open architecture encourages you to:

Set up and manage your practice in the way that works best for you
Work with the systems you prefer and we’ll look to integrate them into ours
Market yourself to your customers and prospects in the way you know has historically produced results
Offer more products from more sponsor firms and choose from two custody/clearing options
Define a customized succession plan that makes sense today and delivers real benefits for the future




We believe you know the best way to manage and grow your business. Because of that, we embrace your vision and want you to do business your way.

Advanced Sales
Our firm is unique in the independent broker-dealer space in that we have in-house attorneys available to provide subject matter expertise and assist you with case design strategies and complex business issues. Although the attorneys don’t provide tax advice, they do understand and capitalize on the tax attributes of the products you offer by providing tax information designed to help your clients make informed decisions.
Each of our Advanced Sales attorneys bring decades of industry experience to the table and their advice is objective, independent and neutral regarding providers. Their areas of expertise include estate planning, charitable giving, business insurance and non-qualified benefit planning. They also offer expert-level knowledge on everything from IRAs to ESOPs and often challenging subjects such as long-term care, Medicaid and combination products, as well as alternative investments.

The bottom line is that we are pro-business with the full intention of helping your practice succeed. It’s not about introducing obstacles, it is all about creating opportunities.

Also, to assist you in transitioning to a fully paperless office, we supply guidance that can support and enhance your efforts to improve productivity, efficiency and accuracy in record keeping when implementing an electronic storage solution.
And to keep you up-to-date, the latest developments are covered in-person at our annual compliance meeting. We also enable you to meet your annual requirements online so that you can determine what best fits your schedule.

Woodbury Financial Services

Woodbury Financial Services: Investor Complaints, Other Issues Grow
Woodbury Financial Services has become the subject of a growing number of investor complaints and enforcement actions tied to allegations of broker misconduct and supervisory failures. At the center of Woodbury's issues are investor complaints that the independent broker/dealer not only failed to supervise its representatives but also failed to conduct proper background checks that, in several instances, revealed serious conduct related charges on records of Woodbury brokers and advisers.
Based in Woodbury, Minnesota, Woodbury Financial Services is a subsidiary of The Hartford Financial Services Group of Hartford, Conn. As an independent broker/dealer, Woodbury Financial offers life insurance, variable annuities, alternative investments, and brokerage services. The company ranked third on the Minneapolis Business Journal's 2009 Top 25 list of securities broker-dealer firms with revenue of $264 million.
Woodbury's latest problems are tied to a series of formal allegations of broker misconduct and supervisory failures, the most recent of which occurred earlier this year when Arizona securities regulators accused two Woodbury Financial brokers – Mayra Angulo and Mark Islas – of defrauding at least 30 clients. In May, Woodbury reimbursed the victims of Angulo and Islas more than $2 million. In June, as part of the settlement with Arizona regulators, Woodbury Financial Services agreed to tighten its policies of looking into the financial backgrounds of its 1,750 representatives and advisors.
In addition to increasing the number of unannounced audits, Woodbury agreed to institute background checks for unreported criminal activity and credit checks to identify those securities representatives who are in financial trouble and may pose risks to clients.
The Arizona incident is far from an isolated one. Other allegations of broker misconduct and supervisory failures came to light in February 2009, when Woodbury Financial was censured and fined $50,000 by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) on allegations that it to implement adequate supervisory procedures in connection to sales of variable life insurance policies.
A year earlier, in December 2008, Woodbury Financial was in the news again. This time Pennsylvania Attorney General Corbett announced charges against Steve A. Brubake, a registered representative with Woodbury, for allegedly defrauding elderly clients out of $284,000. The charges concerned an investment scheme that Brubaker reportedly devised to convince clients to invest in unregistered securities in the form of private bearer bonds issued by TWC Philanthropic Pool.
Bearer bonds are a type of unregistered stock for which no records are kept of the owners or transactions involving ownership. Whoever physically holds the bearer bond papers owns the stock or corporation. Federal law has prohibited the issuance of bearer bonds since 1982.
According to the criminal complaint, Brubaker sold unregistered securities to nine clients, who ranged in age from 57 to 83 years old.  Each client was sold $30,000 worth of private bearer bonds, which Brubaker was supposed to invest on their behalf.
Brubaker was charged with six counts of theft by deception, six counts of theft by failure to make required disposition of funds received, five counts of sales and purchases under the securities act and one count of insurance fraud. He faces a maximum penalty of up to 124 years in prison and a $120,000 fine.
Finally, in April 2009, Woodbury Financial faced charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which fined Woodbury $65,000 for a variety of violations of Regulation S-P. Regulation S-P prohibits disclosure of non-public personal information about clients to non-affiliated third parties, such as other broker-dealers.
As reported April 10, 2009, by Investment News, Woodbury's misuse of clients' personal information was directly related to the firm's recruitment of representatives and advisers.
“Woodbury allowed recruits to provide some of their customers' non-public personal information before becoming associated with Woodbury so that Woodbury could, on the recruits' behalf, pre-populate account transfer and new account forms with certain customer information,” the SEC said in a statement.
Currently, Woodbury Financial has some 200 home office employees and more than 1,850 independent representatives throughout the United States. On Sept. 30, Patrick McEvoy became Woodbury's newest president and CEO. Most recently, McEvoy served as president and CEO of Multi-Financial Securities Corp., a Denver-based broker-dealer in the ING Advisor Network.
