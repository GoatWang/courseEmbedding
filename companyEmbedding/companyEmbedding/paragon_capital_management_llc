Our approach to developing investment policies is based on a thorough analysis of your assets
								(including stock options, real estate holdings, and business ventures), retirement benefits, current 
								and future tax position, cash flow, risk, time horizon, and return requirements.
This process involves periodic reports to keep you informed about your investment performance, tax standing, 
								and asset positioning. Our recommendations are highlighted and implemented in those situations where we have 
								a discretionary authority. Advisory relationships leave the implementation phase up to your discretion.
Paragon Capital Management also assists with estate planning, charitable gifting, educational funding, and 
								risk management strategies. We frequently assist executives with career transition advice by helping them 
								to quantify alternative career opportunities and aiding with employment contract negotiations.
We rise to the challenge when presented with out-of-the-ordinary requests and analyses, and we view these 
								as opportunities to add value.

Our Equity management style emphasizes global diversification of investments 
								and investment approaches. We invest using a range of carefully considered 
								approaches that bring combined value to the overall portfolio with 
								the objective of better returns with lower risk. Inflation, taxes, 
								and transaction costs have an important impact on our clients 
								wealth. We offer considerable expertise on managing equity portfolios 
								tax efficiently to help you keep more of what you make. Finally, we 
								customize and diversify portfolios by considering low cost basis holdings, 
								stock options, and concentrated positions.
Our investment approach for individual stocks balances growth, value, and 
								quality. We seek stocks that will outperform over the long-term by carefully 
								considering the different factors that can affect a stock's long-term 
								performance.

 We manage tax-exempt municipal bond portfolios because our clients are tax sensitive, the returns are compelling on an after-tax basis, and the market is inefficient. Our primary emphasis is divided between yield curve 
								positioning and security selection. Our fixed income management emphasizes 
								quality, liquidity, and capital preservation strategies. Bond portfolios 
								are concentrated in intermediate-term issues where we are able to 
								capture attractive yields with less portfolio risk.

Portfolio risk is carefully managed by adding alternative assets classes that are not highly correlated 
								with equity and fixed income investments. Our goal is to provide attractive after-tax returns while reducing 
								the overall level of risk within the portfolio.
