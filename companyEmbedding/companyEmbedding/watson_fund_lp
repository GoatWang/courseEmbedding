IBM's Watson supercomputer is getting into Wall Street stock-picking


 IBM's Watson artificial intelligence platform has been hired to help pick stocks for a new ETF. Algorithm-driven investing has beaten many human stock pickers in recent years. The world's largest money manager, BlackRock, recently decided to supplement, if not supplant, its human portfolio managers with AI software for many funds.

As the robot war on Wall Street stock pickers heats up, there's a new line of attack from the algorithmic set: IBM's Watson supercomputer has been hired to help run an ETF and pick stocks than can achieve better performance than the broad U.S. stock market index.
The ETF, called the Equbot with Watson AI Total US ETF,  has been filed for by ETF Managers Group, which works with a number of ETF subadvisers to bring new investing ideas into the market, and already has launched big data, cybersecurity, drone and immunotherapy funds, among others.
The Watson ETF's approach to picking stocks is described in the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission as "actively managed" and "based on the results of a proprietary, quantitative model (the "Equbot Model") developed by Equbot LLC ("Equbot") with Watson."

Equbot, the Fund's sub-advisor, is a technology-based company focused on applying artificial intelligence to investment analyses. It is part of the IBM Global Entrepreneurs start-up roster. IBM already has a Watson effort for financial services more broadly, which includes a Watson analytical tool for wealth advisors and wealth management groups, and Watson applications for financial markets analysis.
The filing says Equbot will use IBM's Watson AI to perform a fundamental analysis of U.S.-listed stocks and real estate investment trusts based on up to 10 years of historical data and then apply that analysis to recent economic and news data.
"Each day, the Equbot Model ranks each company based on the probability of the company benefiting from current economic conditions, trends and world events and identifies approximately 30 to 70 companies with the greatest potential for appreciation and their corresponding weights, while maintaining volatility comparable to the broader U.S. equity market."

One of the most successful examples of algorithmic stock-picking in the history of Wall Street is hedge fund titan Robert Mercer, co-CEO of Renaissance Technologies, one of the most profitable hedge funds in the world. Mercer came to Renaissance in 1993 from IBM, where the computer engineer did pioneering work on using computers to review massive amounts of text and then use predictive analytics to translate between languages, an algorithm that laid the groundwork for Google Translate and Apple's Siri.
"The trend with ETF product development is toward quantitative efforts following predetermined rules to ensure consistency. It seems logical that more efforts will involve computer programming going forward using back-tested tools," said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund and ETF research at CFRA.

            Larry Fink: We are not substituting machines for human   
			                        Thursday,  6 Apr 2017 |  6:31  AM ET |  02:54 




Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research, said she likes the idea, but while AI can be used to process and analyze vast amount of data much quicker than humans, sometimes the challenge lies in deciding the importance of each piece of information in the investment decision. "An investment process involving a human analyst/team of analysts, supported by strong data analytics, certainly makes sense," she said.
She also noted that the ETF's expense ratio has not been disclosed, and since it's actively managed, it could be high. "That's the main reason why I don't like most actively managed funds. Active managers' performance has been underwhelming in general and does not justify high management fees charged by them."
BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, with more than $5 trillion in assets — and owner of the iShares family of ETFs — recently decided to turn over management on many of its actively managed funds to algorithms.
In many markets, BlackRock's automated trading products have beaten indexes more consistently than human fund managers, but they suffered a hiccup in 2016. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told CNBC in April that the professionals who had been expected to be cut would be shifted to other jobs that make more use of analytics.
In the past, BlackRock has explained that there are some tasks only a computer can do when it comes to analyzing large sets of data to make stock calls. That includes monitoring satellite data of big-box store parking lots and analyzing internet searches for consumer products to predict sales volume or even national economic growth.

IBM Watson AI Suffers From Hype Despite Healthcare Potential | Fortune.comTechSearchSearchTeslaTesla Model 3: Everything You Need to KnowTelecommunicationsSprint Seeks Merger with Charter Communications: ReportCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDFoxconnEnvironmental Regulations Would Be Waived For Planned Foxconn PlantCommentaryMastering DataHas IBM Watson’s AI Technology Fallen Victim to Hype?Barb DarrowJun 28, 2017If you ask IBM about its plans for a given business opportunity—health care, financial services, pharma, even sports coverage—the answer will likely center on Watson, IBM's take on artificial intelligence, or cognitive computing, in IBM parlance.Since beating human champions in Jeopardy six years ago, Watson has been very long on promise and generated untold numbers of headlines. As for real results, as in profit and real new business? It's unclear as IBM (ibm) chief executive Ginni Rometty has said the company does not break that out  in order to protect this crucial but nascent business.Over the past year, critics have voiced skepticism about Watson's real-world prospects especially as AI competitors—from Google (goog) to Microsoft (msft)—have brought their AI software offerings to market.The perception now is that Watson has not met lofty expectations.Related. At the Ripe Age of 105, IBM Seeks to Reinvent Itself—AgainThe most strident take down came last month when Chamath Palihapitiya, chief executive and founder Social Capital, a VC fund, told CNBC that "Watson is a joke, just to be completely honest.""The companies that are advancing machine learning and AI don't brand it with some nominally specious name that's named after a Sherlock Holmes character," he added.To be fair, while IBM (ibm) did set the table for this broad brush branding, other tech companies have taken up the cause with a vengeance, sprinkling the term "AI" like fairy dust on every bit of their software. IBM has Watson, while Salesforce (crm) has Einstein, for example.RelatedMastering DataWhatsApp Says 1 Billion People Use Its Chat App Every DayMastering DataWhatsApp Says 1 Billion People Use Its Chat App Every DayEarly on, some large companies that were interested in Watson as portrayed by IBM, privately noted later that while they saw great promise, Watson in reality, was a set of technologies that needed to be stitched together at their site. That meant buying Watson—and then preparing data for Watson—was more a big integration project than a product purchase.That's good for IBM's services business, but these companies were not interested in taking on a such a task. IBM duly set up business units centered on productizing the technology, as David Kenny, who was then general manager of the Watson business noted to Fortune last year.  (Kenny is now senior vice president in charge of both Watson and IBM Cloud Platform.)Related: IBM Watson Is All About IBM InfrastructureA new article in MIT's Tech Review has an interesting take on all of this. While it notes setbacks for Watson in health care—notably M.D. Anderson Cancer Center's decision to walk away from Watson earlier this year—the short take is: "Don't throw out the baby with the bath water."The author argues Watson suffers from the IBM's over-the-top marketing, but the tech is still valuable for health care applications.Related: IBM Watson Health Unit DebutsAccording to Tech Review, most of the issues with Watson have nothing to do with a technological problem. They are more about the availability and quality of data for Watson to process.It still seems likely that Watson Health will be a leader in applying AI to health care’s woes. If Watson has not, as of yet, accomplished a great deal along those lines, one big reason is that it needs certain types of data to be “trained.” And in many cases such data is in very short supply or difficult to access. That’s not a problem unique to Watson. It’s a catch-22 facing the entire field of machine learning for health care.IBM, it notes, has been aggressive in filling this data gap. It paid $2.6 billion to buy Truven Health, and its data trove, last year, for example.In response to the article, an IBM spokeswoman told Fortune that the Watson AI platform has been trained on six types of cancer to date, with plans to add eight more types this year. And she noted its use many top life sciences companies, along with companies building Internet of Things applications, retailers and financial services firms."It would be hard for any serious person to conclude that Watson is not working on some of the most significant issues in society today—and making progress," she said via email.The problem with AI as subject matter is that the companies behind it and journalists covering it (guilty here) fall into the trap of extolling the technology as the greatest (or scariest) ever. And then the inevitable reality is just, well, underwhelming.Related: IBM Watson: Not So Elementary My former colleague Derrick Harris has great take on all this in his Architecht newsletter. Read the whole thing, but in his view, the biggest issue for business people is falling for the hype without understanding what's happening in the technology right now. He thinks the technologists in the trenches have a good handle on that. Too bad the marketers and PR maestros at their companies choose not to reflect it.Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
