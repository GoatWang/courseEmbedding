Case Studies
Michael and Brenda Miles

Michael and Brenda Miles joined the coaching program Program in June of 2012. Having a slight knowledge of ecommerce business, both Michael and Brenda were ready to learn everything it was going to take for them to succeed.  In regards to why they joined the program, Michael claimed, “If something were to happen to me, there wouldn’t be anything to help support my wife and family. I needed to make something work, that’s where the coaching program came in.” 

Michael’s field of expertise is in programming and industrial controls. He and his wife own and operate their own business in that field. Before coming to the coaching program, they had sold a few items on ebay, but never really thought much of making it be a main source of income. After speaking with their coach, they felt confident to list a few items that they had around the house. During this process they built up the means to start listing some of the items that their own personal business was not in need of. By listing some of the aftermarket items and slightly used products from their company, they were able to generate an income above their expectations.  Michael and Brenda then started listing on average 14-16 items a week on ebay. They found that listing their items so that they ended on the weekend was perfect for their industry. All of their buyers were factories that, by the end of the week, were coming to purchase replacement parts that they had. Michael and Brenda also started researching popular keyword phrases for their items and putting as much detail into their ebay descriptions so that their listings would be as professional as possible. While performing this process they were able to generate around $4,000 in the first few months of operation. This was far beyond what they imagined would happen. Michael simply stated, “We had a lot of things to get rid of, so that’s what we were using.”  

After they had mastered the idea of listing on ebay, Michael and Brenda also started listing items on classified sections. By following the same methods as they did with ebay, they were able to use classified ads as a means of creating another steady stream of income. 

By the end of their first 4 months, they had a feedback score on ebay of 72, enough income to return their investment from the coaching program and a knowledge of ecommerce business that will be able to support them for years to come. 

Now the couple is taking on the next stages of their business and creating an online ecommerce website. With the help of their coach and the confidence gained, they are right on track for what Michael was originally looking for:  The peace of mind that his family would be supported.

Former Kraft & Philip Morris CEO Michael Miles Passes Away
He helped orchestrate the companies' $13B merger in 1988.

November 11, 2013, 07:00 pm



CHICAGO -- Michael Miles, former chairman and CEO of both Kraft Inc. and Philip Morris Cos., passed away Nov. 10 at the age of 74, according to Crain's Chicago Business. He was suffering from a tumor near the base of his skull, his son Michael Miles Jr. said.
Miles' notable career accomplishments included leading Kraft through a $13-billion merger with Philip Morris in 1988. Also, as the first non-smoking head of Philip Morris, he launched "Marlboro Friday" in 1993 by ordering a 20-percent price cut of the brand in an effort to regain market share.
A 1961 graduate of Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism, Miles spent 10 years with advertising agency Leo Burnett, became vice president of marketing for client Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC), held other positions at its parent company Heublein Inc., and ultimately became president of KFC in 1977. "There, he orchestrated a turnaround of the struggling chain, rebuilding relations with founder Colonel Harlan Sanders and restoring trust with franchisees," Miles’ family recounted.
Miles later joined the former Dart & Kraft, becoming president and chief operating officer in 1985. He was named CEO of Kraft following the merger, and then became chairman and CEO of Philip Morris in 1991. After resigning from the company in 1994, Miles became a special limited partner at private equity firm Forstmann Little & Co. and served on the boards of Dell Computer, Time-Warner, Sears, Allstate, American Airlines and Morgan Stanley, according to the Crain's report.
Following an October surgery in an attempt to diagnose and find a cure for his recent illness, Miles returned home to spend his final days with his family.
Funeral services will be private.
