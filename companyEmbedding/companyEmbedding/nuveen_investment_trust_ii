No-Action Letter: Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC (June 20, 2017)






















Home | Previous Page


























Investment Company Act of 1940 — Section 15(a)
Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC
June 20, 2017
Response of the Chief Counsel's Office
Division of Investment Management
Your letter dated June 19, 2017 requests our assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against NWQ Investment Management Company, LLC (�NWQ�) under Section 15(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the �1940 Act�) if, under the circumstances described in your letter, NWQ continued to serve as investment adviser to certain series of the Nuveen Investment Trust and Nuveen Investment Trust II (the �Trusts�) pursuant to written investment sub-advisory agreements that were not approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such series.[1]
Background
You state the following:

Nuveen Tradewinds Value Opportunities Fund and Nuveen Tradewinds Global All-Cap Fund (the �Funds�) are series of the Trusts.  The Trusts are registered with the Commission as open-end management investment companies.  Nuveen Fund Advisors, LLC (�Nuveen Fund Advisors�) serves as investment adviser to the Funds.[2]  Prior to August 1, 2016, Tradewinds Global Investors, LLC (�Tradewinds�) served as sub-adviser to the Funds.  Nuveen Investments, Inc. (�Nuveen�) owns a controlling interest in Nuveen Fund Advisors, Tradewinds, and NWQ.
In May 2016, Nuveen decided to wind up operations at Tradewinds due in large part to significant asset outflows that commenced following the departure of Tradewinds� President and Chief Investment Officer and persisted thereafter.  As part of a transition plan, at an in-person meeting held in the same month, the Trusts� Board of Trustees (the �Board�) approved the termination of each Fund�s sub-advisory agreement with Tradewinds, effective as of August 1, 2016.  As of the same date, the Board also appointed NWQ as sub-adviser to the Funds, pursuant to interim investment sub-advisory agreements (each, an �Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement�) as permitted by Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act.  Each Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement was scheduled to terminate no later than December 29, 2016 (the �Expiration Date�), thus providing for the longest interim period permitted under the rule.
Also at the May 2016 meeting, the Board considered various long-term alternatives, including liquidation of the Funds, and determined that the Funds� reorganization into Nuveen NWQ Global Equity Income Fund (each, a �Reorganization�) was in the best interests of each Fund.[3]  In the event a Fund�s Reorganization was not approved by shareholders and consummated prior to the Expiration Date, the Board also approved the longer-term appointment of NWQ as the sub-adviser to each Fund pursuant to a new sub-advisory agreement (each, a �New Sub-Advisory Agreement�).  
With a joint proxy statement/prospectus dated September 23, 2016, each Fund solicited shareholders to approve (1) its Reorganization and (2) the New Sub-Advisory Agreement (each, a �Proposal�).  After the joint proxy statement/prospectus was mailed, Nuveen Fund Advisors and the Funds actively solicited votes through direct mailings and the use of an experienced and well-respected proxy solicitor in an effort to achieve a quorum for each Fund.
As of November 8, 2016, an overwhelming majority of the votes received by the Funds� shareholders were cast in favor of both Proposals.  Nuveen Fund Advisors, however, believed that, despite all the efforts made, there was a high probability that neither Fund would receive the number of votes necessary to reach a quorum by the Expiration Date.[4]

Accordingly, as of November 29, 2016, you requested assurance that we would not recommend enforcement action against NWQ under Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act if NWQ continued to serve as sub-adviser to the Funds for the Additional Period (as described below) pursuant to written investment sub-advisory agreements that had not been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Funds.
Analysis
Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act states, in relevant part, that it shall be unlawful for a person to serve as an investment adviser of a registered investment company, except pursuant to a written contract that, among other things, has been approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of such registered investment company.[5]  Section 15(a) was adopted to give fund shareholders a voice in approving fund investment advisory contracts and to prevent trafficking in fund advisory contracts.[6]
Rule 15a-4 under the 1940 Act provides a temporary exemption from the shareholder approval requirement in Section 15(a) where, among other circumstances, the registered investment company�s board of directors has terminated the previous advisory contract.  The rule permits a person to act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company under an interim advisory agreement without the required shareholder approval for a period no greater than 150 days following the date on which the previous contract terminated subject to the requirements set forth in the rule.  Rule 15a-4 was designed to prevent registered investment companies from being harmed by losing investment advisory services before shareholders can approve a new investment advisory contract.[7]
You proposed to have NWQ continue to serve as investment sub-adviser to each Fund for an additional period of time following the interim period allowed by Rule 15a-4, but not to exceed the earliest of: (i) the consummation of the Reorganization; (ii) shareholder approval of the Fund�s New Sub-Advisory Agreement; or (iii) 60 days after the Expiration Date (the �Additional Period�).[8] 
Nuveen Fund Advisors and the Trusts believed that extending the term of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreements was in the best interests of the Funds, and the Board approved such extension.  Without such an extension, you argue that it may have been necessary to liquidate the Funds.[9]
As conditions to the requested relief, the Funds and Nuveen Fund Advisors agreed to the following during the Additional Period:

Nuveen Fund Advisors and the Funds, with the assistance of their proxy solicitor, would continue their proxy solicitation efforts to seek to reach a quorum.  Nuveen Fund Advisors would bear all postage, printing, tabulation and proxy solicitation costs during the Additional Period.
Nuveen Fund Advisors would waive the portion of each Fund�s investment advisory fee in an amount equal to the amount of the sub-advisory fee that would have been payable by Nuveen Fund Advisors to NWQ under the original terms of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreement.
Other than changes to reflect the relief granted, the terms and conditions of the Interim Sub-Advisory Agreements would remain the same.

Conclusion
On the basis of the facts and representations set forth in your letter, we would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission against NWQ under Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act for continuing to serve as investment adviser to each Fund for the Additional Period pursuant to written investment sub-advisory agreements that were not approved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund.
This response expresses our views on enforcement action only and does not express any legal conclusions on the questions presented.  Because our position is based on the facts and representations in your letter, you should note that any different facts or representations may require a different conclusion.
Jill Ehrlich
Senior Counsel



[1] This letter confirms oral no-action relief that the staff provided to Deborah Bielicke Eades, Esq., of VedderPrice P.C. on November 29, 2016.


[2] Nuveen Fund Advisors� investment advisory agreements with the Funds comply in all respects with Section 15(a) of the 1940 Act, including having been approved by a vote of a majority of the Funds� outstanding voting securities. 


[3] Nuveen Fund Advisors and NWQ serve as the investment adviser and investment sub-adviser, respectively, of Nuveen NWQ Global Equity Income Fund.


[4] In particular, you state that several factors likely contributed to the failure to reach a quorum, including: (1) the level of redemptions since the record date for the shareholder meeting; (2) a higher than typical percentage of each Fund�s shares represented by objecting beneficial owners as of the record date; and (3) each Fund�s shareholder base was more dispersed than is typical.  


[5] Section 15(a) applies to investment advisers as defined in Section 2(a)(20)(A) and (B) of the 1940 Act, which includes both primary advisers and sub-advisers. 


[6] See Hearings on S. 3580 Before the Subcomm. of the Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, 76th Cong., 3d. Sess. 253 (1940) (statement of David Schenker).  See also Temporary Exemption for Certain Investment Advisers, Investment Company Act Release No. 24177 at n.4 (Nov. 29, 1999) (�Adopting Release�).


[7] See Adopting Release at n.6 and accompanying text.  


[8] At a shareholder meeting held on December 29, 2016, Nuveen Tradewinds Global All-Cap Fund achieved a quorum and shareholders approved the New Sub-Advisory Agreement.  At a shareholder meeting held on January 26, 2017, Nuveen Tradewinds Value Opportunities Fund achieved a quorum and shareholders approved the New Sub-Advisory Agreement.   



[9] You represent that Nuveen Fund Advisors does not have the requisite infrastructure in place to manage the Funds� portfolios directly, and it would have been impracticable to establish such infrastructure prior to the Expiration Date.

	Example





	The following example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then either
	redeem or do not redeem your shares at the end of a period. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the funds operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based
	on these assumptions your costs would be:

	Portfolio Turnover





	The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or turns over its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when
	fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the funds performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the funds portfolio turnover rate was



	45% of the average value of its portfolio.




	Principal Investment Strategies




	Under normal market conditions, the fund invests primarily in non-U.S. equity securities. The fund invests primarily in developed countries, but it may invest up to 20% of its net assets in equity securities of
	companies located in emerging market countries. No more than 35% of the funds net assets may be invested in equity securities of companies located in a single non-U.S. country. The funds investment strategy is not designed to track the



	performance of any specific benchmark.




	Principal Risks





	Market Risk/Smaller Company Risk

	The market values of securities owned by the fund may decline, at times sharply and unpredictably. This risk is generally greater for lower market capitalization companies because they tend to
	have more limited product lines, markets and financial resources and may be dependent on a smaller management group than larger, more established companies.





	Non-U.S. Risk/Emerging Markets Risk

	Non-U.S. risk is the risk that securities of non-U.S. companies or U.S. companies with significant non-U.S. operations may be subject to additional risks than securities of companies that
	principally operate in the United States as a result of, among other things, political, social and economic developments abroad and different legal, regulatory and tax environments. These additional risks may be heightened for securities of
	companies located in, or with significant operations in, emerging market countries.





	Currency Risk

	Changes in currency exchange rates may
	affect the funds net asset value, the value of dividends and interest earned, and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities.




	As with any
	mutual fund investment, loss of money is a risk of investing.




	Fund Performance




	The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the potential risks of investing in the fund. The funds past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund
	will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at www.nuveen.com/MF/products/performancesummary.aspx or by calling (800) 257-8787.




	Effective October 7, 2002, the fund, pursuant to shareholder approval, (a) changed its name and primary investment strategy, and (b) changed its sub-adviser. Therefore, the funds total returns shown below for periods prior to October
	7, 2002, are not indicative of the performance that the fund, as currently managed, would have generated.




	The bar chart below shows the variability of
	the funds performance from year to year for Class A shares. The bar chart and highest/lowest quarterly returns that follow do not reflect sales charges, and if these charges were reflected, the returns would be less than those shown.





	Class A Annual Total Return*

	Class A year-to-date return as of September 30, 2009 was 21.95%.

	Nuveen Investments









	During the nine-year period ended December 31, 2008, the funds highest and lowest quarterly returns were
	19.42% and -19.48%, respectively, for the quarters ended March 31, 2000 and March 31, 2001.




	The table below shows the variability of the funds
	average annual returns and how they compare over the time periods indicated with those of a broad measure of market performance and an index of funds with similar investment objectives. All after-tax returns are calculated using the historical
	highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of any state or local tax. After-tax returns are shown for Class A shares only; after-tax returns for Class B, C, R3 and I shares will vary. Your own actual
	after-tax returns will depend on your specific tax situation and may differ from what is shown here. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold fund shares in tax-deferred accounts such as individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or
	employer-sponsored retirement plans.

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

History[edit]
Founded in 1898, Nuveen Investments began as John Nuveen & Company, when founder John Nuveen, Sr. created the firm as an investment banking company specializing in the underwriting and distribution of municipal bonds. John Nuveen formed the company in 1898. The first bond it underwrote was for a Minnesota water company. After World War II, John Nuveen, Jr. helped with the Marshall Plan administration.
In 1969, it was purchased by Investors Diversified Services (IDS). In 1974, the company was sold to The St. Paul Companies. It was privatised in 2007 after being acquired by Private Equity Group led by Madison Dearborn Partners for $5.4 Billion.[2]
The company is also known for a commercial it aired in 2000 during the Super Bowl which, through the aid of computer animation, featured Christopher Reeve "walking" along with several other sufferers of spinal paralysis.
Auction rate securities[edit]
Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

Nuveen came under criticism during 2008 for its involvement in the auction rate securities auction failures,[3] during which assets held in Nuveen's closed-end funds, totaling $15 billion, became illiquid.[4][5] Those funds had two share classes: auction-rate preferred shares that hold first claim on the underlying assets (and pay income at rates set in weekly auctions), and common shares that typically pay higher income in exchange for greater risk of loss of principal. During the auction failures, while common shareholders suffered worse than preferred shareholders in terms of principal losses, they were able to sell their shares on the NYSE while preferred shareholders had no market in which to sell.[4] In response, Nuveen posted a "Nuveen Auction Rate Preferred Resource Center" to inform its investors of its plans to borrow money to pay them back.[6] The company later set refinancing for $2.7 Billion in taxable auction-rate preferred shares and has placed $500 Million of VRDP refinancing for its municipal auction rate preferred shares.[7][8]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
