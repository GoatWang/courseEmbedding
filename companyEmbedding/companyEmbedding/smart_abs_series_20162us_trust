The issuance consists of notes backed by automotive lease and loan  receivables originated by Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited (Macquarie Leasing). The  ratings are as follows: USD100.00m Class A-1 notes: 'F1+(EXP)sf' USD175.00m Class A-2 (a & b) notes: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable USD140.00m Class A-3 (a & b) notes: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable USD85.00m Class A-4 (a & b) notes: 'AAA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable AUD15.12m Class B notes: 'AA(EXP)sf'; Outlook Stable AUD83.18m Seller notes: 'NR(EXP)sf' The notes will be issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as  trustee of SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust. The latter is a legally distinct  trust established pursuant to a master trust and security deed.  The collateral backing the SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust transaction is of  similar credit quality to prior pools securitised under the SMART programme. The  pool has weighted-average seasoning of 7.5 months and an average receivable size  of AUD33,317. Novated contracts contributed to the relatively low arrears levels  on prior SMART transactions and make up 50.5% of the current transaction pool. KEY RATING DRIVERS  High Quality Receivables: Historical gross losses by quarterly vintage for  novated leases (cars) range from 0.3% to 1.5%; non-novated leases (cars) from  1.0% to 3.2%; trucks 0.5%-5.0%; and consumer 0.8%-4.0%. The gross loss base-case  for consumer loans has been reduced from 5.0% to 4.0%. Macquarie Leasing has  originated consumer loans directly to individual retail consumers since 2008.  Delinquencies more than 30 days have traditionally tracked below 1.0% for  Macquarie Leasing's book.  Sufficient Enhancement: The SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust transaction  incorporates a sequential pay/pro-rata pay structure, consistent with prior  transactions. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) to the 'AAAsf' notes totals  13.0%. Pro-rata paydown will commence when hard CE reaches 18.9%. Overall, CE is  sufficient to cover Fitch's 'AAAsf' and 'AAsf' stressed cumulative net loss  assumptions in all Fitch scenarios. Adequate Liquidity: Liquidity support is provided by the liquidity reserve and  will ensure stable cash flows for the required payments. The reserve will  initially be funded by Macquarie Bank Limited (A/Stable/F1) at AUD7.6m on the  closing date and subsequently the greater of: 1) 1.0% of the aggregate invested  amount of the notes for that payment date; and 2) AUD300,000. Balloon Loans in Portfolio: The pool comprises amortising principal and interest  lease and loan receivables, with varying balloon amounts payable at maturity.  The weighted average balloon by original balance is 20.7%. EXPECTED RATING SENSITIVITIES  Unexpected increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted  loans could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base-case, which could  result in negative rating action on the notes. Fitch has evaluated the  sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust to  increased gross default levels and decreased recovery rates over the life of the  transaction. Its analysis found the Class A-4 notes displayed sensitivity to increased  defaults, showing downgrades of one notch under Fitch's moderate (25% increase)  and two notches (AA-sf) under Fitch's severe default (50% increase) scenario.  The Class B notes ratings' were also sensitive to increased defaults, with the  rating declining by one notch under the severe scenarios. When subject to reduced recovery rates, all rated notes remain stable under mild  (10% decrease), moderate (25% decrease) and severe (50% decrease) scenarios. The analysis also showed that under a combination of moderate and severe default  and recovery scenarios, the Class A-4 notes would be downgraded to AA+sf and  AA-sf, respectively. The Class B notes' rating declined to Asf under the  moderate combination scenario and declined to Asf under the severe combination  scenario. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10  Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E  focused on agreeing data fields provided in the pool data to source documents.  Fitch considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect  on Fitch's analysis or conclusions. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement  mechanisms (RW&Es) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the  underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  "Related Research" below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es  to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special  Report, Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global  Structured Finance Transactions, dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third party  assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information and concluded that there  were no findings that affected the rating analysis.  As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted  sample of Macquarie Leasing's origination files and found the information  contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the  originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the  agency about the asset portfolio.  Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the  agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies  indicates it is adequately reliable. Key Rating Drivers and Expected Rating Sensitivities are further discussed in  the corresponding presale report, SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust, published  today.  VARIATIONS FROM CRITERIA  The class B notes have 11% subordination in the form of the Seller notes; the  breakeven net-loss for a AAAsf rated note is 10.9%. The class B notes pass the  AAAsf stresses within the cash flow model, however, Fitch has not assigned a  rating higher than AAsf to the class B notes due to the transaction's inability  to switch off the pro-rata paydown other than at call. The level of structural  credit enhancement will not increase above 18.9% for the class A notes and 16.0%  for the class B notes during the pro-rata paydown period. The class B note is  also sensitive to increases in defaults and decreases in recovery rates with a  AAAsf rating. This is a variation from the Global Consumer ABS Rating Criteria,  as the difference between the assigned and model indicated ratings in greater  than one notch.  SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis:  -loan-by-loan data provided by Macquarie Leasing as at 1 September 2016 -loss and recovery data provided by Macquarie Leasing as at 1 September 2016 -transaction documentation provided by Allen & Overy, the issuer's counsel. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used  in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue.

The  issuance consists of notes backed by automotive lease and loan receivables  originated by Macquarie Leasing Pty Limited (Macquarie Leasing). The ratings are  as follows: USD100.00m Class A-1 notes: 'F1+sf' USD175.00m Class A-2a notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable USD140.00m Class A-3a notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable USD85.00m Class A-4a notes: 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD15.19m Class B notes: 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable AUD83.57m Seller notes: 'NRsf' The notes were issued by Perpetual Trustee Company Limited in its capacity as  trustee of SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust. The latter is a legally distinct  trust established pursuant to a master trust and security deed.  The collateral backing the SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust transaction is of  similar credit quality to prior pools securitised under the SMART programme. The  pool has weighted-average seasoning of 8.5 months and an average receivable size  of AUD32,510. Novated contracts contributed to the relatively low arrears levels  on prior SMART transactions and make up 50.5% of the current transaction pool. KEY RATING DRIVERS  High Quality Receivables: Historical gross losses by quarterly vintage for  novated leases (cars) range from 0.3% to 1.5%; non-novated leases (cars) from  1.0% to 3.2%; trucks 0.5%-5.0%; and consumer 0.8%-4.0%. The gross loss base-case  for consumer loans has been reduced from 5.0% to 4.0%. Macquarie Leasing has  originated consumer loans directly to individual retail consumers since 2008.  Delinquencies more than 30 days have traditionally tracked below 1.0% for  Macquarie Leasing's book.  Sufficient Enhancement: The SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust transaction  incorporates a sequential pay/pro-rata pay structure, consistent with prior  transactions. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) to the 'AAAsf' notes totals  13.0%. Pro-rata paydown will commence when hard CE reaches 18.9%. Overall, CE is  sufficient to cover Fitch's 'AAAsf' and 'AAsf' stressed cumulative net loss  assumptions in all Fitch scenarios. Adequate Liquidity: Liquidity support is provided by the liquidity reserve and  will ensure stable cash flows for the required payments. The reserve was  initially funded by Macquarie Bank Limited (A/Stable/F1) at AUD7.6m on the  closing date and subsequently the greater of: 1) 1.0% of the aggregate invested  amount of the notes for that payment date; and 2) AUD300,000. Balloon Loans in Portfolio: The pool comprises amortising principal and interest  lease and loan receivables, with varying balloon amounts payable at maturity.  The weighted-average balloon by original balance is 20.8%. RATING SENSITIVITIES  Unexpected increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity on defaulted  loans could produce loss levels higher than Fitch's base-case, which could  result in negative rating action on the notes. Fitch has evaluated the  sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust to  increased gross default levels and decreased recovery rates over the life of the  transaction. Its analysis found the class A-4 notes displayed sensitivity to increased  defaults, showing downgrades of one notch under Fitch's severe default (50%  increase) scenario. The class B notes' rating was also sensitive to increased  defaults, with the rating declining by one notch under the severe scenario. When subject to reduced recovery rates, all rated notes remain stable under mild  (10% decrease), moderate (25% decrease) and severe (50% decrease) scenarios. The analysis also showed that under a combination of moderate and severe default  and recovery scenarios, the class A-4 notes would be downgraded by one notch to  AA+sf. The class B notes' rating declined to Asf under the severe combination  scenario. USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10  Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E  focused on agreeing data fields provided in the pool data to source documents.  Fitch considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an effect  on Fitch's analysis or conclusions. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS A description of the transaction's representations, warranties and enforcement  mechanisms (RW&Es) disclosed in the offering document that relate to the  underlying asset pool is available by accessing the appendix referenced under  "Related Research" below. The appendix also contains a comparison of these RW&Es  to those Fitch considers typical for the asset class as detailed in the Special  Report, Representations, Warranties and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global  Structured Finance Transactions, dated 31 May 2016. DATA ADEQUACY Prior to the transaction closing, Fitch reviewed the results of a third party  assessment conducted on the asset portfolio information and concluded that there  were no findings that affected the rating analysis.  As part of its ongoing monitoring, Fitch conducted a review of a small targeted  sample of Macquarie Leasing's origination files and found the information  contained in the reviewed files to be adequately consistent with the  originator's policies and practices and the other information provided to the  agency about the asset portfolio.  Overall, Fitch's assessment of the asset pool information relied upon for the  agency's rating analysis according to its applicable rating methodologies  indicates it is adequately reliable. Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further discussed in the  corresponding new issue report, SMART ABS Series 2016-2US Trust, published  today.  VARIATIONS FROM CRITERIA  The class B notes have 11% subordination in the form of the Seller notes; the  breakeven net-loss for a AAAsf rated note is 10.9%. The class B notes pass the  AAAsf stresses within the cash flow model, however, Fitch has not assigned a  rating higher than AAsf to the class B notes due to the transaction's inability  to switch off the pro-rata paydown other than at call. The level of structural  credit enhancement will not increase above 18.9% for the class A notes and 16.0%  for the class B notes during the pro-rata paydown period. The class B note is  also sensitive to increases in defaults and decreases in recovery rates with a  AAAsf rating. This is a variation from the Global Consumer ABS Rating Criteria,  as the difference between the assigned and model indicated ratings in greater  than one notch.  SOURCES OF INFORMATION The information below was used in the analysis:  -loan-by-loan data provided by Macquarie Leasing as at 1 September 2016 -loss and recovery data provided by Macquarie Leasing as at 1 September 2016 -transaction documentation provided by Allen & Overy, the issuer's counsel. The issuer has informed Fitch that not all relevant underlying information used  in the analysis of the rated notes is public.

Reproduction or retransmission in whole or  in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and  maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast  information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and  underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch  conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it  in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification  of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are  available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's  factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains  will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the  requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is  offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of  relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its  advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as  audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports,  engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties,  the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources  with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the  issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports  should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any  third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on  in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete.  Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the  information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and  other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the  work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial  statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings  and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking  and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature  cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current  facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that  were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.  The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or  warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or  any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the  report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security.  This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and  methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore,  ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual,  or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or   a report. The  rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk,  unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or  sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals  identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible  for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes  only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute  for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer  and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be  changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch.  Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a  recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the  adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular  investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to  any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other  obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from  US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In  certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular  issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a  single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000  (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or  dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to  use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed  under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act  of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular  jurisdiction.

event instruct The Depository Trust Company or any replacement 
  15 



clearing agency to notify all of the appropriate US$ Note Owners of the occurrence of such event and of the availability of Definitive Notes to such US$ Note Owners. Upon the surrender of the
Book-Entry Notes to the Issuer by The Depository Trust Company or any replacement clearing agency, and the delivery by The Depository Trust Company or any replacement clearing agency of the relevant registration instructions to the Issuer, the

Property unless:   


 
(i)
the US$ Note Trustee is so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the US$ Noteholders (as a single Class); or   


 
(ii)
if the US$ Noteholders fail to provide direction to the US$ Note Trustee as to how to vote under the Master Security Trust Deed or to otherwise direct the Security Trustee and the US$ Note Trustee is of the opinion,
reached after considering at any time and from time to time the advice of an investment bank or other financial adviser selected by the US$ Note Trustee in good faith and with due care, that: 
 


 
(A)
a sufficient amount would be realised to discharge in full all amounts owing to the relevant US$ Noteholders and any other amounts owing by the Issuer to any other person ranking in priority to or equally with the US$
Notes; or   


 
(B)
the cash flow receivable by the Issuer (or the Security Trustee under the Master Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed) if the Secured Property is not disposed of will not (or that there is a significant
risk that it will not) be sufficient, having regard to any other relevant actual, contingent or prospective liabilities of the Issuer, to discharge in full in due course all the amounts referred to in Clause 7.2(a)(ii)(A). 
 


 
(b)
(Liability for Enforcement): Each of the parties to this Deed acknowledges and agrees that the US$ Note Trustee does not owe any duty of care to any person in relation to the Secured Property. Subject to Clauses
8.3, 9.2, 9.3 and 9.4 and the mandatory provisions of the TIA, the US$ Note Trustee will not be liable for any decline in the value, nor any loss realised upon any sale or other dispositions made under the Master Security Trust Deed and the General
Security Deed, of any Secured Property. Without limiting the foregoing, the US$ Note Trustee will not be liable for any such decline or loss directly or indirectly arising from its acting, or failing to act, as a consequence of an opinion reached by
it in good faith based on advice received by it in accordance with Clause 7.2(a)(ii) or a direction by an Extraordinary Resolution of the US$ Noteholders (as a single Class) in accordance with Clause 7.2(a)(i).

has the power, subject to clause 9.4 of the Master Security Trust Deed:   


 
(a)
(Enforce Following Default): in the event of a default in repayment of the principal or payment of interest by the Issuer in respect of any US$ Note when and as the same shall become due and payable, which
default has continued for a period of ten days, to recover judgment, in its own name and as trustee of the US$ Note Trust, against the Issuer upon the US$ Notes for the whole amount of such principal and interest remaining unpaid and amounts payable
to the US$ Note Trustee;   


 
(b)
(File Proofs): to file such proofs of claim and other payments or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the US$ Note Trustee and the US$ Noteholders allowed in any judicial
proceedings in relation to the Issuer upon the US$ Notes, the Creditors in relation to the Series Trust or the Assets of the Series Trust; 
  28

(Enforce Rights): if an Event of Default occurs and is subsisting, to proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the US$ Noteholders by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the US$ Note
Trustee deems most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the performance of any provision of this Deed or in aid of the exercise of any power under this Deed or to enforce any other proper remedy. 
 


7.4
US$ Note Trustee alone may Enforce  Subject to the Master Security Trust Deed, the
General Security Deed and the mandatory provisions of the TIA, only the US$ Note Trustee may enforce, or direct the Security Trustee to enforce, the obligations of the Issuer or the Manager to the US$ Noteholders under the US$ Notes, this Deed or
any other Transaction Document, unless the US$ Note Trustee has become bound to take steps or to proceed under this Deed and fails to do so within a reasonable time and such failure is continuing. No US$ Noteholder is entitled to proceed directly
against the Issuer, the Manager or MLPL in respect of the US$ Notes, this Deed or any other Transaction Document. If the US$ Note Trustee takes any action to enforce any of the provisions of the US$ Notes, proof that the Issuer has not paid any
principal or interest due in respect of any US$ Note will (unless the contrary is proved) be sufficient evidence that the Issuer has not paid that principal or interest on all other US$ Notes in respect of which the relevant payment is then due.
  


8.
US$ NOTE TRUSTEES POWERS, PROTECTIONS ETC.   


8.1
US$ Note Trustees Additional Powers, Protections, etc.  By way of supplement to

the contrary in this Deed (subject only to Clauses 8.3(c), 9.3 and 9.4 and the mandatory provisions of the TIA) or any other Transaction Documents as follows.   


 
(a)
(Liability to account): The US$ Note Trustee is under no obligation to any Interested Person to pay to or account for any moneys other than those received by the US$ Note Trustee from the Issuer or received or
recovered by the US$ Note Trustee under this Deed or any other Transaction Document, subject always to such deductions and withholdings by the US$ Note Trustee as are authorised by this Deed or any other Transaction Documents. The obligations of the
US$ Note Trustee to any Interested Person or any other person under or in connection with this Deed or any other Transaction Documents can only be enforced against the US$ Note Trustee to the extent to which they can be satisfied out of such moneys
in accordance with this Deed or any other Transaction Documents.   


 
(b)
(US$ Notes): The US$ Note Trustee is not responsible for the receipt or application of the proceeds of issue of any of the US$ Notes or (except when acting as US$ Note Registrar to the extent specifically

advice of, or information obtained from, any lawyer, valuer, banker, broker,

such advice. Any such opinion, advice or information may be sent or obtained by letter, telex, email or facsimile transmission and the US$ Note Trustee will not be liable to any person for acting on any such opinion, advice or information conforming
with any applicable requirements of this Deed and the TIA even though it contains some error which is not a manifest error or is not authentic.   


 
(d)
(No enquiry): Unless specifically required under this Deed, the US$ Note Trustee is not bound to give notice to any person of the execution of this Deed or to take any steps to ascertain whether there has
occurred any Event of Default, Perfection of Title Event, Servicer Default, Manager Default or Trustee Default or event which, with the giving of notice or the lapse of time, would constitute a Perfection of Title Event, Servicer Default, Manager
Default or Trustee Default or to keep itself informed about the circumstances of the Issuer or the Manager and, until it has actual knowledge or actual notice to the contrary, the US$ Note Trustee may assume that no Event of Default, Perfection of
Title Event, Servicer Default, Manager Default or Trustee Default has occurred and that the Issuer, the Manager and each other party to the Transaction Documents (other than the US$ Note Trustee) are observing and performing all the obligations on
their part contained in the Transaction Documents and need not inquire whether that is, in fact, the case (but nothing in this Clause 8.1(d) is to be construed as limiting the US$ Note Trustees right to make such inquiries, in its
absolute discretion, and to exercise its powers under this Deed so to do).   


 
(e)
(Acts pursuant to directions): The US$ Note Trustee will not be responsible for having acted in good faith upon a direction given or purporting to have been given by a Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution of
the US$ Noteholders, even though it may subsequently be found that for any reason such direction was not valid or binding upon the US$ Note Trustee. However, for the purposes of determining whether the US$ Noteholders have given a direction by way
of a Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution which the US$ Note Trustee may rely upon, US$ Notes with respect to which the US$ Note Trustee has received actual written notice that such US$ Notes are owned by the Issuer or the Manager or by any person
directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or the Manager, shall be disregarded. Nothing in this Deed or any other Transaction Documents shall prohibit, or be construed to prohibit,
the right of the US$ Note Trustee to seek the direction of the US$ Noteholders in connection with the performance of its duties and powers under this Deed or any Transaction Documents. 
 


 
(f)

professional person.

selection of such delegate, and subject to Clause 8.5, it will not be under any obligation to any person to supervise the proceedings or be in any way responsible for any loss incurred by reason of any acts, omissions, misconduct or default on the

Additional Note Trustee, together with any costs and expenses properly incurred by any Additional Note Trustee in performing its functions as such, are expenses of the US$ Note Trustee recoverable by it pursuant to Clause 12.2. The US$ Note Trustee,
upon giving prior notice to the Issuer and the Manager, has the power to remove any Additional Note Trustee. The Issuer, for valuable consideration, irrevocably appoints the US$ Note Trustee to be its attorney in its name and on its behalf to
execute an instrument of removal of any such Additional Note Trustee.   


13.2
Joint exercise of powers  All rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
imposed upon an Additional Note Trustee are conferred or imposed upon and exercised or performed by the US$ Note Trustee and the Additional Note Trustee jointly (it being understood that an Additional Note Trustee is not authorised to act separately

  44 



of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed the US$ Note Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such rights,
powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed singly by such Additional Note Trustee (but subject to the direction of the US$ Note Trustee).   


13.3
Notice  The US$ Note Trustee must promptly notify the Issuer, the Security Trustee, the
Principal Paying Agent, the US$ Noteholders and the Rating Agencies of each appointment or removal of an Additional Note Trustee pursuant to this Clause 13.

14.1
Retirement of US$ Note Trustee  The US$ Note Trustee covenants that it will retire as
the US$ Note Trustee if:

(c)
(Ceases to be an Eligible Trust Corporation): it ceases to be an Eligible Trust Corporation;   


 
(d)

(e)
(Breach of duty): when required to do so by the Manager or the Issuer by notice in writing, it fails or neglects within 20 Business Days after receipt of such notice to carry out or satisfy any material duty
imposed on it by this Deed or any Transaction Document provided that the US$ Note Trustee is not required to retire in such circumstances if there is an Extraordinary Resolution from the US$ Noteholders affirming its appointment notwithstanding such

  45 




14.3
US$ Note Trustee may retire  The US$ Note Trustee may retire at any time, at its own

without being responsible for any liabilities of any other person incurred by reason of such retirement provided that such retirement is in accordance with this Deed and provided that no such period of notice of retirement may expire within the
period of 15 days preceding each Distribution Date. Upon such retirement the US$ Note Trustee, subject to any approval required by law, may appoint in writing any other Eligible Trust Corporation as US$ Note Trustee in its stead provided that the
Manager has first provided the Issuer with a Rating Notification in relation to the appointment of the replacement US$ Note Trustee. If the US$ Note Trustee does not propose a replacement by the date which is one month prior to the date of its
proposed retirement, the Manager is entitled to appoint a Substitute US$ Note Trustee, which must be an Eligible Trust Corporation, as of the date of the proposed retirement provided that the Manager has first provided the Issuer with a Rating
Notification in relation to the appointment of the proposed Substitute US$ Note Trustee.   


14.4

Trustee, associated with the appointment of a Substitute US$ Note Trustee will be borne by the Issuer as costs and expenses of the Series Trust.

the Substitute US$ Note Trustee and to deliver all books and records relating to the US$ Note Trust to the Substitute US$ Note Trustee. The Manager and the Issuer may settle with the US$ Note Trustee the amount of any sums payable by the US$ Note
Trustee to the Manager or the Issuer or by the Manager or the Issuer to the US$ Note Trustee and may give to or accept from the US$ Note Trustee a discharge in respect of those sums which will be conclusive and binding as between the Manager, the
Issuer and the US$ Note Trustee but not as between the US$ Note Trustee and the US$ Noteholders.   


14.6
Vesting of US$ Trust Fund in Substitute US$ Note Trustee  The US$ Note Trustee, on its
retirement or removal, must vest the US$ Note Trust Fund or cause it to be vested in the Substitute US$ Note Trustee and must deliver and assign, at the expense of the US$ Note Trustee, to such Substitute US$ Note Trustee as appropriate all books,

Dispute Resolution   


 
(a)
A US$ Noteholder or a US$ Note Owner may require the US$ Note Trustee to direct the Issuer to make a repurchase request or payment demand for the purposes of Clause 20.1(b) by sending a written request in respect
thereof to the US$ Note Trustee, provided that each such request must include (A) the name of the requesting US$ Noteholder or US$ Note Owner, and (B) in the case of a US$ Note Owner, a certification purporting to be from that US$ Note
Owner that it is a US$ Note Owner, together with (C) at least one form of documentation, acceptable to the US$ Note Trustee, purporting to evidence the US$ Note Owners beneficial ownership of a US$ Note, including, but not limited to, a
trade confirmation, account statement, letter from a broker or dealer or other similar document. The US$ Note Trustee will have the benefit of Clauses 8.1(f)(ii) and 9.2(b) in relation to any such certification and other documentation. The US$ Note
Trustee must comply with any such request from a US$ Noteholder or a US$ Note Owner and any action taken by the US$ Note Trustee for that purpose will not be considered to be fraud, negligence or wilful default of the US$ Note Trustee. In complying

the Requesting Party under this Clause 20.1. Any agreed settlement reached between the Requesting Party and the Seller (in a mediation or otherwise) or any decision by an arbitrator in an arbitration held under this Clause 20.1 will be binding upon
the Seller and the Requesting Party with respect to the SMART Receivable that is the subject matter of the repurchase request or demand for payment. In the case of arbitration and in respect of that SMART Receivable, without affecting any
partys rights under the International Arbitration Act 1974 (Cth), issues which have been determined by an arbitral tribunal under this Clause 20.1 may not be re-arbitrated or re-litigated by any of the parties to such an arbitration or be the

ISSUERS LIMITED LIABILITY   


23.1
Limitation on Issuers Liability  This Deed applies to the Issuer only in its
capacity as trustee of the Series Trust and in no other capacity. A liability incurred by the Issuer acting in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust arising under or in connection with this Deed is limited to and can be enforced against the
Issuer only to the extent to which it can be satisfied out of Assets of the Series Trust out of which the Issuer is actually indemnified for the liability. This limitation of the Issuers liability applies despite any other provision of this
Deed (other than Clause 23.3) and extends to all liabilities and obligations of the Issuer in any way connected with any representation, warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction related to this Deed. 
 


23.2
Claims against Issuer  The parties other than the Issuer may not sue the Issuer in
respect of liabilities incurred by the Issuer acting in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust in any capacity other than as trustee of the Series Trust, including seeking the appointment of a receiver (except in relation to Assets of the
Series Trust), a liquidator, an administrator, or any similar person to the Issuer or prove in any liquidation, administration or similar arrangements of or affecting the Issuer (except in relation to the Assets of the Series Trust). 
  64 




23.3
Fraud, Negligence or Wilful Default  The provisions of this Clause 23 will not apply to
any obligation or liability of the Issuer to the extent that it is not satisfied because under the Master Trust Deed, the Series Supplement or any other Transaction Document in relation to the Series Trust or by operation of law there is a reduction
in the extent of the Issuers indemnification out of the Assets of the Series Trust, as a result of the Issuers fraud, negligence or wilful default.   


23.4
Acts or omissions  It is acknowledged that the Relevant Parties are responsible under
the Transaction Documents for performing a variety of obligations relating to the Series Trust. No act or omission of the Issuer (including any related failure to satisfy its obligations or any breach of representation or warranty under this Deed)
will be considered fraudulent, negligent or a wilful default for the purpose of Clause 23.3 to the extent to which the act or omission was caused or contributed to by any failure by any Relevant Party or any other person appointed by the Issuer
under any Transaction Document (other than a person whose acts or omissions the Issuer is liable for in accordance with any Transaction Document) to fulfil its obligations relating to the Series Trust or by any other act or omission of a Relevant
Party or any other such person.   


23.5
No authority  No attorney or agent appointed in accordance with this Deed has authority
to act on behalf of the Issuer in a way which exposes the Issuer to any personal liability and no act or omission of any such person will be considered fraud, negligence or wilful default of the Issuer for the purposes of Clause 23.3. 
 


23.6
No obligation  The Issuer is not obliged to enter into any commitment or obligation
under this Deed or any Transaction Document (including incur any further liability) unless the Issuers liability is limited in a manner which is consistent with this Clause 23 or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the Issuer in its absolute
discretion.   


24.
MISCELLANEOUS   


24.1
Assignment by Issuer  The Issuer will not assign or otherwise transfer the benefit of
this Deed or any of its rights, duties or obligations under this Deed except to a Substitute Trustee which is appointed as a successor trustee of the Series Trust under and in accordance with the Master Trust Deed. 
 


24.2
Assignment by Manager  The Manager will not assign or otherwise transfer the benefit of
this Deed or any of its rights, duties or obligations under this Deed except to a Substitute Manager which is appointed as a successor manager of the Series Trust under and in accordance with the Master Trust Deed. 
  65 




24.3

or any of its rights, duties or obligations under this Deed except with the prior written consent of the other parties hereto.   


24.4

transfer all or any part of the benefit of this Deed or any of its rights, duties and obligations under this Deed except to a Substitute US$ Note Trustee which is appointed as a successor trustee under and in accordance with this Deed. 
 


24.5
Certificate of US$ Note Trustee  A certificate in writing signed by an Authorised
Officer of the US$ Note Trustee certifying any act, matter or thing relating to this Deed or any other Transaction Documents is conclusive and binding on the Issuer in the absence of manifest error on the face of the certificate. 
 


24.6
Continuing obligation  This Deed is a continuing obligation notwithstanding any
settlement of account, intervening payment, express or implied revocation or any other matter or thing whatsoever until a final discharge of this Deed has been given to the Issuer. 
 


24.7
Settlement conditional  Any settlement or discharge between the Issuer and the US$ Note
Trustee is conditional upon any security or payment given or made to the US$ Note Trustee by the Issuer or any other person in relation to the Secured Moneys (as defined in the Master Security Trust Deed) not being avoided, repaid or reduced by
virtue of any provision or enactment relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation for the time being in force and, in the event of any such security or payment being so avoided, repaid or reduced, the US$ Note Trustee is entitled to recover the
value or amount of such security or payment avoided, repaid or reduced from the Issuer subsequently as if such settlement or discharge had not occurred.   


24.8
Interest on judgment  If a liability under this Deed (other than a liability for
negligence, fraud or wilful default of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents) becomes merged in a judgment or order then the Issuer, as an independent obligation, will pay interest to the US$ Note Trustee on the amount of that liability at a
rate being the higher of the rate payable pursuant to the judgment or order and the highest rate payable on the US$ Notes from the date it becomes payable until it is paid.   


24.9
Severability of provisions  Any provision of this Deed which is illegal, void or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction is ineffective in that jurisdiction to the extent only of such illegality, voidness or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Deed or the enforceability of that provision in any other
jurisdiction.   


24.10
Remedies cumulative  The rights and remedies conferred by this Deed upon the US$ Note
Trustee or the Issuer are cumulative and in addition to all other rights or remedies available to the US$ Note Trustee or the Issuer by Statute or by general law. 
  66 




24.11
Waiver  A failure to exercise or enforce or a delay in exercising or enforcing or the
partial exercise or enforcement of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Deed by the US$ Note Trustee or the Issuer will not in any way preclude or operate as a waiver of any further exercise or enforcement of such right, remedy, power or
privilege or the exercise or enforcement of any other right, remedy, power or privilege under this Deed or provided by law.   


24.12
Written waiver, consent and approval  Any waiver, consent or approval given by the US$
Note Trustee or the Issuer under this Deed will only be effective and will only be binding on the US$ Note Trustee or the Issuer, as the case may be, if it is given in writing or given verbally and subsequently confirmed in writing and executed by
the US$ Note Trustee or the Issuer, as the case may be, or on behalf of the US$ Note Trustee or the Issuer by an Authorised Officer for the time being of the US$ Note Trustee or the Issuer, as the case may be. 
 


24.13
Time of essence  Time is of the essence in respect of the Issuers, the
Managers, MLPLs and the US$ Note Trustees obligations under this Deed.   


24.14
Moratorium legislation  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the provisions of all
Statutes operating directly or indirectly:   


 
(a)
(Lessen obligations): to lessen or otherwise to vary or affect in favour of the Issuer any obligation under this Deed; or   


 
(b)
(Delay exercise of powers): to delay or otherwise prevent or prejudicially affect the exercise of any powers conferred on the US$ Note Trustee under this Deed, 
are expressly waived, negatived and excluded.   


24.15
Binding on each signatory  This Deed binds each of the signatories to this Deed
notwithstanding that any one or more of the named parties to this Deed does not execute this Deed, that there is any invalidity, forgery or irregularity touching any execution of this Deed or that this Deed is or becomes unenforceable void or
voidable against any such named party.   


24.16
Counterparts  This Deed may be executed in a number of counterparts and all such
counterparts taken together are deemed to constitute one and the same instrument.   


24.17
Contra Proferentem  Each provision of this Deed will be interpreted without disadvantage
to the party who (or whose representative) drafted that provision.   


24.18
Anti-money laundering  Each party (the Information Provider) agrees to provide
any information and documents reasonably required by any other party (the Information Recipient) to comply with any applicable 
  67 



anti-money laundering or counter-terrorism financing laws including any applicable laws imposing know your customer or other identification checks or procedures that the Information
Recipient is required to comply with in respect of this Deed (AML/CTF Laws), but the foregoing obligation applies only to the extent that such information and such documents are in the possession of the Information Provider or may be obtained
by it after having undertaken reasonable steps and subject to any confidentiality, privacy or general law obligations owed by the Information Provider to any person in relation to whom the information or documents requested relate (except, in all
cases, to the extent that the foregoing may be overridden by the relevant AML/CTF Laws). Each party must comply with any AML/CTF Laws applicable to it, to the extent required to comply with its obligations under the Transaction Documents. Any party
may decline to perform any obligation under the Transaction Documents to the extent it forms the view, in its reasonable opinion, that notwithstanding that it has taken all action to comply with any applicable AML/CTF Laws, it is required to decline
to perform those obligations under any such AML/CTF Laws. To the maximum extent permitted by law, each party and the Noteholders and Unitholders release each other party (a Released Party) from any confidentiality, privacy or general law
obligations that a Released Party would otherwise owe to it in respect of this Deed and to the extent to which it is able, any applicable confidentiality and privacy laws, but only to the extent that the existence of these obligations or laws would
otherwise prevent a Released Party from providing any information or documents requested in accordance with this Clause 24.18 or any similar clause in any other Transaction Document. 
 


24.19
Compliance with Regulation AB

Series Trust, the US$ Note Trustee must prepare and deliver to each of the Issuer, MLPL, the Manager, the US$ Note Trustee and the Rating Agencies each of the following items no later than 90 days after the end of that fiscal year:

Servicing Criteria, including disclosure of any material instance of non-compliance identified by the US$ Note Trustee. Such report must be signed by an Authorised Officer of the US$ Note Trustee, and must be substantially in the form of Schedule 7,
and address (A) each of the Servicing Criteria marked in Appendix A to Schedule 7 as Applicable Servicing Criteria and (B) any unmarked Servicing Criteria in Appendix A to Schedule 7, to the extent that the US$ Note Trustee is
involved in servicing activities relating to such Servicing Criteria, as mutually agreed upon by MLPL and the US$ Note Trustee from time to time;   


 
(ii)
(Accounting attestation report): a report of a registered public accounting firm that attests to, and reports on, the assessment of compliance report made by the US$ Note Trustee and delivered pursuant to

(B) which elements of the Servicing Criteria will be addressed in assessments of compliance provided by each delegate identified pursuant to paragraph (A) of this Clause 24.19(a)(iii). 
  68 




 
(b)
As a condition to the utilisation of any delegate determined to be participating in the servicing function within the meaning of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, the US$ Note Trustee shall cause each such
delegate, if any, to comply with paragraphs (a)(i) and (ii) above as if references to the US$ Note Trustee in those paragraphs were references to such delegate, except that any assessment of compliance or accounting reports delivered by a
delegate of the US$ Note Trustee under paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above need not address any elements of the Servicing Criteria other than those specified by the US$ Note Trustee to such delegate pursuant to Clause 24.19(a)(iii)(B).
  


 
(c)
The US$ Note Trustee represents, warrants and agrees that each report required pursuant to this Clause 24.19 to be provided by the US$ Note Trustee or any of its delegates will be accurate in all material respects and
will not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
  


 
(d)
Any failure by the US$ Note Trustee or any delegate of the US$ Note Trustee to deliver any information, report, certification, accountants letter or other material when and as required under this Clause 24.19,
shall immediately and automatically, without notice or grace period, entitle the Manager, in its sole discretion:   


 
(i)
to remove the US$ Note Trustee or direct the US$ Note Trustee to remove such delegate from the performance of any activities which MLPL reasonably determines to constitute participating in the servicing
function in relation to the Issuer within the meaning of Item 1122 of Regulation AB; and   


 
(ii)
to replace the US$ Note Trustee or such delegate with respect to such activities; 
provided that if directed by MLPL, the Manager shall so remove and replace the US$ Note Trustee or such delegate, as applicable, and
provided further, that to the extent that any provision of the Transaction Documents expressly provides for the survival of certain rights or obligations following termination of such party, such provision shall be given effect.

 Important Notes:  Neither
the Manager nor the Issuer is under any obligation at any time to repurchase any Class A-1 Notes from Class A-1 Noteholders.  This
Class A-1 Note is not a certificate of title and the US$ Note Register on which these Class A-1 Notes are registered is the only conclusive evidence of the title of the abovementioned person to the Class A-1 Notes. 
The Issuer issues this Class A-1 Note only in its role as trustee of the SMART ABS Trust. Any obligation or liability of the Issuer arising under or in
any way connected with the SMART ABS Trust under the Master Trust Deed, the Series Supplement, the US$ Note Trust Deed, this Class A-1 Note or any other Transaction Document to which the Issuer is a party is limited to the extent to which it
can be satisfied out of the assets of the SMART ABS Trust out of which the Issuer is actually indemnified for the obligation or liability. This limitation will not apply to any obligation or liability of the Issuer only to the extent that it is not
so satisfied because of any fraud, negligence or wilful default on the part of the Issuer. The Issuer will have no liability for any act or omission of the Manager or of any other person (other than a person whose acts or omissions the Issuer is
liable for in accordance with any Transaction Document).  Transfers of the Class A-1 Notes must be pursuant to the annexed form of assignment and
otherwise in accordance with clause 5.3 of the Agency Agreement.  None of the Manager or any other member of the Macquarie Bank group or the Issuer in its
personal capacity or as trustee of any other trust guarantees the payment or repayment of any principal, interest or other amounts owing in respect of the Class A-1 Notes. 
The Class A-1 Notes do not represent deposits or other liabilities of the Manager or any other member of the Macquarie Bank group. The holding of the
Class A-1 Notes is subject to investment risk, including possible delays in payment and loss of income and principal invested. None of the Manager or any other member of the Macquarie Bank group stand in any way behind the capital value and/or
performance of the Class A-1 Notes, or the assets held by the SMART ABS Trust.  There is a risk that, for the purposes of ERISA and the Code, the
Class A-1 Notes may be recharacterised as equity interests in the SMART ABS Trust after their initial issuance. In the event of a withdrawal or downgrade to below investment grade of the rating of the Class A-1 Notes or a characterization
of the Class A-1 Notes as other than indebtedness under applicable local law, the subsequent purchase of the Class A-1 Notes or any interest therein by or with the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor or a plan that is subject to a law that
is similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code is and shall be prohibited.

Important Notes: 
Neither the Manager nor the Issuer is under any obligation at any time to repurchase any Class A-3[a/b] Notes from Class A-3 Noteholders. 
This Class A-3[a/b] Note is not a certificate of title and the US$ Note Register on which these Class A-3[a/b] Notes are registered is the only
conclusive evidence of the title of the abovementioned person to the Class A-3[a/b] Notes.  The Issuer issues this Class A-3[a/b] Note only in
its role as trustee of the SMART ABS Trust. Any obligation or liability of the Issuer arising under or in any way connected with the SMART ABS Trust under the Master Trust Deed, the Series Supplement, the US$ Note Trust Deed, this
Class A-3[a/b] Note or any other Transaction Document to which the Issuer is a party is limited to the extent to which it can be satisfied out of the assets of the SMART ABS Trust out of which the Issuer is actually indemnified for the
obligation or liability. This limitation will not apply to any obligation or liability of the Issuer only to the extent that it is not so satisfied because of any fraud, negligence or wilful default on the part of the Issuer. The Issuer will have no
liability for any act or omission of the Manager or of any other person (other than a person whose acts or omissions the Issuer is liable for in accordance with any Transaction Document). 
Transfers of the Class A-3[a/b] Notes must be pursuant to the annexed form of assignment and otherwise in accordance with clause 5.3 of the Agency
Agreement.  None of the Manager or any other member of the Macquarie Bank group or the Issuer in its personal capacity or as trustee of any other trust
guarantees the payment or repayment of any principal, interest or other amounts owing in respect of the Class A-3[a/b] Notes.  The
Class A-3[a/b] Notes do not represent deposits or other liabilities of the Manager or any other member of the Macquarie Bank group. The holding of the Class A-3[a/b] Notes is subject to investment risk, including possible delays in payment
and loss of income and principal invested. None of the Manager or any other member of the Macquarie Bank group stand in any way behind the capital value and/or performance of the Class A-3[a/b] Notes, or the assets held by the SMART ABS Trust.
 There is a risk that, for the purposes of ERISA and the Code, the Class A-3[a/b] Notes may be recharacterised as equity interests in the SMART ABS
Trust after their initial issuance. In the event of a withdrawal or downgrade to below investment grade of the rating of the Class A-3[a/b] Notes or a characterization of the Class A-3[a/b] Notes as other than indebtedness under applicable
local law, the subsequent purchase of the Class A-3[a/b] Notes or any interest therein by or with the assets of a Benefit Plan Investor or a plan that is subject to a law that is similar to Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code is
and shall be prohibited.

4.
Form, denomination and title of and to, and the issue of definitive, US$ Notes   


4.1
Form and denomination  The US$ Notes will initially be issued in registered
book-entry form, without interest coupons, in a minimum denomination of US$1,000 and integral multiples of US$1,000 thereafter. The initial principal amount of each US$ Note (the Initial Invested Amount in relation to that US$
Note) will be stated on its face.  The US$ Notes will be issued in definitive form in limited specific circumstances only, as
provided for in the US$ Note Trust Deed.   


4.2
Title  Title to the US$ Notes will only be shown on, and will only pass by
registration in, the register maintained by the US$ Note Registrar (the US$ Note Register) in accordance with the Agency  
  101 



Agreement. US$ Notes may be transferred, or may be exchanged for other US$ Notes of the same Class or Sub-Class in any authorised denominations and a like Invested Amount (as defined in the
Series Supplement), upon the surrender of the US$ Notes to be transferred or exchanged duly endorsed with or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer and exchange duly executed (with such execution guaranteed by an eligible guarantor
institution) and the provision of such other documents as the US$ Note Registrar may reasonably require, to a specified office of the US$ Note Registrar (as set out at the end of these Conditions or otherwise notified to US$ Noteholders) subject to
and in accordance with the Agency Agreement. No service charge may be made for any transfer or exchange, but the US$ Note Registrar may require payment by the US$ Noteholder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of US$ Notes. The US$ Note Registrar need not register transfers or exchanges of US$ Notes for a period of, in the case of book-entry notes, 2 Business Days or, in the case of definitive notes,
20 days preceding the due date for any payment with respect to the US$ Notes or for a period, not exceeding 20 days, specified by the US$ Note Trustee prior to any meeting, which includes US$ Noteholders, under the Master Trust Deed or the Master
Security Trust Deed. The Issuer Trustee, the US$ Note Trustee, the Manager, the Agent Bank and each Paying Agent may accept the correctness of the US$ Note Register and any information provided to it by the US$ Note Registrar and is not required to
enquire into its authenticity. None of the Issuer Trustee, the US$ Note Trustee, the Manager, the Agent Bank, any Paying Agent or the US$ Note Registrar is liable for any mistake in the US$ Note Register or in any purported copy except to the extent
that the mistake is attributable to its own fraud, negligence or wilful default.   


5.
Status, security and relationship between the Class A Notes, the Class B Notes and the Seller Notes   


5.1
Status of the Notes  The A$ Notes and the US$ Notes (together with the A$ Notes,
the Notes) are direct, secured (as described in Condition 5.2) and limited recourse (as described in Condition 5.3) obligations of the Issuer Trustee.  
 


5.2
Security  The obligations of the Issuer Trustee under the Notes are (amongst the
other payment obligations of the Issuer Trustee comprising the Secured Moneys (as defined in the General Security Deed)) secured, pursuant to the Master Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed in favour of the Security Trustee as trustee
for the Secured Creditors (as defined in the General Security Deed), against all of the assets (including choses in action, covenants, agreements, undertakings, representations, warranties and other rights), tangible and intangible, present or
future, held by the Issuer Trustee from time to time, of the Series Trust (the Secured Property) by virtue of a combination of:   


 
(a)
a security interest (as defined in the PPS Act) over all Secured Property which is subject to the PPSA; and   


 
(b)
a floating charge over all Secured Property which is not subject to the PPSA (such charge, together with the security interest, being the Security).  
The Secured Property includes an equitable interest in certain receivables arising under or pursuant to a Lease Contract, a Loan Contract or a
Hire Purchase Contract and the asset or assets the subject of those Lease Contracts or Hire Purchase Contracts sold on the Closing Date to the Issuer Trustee by Perpetual as trustee of one or more of the warehouse trusts established under the Master
Trust Deed and/or by the Seller. The Security is a first ranking security, subject only to the Prior Interest (as defined in the Master Security Trust Deed) in the Secured Property. 
  102 




5.3
Limited recourse  The liability of the Issuer Trustee to make interest and
principal payments on the US$ Notes is limited, except in certain limited circumstances described in Condition 13, to the extent to which the Issuer Trustee is actually indemnified from the Assets of the Series Trust available for this
purpose in accordance with, and subject to the order of priority of payments in, the Series Supplement (prior to enforcement of the Security) or the Master Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed (following enforcement of the Security).
 The net proceeds of realisation of the available assets and property of the Series Trust (including following enforcement of
the Security) may be insufficient to pay all amounts due to the US$ Noteholders and any other amounts ranking in priority to or equally with amounts due to the US$ Noteholders. Except in the limited circumstances described in Condition 13,
the assets of Perpetual held in its personal capacity will not be available for payment of any shortfall arising and all claims in respect of such shortfall will be extinguished. The assets of Perpetual held in its capacity as trustee of any other
trust (including any other series trust established pursuant to the Master Trust Deed) will not in any circumstances be available to pay any amounts due to US$ Noteholders. 
None of Macquarie Bank Limited, the Manager, the Seller, the Servicer, the US$ Note Trustee, the Security Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Agent
Bank, the Currency Swap Provider or the Unitholders, amongst others, has any obligation to any US$ Noteholder for payment of any amount owed by the Issuer Trustee in respect of the US$ Notes. 
 


5.4
No preference within the Classes of US$ Note  The Class A-1 Notes rank equally and
rateably and without any preference or priority among themselves. The Class A-2 Notes rank equally and rateably and without any preference or priority among themselves. The Class A-3 Notes rank equally and rateably and without any
preference or priority among themselves. The Class A-4 Notes rank equally and rateably and without any preference or priority among themselves.   


5.5
Ranking of interest payments of Notes prior to enforcement  Prior to the enforcement of
the Security, under the Series Supplement the payment of the relevant A$ amount by the Issuer Trustee in respect of the US$ Notes to:   


 
(a)
if a Currency Swap is in place for the relevant US$ Notes and no Currency Swap Provider Payment Default is subsisting in respect of that Currency Swap, the Currency Swap Provider (which in each case will in turn be
applied under the Class A-1 Currency Swap, the Class A-2a Currency Swap, the Class A-2b Currency Swap, the Class A-3a Currency Swap, the Class A-3b Currency Swap, the Class A-4a Currency Swap and the Class A-4b
Currency Swap, to meet the payment of interest on the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2a Notes, the Class A-2b Notes, the Class A-3a Notes, the Class A-3b Notes, the Class A-4a Notes and/or the Class A-4b Notes, as
the case may be, as explained in Conditions 6.10 to 6.16 (inclusive)); or    


 
(b)
if a Currency Swap is not in place for the relevant US$ Notes or if a Currency Swap is in place for the relevant US$ Notes but a Currency Swap Provider Payment Default is subsisting in respect of that Currency Swap, to
the Principal Paying Agent in accordance with the Agency Agreement (after exchanging such A$ amount for US$ in the spot exchange market) (which in each case will in turn be applied to meet the payment of interest on the Class A-1 Notes, the
Class A-2a Notes, the Class A-2b Notes, the Class A-3a Notes, the Class A-3b Notes, the Class A-4a Notes and/or the Class A-4b Notes, as the case may be, as explained in Conditions 6.10 to 6.16 (inclusive)),

  103 


will rank ahead of the payment of interest on the Class B Notes and the Seller Notes. 
Currency Swap Provider Payment Default has the same meaning as in the Series Supplement. 
 


5.6
Ranking of principal payments of Notes prior to enforcement  Prior to the
enforcement of the Security, under the Series Supplement the payment of the relevant A$ amounts by the Issuer Trustee in respect of the US$ Notes to:   


 
(a)
if a Currency Swap is in place for the relevant US$ Notes and no Currency Swap Provider Payment Default is subsisting in respect of that Currency Swap, the Currency Swap Provider (which in each case will in turn be
applied under the Class A-1 Currency Swap, the Class A-2a Currency Swap, the Class A-2b Currency Swap, the Class A-3a Currency Swap, the Class A-3b Currency Swap, the Class A-4a Currency Swap and the Class A-4b
Currency Swap to meet the repayment of principal on the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2a Notes, the Class A-2b Notes, the Class A-3a Notes, or the Class A-3b Notes, the Class A-4a Notes and/or the Class A-4b Notes
(as the case may be)); or   


 
(b)
if a Currency Swap is not in place for the relevant US$ Notes or if a Currency Swap is in place for the relevant US$ Notes but a Currency Swap Provider Payment Default is subsisting in respect of that Currency Swap, the
Principal Paying Agent in accordance with the Agency Agreement (after exchanging such A$ amount for US$ in the spot exchange market) (which in each case will in turn be applied to meet the repayment of principal on the Class A-1 Notes, the
Class A-2a Notes, the Class A-2b Notes, the Class A-3a Notes, the Class A-3b Notes, the Class A-4a Notes and/or the Class A-4b Notes (as the case may be)), 
will rank ahead of the repayment of principal on the Class B Notes and the Seller Notes, only for so long as the Pro Rata Paydown Test
continues to not be satisfied on the relevant Distribution Date.  As between the US$ Notes, to the extent required to reduce the A$
Invested Amount of the relevant US$ Notes to zero:   


 
(a)
the Class A-1 Notes will rank ahead of the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes for the repayment of principal; 
 


 
(b)
the Class A-2 Notes will rank ahead of the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes for the repayment of principal; and 
 


 
(c)
the Class A-3 Notes will rank ahead of the Class A-4 Notes for the repayment of principal, 
on each Distribution Date prior to enforcement of the Security. To the extent required to reduce any remaining Invested Amount of the relevant
US$ Notes (after reduction of the A$ Invested Amount of the relevant US$ Notes to zero) to zero, all US$ Notes will rank on a pari passu and rateable basis for the repayment of principal on each Distribution Date prior to enforcement of the
Security.  Prior to enforcement of the Security, if the Pro Rata Paydown Test is satisfied, the repayment of principal on the Class A
Notes, the Class B Notes and the Seller Notes will be on a pari passu and rateable basis (determined by reference to the aggregate Adjusted Invested Amount of each Sub-Class of US$ Notes and the A$ Invested Amount of each Class of A$ Notes, with the
Class A Notes to be considered in aggregate for the purpose of determining the amount allocable to the Class A Notes). As between the Class A Notes, the Class A-1 Notes will (to the extent required to reduce the A$ Invested
Amount of the Class A-1 Notes to zero but subject to not making any payment or allocation toward the Class A-1 Notes in excess of the amount required to reduce the Invested Amount of the Class A-1 Notes to zero) rank ahead of the
Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and 
  104 



the Class A-4 Notes for the repayment of principal; and the Class A-2 Notes will (to the extent required to reduce the A$ Invested Amount of the Class A-2 Notes to zero but
subject to not making any payment or allocation toward the Class A-2 Notes in excess of the amount required to reduce the Invested Amount of the Class A-2 Notes to zero) rank ahead of the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes
for the repayment of principal; and the Class A-3 Notes will (to the extent required to reduce the A$ Invested Amount of the Class A-3 Notes to zero but subject to not making any payment or allocation toward the Class A-3 Notes in
excess of the amount required to reduce the Invested Amount of the Class A-3 Notes to zero) rank ahead of the Class A-4 Notes for the repayment of principal. To the extent required to reduce any remaining Invested Amount of the relevant
US$ Notes (after reduction of the A$ Invested Amount of the relevant US$ Notes to zero) to zero, all US$ Notes will rank on a pari passu and rateable basis for the repayment of principal on each Distribution Date prior to enforcement of the
Security.  The Pro Rata Paydown Test is satisfied at any time on a Distribution Date if: 
 


 
(a)
the Subordination Percentage at that time (after any application of Total Principal Collections prior to that Distribution Date and prior to that time on that Distribution Date) is greater than or equal to 18.9%; and
  


 
(b)
the Total Collateralised Amount on the immediately preceding Determination Date when expressed as a percentage of the aggregate of the Initial Invested Amount of the A$ Notes and the A$ Equivalent of the Initial
Invested Amount of the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes is greater than 10%, 
otherwise, the Pro Rata Paydown Test is not satisfied at that time. 
A$ Invested Amount has the same meaning as in the Series Supplement. 
Currency Swap Provider Payment Default has the same meaning as in the Series Supplement. 
 


5.7
Ranking of Notes following enforcement  Following the enforcement of the Security, the
payment of amounts owing in relation to the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes will rank ahead of amounts owing in respect of the Class B Notes and the Seller Notes and, as amongst
themselves, in the order of priority set out in the General Security Deed. However, for the purposes of determining distributions to, and allocations between, the US$ Noteholders and other Secured Creditors, amounts owing in respect of the US$ Notes
will be determined in accordance with the General Security Deed.  The Master Security Trust Deed contains provisions requiring the Security
Trustee, subject to other provisions of the Master Security Trust Deed, to give priority to the interests of the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders and the Class A-4 Noteholders if there
is a conflict between the interests of those Noteholders (on the one hand) and any other Secured Creditor, including the Class B Noteholders and the Seller Noteholders (on the other hand). In determining the interests of the US$ Noteholders, the
Security Trustee may rely on a determination of the US$ Note Trustee.  A failure to pay accrued interest in respect of the Class B Notes
and the Seller Notes does not constitute an Event of Default under the Master Security Trust Deed or the General Security Deed while there are any Class A Notes outstanding. 
 


5.8
The Notes rank equally except as provided in the Transaction Documents  The Notes enjoy
the same rights, entitlements, benefits and restrictions except as expressly provided in the Transaction Documents. 
  105 




6.
Interest   


6.1
Period of accrual  Each US$ Note accrues interest from (and including)
14 October 2016 (the Closing Date) and ceases to accrue interest on (but excluding) the earliest of:   


 
(a)
the date on which the Invested Amount of that US$ Note is reduced to zero and all accrued but previously unpaid interest is paid in full; 
 


 
(b)
the date on which that US$ Note is redeemed or repaid in full in accordance with Condition 7 (other than Condition 7.6) unless, upon presentation, payment is improperly withheld or refused in
which case that US$ Note will continue to bear interest in accordance with this Condition 6 (both before and after judgment) until (but excluding) the day on which all sums due in respect of that US$ Note up to that day are received by or on
behalf of that US$ Noteholder; and   


 
(c)
the date on which the US$ Note is deemed to be redeemed in accordance with Condition 7.6.   


6.2
Interest Periods  The period that a US$ Note accrues interest in accordance with
Condition 6.1 is divided into periods (each an Interest Period). The first Interest Period for the US$ Notes commences on (and includes) the Closing Date and ends on (but does not include) the first Distribution Date
thereafter. Each succeeding Interest Period for a US$ Note commences on (and includes) a Distribution Date and ends on (but does not include) the next Distribution Date. The final Interest Period for a US$ Note ends on (but does not include) the
date on which interest ceases to accrue on the US$ Note pursuant to Condition 6.1.   Distribution
Date means the 14th day of each calendar month up to and including the Maturity Date, provided that where any of these dates is not a Business Day the Distribution Date will be the next following Business Day. The first Distribution Date
is 14 November 2016 (or if that is not a Business Day, the next Business Day)  Business Day means any
day on which banks are open for business in Sydney, Melbourne, New York City and London, other than a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday in Sydney, Melbourne, New York City or London. 
 


6.3
Interest Rate for US$ Notes  The rate of interest payable from time to time in respect
of a US$ Note and an Interest Period is the Interest Rate in relation to the US$ Note.  Interest Rate means in
relation to:    


 
(a)
a US$ Fixed Rate Note which is:   


 
(i)
a Class A-1 Note, [●]% per annum;   


 
(ii)
a Class A-2a Note, [●]% per annum; 
  106 




 
(iii)
a Class A-3a Note, [●]% per annum; and   


 
(iv)
a Class A-4a Note, [●]% per annum; and   


 
(b)
a US$ Floating Rate Note, the aggregate of USD-LIBOR-ICE (as hereinafter defined) for that Interest Period plus the Margin (as hereinafter defined) in relation to the US$ Floating Rate Note. 
USD-LIBOR-ICE for an Interest Period will be calculated by the Agent Bank in accordance with paragraphs (a) and
(b), as applicable, below.   


 
(a)
on the second London/New York Business Day before the beginning of the Interest Period (a US$ Floating Rate Set Date) the Agent Bank will determine the rate USD-LIBOR-ICE, as the
applicable Floating Rate Option, as being the rate applicable to any Interest Period for one month deposits in US$ in the London inter bank market which appears on the Rate Page at approximately 11.45am, (London time) on the US$ Floating Rate Set
Date; and   


 
(b)
if the rate referred to in paragraph (a) does not appear on the Rate Page on the relevant US$ Floating Rate Set Date, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be determined as if the Issuer Trustee and the
Agent Bank had specified USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks, as the applicable Floating Rate Option. For this purpose USD-LIBOR-Reference Banks means that the rate for an Interest Period will be determined on the basis of the rates at
which deposits in US$ are offered by the Reference Banks (being four major banks in the London interbank market determined by the Agent Bank) at approximately 11.00am, London time, on the US$ Floating Rate Set Date to prime banks in the London
interbank market for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a Representative Amount (as defined in the 2006 ISDA Definitions of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc.). The Agent Bank will
request the principal London office of each of the Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such quotations are provided, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the quotations. If fewer
than two quotations are provided as requested, the USD-LIBOR-ICE for that Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by not less than two major banks in New York City, selected by the Agent Bank, at approximately 11.00am, New
York City time, on that US$ Floating Rate Set Date for loans in US$ to leading European banks for a period of one month commencing on the first day of the Interest Period and in a Representative Amount. If no such rates are available in New York
City, then the USD-LIBOR-ICE for such Interest Period will be the most recently determined rate in accordance with paragraph (a). 
London/New York Business Day means any day on which banks are open for business in London and New York City, other
than a Saturday, a Sunday or a public holiday in London or New York City.  Rate Page means the Reuters
Screen LIBOR01 Page or, if the Reuters Screen LIBOR01 Page ceases to quote the relevant rate, such other screen, page, section or part of Reuters or Bloomberg as quotes the relevant rate and is selected by the Agent Bank. 
Margin means in relation to:    


 
(a)
a Class A-2b Note, [●]% per annum;   


 
(b)
a Class A-3b Note, [●]% per annum; and   


 
(c)
A Class A-4b Note, [●]% per annum. 
  107 


There is no maximum or minimum Interest Rate for the Class A-2b Notes, the Class A-3b
Notes or the Class A-4b Notes.   


6.4
Calculation of interest on the US$ Notes   


 
(a)
(US$ Fixed Rate Notes): Interest on each US$ Fixed Rate Note for an Interest Period in relation to a US$ Fixed Rate Note (the US$ Fixed Rate Interest Amount) is calculated in accordance with
the following formula:   










FXIA 
 
=
 
IA x IR x N
  



 

 
360
  

  








where:
  

  






FXIA
  
=
  
the US$ Fixed Rate Interest Amount in respect of that US$ Fixed Rate Note for that Interest Period;





IA
  
=
  
the Invested Amount of that US$ Fixed Rate Note on the first day of that Interest Period (after taking into account any reductions in the Invested Amount of that US$ Fixed Rate Note on that day); and





IR
  
=
  
the Interest Rate for that US$ Fixed Rate Note.





N
  
=
  
 in relation to the Class A-1 Notes, the number of days in that Interest Period and, in relation to the Class A-2a Notes, the Class A-3a
Notes and the Class A-4a Note, 30 except in relation to:  
(a)       the first Interest Period; and
  (b)      if the
last Interest Period does not end on a Distribution Date, the last Interest Period,   in
which case, N will be the number of days in that Interest Period assuming a 30/360 day count convention.
  


 
(b)
(US$ Floating Rate Notes): Interest on each US$ Floating Rate Note for an Interest Period in relation to a US$ Floating Rate Note (the US$ Floating Rate Interest Amount) is calculated in
accordance with the following formula:   










FLIA
 
=
 
IA x IR x N
  



 

 
360
  

  








where:
  

  






FLIA
  
=
  
the US$ Floating Rate Interest Amount in respect of that US$ Floating Rate Note for that Interest Period;





IA
  
=

Each of the persons appearing from time to time in the records of the Depository (as defined in the US$ Note Trust Deed) as the beneficial
owner of a US$ Note in book-entry form will be entitled to receive any payment so made in respect to that US$ Note in accordance with the respective rules and procedures of the Depository (as defined in the US$ Note Trust Deed). Such persons will
have no claim directly against the Issuer Trustee in respect of payments due on the US$ Notes in book-entry form which must be made by the holder of that US$ Note, for so long as such US$ Note in book-entry form is outstanding. 
A record of each payment made on a US$ Note in book-entry form, distinguishing between any payment of principal and any payment of interest,
will be recorded in the US$ Note Register by the US$ Note Registrar in relation to the US$ Notes and such record shall be prima facie evidence that the payment in question has been made. 
 


8.9
Payments on Business Days  If the due date for any amount of principal or interest in
respect of any Class A-1 Note, Class A-2 Note, Class A-3 Note or Class A-4 Note is not a Business Day then payment will not be made until the next succeeding Business Day and the relevant Class A-1 Noteholder, Class A-2

Resolution (as defined in the Master Security Trust Deed) of the Voting Secured Creditors if in its opinion, the delay required to obtain the consent of the Voting Secured Creditors would be prejudicial to the interests of the Voting Secured
Creditors as a class. 
  126 




10.3
Priority of Payments from Proceeds from the Enforcement of the Security  Following the
enforcement of the Security, all moneys received in connection with the Master Security Trust Deed by the Security Trustee or by any receiver appointed in relation to the Secured Property pursuant to the provisions of the Master Security Trust Deed
are to be applied, subject to the Master Security Trust Deed, in accordance with the order of priority contained in the Master Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed. 
 


10.4
Security Trustee and US$ Note Trustee Not Liable for Loss on Enforcement  Except in the
case of fraud, negligence or wilful default, neither the US$ Note Trustee nor the Security Trustee is liable for any decline in the value, nor any loss realised upon any sale or other disposition made under the Master Security Trust Deed, of any
Secured Property or any other property which is secured in favour of the Security Trustee by any other person in respect of or relating to the obligations of the Issuer Trustee or any third party in respect of the Issuer Trustee, the Class A-1
Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes or the Class A-4 Notes or relating in any way to the Secured Property. Without limitation, neither the US$ Note Trustee nor the Security Trustee will be liable for any such decline or
loss directly or indirectly arising from its acting, or failing to act, as a consequence of an opinion reached by it based on advice received by it in accordance with the applicable requirements of the US$ Note Trust Deed or the Master Security
Trust Deed, as the case may be. Any liability of the Security Trustee and the US$ Note Trustee under the Transaction Documents is several and not joint.   


10.5
Directions from Class A-1 Noteholders, Class A-2 Noteholders, Class A-3 Noteholders and Class A-4 Noteholders to US$ Note Trustee following Event of Default 
If an Event of Default has occurred and the US$ Note Trustee has received notice of the occurrence from the Manager, the Security
Trustee or the Issuer Trustee in accordance with the Master Security Trust Deed or the US$ Note Trust Deed or otherwise becomes aware of the occurrence of an Event of Default pursuant to this Condition 10.5, the US$ Note Trustee must:
(a) notify each Class A-1 Noteholder, each Class A-2 Noteholder, each Class A-3 Noteholder, each Class A-4 Noteholder and such other persons as are specified in section 313(c) of the TIA (with a copy to the Issuer Trustee
and the Manager) of the Event of Default within 10 days of receiving such notice or otherwise becoming aware of such occurrence, provided that except in the case of a default in payment of principal or interest on any Class A-1 Note,
Class A-2 Note, Class A-3 Note or Class A-4 Note the US$ Note Trustee may withhold such notice from the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders and the Class A-4 Noteholders if
and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of its directors and/or its Authorised Officers under the US$ Note Trust Deed in good faith determine that withholding the notice is in the interest of the
Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders and the Class A-4 Noteholders; and (b) if a meeting of Voting Secured Creditors is to be held under the Master Security Trust Deed, convene a
meeting of Class A-1 Noteholders, Class A-2 Noteholders, Class A-3 Noteholders and Class A-4 Noteholders to seek directions from the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders and
the Class A-4 Noteholders as to how to vote at the meeting of the Voting Secured Creditors.  If any of the Class A-1
Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes or the Class A-4 Notes remain outstanding and are due and payable otherwise than by reason of a default in payment of any amount due on the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2
Notes, the Class A-3 Notes or the Class A-4 Notes, the US$ Note Trustee must not vote at a meeting of Voting Secured Creditors on behalf of the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders or
the Class A-4 Noteholders under the Master Security Trust Deed, or otherwise direct the Security Trustee, to dispose of the Secured Property unless:   


 
(a)
the US$ Note Trustee is so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the US$ Note Trust Deed) of Class A-1 Noteholders, Class A-2 Noteholders, Class A-3 Noteholders and Class A-4
Noteholders (as a single Class); or 
  127 




 
(b)
the US$ Noteholders fail to provide direction to the US$ Note Trustee as to how to vote under the Master Security Trust Deed or otherwise direct the Security Trustee and the US$ Note Trustee is of the opinion, reached
after considering at any time and from time to time the advice of an investment bank or other financial adviser selected by the US$ Note Trustee in good faith and with due care, that: 
 


 
(i)
a sufficient amount would be realised to discharge in full all amounts owing to the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders, the Class A4 Noteholders and any other
amounts owing by the Issuer Trustee to any other person ranking in priority to or with the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes; or 
 


 
(ii)
the cash flow receivable by the Issuer Trustee (or the Security Trustee under the Master Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed ) if the Secured Property is not disposed of will not (or that there is a
significant risk that it will not) be sufficient, having regard to any other relevant actual, contingent or prospective liabilities of the Issuer Trustee, to discharge in full in due course all the amounts referred to in paragraph (i) above.
 Subject to the provisions in the US$ Note Trust Deed relating to the deemed receipt of notices, the US$ Note Trustee will
only be considered to have knowledge or awareness of, or notice of, an Event of Default by virtue of the officers of the US$ Note Trustee (or any related body corporate of the US$ Note Trustee) which have the day to day responsibility for the
administration or management of the US$ Note Trustees (or a related body corporate of the US$ Note Trustees) obligations in relation to the Series Trust, the trust created under the US$ Note Trust Deed or the US$ Note Trust Deed, having
actual knowledge, actual awareness or actual notice of the occurrence of the events or circumstances constituting an Event of Default or grounds or reason to believe that such events or circumstances have occurred. 
 


10.6
Only Security Trustee May Enforce Security  Only the Security Trustee may enforce the
Security and neither the US$ Note Trustee nor any US$ Noteholder (nor any other Secured Creditor) is entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer Trustee to enforce the performance of any of the provisions of the Master Security Trust Deed, the
General Security Deed, the US$ Note Trust Deed, the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes, the Class A-4 Notes or any other applicable Transaction Document, except as provided for in the Master Security Trust
Deed, the General Security Deed, the US$ Note Trust Deed, the Master Trust Deed and the Series Supplement. The Security Trustee is not required to act in relation to the enforcement of the Security unless its liability is limited in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to it or, if required by the Security Trustee (in its absolute discretion), it is adequately indemnified from the Secured Property or the Security Trustee receives from the Voting Secured Creditors (which expression shall,
where the US$ Note Trustee is a Voting Secured Creditor, include the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders and the Class A-4 Noteholders in place of the US$ Note Trustee) an indemnity in a
form reasonably satisfactory to the Security Trustee (which may be by way of an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Master Security Trust Deed) of the Voting Secured Creditors) and is put in funds to the extent necessary. 
  128 




10.7
Exercise of US$ Noteholder rights by US$ Note Trustee  The rights, remedies and
discretions of the US$ Noteholders under the Master Security Trust Deed including all rights to vote or to give an instruction or consent can only be exercised by the US$ Note Trustee on behalf of the US$ Noteholders in accordance with the Master
Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed and the mandatory provisions of the TIA, unless the US$ Note Trustee has become bound to take steps or to proceed under the US$ Note Trust Deed and fails to do so within a reasonable time and such
failure is continuing. The Security Trustee may rely on any instructions or directions given to it by the US$ Note Trustee as being given on behalf of the US$ Noteholders from time to time and need not inquire whether any such instructions or
directions are in accordance with the US$ Note Trust Deed, whether the US$ Note Trustee and the US$ Noteholders from time to time have complied with any requirements under the US$ Note Trust Deed or as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the US$
Note Trustee.   


11.
Meetings of Voting Secured Creditors, Directions of US$ Noteholders, Modifications, Consents, Waivers and Indemnities   


11.1
Meetings of Voting Secured Creditors  The Master Security Trust Deed contains provisions
for convening meetings of the Voting Secured Creditors to, among other things, enable the Voting Secured Creditors by an Extraordinary Resolution to direct or consent to the Security Trustee taking or not taking certain actions under the Master
Security Trust Deed. For example, the relevant provisions enable the Voting Secured Creditors, following the occurrence of an Event of Default, to direct the Security Trustee to declare the Notes immediately due and payable, to appoint a receiver
over the Secured Property, to instruct the Security Trustee to sell and realize the Secured Property or to take such other actions as the Voting Secured Creditors may otherwise specify in the Extraordinary Resolution. 
 


11.2
Directions of US$ Noteholders  Under the US$ Note Trust Deed the US$ Note Trustee may
convene a meeting of the US$ Noteholders as a whole or the US$ Noteholders in respect of a Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes only, to seek directions from such US$ Noteholders, from time to time including following the occurrence of an Event of
Default. All such meetings must be held in New York City. The US$ Note Trustee will not be responsible for acting in good faith upon a direction given, or purporting to be given, by a Resolution (as defined in the US$ Note Trust Deed) of the US$
Noteholders as a whole or the US$ Noteholders in respect of a Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes only.  If the US$ Note Trustee is entitled
under the Master Trust Deed, the Master Security Trust Deed or the General Security Deed to vote at any meeting, or give any direction or consent, on behalf of the US$ Noteholders or any Class or Sub-Class of US$ Noteholders, the US$ Note Trustee
must vote, consent or direct in accordance with the directions of the US$ Noteholders or the relevant Class or Sub-Class of US$ Noteholders and, in the event that such directions are not forthcoming, in its absolute discretion. In acting in
accordance with the directions of the US$ Noteholders or any Class or Sub-Class of US$ Noteholders, the US$ Note Trustee must exercise its votes for or against any proposal to be put to a meeting in the same proportion (rounded to the nearest whole
vote) as that of the votes cast for or against such a proposal at a meeting of the US$ Noteholders or the relevant Class or Sub-Class of US$ Noteholders convened in accordance with the US$ Note Trust Deed by the US$ Note Trustee for the purpose of
seeking directions.  Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of any other Transaction Document, each US$ Note Owner (as
defined in the US$ Note Trust Deed) will only be permitted to exercise consent or voting rights with respect to the US$ Notes to the extent such US$ Note Owner has completed the appropriate proxy forms directing the direct or indirect Clearing
Agency Participants through whom 
  129 



it holds its beneficial interests in the US$ Notes. For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Clearing Agency nor the Depository will consent or vote with respect to the US$ Notes unless authorised
by a direct Clearing Agency Participant in accordance with the procedures of the Clearing Agency. Under its usual procedures, the Clearing Agency mails an omnibus proxy to the US$ Note Trustee as soon as possible after the relevant Record Date,
which assigns the consent or voting rights of the Depository to those Clearing Agency Participants to whose accounts the US$ Notes are credited on the Record Date, identified in a listing attached to the proxy. 
 


11.3
Amendments to US$ Note Trust Deed and the US$ Notes  Pursuant, and subject, to
the US$ Note Trust Deed and subject to any approval required by law, the US$ Note Trustee, the Manager, MLPL and the Issuer Trustee may together agree, without the consent or sanction of any US$ Noteholder (other than in the case of Condition
11.3(d)(ii)), by way of supplemental deed to amend, add to or revoke any provision of the US$ Note Trust Deed, the US$ Notes (including these Conditions) or any other Transaction Document to which the US$ Note Trustee is a party, so long as such
amendment, addition or revocation, in the opinion of the Manager (or a barrister, solicitor or attorney instructed by the Manager):   


 
(a)
is necessary or expedient to comply with the provisions of any statute or regulation or with the requirements of any governmental agency; 
 


 
(b)
is made to correct a manifest error or ambiguity or is of a formal, technical or administrative nature only;   


 
(c)
is appropriate or expedient as a consequence of an amendment to any statute or regulation or altered requirements of any governmental agency or any decision of any court (including, without limitation, an amendment,
addition or revocation which is in the opinion of the Manager appropriate or expedient as a consequence of the enactment of a statute or regulation or an amendment to any statute or regulation or ruling by the Australian Commissioner or Deputy
Commissioner of Taxation or any governmental announcement or statement or any decision of any court, in any case which has or may have the effect of altering the manner or basis of taxation of trusts generally or of trusts similar to the Series
Trust or the trust constituted under the US$ Note Trust Deed); or   


 
(d)
is otherwise desirable for any reason and:   


 
(i)
is not in the opinion of the Manager likely, upon coming into effect, to be materially prejudicial to the interests of the US$ Noteholders when taken as a whole or to the interests of the US$ Noteholders in respect of
any Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes; or   


 
(ii)
if it is in the opinion of the Manager likely, upon coming into effect, to be materially prejudicial to the interests of the US$ Noteholders when taken as a whole or to the interests of the US$ Noteholders in respect of
any Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes, the consent of the US$ Noteholders as a whole or of the US$ Noteholders in respect of the relevant Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes (as the case may be), by an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the US$ Note
Trust Deed) to the amendment, addition or revocation has been obtained. For the purpose of determining whether the US$ Noteholders as a whole or of the US$ Noteholders in respect of the relevant Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes (as the case may be)
have consented, by an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the US$ Note Trust Deed) to an amendment, addition or revocation, US$ Notes with respect to which the US$ Note Trustee has received actual written notice that such US$ Notes are owned by
the Issuer Trustee or the Manager or by any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer Trustee or the Manager, will be disregarded, 
  130 


provided that the US$ Note Trustee, the Manager, MLPL or the Issuer Trustee may not amend, add to
or revoke any provision of the US$ Note Trust Deed or any US$ Notes unless the Manager has notified the Rating Agencies 5 Business Days in advance of any such amendment, addition or revocation becoming effective. 
The US$ Note Trustee must, in accordance with Condition 12, notify all US$ Noteholders of any amendment, addition or revocation
made pursuant to this Condition 11.3 as soon as reasonably practicable after the amendment, addition or revocation has been made and the US$ Note Trustee must make a copy of any such amendment, addition or revocation available at its offices
to the US$ Noteholders.  Any supplemental deed amending, adding to or revoking any provision of the US$ Note Trust Deed or the US$
Notes (including these Conditions) must conform, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of the TIA.   


11.4
Waivers, etc  The Security Trustee may, in accordance with the Master Security Trust
Deed and without the consent or sanction of the Voting Secured Creditors (but not in contravention of an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Master Security Trust Deed) of the Voting Secured Creditors), waive or authorise any breach or
proposed breach or determine that any event that would otherwise be an Event of Default will not be treated as such if and in so far as in its opinion the interests of the Secured Creditors will not be materially prejudiced. Any such waiver,
authorisation or determination shall be binding on the Secured Creditors and, if, but only if, the Security Trustee so requires, any such waiver, authorisation or determination will be notified to the Secured Creditors by the Manager in accordance
with the Master Security Trust Deed.  The US$ Note Trustee may, without the consent of any of the US$ Noteholders, or if directed to do so
by a Resolution of all US$ Noteholders (as defined in the US$ Note Trust Deed) the US$ Note Trustee must, on such terms and conditions as it may deem reasonable, and without prejudice to its rights in respect of any subsequent breach, agree to any
waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of any of the terms and conditions of the Transaction Documents by the Issuer Trustee, the Manager or any other person which is not, in the opinion of the US$ Note Trustee, materially
prejudicial to the interests of the US$ Noteholders when taken as a whole or to the interests of the US$ Noteholders in respect of a Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes only (unless the US$ Note Trustee is acting on the direction of a Resolution of the
US$ Noteholders when taken as a whole or the US$ Noteholders in respect of a relevant Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes only, as the case may be, in which case the US$ Note Trustee must agree to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed
breach notwithstanding any such material prejudice). No such waiver, authorisation or determination may be made in contravention of any prior directions by a Resolution of US$ Noteholders when taken as a whole or of the US$ Noteholders in respect of
a Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes only, as the case may be. No direction of the US$ Noteholders when taken as a whole or of the US$ Noteholders in respect of a Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes only, as the case may be, shall affect any such waiver,
authorisation or determination previously given or made. Any such waiver, authorisation or determination will be notified to the Rating Agencies and, if the US$ Note Trustee so requires, be notified to the US$ Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 12 by the Issuer Trustee (as directed by the Manager) as soon as practicable after it is made. 
  131 




11.5
Indemnification and Exoneration of the US$ Note Trustee and the Security Trustee  The
US$ Note Trust Deed, the General Security Deed and the Master Security Trust Deed contain provisions for the indemnification of the US$ Note Trustee and the Security Trustee (respectively) and for their relief from responsibility, including
provisions relieving them from taking proceedings to realise the security and to obtain repayment of the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes unless indemnified to their satisfaction.
Each of the US$ Note Trustee and the Security Trustee is entitled to enter into business transactions in its personal capacity with the Issuer Trustee and/or any other party to the Transaction Documents without accounting for any profit resulting
from such transactions.  The US$ Note Trustee is not responsible for any loss, expense or liability occasioned to the Secured Property or
any other assets or in respect of all or any of the moneys which may stand to the credit of the Collections Account from time to time however caused (including, without limitation, where caused by an act or omission of the Security Trustee) unless
that loss is occasioned by the fraud, negligence or wilful default of the US$ Note Trustee. The Security Trustee is not liable or otherwise accountable for any omission, delay or mistake or any loss or irregularity in or about the exercise,
attempted exercise, non-exercise or purported exercise of any of the powers of the Security Trustee or of the receiver under the Master Security Trust Deed and the General Security Deed except for fraud, negligence or wilful default on the part of
the Security Trustee.  Except in the case of fraud, negligence or wilful default on its own part, the US$ Note Trustee may act on the
opinion or advice of, or information obtained from, any lawyer, valuer, banker, broker, accountant or other expert appointed by the US$ Note Trustee, or by a person other than the US$ Note Trustee, where that opinion, advice or information is
addressed to the US$ Note Trustee or by its terms is expressed to be capable of being relied upon by the US$ Note Trustee. Except as provided above, the US$ Note Trustee will not be responsible to any Class A-1 Noteholder, Class A-2
Noteholder, Class A-3 Noteholder or Class A-4 Noteholder, amongst others, for any loss occasioned by so acting in reliance on such advice. Any such opinion, advice or information may be sent or obtained by letter, telex or facsimile
transmission and the US$ Note Trustee will not be liable to any Class A-1 Noteholder, Class A-2 Noteholder, Class A-3 Noteholder or Class A-4 Noteholder, amongst others, for acting on any opinion, advice or information conforming
with any applicable requirements of the US$ Note Trust Deed and the TIA even though it contains some error which is not a manifest error or is not authentic. Additional powers and protections of the US$ Note Trustee are contained in the US$ Note
Trust Deed.   


12.
Notices   


12.1
General  Subject to clause 3.3(e)(ii) of the US$ Note Trust Deed, all notices,
other than notices given in accordance with the following paragraph and Condition 12.2, to US$ Noteholders will be deemed given if in writing and mailed, postage prepaid to each US$ Noteholder, at his or her address as it appears on the US$
Note Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to US$ Noteholders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice nor any defect in
any notice so mailed to any particular US$ Noteholder will affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other US$ Noteholders, and any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided will conclusively be presumed to have been duly
given.  A notice may be waived in writing by the relevant US$ Noteholder, either before or after the event, and such waiver will be
the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by US$ Noteholders will be filed with the US$ Note Trustee but such filing will not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such a waiver. 
Any such notice will be deemed to have been given on the date such notice is deposited in the mail. 
  132 


In case, by reason of the suspension of regular mail services as a result of a strike, work
stoppage or similar activity, it is impractical to mail notice of any event to US$ Noteholders when such notice is required to be given, then any manner of giving such notice as the Issuer Trustee directs the US$ Note Trustee will be deemed to be a
sufficient giving of such notice.   


12.2
Note information  Any notice specifying a Distribution Date, an Interest Amount,
a Principal Amount (or the absence of a Principal Amount), a Principal Balance, an Invested Amount, a Collateralised Amount or a Note Factor in relation to the US$ Notes, or any other matter permitted to be given in accordance with this Condition
12.2, will be deemed to have been duly given if the information contained in the notice:    


 
(a)
appears on the relevant page of the Reuters Screen or the electronic information system made available to its subscribers by Bloomberg, L.P. or another similar electronic reporting service approved by the US$ Note
Trustee in writing and notified to US$ Noteholders pursuant to Condition 12.1 (the Relevant Screen); or   


 
(b)
is set out in any filing made by the Issuer (or MLPL on its behalf) with the Commission. 
Any such notice will be deemed to have been given on the first date on which such information appeared on the Relevant Screen or the
relevant filing was made with the Commission. If it is impossible or impracticable to give notice in accordance with this paragraph then notice of the matters referred to in this Condition 12.2 will be given in accordance with
Condition 12.1.   


12.3
Consents in writing  All consents, approvals and waivers given pursuant to these
Conditions must be given in writing.   


13.
Limitation of Liability of the Issuer Trustee   


 
(a)
The Transaction Documents apply to the Issuer Trustee, and the Issuer Trustee issues the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes and the Class A-4 Notes, only in its capacity as
trustee of the Series Trust and in no other capacity (except where the Transaction Documents provide otherwise). A liability arising under or in connection with the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes, the
Class A-4 Notes, the Transaction Documents or the Series Trust is limited to and can be enforced against the Issuer Trustee only to the extent to which it can be satisfied out of the Assets of the Series Trust out of which the Issuer Trustee is
actually indemnified for the liability. This limitation of the Issuer Trustees liability applies despite any other provision of the Transaction Documents (other than paragraph (c) of this Condition 13 below) and extends to all
liabilities and obligations of the Issuer Trustee in any way connected with any representation, warranty, conduct, omission, agreement or transaction related to the Transaction Documents, the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the
Class A-3 Notes, the Class A-4 Notes or the Series Trust.   


 
(b)
No person may sue the Issuer Trustee in respect of liabilities incurred by the Issuer Trustee in its capacity as trustee of the Series Trust other than as trustee of the Series Trust or seek the appointment of a
receiver (except under the Master Security Trust Deed), a liquidator, an administrator or any similar person to the Issuer Trustee or prove in any liquidation, administration or similar arrangements of or affecting the Issuer Trustee (except in
relation to the Assets of the Series Trust).   


 
(c)
 The provisions of this Condition 13 will not apply to any obligation or liability of the Issuer Trustee to
the extent that it is not satisfied because under the Master Trust Deed or the Series 
  133 




 

Supplement or by operation of law there is a reduction in the extent of the Issuer Trustees indemnification or exoneration out of the Assets of the Series Trust as a result of the Issuer
Trustees fraud, negligence or wilful default.   


 
(d)
It is acknowledged that the Relevant Parties are responsible under the Transaction Documents for performing a variety of obligations relating to the Series Trust. No act or omission of the Issuer Trustee (including any
related failure to satisfy its obligations under the Transaction Documents, the Class A-1 Notes, the Class A-2 Notes, the Class A-3 Notes or the Class A-4 Notes) will be considered fraud, negligence or wilful default of the
Issuer Trustee for the purpose of paragraph (c) of this Condition 13 to the extent to which the act or omission was caused or contributed to by any failure by any Relevant Party or any other person appointed by the Issuer Trustee
under any Transaction Document (other than a person whose acts or omissions the Issuer Trustee is liable for in accordance with any Transaction Document) to fulfil its obligations relating to the Series Trust or by any other act or omission of a
Relevant Party or any other such person.   


 
(e)
In exercising their powers under the Transaction Documents, each of the Security Trustee, the US$ Note Trustee, the Class A-1 Noteholders, the Class A-2 Noteholders, the Class A-3 Noteholders and the
Class A-4 Noteholders must ensure that no attorney, agent, delegate, receiver or receiver and manager appointed by it in accordance with a Transaction Document has authority to act on behalf of the Issuer Trustee in a way which exposes the
Issuer Trustee to any personal liability and no act or omission of any such person will be considered fraud, negligence or wilful default of the Issuer Trustee for the purpose of paragraph (c) of this Condition 13.
  


 
(f)
The Issuer Trustee is not obliged to enter into any commitment or obligation under these Conditions or any other Transaction Document (including any further liability) unless the Issuer Trustees liability is
limited in a manner which is consistent with this Condition 13 or otherwise in a manner satisfactory to the Issuer Trustee in its absolute discretion. 
The expression fraud, negligence or wilful default is to be construed in accordance with the Master Security Trust
Deed and US$ Note Trust Deed.   


14.
Governing law  The US$ Notes and the Transaction Documents (with the exception of the
Fixed Rate Swap Agreement and Currency Swap Agreement (which are governed by the laws of the State of New South Wales) and the Underwriting Agreement (which is governed by the laws of the state of New York)) are governed by, and will be construed in
accordance with, the laws of the Australian Capital Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia.  Each of the Issuer Trustee, the US$ Note
Trustee, the Manager, MLPL and each US$ Noteholder has in the US$ Note Trust Deed irrevocably agreed that the courts of the Australian Capital Territory of the Commonwealth of Australia are to have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes
which may arise out of or in connection with the US$ Note Trust Deed.  Each of the Issuer Trustee, the US$ Note Trustee and the US$
Noteholders has in the US$ Note Trust Deed irrevocably agreed that the federal and state courts in the Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York are to have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any disputes which may arise out of or in connection
with the US$ Note Trust Deed.

VOTING PROCEDURE   


8.1

Representative. 
  138 




8.2
Declaration  At any meeting, unless a poll is (before or on the declaration of the
result of the show of hands) demanded by the chairman, the US$ Note Trustee or by one or more persons being US$ Noteholders holding, or being Representatives representing, in aggregate not less than 2% of the aggregate outstanding Invested Amount of
the US$ Notes at that time, a declaration by the chairman that a resolution has been carried by a particular majority or lost or not carried by any particular majority is conclusive evidence of the fact without proof of the number or proportion of
the votes recorded in favour of or against such resolution.   


8.3
Poll  If at any meeting a poll is so demanded, it will be taken in such manner and
(subject as hereinafter provided) either at once or after such an adjournment as the chairman directs and the result of such poll will be deemed to be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded as at the date of the taking of the
poll. The demand for a poll will not prevent the continuance of the meeting for the transaction of any business other than the question on which the poll has been demanded.   


8.4
No Adjournment  Any poll demanded at any meeting on the election of a chairman or on any
question of adjournment will be taken at the meeting without adjournment.

(b)
(Poll): on a poll every person who is so present has, subject to the following, one vote for each US$1,000 of the principal outstanding of each US$ Note at that time that he or she holds or in respect of which he
or she is a Representative.  Any person entitled to more than one vote need not use all his or her votes or cast all
his or her votes to which he is entitled in the same way.   


9.
RIGHT TO ATTEND AND SPEAK  The Issuer, the US$ Note Trustee, the Manager and the
Security Trustee (through their respective representatives) and their respective financial and legal advisers are entitled to attend and speak at any meeting of US$ Noteholders. No person is otherwise entitled to attend or vote at any meeting of the
US$ Noteholders unless he or she holds outstanding US$ Notes or is a Representative representing outstanding US$ Notes.   


10.
APPOINTMENT OF PROXIES   


10.1
Requirements  Each appointment of a proxy must be in writing and, together (if so
required by the US$ Note Trustee) with proof satisfactory to the US$ Note Trustee of its due execution, must be deposited at the registered office of the US$ Note Trustee or at such other place as the US$ Note Trustee designates or approves not less
than 24 hours before the time appointed for holding the meeting or 
  139 



adjourned meeting at which the named proxy proposes to vote and in default, the appointment of proxy will not be treated as valid unless the chairman of the meeting decides otherwise before the
meeting or adjourned meeting proceeds to business. A notarially certified copy proof as aforesaid (if applicable) of due execution will if required by the US$ Note Trustee be produced by the proxy at the meeting or adjourned meeting but the US$ Note
Trustee is not obliged to investigate or be concerned with the validity of, or the authority of, the proxy named in any such appointment. The proxy named in any appointment of proxy need not be a US$ Noteholder. 
 


10.2
Proxy Remains Valid  Any vote given in accordance with the terms of an appointment of
proxy conforming with Clause 10.1 of this Schedule 6 is valid notwithstanding the previous revocation or amendment of the appointment of proxy or of any of the US$ Noteholders instructions pursuant to which it was executed if no intimation in
writing of the revocation or amendment is received by the US$ Note Trustee at its registered office or by the chairman of the meeting not less than 24 hours before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the appointment of
proxy is used.   


11.
CORPORATE REPRESENTATIVES  If a US$ Noteholder is a body corporate, a person authorised
pursuant to section 375 of the Companies Act, 1985 (UK), or the equivalent section in the Companies Act (or equivalent) of the jurisdiction in which the US$ Noteholder is incorporated, to act for it at any meeting will, in accordance with his
or her authority until his or her authority is revoked by the body corporate concerned, be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of that body corporate as that body corporate could exercise if it were an individual US$ Noteholder and is
entitled to produce evidence of his or her authority to act at any time before the time appointed for the holding of or at the meeting or adjourned meeting or for the taking of a poll at which he or she proposes to vote. The US$ Note Trustee and any
officer of the US$ Note Trustee may be appointed a Representative.   


12.
RIGHTS OF REPRESENTATIVES  A Representative of a US$ Noteholder has the right to demand
or join in demanding a poll and (except and to the extent to which the Representative is specially directed to vote for or against any proposal) has power generally to act at a meeting for the US$ Noteholder. 
 


13.
POWERS OF A MEETING  A meeting has, without prejudice to any rights or powers conferred
on other persons by the US$ Note Conditions, only such powers as are conferred by the US$ Note Conditions or the US$ Note Trust Deed exercisable by Resolution or Extraordinary Resolution, as the case may be, and, in addition, the following powers,
exercisable by Extraordinary Resolution:

formed; 
  140 




 
(d)

Extraordinary Resolution.   


14.
EXTRAORDINARY RESOLUTION BINDING   


 
(a)
(US$ Noteholders as a whole): An Extraordinary Resolution passed at a meeting of the US$ Noteholders as a whole duly convened and held in accordance with this Schedule 6 is binding upon all the US$ Noteholders

15.
MINUTES AND RECORDS  Minutes of all resolutions and proceedings at every meeting must be
made and duly entered in the books to be from time to time provided for that purpose by the US$ Note Trustee. Any minutes purporting to be signed by the chairman of the meeting at which such resolutions were passed or proceedings transacted or by
the chairman of the next succeeding meeting are conclusive evidence of the matters therein contained and until the contrary is proved every such meeting in respect of the proceedings of which minutes have been made and signed as aforesaid will be
deemed to have been duly convened and held and all resolutions passed or proceedings transacted thereat to have been duly passed and transacted.   


16.
WRITTEN RESOLUTIONS  Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this Schedule 6, a
resolution (including an Extraordinary Resolution) of the US$ Noteholders as a whole or of the US$ Noteholders in respect of any Class or Sub-Class of US$ Notes only may be passed, without any meeting or previous notice being required, by an
instrument or instruments in writing which has or have:

Note Conditions or the US$ Note Trust Deed, the Issuer may without the consent of the US$ Noteholders prescribe such further regulations regarding the holding of meetings of the US$ Noteholders and attendance and voting thereat as the Issuer may in
its sole discretion determine including particularly (but without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) such regulations and requirements as the Issuer thinks reasonable:

(Forms of Representative): as to the form of appointment of a Representative. 
  142

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
