Rare Earth Elements
Rare earth elements (REEs), or lanthanides, are a group of 15 elements in the periodic table with unique chemical, physical, and optical properties. Often included in this group is yttrium, which not only possesses similar characteristics to REEs, but is also frequently contained within the same mineral deposits. Although the elements themselves are found widely dispersed in the Earth’s crust, economic deposits are a rarity. These elements are only found with other REEs and do not occur individually.

RARE EARTH FACTS
REEs enable many of the world’s most advanced technologies serving as key components in mankind’s quest for electronics miniaturization, energy efficiency, environmental stewardship, and technological advancement. While REEs have long played an underlying role in technology development, recent attention to global supply/demand dynamics and overall industry structure has brought their importance to the forefront. About 95 percent of all REEs are produced in China. This has raised concern around the world, particularly as China has taken steps to curb production–and exports–of these key elements.

REEs include the following:





Cerium
Dysprosium
Erbium
Europium




Gadolinium
Holmium
Lanthanum
Lutetium




Neodymium
Praseodymium
Promethium
Samarium




Scandium
Terbium
Thulium
Ytterbium




Yttrium





 




LIGHT Vs HEAVY RARE EARTHS
REEs are often divided into Light Rare Earth Elements (LREEs) and Heavy Rare Earth Elements (HREEs) based on their chemical properties. Globally, LREEs are more abundant than HREEs, according to published sources, particularly in economic quantities and concentrations. As a result, HREEs tend to be far more valuable. REEs are integral to many common electronics such as cell phones and laptop computers.
During the past 20 years, many new applications for REEs have been developed and there has been an increase in demand for many items that require rare earth elements. For example, nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries are made with rare earth compounds. These batteries are found in items that range from handheld electronics to hybrid and electric vehicles. Rare earth elements are also used in in flat screen displays, energy efficient lighting, lasers, and fiber-optic communication systems.
Typically, REEs are present only in small quantities. Large deposits, like Texas Mineral Resources’ Round Top project in Hudspeth County, Texas, are rare.

Texas Mineral Resources Signs MOU with Pennsylvania Coal Company to Recover and Produce Scandium and Rare Earth Byproducts from Coal Ash and Coal Overburden

SIERRA BLANCA, TX—(Marketwired- July 5, 2016)  – Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (OTCQX: TMRC)
--- U.S. Department of Energy data suggests potentially significant  amounts of scandium and       rare earth  byproducts are present
---Both coal ash and in-situ coal overburden have been outlined as potential resources
---Preliminary internal economic analysis of a coal ash project  suggests modest CAPEX requirements along with profitability
---TMRC to establish Scandium America Corp subsidiary upon signing  definitive agreement 
Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (TMRC), an  exploration company targeting the heavy rare earths and a variety of other  high-value elements and industrial minerals, is pleased to announce that it has  signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with a well-established  privately-held Pennsylvania coal company.   The MOU gives TMRC a six-month period of time to further evaluate the  potential to finance, recover and produce scandium and other rare earth  byproducts from their properties. 

  The National Energy Technology Laboratory of  the Department of Energy has recently conducted studies at the properties that  are the subject of this MOU, suggesting the existence of potentially valuable  rare earth and scandium mineralization in coal ash being deposited at several  locations on the property and in the in-situ coal bed overburden at different sites on company property.  

  Tonnages of the ash repositories are well  documented.  The area chosen for initial  study, because of its favorable location, contains 3.7 million short tons of  coal ash. A total of three ash repositories and an as yet undetermined number  of in-situ overburden deposits lend  themselves to simultaneous development. The property is fully permitted for  mining and processing of coal.  Only the  additional permitting for scandium and rare earth processing would be needed. 

  With respect to the coal ash deposit,  preliminary internal economic analysis, done by TMRC, of a modest startup  operation processing 300 tons of coal ash per day suggests that it would  require an estimated CAPEX of approximately $17 million, inclusive of a 25%  contingency.  Assuming a recoverable  grade of 45 ppm (parts per million) scandium content, potential estimated  production of scandium oxide would approximate 7,500 kilograms per year.  Using a current scandium oxide market price  of $2,000/kg could potentially result in pre-tax cash flow of approximately  $10.3 million, after operating costs and royalty payments to the coal company.  These assumptions assume that only the  recovered scandium would be sold, attributing no value to the rare earth and  other elements and minerals that could be recovered. 

  Additionally, the coal company has a large  database of drill hole and outcrop sampling that indicates potential for extensive  rare earth and scandium value in the rocks overlying the unmined coal. Research  conducted on overburden from other properties in the region and published by a  group from Pennsylvania State University*, suggests that the rock (overburden)  can be successfully leached with several different organic solvents with  encouraging recoveries.. The drill and outcrop data suggest that the in-situ overburden rock contains higher  scandium values than the coal ash, thus offsetting the potentially higher costs  of mining, crushing and grinding it.

  “While our Round Top deposit remains the  flagship property of the company, we are very pleased to be able to start  parallel examination of a series of deposits, potentially profitable at current  scandium prices, that offer the possibility of being brought to production more  rapidly and at a fraction of the cost of Round Top. A significant portion of  the process development work we plan to undertake for the coal related deposits  will be applicable to feasibility work required by Round Top ”,  Dan Gorski, CEO, added.  

  Anthony Marchese, Chairman, further  commented:  “Worldwide scandium  production is limited and industry demand is growing. Domestic manufacturers  need a large and reliable source of scandium oxide.  We believe joining forces with a well-  established Pennsylvania coal company for the potential recovery of scandium  and other valuable rare earth minerals is a perfect complement to our Round Top  heavy rare earth project.  The potential  benefits of such a project will be felt in the surrounding coal community as  well as by TMRC shareholders.  In  recognition of the potential significance of a long-term domestic source of  scandium oxide we plan to establish a new subsidiary titled Scandium America  Corp upon the signing of a definitive agreement with the domestic coal company,  at which time further details of the Agreement will be released.”

Background  on Scandium

Global scandium production is estimated to be  between 8,000 to 15,000 kilograms annually.   Most of today’s production tends to come as a byproduct of the leaching  activity associated with production of other metals, minerals or rare earths. The  United States is 100% import-dependent for scandium.   According  to the USGS (U.S. Geological Survey), scandium-bearing minerals have not been  mined nor recovered from mine tailings since 1990.  Principal sources of scandium today include  China, Kazakhstan, Russia and the Ukraine. Freedom House, a U.S. based non  partisan organization that conducts research and advocacy on democracy,  political freedom and human rights,  currently ranks the first three sources as  “Not Free” and the last as “Partially Free”.

  Principal uses of scandium today are for the  production of solid oxide fuel cells, lasers, switches and mercury vapor high  intensity lamps.  Future significant  growth is forecast in the metallurgical market as high-strength alloys of  aluminum.  When used in combination with  other common aluminum alloys scandium can produce lighter, stronger, more  corrosion resistant, heat tolerant and weldable aluminum products. It is  believed that use of aluminum/scandium alloys can reduce aircraft weight by  15-20%.  Likewise, automotive  applications are large potential markets.   One industry source estimates that if only a tiny fraction (0.1%) of the  annual aluminum market absorbed scandium in alloy at a 0.5% level, it would  represent a potential 317,000 kilograms of scandium demand.
About  Texas Mineral Resources Corp. 
    Texas Mineral  Resources Corp.'s primary focus is exploring and, if warranted, developing its  Round Top heavy rare earth and industrial minerals project located in Hudspeth  County, Texas, 85 miles east of El Paso.

Texas Mineral Resources Establishes ‘American Mineral Reclamation LLC' To Add Strategic Line Of Business




Sierra Blanca, TX (Marketwired) - Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (OTCQX: TMRC)

Creates American Mineral Reclamation subsidiary to actively seek out and develop lower cost projects involving metals and mineral recovery and reclamation, from coal byproducts, industrial wastewater, acid mine drainage and scrap metal processing
Currently actively evaluating multiple projects
Signs Cooperation Agreement with Inventure Renewables Inc.
Continues work with K-Technologies, Inc. (K-Tech) in the utilization of their environmentally friendly CIX/CIC separation technology

Texas Mineral Resources Corp. (TMRC), an exploration company targeting the heavy rare earths and a variety of other high-value elements and industrial minerals, is pleased to announce it has added a new strategic line of business with the recent establishment of a subsidiary named American Mineral Reclamation LLC. The formation of this subsidiary is in response to the growing number of opportunities that TMRC has been presented as a result of work undertaken with partners that has resulted in winning grants from the Department of Defense (Defense Logistics Agency) and the Department of Energy.
American Mineral Reclamation, along with industrial partners, is currently evaluating projects whose goal is the reclamation of high-value elements and industrial minerals from both liquid and solid waste material. There are multiple benefits to developing such projects:
(1) technology now exists to recover these materials in a potentially cost-efficient and profitable manner,
(2) capital expenditures are typically significantly less than traditional comparable mining projects seeking the same material,
(3) reclamation can focus on low cost feedstocks, as identified by American Mineral Reclamation, that can serve as bases for production of multiple strategic and critical metals,
(4) a large number of projects involving waste material are available domestically, and
(5) reclamation projects offer significant potential to protect the environment, enrich land and water quality and contribute to public health and safety. 
An example of just one such project is the recovery of scandium and other rare earth elements from coal waste in the Pennsylvania region. The U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded a consortium assembled by TMRC which included Inventure Renewables, K-Tech and Penn State University, a Phase One grant of $1 million dollars with potential for Phase Two funding up to $18 million for the construction of a pilot plant to produce saleable rare earth oxides, to be located in central Pennsylvania. In addition, TMRC is currently evaluating projects in the following areas: environmentally-friendly process improvements for byproduct water from the unconventional oil and gas industry, recovery of rare earth minerals from acid mine drainage and recovery of cobalt and rhenium from military scrap metal.
TMRC is also pleased to announced that it has signed a Cooperation Agreement with Inventure Renewables Inc. of Tuscaloosa, Alabama (www.inventurechem.com), one of its project partners for the recent Department of Energy grant. Inventure Renewables pioneers process technologies for the rapid, low-cost, high yield extraction of natural biochemical and material building blocks from low-value/waste biomass to provide cost-effective, carbon neutral biofuels, biochemicals and biomaterials. Inventure Renewables, along with K-Tech (www.ktech-inc.com), Penn State University (www.ems.psu.edu) and additional industrial partners, will play a key role in the evaluation and development of future reclamation projects.
Dan Gorski, CEO, commented: "The success of K-Tech's ion exchange and ion chromatographic methodology to process the leach solution from Round Top rock into separated, high purity REE products led us to examine the possibility of employing it at other projects and in other sectors. Our work with the Defense Logistics Agency brought us into contact with the research being sponsored by the Department of Energy to recover the rare earth and other strategic elements that are associated with the Appalachian coal deposits. Teaming with K-Tech, Inventure Renewables and Penn State University, we applied for and received a grant from the Department of Energy to identify and develop one of these coalbed-related deposits. The opportunity to further extend this technology into the removal and recovery of various elements from both acid mine drainage and from flow back and production waters in oil and gas development has opened what we think is an exceptional development opportunity for TMRC."
"In too many instances, U.S. advanced manufacturing -- and advanced defense systems -- depend on metals and minerals for which the U.S. is deeply dependent on questionable foreign supply," said Anthony Marchese, Chairman. "As we work to bring our multi-metal Round Top heavy rare earth deposit into production, we now see a new distinct line of business by partnering with entities to develop projects which reclaim and recover critical materials from many different low-cost feedstocks that would normally be considered waste material -- coal overburden, mine waste, e-waste and industrial scrap, as well as waste water and acid mine drainage sludge. Our newly established American Mineral Reclamation subsidiary is a 'pure-play' vehicle for developing an environmentally beneficial line of business which involves projects that are potentially low-cost, profitable and provide a rapid time to market."

MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINING





MINERAL RESOURCES AND MINING. Minerals and mineral products of Texas are presented alphabetically in this article.
Aluminum. Three Texas plants produce aluminum oxide from imported aluminum ore (bauxite). Aluminum processing plants are located in Calhoun, Milam, and San Patricio counties.
Antimony. Although antimony ore is not produced in Texas, antimony ores are processed at a smelter in El Paso.
Asbestos. Amphibole asbestos is associated with talc deposits in Hudspeth County. Tremolite asbestos occurs in some of the Precambrian metamorphic rocks of the Llano region. No asbestos is mined in Texas.
Asphalt. Numerous deposits of asphalt-bearing rocks occur in Texas. They include asphaltic Cretaceous limestones in Bexar, Burnet, Kinney, Uvalde, and other counties. Large amounts of the asphaltic limestone are quarried in Uvalde County for use chiefly as paving material. Asphaltic Cretaceous sandstones, which are not currently quarried, occur in Cooke, Montague, Uvalde, and other counties.
Barite. Deposits of barite are widely distributed in Texas, but most are minor. They occur in Baylor, Brewster, Culberson, Gillespie, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Llano, Taylor, and other counties. During the 1960s barite was mined in the Seven Hart Gap area for use as a weighting agent in rotary-drilling muds.
Basalt. Intrusive masses of basalt are present in several counties along the Balcones Fault Zone and in the Trans-Pecos area of West Texas. It is produced for aggregate, road ballast, and road material in Uvalde County.
Beryllium. Beryllium minerals are present at several localities in the Trans-Pecos area of West Texas. In recent years a beryllium prospect has been located in Hudspeth County near Sierra Blanca where several beryllium minerals are associated with fluorspar, but no production has been reported.
Bismuth. Bismuth occurs in association with molybdenum and gold in a Precambrian pegmatite dike at the Kiam prospect on Honey Creek in Llano County. It was found also in small quantities in the old Heath gold prospect in Llano County. No bismuth has been produced commercially in Texas.
Bleaching clay. Bentonite clays that are commonly used as bleaching clays and fuller's earth occur at numerous localities in Tertiary formations of the Coastal Plain and deposits on the High Plains. Bleaching clays are used for refining petroleum products and to a lesser extent for refining vegetable oils. Texas bleaching clays are currently produced in Fayette and Gonzales counties.
Brines. Brines containing strong concentrations of mineral salts occur in a variety of geological conditions in widely separated areas of Texas. Shallow brines occur in broad shallow basins usually occupied in part by one or more saline playas or alkaline lakes. Surface and seep waters draining into the playas undergo rapid natural evaporation, resulting in the concentration of salts leached from soils and rocks of the drainage area. Shallow brines are produced for sodium sulfate in Gaines and Terry counties. Brine reservoirs containing salts of sodium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and other elements are present in the Permian Basin. These aquifers lie at considerable depth and have not been produced commercially for their salts. In Trans-Pecos Texas shallow brines containing mainly common salt and gypsum occur in the Salt Basin in northern Culberson and Hudspeth counties. Highly gypsiferous waters are present in eastern Culberson County and parts of Reeves County. In southern Texas, brines containing sodium chloride and other salts occur in La Sal Vieja and La Sal del Reyqqv in Willacy and Hidalgo counties. No salts are produced from these brines. Local brine areas are known in the vicinity of salt domes in the Texas Coastal Plain. In parts of East Texas, some moderately strong brines occur in saliferous Tertiary formations not related to salt domes.
Bromine. Bromine is extracted from seawater at Freeport in Brazoria County.
Caliche. Caliche occurs abundantly in surface and near-surface deposits in the semiarid and arid parts of Texas and is particularly abundant in the High Plains and the outcrop belt of the Goliad Formation of South Texas. A large quantity of caliche is produced chiefly for road construction from numerous and widespread localities.
Celestite. Celestite is known at numerous localities, particularly in the Cretaceous Glen Rose Formation and the Upper Permian Whitehorse Formation in North and north central Texas, respectively. These occurrences are small and have no commercial value. Extensive deposits of celestite are present in Brown and Nolan counties. Small quantities of celestite were produced from these counties during the late 1930s and early 1940s. Most of the celestite produced in Texas has been used as a weighting agent in rotary-drilling fluids.
Cement. Limestone and clay are the principal components used in the manufacture of cement. Iron ore and gypsum are also used in smaller amounts. Cement is currently produced in Bexar, Comal, Dallas, Ector, Ellis, El Paso, Harris, Hays, McLennan, Nolan, Nueces, Potter, and Tarrant counties. Portland cement output rose slightly during 1989 to a total of 7.2 million short tons with a value of $286 million. Historically, the state's portland cement output has accounted for about 10 percent of the annual United States production. Texas usually has been ranked first or second among the thirty-eight producing states. In 1989 Texas was ranked second behind California. Masonry cement continued its five-year downtrend, and output was estimated at less than half of that in 1984. Declines in Texas construction industries generally have caused a decrease in demand for portland cement. Texas Portland cement production was up 200,000 tons over that of 1988 but was still lower than the 1975 production. The demand for masonry cement has fallen every year since a record high of 291,000 short tons in 1984.
Clay. Texas has an abundance of various types of clays, occurring in many geologic units. Production includes ball clay, bentonite, common clay and shale, fire clay, fuller's earth, and kaolin. Texas is one of the leading producers of clays in the United States. Ceramic products include structural building brick, paving brick, decorative tile, drain tile, and expanded clay for lightweight aggregate. Common clay suitable for the manufacture of cement or common brick is found in many counties. Clays suitable for ceramic and refractory ware contain a high proportion of kaolin and are found primarily in northeastern Texas. Nonceramic clays are used as bleaching or adsorbent clays, fillers, coaters, additives, bonding clays, drilling muds, and catalysts. Most nonceramic products are produced from bentonites that are found primarily in the Coastal Plain. Kaolin clays found in East Texas are used as paper coaters and fillers and rubber fillers. High-purity kaolin clays have a high alumina content and are a potential source of metallic aluminum.
Coal. Bituminous coal of Pennsylvanian age occurs primarily in Coleman, Eastland, Erath, Jack, McCulloch, Montague, Palo Pinto, Parker, Throckmorton, Wise, and Young counties of north central Texas. Bituminous coal deposits are also found in Cretaceous deposits of the Olmos Formation in Maverick County and in Eocene age cannel coal deposits in Webb County. These coals provided a significant energy source prior to the development of oil and gas in the 1940s. Mines in these areas were inactive from the early 1940s until the 1970s, when high petroleum prices prompted a revaluation of the Texas coal deposits. Limited bituminous coal production in these areas was resumed during the late 1970s. A decline in demand during the late 1980s resulted in the closing of the North Texas coal mines. The mines in Webb County reduced production but were still in operation in 1992. Cretaceous bituminous coals in Trans-Pecos Texas have little potential for development as a fuel. They have been marketed primarily as a soil conditioner (leonardite). Commercial mining for coal and lignite started in the late 1880s. The first year coal production was listed for Texas was 1884, when 125,000 short tons was mined. Production declined from 1885 to 1888. It subsequently climbed at a high rate to 1,107,953 short tons in 1901, then gradually increased to a high of about 2.4 million tons in 1913. After that year, coal and lignite production gradually declined. Annual production fell below one million short tons in 1930 and below 100,000 short tons in 1945. Production of bituminous coal ceased in 1944; production of lignite continued but declined drastically during the early 1950s. Coal and lignite were mined primarily by underground methods until the 1950s. In the mid-1950s the industry received a tremendous boost when Aluminum Company of America started using char produced from lignite at its plant near Rockdale. In 1954 estimated lignite production exceeded a million short tons. The production of lignite by strip-mining methods and the utilization of lignite to fuel mine-mouth generators for the production of electricity caused Texas to become a major coal (lignite) producer during the 1970s. Coal production in Texas now exceeds fifty million short tons annually.
Copper. Copper deposits in Texas occur in the Trans-Pecos region, in the Permian red beds of north central Texas, and in the Llano region. Mining has been attempted at different times on the deposits in each region. Most of the state's small production has been from the Van Horn-Allamoore mining district, whereas only small shipments of copper have been reported from the North Texas and Llano regions. The last reported copper production was eighteen tons in 1952, valued at $8,712. Most of the ore came from the Old Hazel Mine in Culberson County. During the mid 1950s, however, most of the Texas copper mines were inoperative. Large deposits of ore exist in North Texas but have not been developed because of their low metal content. Copper refineries operate in El Paso and Potter counties. Copper smelters are operating in plants at Amarillo, El Paso, and Texas City. These depend upon imported ore from Arizona, Chile, New Mexico, and Mexico to produce refined copper, copper anode, copper sulfate, and other copper products.
Diatomite. Diatomite, or diatomaceous earth, occurs in the upper Tertiary and Pleistocene lacustrine deposits on the High Plains. No Texas diatomite has been produced.
Dolomite. Dolomite is widely distributed in Texas except in the Coastal Plain and over the greater part of the High Plains. It occurs in beds of varying thickness and extent in rocks ranging from Precambrian to Cretaceous in age. Dolomite was mined from the Ellenburger Formation in Burnet County as an ore of magnesium during the 1940s. It was processed in the Austin plant of International Minerals and Chemical Company and the Mathieson Alkali Works, Lake Charles, Louisiana. The Ellenburger dolomites are now used by Dow Chemical at Freeport in Brazoria County as a part of a process of removing magnesium from sea water. Dolomites from the Edwards Formation are used as a source of crushed stone.
Evaporites. Evaporites, including rock salt, gypsum, potassium minerals, and other similar compounds, occur extensively in Permian deposits that underlie the greater part of the High Plains and parts of adjacent regions. The evaporite compounds of West Texas are not being produced, although potash is mined extensively in the vicinity of Carlsbad, New Mexico. Salt, anhydrite, and gypsum occur in the salt domes of the Coastal Plain. These minerals, except anhydrite, are considered separately.
Feldspar. Feldspar occurs in Precambrian formations in parts of the Llano and Trans-Pecos regions. During the 1950s it was produced from pegmatite dikes in Llano and Culberson counties and used in the manufacture of pottery, ceramics, and glassware. Feldspars are not currently being produced in Texas.
Fluorspar. Fluorspar or fluorite is an important industrial mineral used in the manufacture of steel, aluminum, glass, and fluorocarbons. It occurs at several localities in the Trans-Pecos and Llano regions of Texas. Trans-Pecos deposits are commonly associated with Tertiary volcanics and Cretaceous limestones. Mining operations first started in 1943 at Eagle Mountainqv in Hudspeth County. Occurrences of fluorspar have also been found in the Quitman Mountains of Hudspeth County, the Chinati Mountains of Presidio County, the Franklin Mountains of El Paso County, and the Christmas Mountainsqqv and other areas of Brewster County. The fluorspar in the Llano region occurs in pegmatite dikes and lenses and veins in Precambrian schists and gneisses. None of the deposits in Texas are currently being produced.
Gemstones. Collecting gem rock and mineral specimens has attracted numerous fans ("rockhounds") and has proved quite profitable. Agate, jasper, cinnabar, fluorite, topaz, calcite, opal, petrified wood, and tektites are stones that are commonly collected by lapidarists. No records are available on the quantities of gemstones collected and sold each year.
Gold. Gold mining has not been extensive in Texas since the occurrence of the metal is limited. Main production, confined to the Presidio and Hazel mines in West Texas and the Heath mine in the Llano region, amounted to a total of 8,277 fine ounces by 1942, valued at $233,499. Most of the gold produced has come as the by-product of silver and copper ores, but traces of it occur in the Shafter, Van Horn, Allamore, and Ouitman Mountains, and in Howard, Taylor, Irion, Uvalde, and Williamson counties with other rocks and ores. The last reported gold production was from the Presidio mine in 1942.
Graphite. Deposits of fine-flake graphite occur in the Precambrian Packsaddle Schist in the Llano region. Graphite was previously produced in Burnet County.
Greensand. Greensand or glauconite sand occurs in Upper Cambrian rocks in the Llano region and in the Midway, Weches, and other Eocene formations in the Texas coastal plain. Greensand has been used in the past as a soil conditioner and in purifying water. It is not currently produced commercially in Texas.
Grinding pebbles. Pebbles suitable for use in grinding mills occur in widely distributed surface deposits along the interior margin of the southern and southwestern Coastal Plain. They have been produced in Bastrop, Colorado, Fayette, Frio, and Gonzales counties. However, modern grinding methods have eliminated the demand for grinding pebbles, and there is no current production of these materiels.
Guano. Bat guano occurs in numerous caverns in the Edwards Plateau and in the Trans-Pecos region and to a more limited extent in Central Texas. Guano has been produced in Edwards, Medina, Real, and other counties. No current production is known in Texas.
Gypsum. Gypsum is widely distributed and extensively developed in Texas. The main occurrences are (1) in the Blaine and other Permian formations that crop out east of the High Plains; current mining from these extensive bedded deposits occurs in Fisher, Hardeman, and Nolan counties; (2) in the Permian Castile gypsum that crops out in large areas between the Delaware and Apache Mountainsqqv and Pecos River in Culberson and Reeves counties; (3) in rocks of probable Permian age in the vicinity of the Malone Mountains in Hudspeth County; (4) in the Cretaceous Edwards Formation in Gillespie and Menard counties, mined in Gillespie County; (5) in caprocks of the Gulf Coast salt domes mined at Hockley dome in Harris County and previously at Gyp Hill in Brooks County. Gypsum is used in the manufacture of plaster of paris, wallboard, and cement.
Helium. Texas is the leading producer of helium, which is extracted from natural gas in the Panhandle area at a United States Bureau of Mines plant in Moore County and at two privately owned plants in Moore and Hansford counties. Production is from the Cliffside gas field near Amarillo.
Iron. Deposits of iron ore, including siderite and the limonite-group minerals, are present in the Eocene Weches Formation in northeastern Texas. Deposits are present in Anderson, Camp, Cass, Cherokee, Harrison, Henderson, Marion, Morris, Nacogdoches, Smith, and Upshur counties. Deposits in Cherokee and Henderson counties are mined chiefly as a source of iron for the manufacture of cement. Several deposits of iron ore minerals are present in Central Texas, such as the magnetite deposits at Iron Mountain in Llano County and the hematitic sandstone deposits in Llano, Mason, McCulloch, and San Saba counties. Hematite also is present in the Trans-Pecos.
Lead and Zinc. Lead and zinc are commonly considered together because they are generally associated in mineral deposits. These metals occur in small deposits in Texas, and much of their past production has been as a by-product in the production of silver. A large part of the lead was obtained as a minor product of silver-lead ores taken from the Presidio mine in Presidio County. Practically all of the state's zinc production and an approximately equivalent amount of lead was produced from the Bonanza and Alice Ray mines in Hudspeth County from ores with a small silver content. Lead and zinc are also present in the Quitman Mountains southwest of Sierra Blanca in Hudspeth County and in the Apache Mountains in Culberson County. Lead deposits are known at several localities in Cambrian strata in Blanco, Burnet, and Gillespie counties in Central Texas. The only reported production from the Central Texas area was in 1930 from the Pavitte prospect in western Burnet County. Lead and zinc are not currently produced in Texas and have not been mined in the state since 1952. Between 1885 and 1952 the total lead production in Texas amounted to 5,443 short tons and the total zinc production was 837 short tons. Lead was formerly produced as a by-product of silver mining, mainly from the Presidio Mine in Presidio County and the Bird Mine in Brewster County. Zinc production had come chiefly from the Bonanza and Alice Ray mines in Hudspeth County, with small amounts also from the Chinati and Montezuma mines in Presidio County and the Buck Prospect in Culberson County. Although no longer a producer of lead and zinc, Texas had a primary smelter that produced lead and zinc in El Paso County until the mid-1980s. The ore came from western states and Mexico.
Lignite. Lignite or brown coal occurs in extensive deposits in the Eocene, Wilcox, and Claiborne groups of the Texas Coastal Plain. The Wilcox Group contains the largest reserves and highest quality lignite. The principal resource area is north of the Colorado River in Central and East Texas. Lignite was first mined in Texas during the 1850s and was produced primarily from underground mines. Lignite production declined during the 1940s and early 1950s, when oil and gas supplies became readily available. Recovery of the Texas coal-mining industry began in the 1950s, when strip-mining techniques were first used to mine Texas lignite and provide a feed stock to mine-mouth electrical generators. Texas is now the nation's sixth-largest coal producer, with estimated recoverable near-surface reserves (at depths of less than 200 feet and seam thicknesses of three or more feet) of twenty-three billion short tons. Lignite is currently utilized at electrical generators in Atascosa, Bastrop, Freestone, Grimes, Harrison, Hopkins, Limestone, Panola, Rusk, and Titus counties. It is also produced in Harrison County as a source of activated carbon. Deep-basin lignite resources (200 to 2,000 feet deep) are approximately equal to near-surface lignite resources. These resources can be developed by the process of in situ gasification.
Lime. Limestones, which are abundant in many parts of Texas, are utilized in the manufacture of lime. They are crushed and calcined to drive off the excess carbon dioxide and convert the calcium carbonate to calcium oxide (see LIMEKILNS). Uses of lime include soil stabilization, water purification, paper and pulp manufacture, metallurgy, sugar refining, agriculture, construction, and removal of sulfur from power plant stack gases. Plants for the production of lime are currently operating in Bexar, Bosque, Burnet, Comal, Deaf Smith, Hill, Johnson, Nueces, and Travis counties.
Magnesite. Magnesite occurs in Precambrian deposits commonly associated with marbles. Small-scale mining operations in Llano and Mason counties have extracted magnesite for use as agricultural stone and terrazzo chips.
Magnesium. Magnesium chloride, magnesium sulfate, and other mineral salts are present in Upper Permian brines in Borden County and in shallow brines underlying playas in the High Plains. Magnesium chloride is extracted from sea water at a plant in Brazoria County and is used to produce magnesium compounds and magnesium metal.
Manganese. Manganese is known to occur in residual and surficial deposits in Precambrian rocks in Mason and Llano counties, at several localities in Cretaceous and Quaternary deposits in Val Verde County, in Lower Cretaceous deposits in Jeff Davis County, and in Triassic sandstones in Dickens County. Small quantities of manganese have been mined from the deposits in Jeff Davis County, but no production has been reported since the mid-1950s.
Mercury. Mercury mineral deposits occur in the Terlingua district of southern Brewster and southeastern Presidio counties, where mining was initiated in 1896. During the early 1930s Texas was one of the nation's leading producers of mercury. The sharp reduction in price and demand after World War II caused the closure of all Texas mercury mines. A rise in price during the 1950s caused sporadic mining activity in the area. Record high prices for mercury in the middle to late 1960s prompted renewed interest in the area that resulted in the reopening of several mines and the discovery of new reserves. All of the mines closed in the early 1970s, when prices again declined. No production has been reported since 1973.
Mica. Mica is present in Precambrian pegmatite dikes on the western side of the Van Horn Mountains in western Culberson County and also in Precambrian schists and pegmatites in the Llano region. Some mica has been produced in the past from the Culberson County area, but production is no longer active.
Mineral water. Water containing high concentrations of salts and bitterns has been extracted from a variety of groundwater horizons. Mineral water has been produced at Mineral Wells in Palo Pinto County, near Marlin in Falls County, at Milford in Ellis County, and at Thorndale in Williamson County. No production of mineral waters is currently reported.
Molybdenum. Deposits of molybdenum minerals have been found in Brewster, Culberson, Hudspeth, Llano, and Presidio counties, but no production has been reported.
Nitrates. Sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate are present in volcanic rocks in the vicinity of Candelaria, but attempts at production have been unsuccessful.
Novaculite. Novaculite, a chert-like, siliceous rock, occurs in the Caballos Formation of Devonian age that crops out in prominent ridges in the Marathon area in Brewster County. It is not produced in Texas.
Opal. Common opal associated with chalcedony occurs in the Catahoula and other Tertiary formations of the Texas Coastal Plain. Opal also occurs as nodules and masses, as cement in sandstones, as vein and cavity fillings, and as a replacement of wood.
Oyster shell. Oyster and clam shells occur in reefs and beds in the bays and lagoons bordering the Gulf of Mexico and in some Quaternary sediments along the seaward margin of the Texas Coastal Plain. Shells from many of these areas were extensively produced until the early 1960s, when production was discontinued because of environmental concerns.
Peat. Peat bogs are widely distributed in the middle and eastern part of the Coastal Plain at localities in Gonzales, Guadalupe, Lee, Milam, Polk, and San Jacinto counties. Peat from some of these deposits has been produced in the past for use as a soil conditioner.
Perlite. Perlite is a glassy igneous rock that expands to a porous lightweight mass when heated. Its uses include filter medium, lightweight aggregate, and horticultural aggregate. Perlite has been produced near Pinto Canyon in Presidio County. No perlite is currently produced in Texas, but imported perlite is processed at plants in Bexar, Dallas, El Paso, Guadalupe, Harris, and Nolan counties.
Phosphate. Small quantities of phosphate rock are present in Paleozoic formations in West and Central Texas. Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits in northeastern Texas also contain lenses of rock phosphate. No phosphate is mined in Texas, but imported phosphate rock is processed at a plant in Brownsville.
Potash. Potash minerals, including polyhalite, are found in extensive deposits in Permian strata in parts of West Texas. After World War I a search for potash sources, conducted by state and federal agencies, resulted in the development of high-grade potash rock containing sylvite and other potash minerals in New Mexico. Texas potash deposits are of a lower grade and have not been developed.
Pumicite. Volcanic ash or pumicite occurs in numerous deposits in some of the Tertiary formations of the Texas Coastal Plain, particularly in the Catahoula and Jackson formations. Other Tertiary ash deposits occur in volcanic rocks in the Trans-Pecos. Pleistocene volcanic-ash deposits occur at several localities in the High Plains and eastward as far as Wichita County. Volcanic ash was formerly mined in Dickens, Gonzales, Lynn, Scurry, and Star counties.
Rare-earth minerals. Elements of the Lanthanide series are commonly termed rare-earth elements. Yttrium is also commonly included in the group because it is associated with the heavier rare earths. Several of the rare earths have anomalous concentrations in the rhyolitic and related igneous rocks in the Quitman Mountains and the Sierra Blanca area of Trans-Pecos Texas. A deposit containing several rare-earth minerals was exposed at Barringer Hill in Llano County before it was covered by the waters of Lake Buchanan. No rare earths are produced in Texas.
Salt. Salt occurs in large quantities in salt domes in the Texas Coastal Plain and with other evaporites in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Smaller quantities are present in surface and near-surface brines and in playas and saline springs in West and South Texas. Rock salt is produced from an underground mine at Grand Saline in Van Zandt County. However, most of the salt production in Texas is from brine wells. Texas is one of the leading salt-producing states.
Sand and gravel. Sand and gravel deposits of commercial value are found adjacent to the major rivers that flow across Texas and in the Goliad, Uvalde, and Willis formations in the Texas Coastal Plain. Extensive deposits also occur in Seymour Formation gravels and basal Cretaceous formations in north central Texas, in alluvial fan deposits east of the Caprock, and in the mountain areas of Trans-Pecos Texas. Sand and gravel deposits are mined primarily as a source of construction materials. The principal sand and gravel producing counties in Texas include Bexar, Brazos, Colorado, Dallas, Ellis, Fayette, Hays, Hidalgo, Johnson, Kaufman, Liberty, McLennan, Montgomery, Parker, Pecos, Reeves, Travis, Val Verde, Victoria, and Wise counties.
Sands. Sands used for industrial purposes commonly have unique physical or chemical characteristics that make them suitable for special purposes. Most of these sands have a high silica content. Sands suitable for industrial use occur in Tertiary deposits of the Texas Coastal Plain and East Texas, Cretaceous formations of north central Texas, and Paleozoic rocks of Central Texas. Industrial sands produced in Texas include abrasive, blast, chemical, engine, filtration, foundry, glass, hydraulic-fracturing, molding, and pottery sands. These are produced from formations in Atascosa, Bowie, Colorado, El Paso, Gonzales, Guadalupe, Hardin, Harris, Johnson, Liberty, Limestone, McCulloch, Newton, Smith, Somervell, Upshur, and Wood counties.
Silver. The discovery of silver in Texas has been credited by some to Franciscans who discovered and operated mines near El Paso about 1680. Reportedly, these mines were worked periodically, closed down and concealed, and later rediscovered. However, no documentation of these operations is available. Documented silver production started in the late 1880s at the Presidio Mine, near Shafter in Presidio County. About 1885 silver mining began in the Van Horn-Allamoore district in Hudspeth and Culberson counties. Other areas where silver has been produced in Texas include the Shafter district, northern Quitman Mountains district, Loma Plata mine, Altuda Mountain district, Eagle Mountains district, and Van Horn Mountains district. Between 1885 and 1955, Texas produced 32,663,405 troy ounces of silver.
Stone, crushed. Texas is among the nation's leading producers of crushed stone. Crushed stone can be produced from many varieties of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. Most crushed stone produced in the state is limestone. Other stones that provide smaller volumes of crushed stone include basalt, dolomite, granite, marble, rhyolite, sandstone, and serpentine. Crushed stone is used primarily as aggregate for use in concrete and road material. Large tonnages are also used in the manufacture of lime and cement. Relatively small tonnages of crushed stone are used for fillers, filter material, riprap, roofing chips, and terrazzo.
Stone, dimension. Materials suitable for dimension stone or building stone can be found in most parts of the state except the High Plains and the Gulf Coastal Plain. Granite, limestone, and sandstone are the only stones currently being produced as dimension stone. Granites are produced from Precambrian granites in Burnet, Gillespie, Llano, and Mason counties. Limestones are produced from rocks of Permian age in Jones and Schackelford counties and rocks of Cretaceous age in Lampasas, Travis, and Williamson counties. Sandstones are produced from Triassic deposits in Ward County.
Sulfur. Sulfur occurs in the caprocks of salt domes in the Gulf Coastal Plain, in Permian-age bedded deposits in Trans-Pecos Texas, and as a constituent of sour gas and petroleum. Mining of native sulfur deposits is accomplished by the Frasch process, which uses superheated water to melt the sulfur so that it can be pumped to the surface. Sulfur is used in petroleum refining and in the preparation of fertilizer and chemicals. Texas is one of the nation's leading producers of sulfur. Native sulfur is produced from one salt dome in Wharton County and from subsurface Permian deposits in Culberson County. Recovered sulfur is extracted from oil and gas at more than sixty plants in about thirty-six Texas counties.
Talc. Talc deposits are present in Precambrian metamorphic rocks in the Allamoore area of Culberson and Hudspeth counties and in Blanco, Gillespie, and Llano counties of the Llano Uplift area. Deposits in the Allamoore are currently being produced. Talc is used as a filler in the manufacture of roofing materials, paper, plastic, and synthetic rubber and in ceramic materials.
Tin. The tin mineral cassiterite is present in the Franklin Mountains north of El Paso, where small quantities of tin ore were produced during the early 1900s. Minor quantities have also been found in the Streeter area of Mason County. The only tin smelter in the United States is located at Texas City. Imported ore concentrates and other tin-bearing materials are processed at this plant. Tin is not currently being mined in Texas.
Titanium. The titanium mineral rutile occurs in association with Tertiary silicified tuffs and kaolin at the Mueller prospect in south central Jeff Davis County. The mineral ilmenite also contains titanium and is present in several counties in Gulf Coastal Plain. No deposits of commercial interest have been discovered.
Topaz. Colorless and light-blue varieties of topaz are found in Precambrian granite in the vicinity of Streeter in Mason County. Topaz is not produced commercially.
Tripoli. Tripoli occurs in several deposits in the Marble Falls limestone in southern Lampasas County. The tripoli, a siliceous incoherent material consisting of particles of sponge spicules, has been produced in small quantities, but there is no current production from the area.
Tufa. Tufa and travertine are freshwater limestone deposits commonly associated with springs and streams in the limestone regions of Texas. Tufa deposits were previously produced in San Saba County, but no current production is known.
Turquoise. Turquoise occurs in the Precambrian Carrizo Mountain schist in the Van Horn area near the Culberson-Hudspeth county line. Material has been produced from this area in the past, but no production is known at present.
Uranium. Uranium was discovered in Texas in the mid-1950s in Karnes County. Deposits were found in Tertiary formations in a mineralized zone that extends from the central Coastal Plain southwestward to the Rio Grande. Uranium mineralization was subsequently discovered in the Trans-Pecos area, the Llano Uplift, and the High Plains. A small amount of uranium was produced from deposits in the High Plains during the 1950s, but most of the Texas production has been from the Coastal Plain. In the past uranium was produced from surface mines in Atascosa, Gonzales, Karnes, and Live Oak counties. These mines are now closed and reclaimed. Current uranium production is by in situ leaching. Demand and production of uranium decreased sharply during the 1980s.
Vermiculite. Vermiculite is a mica-like mineral that expands when heated. It is used as a horticultural medium, lightweight aggregate, and insulating material. Deposits are present in Precambrian metamorphic deposits in the Llano region. Exfoliation plants at Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio currently process vermiculite mined outside of Texas. Vermiculite is not currently produced in Texas.
Zeolites. Zeolite minerals occur in Tertiary volcanic deposits in Trans-Pecos Texas and in the Coastal Plain. They are used in ion-exchange processes, as catalysts, in air and water purification, and other purposes. Deposits in McMullen County are currently being produced.

(  OTCQX :  TMRC )New name reflects significantly broader scope of Round Top projected output  Lithium, uranium, scandium and other valuable industrial minerals expected to potentially comprise 50% of projected project revenue Ticker symbol changed to TMRC effective immediately Texas Rare Earth Resources Corp. (  OTCQX :  TRER ), an exploration company targeting the heavy rare earths and a variety of other high-value elements and industrial minerals, announces that effective at 9:00 a.m. Eastern time on March 21, 2016, the Company will change its corporate name to Texas Mineral Resources Corp. and will begin trading on the OTCQX under the ticker symbol TMRC on the start of trading today with no impact to current shareholders. Shareholders approved the name change at the Annual General Meeting held on February 24, 2016. "Our increasing confidence in the ion exchange/ion chromatography process in separating and purifying the strategically vital heavy rare earth elements present in the Round Top ore now permits us to begin to examine the production and marketing of the variety of other elements that are leached from the rhyolite. The name change to Texas Mineral Resources Corp. will help us better communicate this significant broadening of the base of the company that we feel will significantly add to the value of our Round Top Project to potential partners and investors," said Dan Gorski, CEO.In addition to the heavy rare earth minerals potentially produced, TMRC has reported, in prior press releases, the following potentially recoverable quantities of minerals:          Mineral Potential Annual Recovery* Current Pricing           Uranium 307,000 lbs. $32.15 lb.**   Scandium 5,400 kgs. $1,600-2,000 kg. ***   Lithium 9,000 tons $6,000 ton ****          * Potential recovery amounts are estimates only based on preliminary assessments and are not derived from an SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant feasibility study and do not represent a proven or probable mineral reserve. ** UxC Spot Price *** Confidential discussions with industrial users **** September 2015 price. FMC has announced a 15% price increase effective January 2106It should be noted that in April 2015, TRER signed a uranium off-take agreement with UG USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of AREVA (  OTC PINK :  ARVCY ), a global leader in nuclear energy and major player in renewable energies. According to the agreement, TRER would supply up to 300,000 pounds of natural uranium concentrates (U308) per year based upon a pricing formula indexed to U308 spot prices at the times of delivery over a five-year period commencing in 2018 or as soon thereafter, contingent upon development and production at its Round Top project. UG USA has a right of first refusal on any quantities beyond the initial 300,000 pounds.As reported previously, careful review of the 2013 column leach tests indicates that if the industrial minerals present in these leach solutions were recovered, they would produce the following tonnages per year in the envisioned 20,000 tonnes per day operation at Round Top:          Mineral Potential Annual Recovery (Metric Tons)* Current Price Per Ton**           Aluminum Sulfate 182,000 MT $150-220   Ferrous Sulfate 71,000 MT $80-100   Magnesium Sulfate 44,000 MT $75-130   Potassium Sulfate 33,000 MT $700-735   Sodium Sulfate 26,000 MT $65-100   Lithium Sulfate 12,000 MT $450-650   Manganese Sulfate 4,800 MT $450-600          * Potential recovery amounts are estimates only based on preliminary assessments and are not derived from an SEC Industry Guide 7 compliant feasibility study and do not represent a proven or probable mineral reserve.**Open source pricing for commercial quantitiesFinally, in September 2015, TRER, in conjunction with its joint venture partner K-Technologies Inc, was awarded a research contract by the United States Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Strategic Materials Division, to demonstrate at the bench scale the ability to separate and refine yttrium (Y) oxide to a minimum of 99.999% purity, ytterbium (Yb) oxide to a minimum of 99.99% purity and a third rare earth oxide, which is not being publicly disclosed, to a minimum 99.9999% purity level, using CIX/CIC. We are pleased to report we are nearing successful completion of the project at the specified purities and we expect to announce more details in the near future."While the production of heavy rare earths remains the primary objective at Round Top, the deposit is truly poly-metallic," said Dan Gorski, CEO. "As we complete our assessment of the total potential of the deposit, the numerous other minerals potentially being recovered in leaching of this rock are proving to make a significant contribution to the potential revenue stream. Based upon current established industrial mineral pricing, the total revenue potential of the mineral byproducts may exceed that of the rare earth minerals at current internal Chinese pricing. Unlike rare earth minerals, the industrial minerals we plan to recover are readily marketable within the United States and around the world. Our existing infrastructure includes a rail yard within three miles of our deposit, thus enabling us to ship product anywhere in the United States for domestic or overseas consumption.Read MoreAbout Texas Mineral Resources Corp. Texas Mineral Resources Corp.'s primary focus is exploring and, if warranted, developing its Round Top heavy rare earth and industrial minerals project located in Hudspeth County, Texas, 85 miles east of El Paso.
