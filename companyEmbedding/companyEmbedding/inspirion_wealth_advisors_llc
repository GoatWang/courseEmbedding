Richard Young
Advisor

Richard Young received a BA in Economics from the University of Cincinnati. He then worked 23 years for a Fortune 500 company. After taking an early retirement, he started his financial business in 1996.
In 2011, Richard began a strategic partnership with Mark Holmertz to service his clients now and in the future. As Richard would put it, “Mark’s the brains and I’m the good looks!” A comic by nature, Richard can always elicit a smile from clients and colleagues.
Richard has been married for over 32 years, has two married adult children, and several grandchildren.
What do you enjoy most about wealth management?
I enjoy helping people meet and exceed their financial goals and/or needs. It has always been my passion to address people’s financial issues.
What’s the biggest challenge?
The volatility of the market and assessing people’s risk tolerance are challenges.
What do you love most about being part of Inspirion?
The variety of my colleagues’ expertise, their professionalism, as well as the culture of cooperation and integrity in our office, are important qualities to me.
What qualities of yours make you best suited to what you do?
I majored in Economics in college. Dealing with numbers and finances has always been my passion. Earning the trust of others is a quality of which I am proud.
What do you love to do outside of work?
I enjoy reading inspirational books. I enjoy most sporting events, which includes going to spring training baseball games in Arizona. My wife and I enjoy traveling, which includes visiting our two married children and grandchildren, who live in two different states.
What was the most influential book you’ve read and why?
I enjoyed the book The Automatic Millionaire by David Bach, and recommend it to my clients to read, as well.
What personal accomplishments are you most proud of?
I am proud that I made a successful career change at age 45, and find great pleasure in my work.

Noah Seidenberg
CFP®
Managing Partner



Noah Seidenberg has been a financial services professional for more than 20 years and founded his own wealth management firm, Seidenberg Investment Group, in 2000. In 2012, Noah and Rich made the decision to combine their two firms, founding Inspirion Wealth Management. Noah brings extensive market experience to the combined entity, including expertise in analyzing and selecting funds and fund managers.
A CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER™ practitioner, Noah holds a BA in Economics from Fredonia State University of New York, with a concentration in personal finance. At Fredonia, he played, and later was an assistant coach, for the school’s NCAA Divison III hockey team.
He is an active member of his community having been involved with a wide range of organizations, including Lions Club, Exchange Club, Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Merchants and Heritage Association, Financial Advisory Board of School District 46, and Hawthorn Woods Finance Committee. He also served as Director of the Grayslake Economic Development Commission.
Noah resides in Hawthorn Woods with his wife and 2 children. In his free time, he enjoys watching his children’s sports events, and playing hockey and paddle tennis.
What do you enjoy most about wealth management?
Educating people and helping give them some perspective on one of the most challenging parts of their lives. Especially in light of the fact that today, there are many sources providing “noise” regarding planning and investments.
What’s the biggest challenge?
Getting clients to step back and look objectively at their situation when they are actually “in the moment.”
What do you love most about being part of Inspirion?
Since helping to form Inspirion, it is the happiest I have ever been professionally. We have assembled a great team to do one thing — help clients.
What qualities of yours make you best suited to what you do?
Patience, and the ability to explain difficult terms and concepts more simply and understandably.
What do you love to do outside of work?
Spending time with my wife and kids, playing hockey and paddle tennis.
What personal accomplishments are you most proud of?
Playing collegiate hockey was something I was very proud of because I wasn’t naturally talented enough, but had to work very hard to get there. At this point I think I can look back and say I have set a good example for my children on how to be a decent citizen of the world.

VISUALIZING YOUR FUTURE
We focus on building long-term relationships so we can create the most effective financial strategy for our clients. Money, however, is just a part of what brings a client to our firm. We create financial plans that consider their entire lives, not just their assets.

Purpose


Inspirion Wealth Advisors was formed in 2012, when two well-respected advisory firms came together to better serve clients and ensure continuity. We have had the privilege of working with many of our clients for close to 20 years and have grown with them thanks to their trust, support, and continued loyalty.

We are a fee-only Registered Investment Advisor (RIA), which means that we have a fiduciary obligation to act solely in the best interest of our clients and charge them directly for our advice and ongoing management. We believe that integrity and objectivity are the most important qualities we can bring to our clients, along with experience and expertise.


We Believe


Professional Beliefs:

We believe in diversification as a way to minimize portfolio risk.
We believe in seeking low cost investments as a baseline for your portfolio.
We believe in managing your entire financial portfolio, holistically.
We believe your investments are a means to an end, and it’s our job to find out what that end goal truly is.



Personal Beliefs:

We believe in treating everyone with respect.
We believe in helping others.
We believe in working hard, and being appreciative for every opportunity.
We believe in an open mind, as it’s the only way you’ll ever continue to learn.




How Can We Help You?

We keep it simple. Investing doesn’t need to be overly complex. It begins and ends with knowing our clients, and understanding what’s important to them. We know that investments, tax considerations, estate planning and retirement needs can be complicated and time consuming, especially when you are focused on work, family, health and general well being. At Inspirion, our goal is to anticipate and manage the complexities of your financial life, freeing you to concentrate on all the other things that matter to you.


Investment PlanningOur planning process starts with listening and ends with thoughtful discussion around your risk tolerance, needs and future goals. We take the time to put the right investment strategy in place.
Retirement PlanningWe develop personalized projections that allow you to compare scenarios and financial markets in retirement. We’re committed to finding the right path for you so retiring is a peaceful decision.
Tax PlanningWe help our clients maintain control of their taxes in retirement, rather than stick to the status quo advice you may hear outside our walls. In collaboration with you and your tax advisor, we request yearly tax returns, and proactively seek to add value as it pertains to your overall wealth plan.
Estate PlanningOur advisors have the experience in creating estate plans, and work with a network of professionals to ensure professional execution so that your legacy is protected for years to come.
Charitable PlanningWe are passionate about gifting strategies and seek to help clients maximize their tax benefit while supporting their favorite cause.
Insurance PlanningWe aim to provide a sense of safety and security for you and your family. We help you analyze current policies as well as identify gaps in coverage.

Our Difference
You’re our difference. You’re what sets us apart. Your loyalty over the years is what drives us each and every day. The trust and appreciation you give is humbling, and we are committed to guiding you and your families for years to come.
