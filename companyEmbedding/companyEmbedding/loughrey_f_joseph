BOARD CHAIRF. Joseph LoughreyConnect on LinkedInJoe Loughrey was with Cummins Inc. for over 35 years until he retired on April 1, 2009 where he was president and vice chairman. Cummins is the world’s largest independent diesel engine manufacturer. He was a member of its board of directors since 2005 and the board of The Cummins Foundation since 1992.
During Loughrey’s career, Cummins—based in Columbus, Indiana—grew into a Fortune 200 company with over 40,000 employees and more than $14.3 billion in sales in 2008. Almost 60% of those sales were made outside the United States.
Along with his responsibilities at Cummins, Loughrey, a 1971 graduate of the University of Notre Dame, is recognized as a leading proponent of advanced manufacturing, both in Indiana and nationally. He served on the board of trustees (chairman 2005-2007) of The Manufacturing Institute, the educational arm of the National Association of Manufacturers and was founding chairman of Conexus Indiana from 2007—2012, an organization dedicated to promoting advanced manufacturing and logistics in Indiana. He continues to advocate for far better alignment between education and the knowledge and skill requirements of the future. Since the early 1970’s, he has also been involved in the promotion of international cooperation as well as corporate responsibility. He is actively involved in a number of organizations and initiatives which seek to eliminate poverty and injustice in the world.
He is chairman of Hillenbrand Inc., chairman of Oxfam America, and serves on the boards of AB SKF, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling, Inc., The Vanguard Group, Oxfam International, Lumina Foundation, and The V Foundation for Cancer Research. He is also a member (chair 2009-2012) of the advisory council to the College of Arts & Letters and chair of the Kellogg Institute for International Studies advisory board, both at the University of Notre Dame.
His honors include being named to the Irish America Business 100; Distinguished Alumni Honoree for Massachusetts Boys’ State 60th Anniversary; AIESEC Lifetime Achievement Award; Volunteer of the Year—Association of Retarded Citizens; and in 2007 he was given the Achievement Award for Business by the Ireland Chamber of Commerce in the U.S. and the Dick Johnson Leadership Award by the March of Dimes. He was named Indiana Global Business Person of 2007 and appointed ‘Sagamore of the Wabash’ by Governor Mitch Daniels in 2008. He also received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2008. In 2009 he was given the John F. Kennedy National Award by the St. Patrick’s Committee of Holyoke, Massachusetts, the William R. Laws Human Rights Award by the Human Rights Commission of Columbus, Indiana, and was elected to the Indiana Academy. In 2015 he received a Doctor of Humanities (honoris causa) from Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire for his philanthropy and volunteerism.

Board of directors

   Board of directors As an investor, you deserve to know that your assets are managed carefully with your best interests in mind. That's why it's important to know who ultimately controls how your money is managed. Our board of directors is in place to ensure that your mutual funds are organized, operated, and managed in the interest of their shareholders. These ten directors serve not only on Vanguard's board but also as trustees of each Vanguard fund. Nine are independent directors, meaning that they have no affiliation with Vanguard or the funds apart from any investments they may choose to make as private individuals. The tenth director is Vanguard's chief executive officer, Bill McNabb, who is also chairman of the board. The board members help select investment advisors for the funds; monitor fund operations, performance, and costs; review contracts; and elect Vanguard's officers. They are a very distinguished group, bringing a wide range of experience and perspectives to Vanguard's governance, as you can see below.      F. William McNabb III is  chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Vanguard. He  joined Vanguard in 1986, has been chief executive officer  since 2008,  and became chairman of the board in 2010. Mr. McNabb also serves as a director  of Vanguard Marketing Corporation, and he served as a managing director of  Vanguard from 1995 to 2008. Mr. McNabb is active elsewhere in the investment  management industry and serves on the executive committee of the Investment  Company Institute's board of governors. He is on the boards of the  Zoological Society of Philadelphia and United Way of Greater Philadelphia and  Southern New Jersey.        Mortimer J. "Tim" Buckley is president and a director of Vanguard. Previously, he was a managing director and Vanguard's chief investment officer, overseeing the company's internally managed stock, bond, and money market portfolios as well as its investment research and methodology.

Outside of Vanguard, he served as chairman of the board of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia from 2011 to 2017. He  holds an A.B. in economics from Harvard College and an M.B.A. from Harvard  Business School.        Emerson U. Fullwood retired in 2008 from Xerox Corporation, where he was the executive chief staff and marketing officer for North America and corporate vice president.
