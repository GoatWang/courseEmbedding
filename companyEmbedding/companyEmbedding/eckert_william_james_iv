A book is the nearest thing we have to telepathy, sending thoughts from the author's mind directly to the readers even over a gap of two thousand years. Even with all our technology, there is no better way to make a brain to brain connection than by simply reading a book. Go Way Back to the BeginningAntique books and manuscripts offer an amazing look into history, you can see the thoughts of the past as they saw them themselves. Antiquarian and collectible books don't just look good on the shelf, they also grow in value. There is nothing like picking up an old book to really feel the past. Explore the Human ConditionThe beauty of fiction and literature is that it lets you explore the human condition in a way that mere recitations of fact can never duplicate. Rather than focusing on the mundane, these books bring out the emotional truth of human experience. They show you who you really are by exposing you to other experiences you could never have discovered yourself. These books are the underpinnings of human culture. See how someone else sees the world. Discover the World Around YouNon fiction books offer the widest range of human experience, joined only by their commitment to the truth. From self-help to space travel, they run the gamut of human thought. Learn how to deal with your family, how to save money for that trip, or how the Egyptians built the pyramids. Follow famous lives, or study esoteric philosophies. It's all there for you to find. Non fiction gives us the foundations of human civilization, the story of how everything works. Keep Learning for LifeEducation is the gateway to success, and textbooks are your key to that door. From elementary readers to calculus texts, these books are the doors to our full potential. Textbooks not only give us facts, they give us the tools to interpret and make use of those facts. They are the key to organizing our thoughts and making our brains work for us. It's not just academia either, mechanics textbooks can help you learn how to fix your car.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsSee all in Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsBook Wholesale LotsOther Book & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsWholesale AudiobooksWholesale MagazinesBook AccessoriesSee all in Book AccessoriesAddress BooksBlank Diaries & JournalsBook CoversBook LightsBook PlatesBook Stands & HoldersBookendsBookmarksOther Book AccessoriesCatalogsSee all in CatalogsAgriculture CatalogsArt & Exhibitions CatalogsAuction CatalogsClothing & Fashion CatalogsDepartment Stores CatalogsMusic & Instruments CatalogsOther CatalogsOwner's Manuals CatalogsToys & Hobbies CatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksSee all in Children & Young Adult BooksChildren & YA Non-Fiction BooksChildren's Fiction BooksChildren's Picture BooksOther Children & Young Adult BooksYoung Adult Fiction BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksOther BooksTextbooks & Educational Books

Welcome to The Belford Family Tree. My name is Ian Belford and I am the 
administrator of this website. 
I have traced our tree on my fathers side through my Grandfather Robert James Belford 
back to JAMES BALFOUR born Muckross Ireland 1784-85 who 
sailed to Australia in 1840 in the "CRESCENT". He settled in the Newcastle 
area and worked as a Stone Mason and is buried in Millers Forest, HEXHAM near 
Newcastle.
His brother ROBERT BELFOUR born in Drumkeerin, Co Fermanagh, Ireland in 1805 
came to AUSTRALIA in 1838 on the "PARLAND" as a stone mason.
I have entered as much information as I have, please feel free to send me any 
information you would like added to this site. 

My G.Grandmother on my fathers side, Mary Martha Heinrch's family settled in South 
Australia after leaving Silesia in Prussia in the 1830's.
They were part of the Lutheran separatists who fled religious persecution by the 
Prussian authorities to start a new life in the fledgling colony of South Australia.

These events were brought about by the following........On 27th September 1817, in an 
attempt to unite the protestant movements of Calvinism and Lutheranism, Frederick 
William III announced his intention to create the "Church of the Prussian Union" His 
reasoning was to close the confessional gap between the Monarchy and the people, as 
he was prevented from taking communion with his late Lutheran wife, Luise. He also 
believed it would help stabalise Protestantism in face of the greatly enlarged 
Catholic minority in post-war Prussia.
He was met by increasing resistance from the Lutherans and by the mid 1830 the 
situation had escalated to the point where the authorities had taken to fining and 
imprisoning members of what was known as the Old Lutherans.
There was an argument that the state had no power to impose these actions against the 
separatists as ?Wollers Edict of Religion? of 9th July 1788 affirmed the right 
of ?the three main confessions of the Christian religion? to the protection of the 
monarch. As the jurist Carl Gottlieb Svares had explained to the future Frederick 
William III in 1791-2, the authority for such action rested not with the state, but 
with the individual religious community. Furthermore, the right of Lutherans to 
tolerance in the province of Silesia had been guaranteed by Frederick the Great in 
1740 and confirmend by Frederick William III in 1798. Separatist petitions frequently 
cited key passages in the ?General Code? and presented their stance as grounded in 
the dictates of conscience ?Gewissen?. For these and many other reasons the efforts 
of Interior Minister von Rochow to put and end to the Old Lutheran movement were a 
failure. 
The conflict was defused only in 1845 when Frederick William IV offered a general 
amnesty and granted the Lutherans the right to establish themselves within Prussia as 
an autonomous church association, upholding the legal stance they had maintained from 
the beginning. 
A deeply embarrassing chapter for the Prussian authorities, and widely reported in 
the press at the time, occurred when Prussians living along the banks of the river 
Oder were treated to an astonishing site: barges full of law-abiding, hymn-singing 
Lutherans on their way to Hamburg for transfer to London and then to South Australia, 
fleeing religious persecution. Taken from "Iron Kingdom the rise and downfall of 
Prussian, 1600-1947" by Christopher Clark penguin books c2006.

One reason is simple, while the Internet may be everywhere, it's not always accurate, and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information. That's why approved textbooks are so important; they give you the facts, not the opinions of someone on the Internet.Help for the Home SchooledNo one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children. There is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their children's education on the aspects Engl are most important to them, and tailor the curriculum to their own child's individual learning styles. From science and mathematics to English and history, textbooks are a vital part of any education program.For Every Age LevelNo matter what age or grade level your student is at, there are education textbooks to cover their needs.  Even if they go to a regular grade school, there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it. Not every book is the right fit for every student, and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbook.Explore Adult EducationEducation isn't just for children; many adults have a need for textbooks too. From those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their GED, to professionals looking to further their development, there's a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life. It's not just academic textbooks. You can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management, to woodworking, and auto repair.Control Your College EducationCollege is more than just an investment in your future; it's an investment. One way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks. Many textbooks, especially in fields such as English and history do not change much from year to year, so grabbing last  year's engineering handbook may be the best way to go.Tell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryBooksTextbooks & Educational BooksBook AccessoriesAntique Books and ManuscriptsAudiobooksCatalogsChildren & Young Adult BooksCookbooksFiction & Literature BooksMagazine Back IssuesNonfiction BooksBook & Magazine Wholesale & Bulk LotsOther BooksFormatsee allHardcoverMixed LotPaperbackNot SpecifiedPublication Yearsee all1900-19491950-19992000-20102011-NowSubjectsee allBusiness & EconomicsEducation, TeachingEngineeringHistoryMathMedicinePerforming ArtsScience & TechLanguagesee allConditionsee allBrand NewLike NewVery GoodGoodAcceptableNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
