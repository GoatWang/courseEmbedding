Throughout the ages, sailors effectively used celestial navigation to determine their latitude. Calculating longitude, however, was more difficult because the Earth’s rotation of 15 degrees per hour causes a one degree difference in longitude for every four minutes of time difference between a ship’s home port and its location.Accurate determination of longitude by celestial navigation relied on knowing the precise time difference between one’s home port and where one was at sea. While not particularly problematic for short voyages, the importance of precise timekeeping over long journeys became very important by the 15th century as transatlantic travel to the “New World” grew more frequent. Timepieces of the day were imprecise and failed in the harsh conditions experienced at sea, resulting in the regular loss of ships, many lives and precious cargo. The ability to calculate longitude accurately emerged as a major economic opportunity for sea faring nations looking to expand their influence abroad.Consequently, several European monarchies offered financial incentives to solve this problem as early as 1598, but it was only after a series of highly publicized Royal Navy shipwrecks in the early 1700s caused by miscalculation of longitude that the British Parliament created The Longitude Prize, an unprecedented reward of £20,000 (equivalent to several million dollars today) to the person who invented a technology that could accurately and consistently determine longitude.John Harrison (1693-1776), a self-educated clockmaker in England, won The Longitude Prize after inventing and perfecting a marine chronometer nearly impervious to pitch and roll, temperature and humidity. Between 1730 and 1761, Harrison tested four timekeeping devices (H1, H2, H3 and H4) on various sea voyages. Ultimately, the H4 proved itself on two voyages to the Caribbean and Harrison was awarded the prize. Today, Harrison’s four experimental timepieces are on permanent display in the National Maritime Museum at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England.John Harrison’s talent and entrepreneurial persistence delivered a paradigm-changing solution to one of the greatest economic and technical problems of his day and earned him a great reward. The Longitude Prize is an apt metaphor for our own endeavors at Longitude Capital – we invest in outstanding entrepreneurs focused on using technology to solve problems of significant economic and social importance.      Disclaimer - Longitude Capital          Select Page   DisclaimerThis website not an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities of any fund many managed by Longitude. Solicitation of offers to buy the risks inherent in the investment in a Fund. The information herein is not intended to provide, and should not be construed as financial advice. Portfolio Companies are listed for informational purposes only and should not be considered a recommendation to sell or to purchase any specific security.Risk FactorsAn investment in any Longitude fund involves a significant degree of risk. The following considerations should be carefully evaluated.Reliance on ManagementThe success of the fund will depend on the general partner, and in particular, on the ability of the investment professionals who manage the general partner, to implement the fund’s investment strategy, to identify and consummate suitable investments and manage these investments to profitability. The loss of the services of one or more of these investment professionals would likely have a material adverse effect on the general partner and its ability to effectively manage the fund.Unspecified InvestmentsThere can be no assurance that the general partner will be able to identify, structure and implement investments consistent with the fund’s investment objective, strategy or policies, and there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to achieve its expected returns or achieve its investment objectives. There can be no assurance that any portfolio investments completed by the fund will provide returns commensurate with the risk of investment in the Fund.Past PerformanceNo representation is being made that the fund will or is likely to achieve comparable performance results to that shown herein. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Although valuations of unrealized investments are made on assumptions that the general partner believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the actual realized return on unrealized investments will depend on among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may differ significantly from the assumptions on which the valuations used in the data contained herein are based. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that these valuations are accurate and the actual realized return on these investments may differ materially from the expected returns.Lack of DiversificationThe fund may concentrate its investments in a particular industry or geographic region, and may not be broadly diversified. Any disruptions to such industries will affect the value of the fund’s portfolio more than they would likely affect a portfolio that was not similarly concentrated. The fund may, therefore, be subject to greater risk of loss than a more broadly diversified fund.IlliquidityNo market exists for the interests in the fund and none is expected to develop. It is anticipated that there will be a significant period of time before the fund has completed its investment program. Many of the investments made by the fund may be very illiquid and may take from years from the date of initial investment to reach a state of maturity when realization of the investment can be achieved, if at all. It is anticipated that all or a substantial portion of the fund’s investments will consist of securities that are subject to restrictions on sale by the fund because they were acquired from the issuer in “private placement” transactions or because the fund will be deemed to be an affiliate of the issuer. Generally, the fund will not be able to sell these securities publicly without the expense and time required to register the securities under the Securities Act.Defaulting InvestorsIf an investor fails to pay its commitment to the fund when due, and the contributions made by non-defaulting investors are inadequate to cover the defaulted contributions, the fund may be unable to pay its obligations when due. As a result, the fund may be subjected to significant penalties that could materially adversely affect the returns to the investors (including non-defaulting investors).General Partner Conflicts of InterestInstances may arise where the interests of the general partner may potentially or actually conflict with the interests of the fund and the investors. For example, the existence of the general partner’s carried interest may create an incentive for the general partner to make more speculative investments on behalf of the fund than it would otherwise make in the absence of such performance-based arrangements. Assets of the fund will be valued by the general partner. The general partner is not required to obtain and does not expect to obtain an independent appraisal of the value of securities or other assets.Economic and Regulatory RiskSecurities markets and exchanges have experienced high volatility, market disruption and substantial losses, which may continue for some time. Investors should be aware that these market conditions can be expected to present significant challenges to investors, including managers with past success under other market conditions. Unexpected volatility, illiquidity, governmental action, currency devaluation, or other events in global markets in which the fund directly or indirectly holds positions could impair the ability of the fund to carry out its business and could cause the fund to incur substantial losses. Legal, tax and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the fund that may adversely affect the fund, its portfolio companies or the investors.

 Follow @chriswitkowsky





Longitude Capital led a $68 million Series C preferred stock financing in Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which develops ophthalmic products. New investors in the funding included OrbiMed, Vivo Capital and CAM Capital. Existing investors in the funding included RA Capital Management, Wellington Management Company LLP, Polaris Partners, Lux Capital, CVF, LLC and others. Gregory Grunberg, managing director at Longitude Capital, and Chen Yu, managing partner at Vivo Capital, are joining Kala’s board as new board members.
Press Release
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Kala), a developer of innovative ophthalmic products based on its proprietary mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) technology, announced that it has closed a highly oversubscribed $68 million Series C preferred stock financing, led by Longitude Capital. Additional new investors included OrbiMed, Vivo Capital and CAM Capital, who were joined by RA Capital Management, Wellington Management Company LLP, Polaris Partners, Lux Capital, CVF, LLC, and other existing investors.
“This financing provides us with the resources to complete our Phase 3 trials with KPI-121, our novel nanoparticle formulation of loteprednol etabonate, in cataract surgery and dry eye disease, which if successful, will position us to file New Drug Applications for each indication in the U.S. in 2017,” said Mark Iwicki, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kala Pharmaceuticals. “We are grateful for the support of so many blue chip investors who share our conviction that Kala’s MPP enabled medicines can transform the treatment of millions of patients suffering from these conditions.” 





The proceeds of the financing will be used to advance the confirmatory Phase 3 trial for KPI-121 for the treatment of inflammation and pain following cataract surgery, two parallel Phase 3 studies for KPI-121 in dry eye disease, and for general corporate purposes.
In conjunction with the financing, Kala added two seats to the company’s Board of Directors. Gregory Grunberg, Managing Director at Longitude Capital, and Chen Yu, Managing Partner at Vivo Capital, joined as new Board members. Rajeev Shah, Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at RA Capital Management, joined the Company’s Board of Directors last year. Jonathan Silverstein, Partner and a Co-Head of Global Private Equity at OrbiMed, will hold a Board observer seat.
“Kala has rapidly transformed into a late-stage ophthalmic company with multiple near-term commercial opportunities for KPI-121,” said Gregory Grunberg. “Kala’s promising pipeline has the potential to address major markets with large unmet needs and the company has the financial strength, the right team, and the experience to drive its programs toward near-term value creation.”

KPI-121 is a novel nanoparticle formulation of loteprednol etabonate utilizing Kala’s proprietary MPP technology to enhance penetration into target tissues of the eye. KPI-121 has been studied in multiple clinical trials, including 1% and 0.25% formulations for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain and a 0.25% formulation for dry eye and Meibomian gland disease. 





About Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
Kala is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on innovative nanoparticle-based treatments for ocular diseases affecting both front and back of the eye. Kala leverages its proprietary mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) technology to develop topical ophthalmic formulations with enhanced delivery into ocular tissue by facilitating penetration through the tear film mucus. Beyond ophthalmology, Kala’s MPP technology has potential applications in women’s reproductive health, respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases, and other indications.
Kala was founded by leaders in the fields of nanomedicine and biopharmaceutical engineering, and is backed by leading life sciences investors including Longitude Capital, OrbiMed, Vivo Capital, CAM Capital, RA Capital Management, Polaris Partners, Third Rock Ventures, Lux Capital, CVF, LLC, and Ysios Capital.
