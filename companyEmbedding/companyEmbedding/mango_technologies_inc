A brief history
Mango Technologies began with a small group of like-minded individuals.
In 2012, the entire founding group were complete strangers to one another. Even weirder, we were living in totally different worlds.
Some of us were building software, one was running a sales teams for a Fortune 500 company, another was working as a nuclear engineer at Oak Ridge National Lab (of Manhattan Project fame) – and the list goes on.
But starting in 2014, our paths began to converge – one at a time and in extremely unusual ways.
As we became acquainted with one another, we found that we didn’t just have similar short-term goals but that we all had a fundamentally similar vision for our futures: One that prioritized our future impact in the world over “seizing the day” while we were still young.
We shared many of the same core beliefs and frustrations, but also had such different skills and backgrounds that our ability to solve problems skyrocketed when we were together.
While we all had our own projects, we couldn’t help but get involved in what everybody else was doing – the problems were just too enticing.
After a few months of cross-pollination, it became obvious that the chemistry we had was something that couldn’t be replicated any other way.
We knew we had to combine our efforts in a coordinated way.
Within a month of this realization, we formalized our team as Mango Technologies.
Together we outlined our vision for the future, the values we believe will be paramount to realizing this vision, and the concrete goals we felt were most pressing.
In 2016, we moved our offices to Palo Alto to pursue our vision as aggressively as possible.
So far, our projects have prioritized solutions to our own problems – ranging from a video social network to a social media marketing company.
Our primary project currently, ClickUp, is a project management tool designed for builders instead of just managers.

With ClickUp, Mango Technologies is hoping to deliver a fundamentally different solution to some of the deepest problems in business, and this will require and A+ development team.
Although there are a number of giants already fighting within the market, Mango Technologies is not intimidated by their scale.
“We believe that we’ll be able to carve out our piece of the market – and that from there we’ll be able to expand to tangential markets as we grow,” stated Brian Evans, the CEO of Mango Technologies.
However, ClickUp is confident it’s fresh approach will be able to penetrate the market and allow it to develop into a major business.
ClickUp is the newest project for Mango Technologies, a young team which has been self-funded up to this point.
