North American Power Cords

North American cords are keyed by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) in relation to both current and voltage. All North American cords are UL and C-UL approved. The North American Power Cords category is broken down into four sections. The 2 Conductors sub-category refers to molds utilizing only two prongs. 3 Conductors includes plugs and receptacles that have three blades in their configuration. Rotating plugs are unique for their sleek and adaptable design, and Extension Cords incorporate plugs and receptacles of the same type with a few interesting style variations.





Choose among the following:















2 Conductors Power Cords












3 Conductors Power Cords












Rotating Power Cords














Extension Cords












Q-Lock Cords












IEC Auto-Lock™ Power Cords

High Voltage/Current Power CordsQuail Electronics, Inc.® offers the highest quality in high voltage and high current power cords from heavy gauge straight-blade cords to construction grade locking NEMAs.  The high volumes of electricity carried by these cords necessitate a unique plug and receptacle design to assure matching electrical ratings.  All our heavy duty cords are machined precisely to industry standards and carry the necessary approvals.
High Voltage/Current Power Cords are divided into three sections:  Straight Blade Cords are all the NEMA configurations which have the standard flat pins.  Locking Blade Cords are all the NEMA plugs and receptacles that use low tolerance rounded pins for twist-lock action.  IEC60309 is a category of cords that complies with international regulation IEC 60309, and can be distinguished by the circular housing.





Choose among the following:















Straight Blade












Locking Blade












IEC60309














IEC Auto-Lock™ Power Cords
