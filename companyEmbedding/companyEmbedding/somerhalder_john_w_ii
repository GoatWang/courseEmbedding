AGL Resources - About Us - Executive Leadership - John W. Somerhalder II



























 








John W. Somerhalder II
					        Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
                            AGL Resources
John W. Somerhalder II was named president and chief executive officer of AGL Resources (NYSE:GAS) in March 2006 and has served as chairman of the company's board of directors since November 2007. In May of 2015 the company named Andrew W. Evans president and chief operating officer, with Somerhalder remaining chairman and chief executive officer.
With more than three decades in the energy industry, including state and regulatory experience in multiple jurisdictions, Somerhalder provides seasoned leadership to AGL Resources, an Atlanta-based energy services holding company with operations in natural gas distribution, retail operations, wholesale services and midstream operations. As the nation's largest natural gas-only distributor based on customer count, AGL Resources serves approximately 4.5 million utility customers in seven states through its regulated distribution subsidiaries: Atlanta Gas Light, Chattanooga Gas, Elizabethtown Gas, Elkton Gas, Florida City Gas, Nicor Gas and Virginia Natural Gas. The company also serves more than one million retail customers through its SouthStar Energy Services joint venture and Pivotal Home Solutions, which market natural gas and related home services. Other non-utility businesses include asset management for natural gas wholesale customers through Sequent Energy Management and ownership and operation of natural gas storage facilities. 
Somerhalder joined AGL Resources from El Paso Corporation, where he spent almost 30 years, rising through the ranks from engineer to president of El Paso Pipeline Group and executive vice president of El Paso Corporation.
He is a member of the board of directors of the American Gas Association, which he chaired in 2011. He also serves on the boards of the Gas Technology Institute, the Georgia Chamber of Commerce and the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce. He has served as past chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of America. He currently serves as a director of Crestwood Equity Partners LP.
Somerhalder is chairman of the board of the Atlanta BeltLine, Inc., which is leading the development of the Atlanta BeltLine along 22 miles of historic railroad around the city. A member of the board of the United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta, he successfully chaired the 2009 United Way Campaign for metro Atlanta during difficult economic times and served an unprecedented second term as chair of the 2010 campaign.

Somerhalder holds a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering from the University of Arizona.
He and his wife, Rebecca, live in Atlanta. They have four grown children and six grandchildren.
