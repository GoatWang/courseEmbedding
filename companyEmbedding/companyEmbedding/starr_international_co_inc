      the insurance life cycle. The technology is expected to lower 
      operational costs resulting in savings for the customer.
    

      “We wanted to team up with a technology leader, with strong data and 
      design capabilities, to radically transform the customer experience when 
      buying insurance,” said Maurice R. Greenberg, chairman of Starr 
      Companies. “With CoverWallet, we have found a partner that is innovative 
      and ambitious with respect to online insurance.”
    

      As part of the partnership, CoverWallet has also received additional 
      funding from Starr Companies. CoverWallet previously raised $10MM from 
      Union Square Ventures, Index Ventures, Highland Capital Partners,

Starr Companies Enhances Crime & Fidelity Endorsement

Article
Comments


Starr Companies has launched an enhanced crime & fidelity endorsement expanding coverage for fraudulent impersonation losses.
According to Brian Inselberg, senior vice president, Financial Lines,  the enhanced coverage offers coverage for losses associated with certain transfers of tangible property because of fraud.
“While coverage for loss of ‘funds’ may be available in the marketplace, businesses are still exposed to the risk of loss for the transfer of tangible property as a result of a fraudulent instruction,” Inselberg said. “Given the rapid speed with which companies often move their inventory, component parts, and, other tangible property, the risk of acting on a fraudulent instruction is increasing.”
Starr Companies’ expanded coverage follows the recent introduction of the KnowBe4 risk management tools as part of the company’s efforts to address the evolving crime and fidelity exposures of companies.
Starr Companies (Starr) is the worldwide marketing name for the operating insurance and travel assistance companies and subsidiaries of Starr International Company, Inc. and for the investment business of C.V. Starr & Co., Inc. and its subsidiaries. Through its operating insurance companies, Starr provides property, casualty, and accident & health insurance products as well as a range of specialty coverages including aviation, marine, energy and excess casualty insurance.

Starr vs The US | Starr International Co., Inc. v. The United States

























CONTACT US

























ABOUT


On September 22, 2008, the United States took a 79.9% equity interest in AIG - contemporaneously valued by the United States and AIG at $23 billion - without paying just compensation to AIG's common shareholders.  As a result, the existing common shareholders went from owning 100% of the Company to owning 20.1%.
 
At the same time, the United States extended an $85 billion line of credit to AIG. That loan was fully secured by all of AIG's assets and initially cost over 14% in interest and fees. Under the applicable statute, Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the United States was only entitled to collect a reasonable rate of interest1 and fully secure its loan; at the relevant time, neither the Federal Reserve nor the Treasury Department could own equity in a private company.2 In an attempt to avoid that prohibition, the United States created a trust to hold the equity; the judge presiding over this action characterized the trust as an attempt ''to circumvent" those prohibitions and said that there appeared to be "no meaningful distinction" between ownership by the United States or by the trust.
 
AIG fully repaid the loan, which was always fully secured, but the United States nevertheless kept the 79.9% equity interest.3 The United States reported that it made a $22.7 billion profit on the loan and its other financial dealings with AIG between the Fall of 2008 and the end of 2012.
 
On November 21, 2011, Starr International, which had owned 11% of the common stock of AIG prior to the Government's taking, commenced an action in the United States Court of Federal Claims on behalf of a class of AIG shareholders, alleging that the Government's taking and/or illegal exaction of that 79.9% interest without just compensation violated the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Starr also claims that the United States used the control it acquired over AIG on September 16, 2008, when it made a $14 billion loan to AIG under a short-term demand note, to install its own management in AIG, impose the terms of the taking on AIG, and otherwise operate AIG to serve the interests of the Government and AIG's counterparties to the detriment of AIG and its common shareholders.  Starr separately claims that the Government used this control to cause a misleading and coercive vote on a reverse stock split of AIG's stock on June 30, 2009 that permitted the Government to circumvent AIG shareholders' right to block the United States from exchanging its AIG preferred stock for more liquid (and thus more valuable) AIG common stock.  Starr will also prove at trial that none of the many other financial institutions that were suffering from a liquidity shortage in 2008 received financial assistance from the United States on terms that remotely approached the terms that were imposed on AIG and its common shareholders.
 
Judge Thomas Wheeler, to whom the action has been assigned, has denied multiple attempts by the United States to dismiss Starr's claims, certified a class of over 275,000 AIG common shareholders,  and set September 29, 2014 as the date to commence a six-week bench trial.  Lead trial counsel will be David Boies of Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is acting as co-counsel in the action.  Starr's damages expert (Deputy Dean S.P. Kothari of MIT) has opined that AIG's common shareholders suffered damages of over $40 billion ($35.4 billion on the takings claim  and $4.67 billion on the reverse stock split claim), plus pre-judgment interest.

Starr International Co., Inc.v. The United StatesClass Action Lawsuit: Boies, Schiller & Flexner for Starr







NEWS


1 The Federal Reserve discount rate at the time was 3% or less.
2 One of the reasons the United States’ motion to dismiss this action was denied was that Section 13(3) does not
authorize a Federal Reserve bank to demand stock in a corporation in return for a loan.
3 In denying the United States' motion to dismiss, the federal judge presiding over this action rejected the Government's claim that the equity interest was "security" for the extension of credit and stated that he would treat the acquisition of the 79.9% equity interest as a purchase for $500,000 in loan forgiveness to AIG.

A C Corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax, regulatory and official reasons. A C Corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business, and contrasts with other popular business structures including Limited Liability Companies (LLCs), S Corporations, Sole Proprietorships and others.
Generally, a C Corporation structure is better for larger businesses. This is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares, through having an Initial Public Offering, or IPO. A C Corporation is much more attractive to potential investors, including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation.
The majority of larger businesses in the United States are structured as C Corporations, although a C Corp could, theoretically, consist of just one person. The information below will help you decide if a C Corporation structure is right for your business.
How Is a C Corporation Formed?
A C Corp, also known as a corporation, is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing “Articles of Incorporation” with the Secretary of State in the state of incorporation. The policies, articles, cost and regulations for forming a C Corp vary from state-to-state. Details on exactly how to form a C Corporation can be found at the end of this article.
The corporation is the oldest form of business entity. It has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose, with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own. Although a C Corp is a popular business structure, there are other options for forming businesses in the US.
The Advantages of C Corporations
Forming a C Corporation does have several benefits:
1. A C Corporation has Limited Liability
Because a C Corp is a separate legal entity, the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors, investors and shareholders. Generally, the owners of a C Corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations. This does not apply in all cases, for example if corporate funds are misused, there is wilful fraud, or if certain rules and regulations are not followed.
2. A C Corporation Exists Independently of its Owners
A C Corporation can have “Perpetual Existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business.
3. Ownership of C Corporations Can Be Fluid and Transferred
Ownership in a C Corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues. These stocks can be bought and sold between investors, and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange, institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company.
4. Ease of Access to Funding Through Issuing Stock
If a C Corporation want to raise money, it can hold an “Initial Public Offering (IPO)” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange. This can bring significant money into a business. They can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding, although this can dilute the value of existing shares.
5. Enhanced Business or Corporate Credibility
Most of the businesses that are household names are C Corporations. Incorporating as a C Corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority.
The Disadvantages of a C Corporation
A C Corporation does have some disadvantages. Briefly, they are:

A different tax structure to other types of businesses.
Double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them.
Legal rules, regulations, formalities, and compliance they have to meet.

We cover these in more detail below.
What Are the Differences Between an S Corp, C Corp and LLC?
Two other popular business entity structures in the US are the S Corp and the LLC. They provide many of the same protections offered by a C Corp but have less formal rules on taxation, governance and compliance. This can mean more flexibility in how an LLC or S Corp is owned and funded.
One of the main differences between C Corps and S Corps / LLCs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed.

For LLCs and S Corps, any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’ / shareholders’ / members’ tax returns, where it is taxed as part of1 their overall income. The company does not have to file a separate tax return.
S Corps and C Corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends.
S Corps are limited to having a maximum of 100 shareholders.
A C Corp is taxed at the corporate level — That means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned.

How Are Profits And Taxes Handled With A C Corp?
A C Corporation is taxed as a separate business entity. Unlike individuals, C Corporations have to file a designated tax form with the IRS, which is called IRS Form 1120. Additionally, C Corporations have their own tax rates.
Corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital, this can shelter some of the profits from taxation.
C Corporation Tax Rates
The tax rates levied on C Corporations are as follows.
Profit

Up to $50,000 — 15%
$50,000 - $75,000 — 25%
$75,000 - $100,000 — 34%
$100,000 - $335,000 — 39%
$335,000 - $10,000,000 — 34%
$10,000,000 - $15,000,000 — 35%
$15,000,000 - $18,333,333 — 38%
More than $18,333,333 — 35%

Stock Dividends from C Corporations
A C Corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends, which are distributed to shareholders. The percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own.
Dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice (double-taxed). They are taxed first at the corporate level as profit (on the corporation’s form 1120), and again at the individual level as stock dividends (on the shareholder's form 1040).
What are a C Corporation's Legal Requirements?
A C Corporation must meet certain requirements:
1. Hold an Annual General Meeting (AGM) for the shareholders and the board of directors
The annual meetings are used to discuss and decide important information, strategic decisions, opportunities, risks and issues that the corporation will need to deal with.
2. Issue shares to investors as ownership of the business
Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares. The management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.
3. Appoint a board of directors
The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also drafts bylaws for the corporation. These are written protocols that state the way that the corporation will be governed.
4. Assign Certain Positions in the Corporation
A C Corporation will need to have all of the following positions. In a small C Corp, one person could hold multiple of these positions.

Shareholders: They own the company's stock and are responsible for electing directors, amending the bylaws and articles of incorporation and approving major actions taken by the corporation like mergers and the sale of corporate assets. They alone are allowed to dissolve the corporation.
Directors: They manage the corporation and are responsible for issuing stock, electing officers and making the corporation's major decisions.
Officers: The corporation must have a president, secretary, and treasurer. These officers are responsible for making the day-to-day decisions that govern the corporation's operation.
Employees: They receive a salary in return for their work for the corporation.

Forming a C Corporation
If a C Corporation is right for you, here’s how to form one:

Choose a legal name for your new business.
If the Secretary of State in your state reserves business names, reserve the name.
Draft and file your Articles of Incorporation — These should be sent to your Secretary of State.
Establish who your initial investors and shareholders are.
Create and issue stock certificates to your shareholders.
Apply for a business license — You may require licenses from your state, county, and township.
Apply for any other certificates you need to conduct business — These can vary from industry to industry.
Get an “Employer Identification Number (EIN): from the IRS — You can file online, or complete form SS-4.
Apply for any other ID numbers and complete other formalities required by your state and local government agencies.
Requirements do vary from one jurisdiction to another, but you will generally need to get ID numbers for the unemployment, disability and other payroll taxes.
Appoint a board of directors.
Assign other positions in the business as required by law.

We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.

That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form CT-6 is time sensitive and must be filed with the the state within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain the NYS S-corporation tax status for the current year.
