 5.8     
Matters Relating
to Acquisition of the ETP Common Units .
(a)     
Such Contributor has
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so
as to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its
investment in the ETP Common Units and is capable of bearing the
economic risk of such investment. Such Contributor is acquiring the
ETP Common Units for investment for its own account and not with a
view toward or for sale in connection with any distribution
thereof, or with any present intention of distributing or selling
the ETP Common Units. Such Contributor does not have any Contract
or arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant
participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect
to the ETP Common Units. Such Contributor acknowledges and
understands that (i) the acquisition of the ETP Common Units has
not been registered under the Securities Act in reliance on an
exemption therefrom and (ii) the ETP Common Units will, upon such
acquisition, be characterized as “restricted
securities” under state and federal securities laws. Such
Contributor agrees that the ETP Common Units may not be sold,
transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise
disposed of except pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in
compliance with other applicable state and federal securities laws.
Each Contributor acknowledges that the ETP Common Units to be
issued at the Closing as the ETP Equity Consideration will bear a
restrictive legend in the following or similar form:

THESE SECURITIES HAVE
BEEN ISSUED IN RELIANCE UPON AN EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “SECURITIES
ACT”) AND HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED WITH THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION OR THE SECURITIES COMMISSION OF ANY STATE. THE
HOLDER OF THESE SECURITIES ACKNOWLEDGES FOR THE BENEFIT OF ENERGY
TRANSFER PARTNERS, L.P. THAT THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD,
OFFERED, RESOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IF SUCH TRANSFER
WOULD (A) VIOLATE THE THEN APPLICABLE FEDERAL OR STATE SECURITIES
LAWS OR RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION, ANY STATE SECURITIES COMMISSION OR ANY OTHER
GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY WITH JURISDICTION OVER SUCH TRANSFER, (B)
TERMINATE THE EXISTENCE OR QUALIFICATION OF ENERGY TRANSFER
PARTNERS, L.P. UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, OR (C)
CAUSE ENERGY TRANSFER PARTNERS, L.P. TO BE TREATED AS AN
ASSOCIATION TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE TO BE TAXED AS AN
ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES (TO THE EXTENT NOT ALREADY
SO TREATED OR TAXED). THE GENERAL PARTNER OF ENERGY
TRANSFER

 



28
 

 




 


 


PARTNERS L.P., MAY
IMPOSE ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF THESE SECURITIES
IF IT RECEIVES AN OPINION OF COUNSEL THAT SUCH RESTRICTIONS ARE
NECESSARY TO AVOID A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF ENERGY TRANSFER PARTNERS,
L.P. BECOMING TAXABLE AS A CORPORATION OR OTHERWISE BECOMING
TAXABLE AS AN ENTITY FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAX PURPOSES. THE
RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH ABOVE SHALL NOT PRECLUDE THE SETTLEMENT OF
ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THESE SECURITIES ENTERED INTO THROUGH
THE FACILITIES OF ANY NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE ON WHICH THESE
SECURITIES ARE LISTED OR ADMITTED TO TRADING.
(b)     
Such Contributor has
undertaken such investigation as it has deemed necessary to enable
it to make an informed and intelligent decision with respect to the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
acquisition of the ETP Common Units. Such Contributor has had an
opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from Contributors
regarding the terms and conditions of the offering of the ETP
Common Units and the business, properties, prospects and financial
condition of ETP. The foregoing, however, does not modify the
representations and warranties of ETP in Article VI and such
representations and warranties constitute the sole and exclusive
representations and warranties of ETP to such Contributor in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.
 5.9     
No Other

AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE III, ARTICLE IV OR ARTICLE
V, AND THOSE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THE OTHER
TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, SUCH CONTRIBUTOR MAKES NO
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, AND SUCH CONTRIBUTOR

its business as it is now being conducted. ETP is duly qualified,
registered or licensed to do business as a foreign entity and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the property owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of the business conducted by
it makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
to materially impair ETP’s ability to perform its obligations
under this Agreement. ETP has

 



29
 

 




 


 


made available to

Enforceability .
(a)

Documents to which ETP is or will be a party, and the consummation
by ETP of the transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly and
validly authorized by ETP, and no other proceedings on the part of
ETP are necessary to authorize the Transaction Documents to which

contemplated by the Transaction Documents to which it is or will be
a party.
(b)     
The Transaction
Documents to which ETP is or will be a party have been duly

would give rise to a default) under, or give rise to any right of
termination, cancellation, amendment, preferential purchase right
or acceleration (with or without the giving of notice, or the

provisions of any Contract to which ETP or its Subsidiaries is a

constitute (with or without the giving of notice or the passage of
time or both) an event which would result in the creation of any
Lien (other than Permitted Liens) on any asset of ETP or its
Subsidiaries; except to the extent that, with respect to clauses
(b) and (c), such default, event, obligation, termination,
cancellation, amendment, preferential purchase right, acceleration,
violation would not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which ETP is or
will be a party or to materially impair ETP’s ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party.
 6.4

Approvals . Except as set forth on

course be made or obtained after the Closing, or which, if not
obtained or made, would not reasonably be expected to prevent or

to perform its obligations under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party.

by the Transaction Documents to which ETP is or will be a party or
to materially impair ETP’s ability to perform its obligations
under the Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a
party.
 6.6     
SEC Filings
Regarding ETP .
(a)     
ETP has timely filed
with or furnished to the SEC all reports, schedules, forms,

Document complied as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act,
as the case may be.
(c)     
As of its filing date
(or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date hereof,
on the date of such filing amending or superseding same), each ETP
SEC Document filed pursuant to the Exchange Act did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.
(d)     
Each ETP SEC Document
that is a registration statement, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date
such registration statement or amendment became effective or is
deemed to have become effective, did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading.
 6.7

6.9     
Valid
Issuance . The issuance of the ETP Common
Units constituting the ETP Equity Consideration has been duly
authorized in accordance with the Organizational Documents of ETP.
Such ETP Common Units, when issued and delivered in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid (to
the extent required under the Organizational Documents of ETP),
nonassessable (except as such nonassessability may be affected by
Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the Delaware LP Act) and,
assuming each Contributor is an “Eligible Citizen” as
such term is defined in the Organizational Documents of ETP and
except as otherwise provided in the Organizational Documents of
ETP, free of any Liens, other than transfer restrictions imposed by
federal and state securities laws or the Organizational Documents
of such Contributor.
 6.10     
Matters Relating
to Acquisition of the Subject Interests .
(a)     
ETP has such knowledge
and experience in financial and business matters so as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Subject Interests and is capable of bearing the economic risk of
such investment. ETP is an “accredited investor” as
that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D (without regard to
Rule 501(a)(4)) promulgated under the Securities Act. ETP is
acquiring the Subject Interests for investment for its own account
and not with a view toward or for sale in connection with any
distribution thereof, or with any present intention of distributing
or selling the Subject Interests. ETP does not have any Contract or
arrangement with any Person to sell, transfer or grant
participations to such Person or to any third Person, with respect
to the Subject Interests. ETP acknowledges and understands that (i)
the acquisition of the Subject Interests has not been registered
under the Securities Act in reliance on an exemption therefrom and
(ii) the Subject Interests will, upon such acquisition, be
characterized as “restricted securities” under state
and federal securities laws. ETP agrees that the Subject Interests
may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of except pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act or
pursuant to an available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with other
applicable state and federal securities laws.
(b)     
ETP has undertaken such
investigation as it has deemed necessary to enable it to make an
informed and intelligent decision with respect to the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the acquisition of
the Subject Interests. ETP has had an opportunity to ask questions
and receive answers from Contributors regarding the terms and
conditions of the offering of the Subject Interests and the
business, properties, prospects and financial condition of the
Partnership. The foregoing, however, does not modify the
representations and warranties of Contributors in Article V
and such representations and warranties constitute the sole and
exclusive representations and warranties of Contributors to ETP in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.
 6.11     
No Other
Representations and Warranties . EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS ARTICLE VI , AND THOSE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THE OTHER TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, AS APPLICABLE, ETP MAKES NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY, AND ETP HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY SUCH
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION
AND
