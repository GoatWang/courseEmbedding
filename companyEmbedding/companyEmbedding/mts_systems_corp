Products produced by this segment are used by customers in their development of products and certain applications to characterize the products' mechanical properties. MTS' test systems simulate forces and motions that customers' products are expected to encounter in use. A test system includes a load frame to hold the prototype specimen, a hydraulic pump or electro-mechanical power source, piston actuators to create the force or motion, and a computer controller with specialized software to coordinate the actuator movement and record and manipulate results. MTS' Test segment sells a variety of accessories and spare parts, along with services that include installation, calibration, maintenance, training and consulting. The Test segment has a range of customers in the United States of America, Europe and Asia, which respectively represent approximately 30%, 30% and 40% of total orders.

The Ground Vehicles market consists of automobile, truck, motorcycle, motorsports vehicle, construction equipment, agricultural equipment, rail, and off-road vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers. Test segment system and service products are used in the Ground Vehicles market for the testing of vehicles, subsystems and components. The Materials market covers diverse industries, including power generation, aerospace, vehicles, and bio-medical. Test segment products are sold worldwide through a direct field sales and service organization as well as through independent representatives.
The Company’s products and services support customers in the research and development of products through the physical characterization of materials, such as ceramics, composites and steel. Bio-medical applications include systems to test durability and performance of implants, prostheses, and other medical and dental materials and devices.

The aerospace structural testing market consists of manufacturers of commercial, military, and private aircraft and their suppliers. The wind energy market consists of wind turbine manufacturers and their component suppliers. Structural engineering customers include government agencies, universities and the manufacturers of building materials.
Sensors Segment
The industries that use the Company’s Sensor segment’s products include manufacturers of plastic injection molding machines, steel mills, fluid power, oil and gas, medical, wood product processing equipment, mobile equipment, and alternative energy. Sensors segment products are also used to measure fluid displacement, such as liquid levels for customers in the process industries. The Sensors segment manufactures products utilizing magnetostriction technology. MTS has developed an implementation of the technology, known as Temposonics. Its Sensors segment has a range of customers in the United States of America, Europe and Asia represents approximately 25%, 50% and 25% of orders, respectively. Sensors segment products are sold worldwide through a direct sales organization, as well as through independent distributors.[2]
MTS Systems Corp. was fined $400,000 after pleading guilty on March 12, 2008 for submitting false US export license applications on proposed shipments to India. The company admitted to two misdemeanor counts of "false certification or writing" by omitting information linked to nuclear power plant test equipment.[3] In March 2011, MTS disclosed that it was again under investigation and barred from bidding on new government contracts.[4] On September 2011 the ban imposed by the Air Force was lifted, allowing MTS Systems to bid on new government contracts and to continue existing government contracts.[5] MTS Systems settled all investigations with the U.S. Government and took measures to ensure government contracting standards were met.[6] "We are happy to put the government investigation behind us. We have made great progress to ensure we meet the U.S. government's contractor standards and we are committed to meeting these requirements every day," MTS Systems CEO Jeffrey Graves said in a statement.[7]

You do one little thing, they are on you like a hawk. There is a toxic environment here. Most in upper management have no tack. The management doesn't care how they speak to you, most of it is in a toxic way. They force overtime. Even if you are sick, you get a bad mark on you even with a doctor's note. You only get 6 bad marks in a year then you get let go. There is a HIGH turnover rate in Cary due to the crazy rules and no trust in their employees with all these crazy rules. The company will NOT invest in new technology or tools.Advice to ManagementHave management take a management course so they know how to interact properly with their staff. Listen to the employees about how to improve the process, they have some good ideas that you just toss away and keep making the same mistakes over and over again. They also act like they are FAR SUPERIOR to the regular employees.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (4) MTS Systems Response seconds agoEdit • Delete MTS Systems 2017-06-29 12:21 PDT Jul 1, 2017 Helpful (1)"Really..."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous in Eden Prairie, MNCurrent Employee - Anonymous in Eden Prairie, MNDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at MTS Systems full-time (More than 8 years)ProsHard to think of any.... health coverage is average, wages are average, 401k match is average, cafeteria is okay, work is interesting.ConsWell, lets start with they let good, highly talented managers walk right out the door and then turn around and offer a higher position to a terrible manager that recently turned in notice. What are you people thinking?! The dead weight around here that should be trimmed somehow they manage to get promoted and everyone is left shaking their head in complete disbelief. They've stopped paying bonuses into our 401k plans, they have leaders that are clueless with no schooling background trying to lead the way but they can't even read the map. These clowns would have a hard time running a profitable popcorn stand at your local county fair. Stay away and if your stuck here for now like I am look for opportunities to free yourself of this life draining place they call MTS.Advice to ManagementDo us all a favor and quit. Find another company to go ruin. Learn that people work harder for a company that shows appreciation for there employees then one that constantly beats them down. Stop making people work OT when there's NO work to do. An upper manager once made the comment that we're all just monkeys with wrenches but I've never seen this person do one thing good for this company and it's truly sad.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) MTS Systems Response seconds agoEdit • Delete MTS Systems 2017-07-01 04:06 PDT May 11, 2017 Helpful (5)"MTS?"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Mechanical Designer in Eden Prairie, MNCurrent Employee - Mechanical Designer in Eden Prairie, MNDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at MTS Systems full-timeProsCheap to live here vs. pay. Getting off early or getting (non) paid days off is easy.ConsThe company has no long term vision. Its all short sighted gains to get to the next quarter. Crack down on poor folks on the manufacturing floor is very unfair. They don't sell a product you can just "buy" off the shelf.

Leadership style across departments varies dramatically. While some managers are wonderful leaders, others are in dire need of additional training. Operations is a mess. Communication cross-functionally is non existent. Most employees are severely undervalued while others are promoted and kept in their role to the detriment of the team and those they work with. Teams are not given the tools they need for success. Zero investment in additional training or continuous improvement. Overall, culture is resistant to change and very reactive.Advice to ManagementProvide leadership training to mid level management. Stop posting on Linkedin how valued employees are when actions by management and HR reflect the exact opposite. Bring in an outside consultant to help get the right people in the right spots. Take time off from the revenue and direct labor focus to actually fix issues.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) MTS Systems Response seconds agoEdit • Delete MTS Systems 2017-03-05 05:50 PST Feb 24, 2017"Unique industry with a highly talented workforce in a variey of disciplines"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chaska, MNFormer Employee - Anonymous Employee in Chaska, MNRecommendsNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOI worked at MTS Systems full-time (More than 10 years)ProsVery custom and highly technical engineering business requiring strong team work from various departments to be successful.

Frequent leadership turnover and the time for new leadership to understand the business due to its complex nature. New leadership taking similar paths that old leadership had once traveled - this can be good or bad. You may acquire a person's job when an individual departs the company and be expected to absorb the work.Advice to ManagementEmbrace the special talents required to make the business successful.

Derma Roller System | How Dermaroller Works


















How It Works



What is the Derma Roller System?The Derma Roller (also known as a skin roller or microneedle roller) is a revolutionary hand-held device which has the ability to naturally stimulate collagen and elastin in the skin to promote healthier skin cells in the body. Using 200 extremely fine medical-grade needles, the dermaroller painlessly creates microchannels in your skin which trigger the body's natural healing process to create new, healthier tissue to replace the imperfections of older skin. By renewing your skin cells regularly, you will be able to treat common problems we experience as we age such as wrinkles, skin hyperpigmentation, scars (including acne scars), uneven skin, stretch marks (usually developed after pregnancy), hair loss or it can simply be used to create smoother skin.

What can the Derma Roller System treat?The Derma Roller System (DRS) can be used by both women and men and has numerous beneficial effects including:- Anti Ageing- Anti Wrinkle- Cellulite Treatment / Cellulite Reduction or Removal- Hair Loss Treatment / Hair Restoration- Hyper Pigmentation Treatment- Scar Removal - including acne scar removal- Skin Smoothing- Stretch Mark Removal

Understanding Our SkinThe concept of skin renewal can be described simply as wound and heal. The youthful glow on a baby's skin is the result of constant skin renewal, which is the shedding of old skin cells continually being replenished by new ones. As we enter our teen years and beyond, skin renewal starts to slow. Research has shown that when people reach their 40's and 50's, skin only sheds approximately once every fifty-three days. Skin with unshed cells build up on the skin's surface, and becomes a dual culprit to our skin's dull, aging appearance.When we try to resurface the skin, we are targeting treatment within the epidermis (top layer of skin). Lotions such as collagen creams applied on your skin are only able to stay idly on top of this layer of skin because collagen molecules are too large to penetrate through the skin. When we need to remodel the skin for wrinkle treatments, scar treatments, etc., we are targeting treatment within the mid-dermis. The derma rollers' fine needles create small micro-channels in the skin leaving the epidermal barrier fully intact, treating only areas in the mid-dermis. Using the Derma Roller System with a nourishing lotion, allows the large collagen molecules to penetrate through the top layer of the epidermis through the micro-channels and repair the skin from the inside out without damaging the surface of the skin. This eliminates the risks and negative side effects on the skin commonly encountered with chemical peeling, dermabrasion and laser resurfacing.Also See Why Collagen Creams Don't Work.

How does the Derma Roller Work?In order for our skin to have a smooth and healthy glow, it must continually be replenished with new cells. The Derma Roller System renews your skin cells from the inside out by using Collagen Induction Therapy (C.I.T.). This is a process where the derma rollers' 200 fine medical-grade needles are rolled over your skin to cause pores in your skin to open temporarily. While your pores are opened, it triggers your body's natural healing process to heal the pores thereby stimulating collagen and elastin production. The production of collagen and elastin helps to thicken the skin, smooth away fine lines and wrinkles and rid the skin of hyperpigmentations. When the derma roller is applied simualtaneously with the application of nourishing creams, your skins absorption of vitamins,  enzymes, lipids and other nourishing ingredients are greatly enhanced. In approximately one to two hours after the application of the derma roller, these micro-channels fully close through the body's natural healing process, providing just enough time for new collagen structures to form within the skin's lower layers, but short enough recovery time to ensure the resumption of your normal schedule. By continuously triggering the body's natural healing process this way, your skin constantly stimulates collagen and elastin production needed to help restore and remodel your skin on a cosmetic level.Also see the Advantages of using the Derma Roller System.

Results are Quick & Simple.The speed at which you will see results depends on the condition you are treating, the needle length used and how extensively your body needs to remodel the affected area. Skin renews itself every 40 days, which is why your treatment should be carried out for at least a three-month period. Results are dramatic and fast. You will be able to notice smoother, clearer skin within the first 2-3 weeks, and your skin should heal completely after several months of using the Derma Roller System. It is recommended to take before/after pictures to help you notice improvements in your skin from one week to another because it can be difficult to spot daily changes.

Did You Know?Only minor fractions (at most 0.3%) of the active substances in your favorite creams, gels or lotions can actually penetrate the surface of your skin. The majority of these substances (the other 99.7%) is wasted on your towel, pillow, shower, etc. The active ingredients in these substances do not penetrate deeply enough to be very effective because your skin protects your body from the external environment. However, research has shown that when lotions are used with the Derma Roller System, the effectiveness of these substances are enhanced by up to 40 times!



Did You Know?Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were featured on the August 2009 issue of Marieclaire.co.uk to have used the same microneedling technique to give their skin a smooth and youthful glow. Now, with the Derma Roller System, you can achieve similar results as top Hollywood clinics all in the comfort of your own home for a fraction of the price![Source]

Treatments



Cellulite Treatment / Cellulite Reduction or RemovalCellulite removal/reduction can be accomplished with regular treatment using the Derma Roller System. The Derma Roller System can be used to remove/reduce cellulite commonly found on arms, buttocks, hips, legs, thighs and stomach.

Hair Loss Treatment / Hair Restoration (used with Minoxidil 5%)The Derma Roller System can be used to effectively prevent and stop hair loss from occuring. The Derma Roller System can help with hair restoration and regrowth by both men and women who are experiencing alociepia, balding, bald spots, receding hairlines and thinning hair. A recent trial conducted over a 3 month period showed that men with thinning hair who used the Derma Roller System experienced both an increase in hair growth and an average of 80% reduction in hair loss.Note: For hair regrowth and hair loss prevention, the Derma Roller must be used with Minoxidil 5% (available at your local pharmacy).

Scar Removal - including acne scar removalThe Derma Roller System is effective in acne scar removal and acne scar treatment, as well as treating appdectomy scars, breast augmentation scars, burn scars, C-section scarring, chicken pox scars, ice pick scars, large pores, pitting of the skin,  surgical scars, tummy tuck scars and more.

Skin SmoothingThe Derma Roller System is an effective way to smoothen your skin. By stimulating collagen and elastin and repairing your skin from the inside, your skin will stay beautiful even as you get older. The Derma Roller System is even more effective in preventing any wrinkles, scars, etc. from ever happening in the first place. Simply use the Derma Roller System regularly, and your skin will stay healthy and smooth many years to come.

Stretch Mark Removal / TreatmentThe Derma Roller System can be used to remove stretch marks such as those developed during pregnancy, adolescent growth spurts, rapid muscle growth, rapid muscle growth spurts and weight loss/gain. The Derma Roller System removes stretch marks by stimulating the production of new collagen fibres and elastin in the skin. Producing more collagen and elastin in the skin fills in stretch marks as the skin thickens, tightens and elasticity is restored.

Anti Wrinkle / Anti Aging TreatmentThe Derma Roller System can be used to treat creases in the skin of the forehead (scowl lines), deep wrinkles, fine wrinkles, skin creases and lines, wrinkles around the mouth, on the neck and jaw line, the decolletes (chest), on the backs of the hands and more.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Test segment system and service products are used in the Ground Vehicles market for the testing of vehicles, subsystems and components. The Materials market covers diverse industries, including power generation, aerospace, vehicles, and bio-medical. Test segment products are sold worldwide through a direct field sales and service organization as well as through independent representatives.
The Company’s products and services support customers in the research and development of products through the physical characterization of materials, such as ceramics, composites and steel. Bio-medical applications include systems to test durability and performance of implants, prostheses, and other medical and dental materials and devices. Structures market serves the structural testing needs in the fields of aerospace, wind energy, structural engineering, and petroleum, among others. The aerospace structural testing market consists of manufacturers of commercial, military, and private aircraft and their suppliers. The wind energy market consists of wind turbine manufacturers and their component suppliers. Structural engineering customers include government agencies, universities and the manufacturers of building materials.
Sensors Segment
The industries that use the Company’s Sensor segment’s products include manufacturers of plastic injection molding machines, steel mills, fluid power, oil and gas, medical, wood product processing equipment, mobile equipment, and alternative energy. Sensors segment products are also used to measure fluid displacement, such as liquid levels for customers in the process industries. The Sensors segment manufactures products utilizing magnetostriction technology. MTS has developed an implementation of the technology, known as Temposonics. Its Sensors segment has a range of customers in the United States of America, Europe and Asia represents approximately 25%, 50% and 25% of orders, respectively. Sensors segment products are sold worldwide through a direct sales organization, as well as through independent distributors.[2]
MTS Systems Corp. was fined $400,000 after pleading guilty on March 12, 2008 for submitting false US export license applications on proposed shipments to India. The company admitted to two misdemeanor counts of "false certification or writing" by omitting information linked to nuclear power plant test equipment.[3] In March 2011, MTS disclosed that it was again under investigation and barred from bidding on new government contracts.[4] On September 2011 the ban imposed by the Air Force was lifted, allowing MTS Systems to bid on new government contracts and to continue existing government contracts.[5] MTS Systems settled all investigations with the U.S. Government and took measures to ensure government contracting standards were met.[6] "We are happy to put the government investigation behind us. We have made great progress to ensure we meet the U.S. government's contractor standards and we are committed to meeting these requirements every day," MTS Systems CEO Jeffrey Graves said in a statement.[7]

MTS Systems Corporation (MTS), incorporated in 1967, is a global supplier of test systems and industrial position sensors located in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, a southwest suburb of Minneapolis. The company provides mechanical test systems, material testing, fatigue testing and tensile testing services, as well as motion simulation systems and calibration services. Examples of MTS products include: hydraulic actuators,rolling road simulators, shaker tables and medical testing equipment.
The Company operates in two segments: the Test segment and the Sensors segment. During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2011(fiscal 2011), the Test and Sensors segments represented approximately 80% and 20% of the company's revenue, respectively. The Test segment provides testing solutions, including hardware, software and after market support. The Sensors segment products are used by industrial machinery and mobile equipment manufacturers to automate the operation of their products.
Test Segment
Products produced by this segment are used by customers in their development of products and certain applications to characterize the products' mechanical properties. MTS' test systems simulate forces and motions that customers' products are expected to encounter in use. A test system includes a load frame to hold the prototype specimen, a hydraulic pump or electro-mechanical power source, piston actuators to create the force or motion, and a computer controller with specialized software to coordinate the actuator movement and record and manipulate results. MTS' Test segment sells a variety of accessories and spare parts, along with services that include installation, calibration, maintenance, training and consulting. The Test segment has a range of customers in the United States of America, Europe and Asia, which respectively represent approximately 30%, 30% and 40% of total orders.
Products and customers are grouped into three global markets: Ground Vehicles, Materials and Structures. The Ground Vehicles market consists of automobile, truck, motorcycle, motorsports vehicle, construction equipment, agricultural equipment, rail, and off-road vehicle manufacturers and their suppliers. Test segment system and service products are used in the Ground Vehicles market for the testing of vehicles, subsystems and components. The Materials market covers diverse industries, including power generation, aerospace, vehicles, and bio-medical. Test segment products are sold worldwide through a direct field sales and service organization as well as through independent representatives.
The Company’s products and services support customers in the research and development of products through the physical characterization of materials, such as ceramics, composites and steel. Bio-medical applications include systems to test durability and performance of implants, prostheses, and other medical and dental materials and devices. Structures market serves the structural testing needs in the fields of aerospace, wind energy, structural engineering, and petroleum, among others. The aerospace structural testing market consists of manufacturers of commercial, military, and private aircraft and their suppliers. The wind energy market consists of wind turbine manufacturers and their component suppliers. Structural engineering customers include government agencies, universities and the manufacturers of building materials.
Sensors Segment
The industries that use the Company’s Sensor segment’s products include manufacturers of plastic injection molding machines, steel mills, fluid power, oil and gas, medical, wood product processing equipment, mobile equipment, and alternative energy. Sensors segment products are also used to measure fluid displacement, such as liquid levels for customers in the process industries. The Sensors segment manufactures products utilizing magnetostriction technology. MTS has developed an implementation of the technology, known as Temposonics. Its Sensors segment has a range of customers in the United States of America, Europe and Asia represents approximately 25%, 50% and 25% of orders, respectively. Sensors segment products are sold worldwide through a direct sales organization, as well as through independent distributors.[2]
MTS Systems Corp. was fined $400,000 after pleading guilty on March 12, 2008 for submitting false US export license applications on proposed shipments to India. The company admitted to two misdemeanor counts of "false certification or writing" by omitting information linked to nuclear power plant test equipment.[3] In March 2011, MTS disclosed that it was again under investigation and barred from bidding on new government contracts.[4] On September 2011 the ban imposed by the Air Force was lifted, allowing MTS Systems to bid on new government contracts and to continue existing government contracts.[5] MTS Systems settled all investigations with the U.S. Government and took measures to ensure government contracting standards were met.[6] "We are happy to put the government investigation behind us.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
