Norman Bobins - tribunedigital-chicagotribune




 



CAREER PATHNorman BobinsWorking in family firm gave banker early basis in realityNorman Bobins' father told him to get finance experience in a bankJune 19, 2006|By Interview by Ann Therese Palmer, special to the TribuneAs a college student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Norman Bobins didn't give much thought to what he would do after graduation.That's because in 1933 his paternal grandfather had founded a Chicago-based manufacturer of men's belts, tie bars and tie clips. Bobins' dad and uncle worked there. Bobins expected he would, too, after graduation.FOR THE RECORD - This story contains corrected material, published June 20, 2006."From the time I was 14 I worked there every summer doing a variety of jobs," says the Chicago native, raised in Hyde Park."I worked in plating, on the punch press, customer service, product development."As planned, the newly married Bobins joined the firm, while his wife, Virginia, finished her undergraduate degree. Bobins also enrolled in the University of Chicago's MBA evening program. After Virginia graduated he switched to the full-time program."When I was about to graduate and rejoin the family business my dad and uncle, who'd become 50-50 partners, had another idea," Bobins relates. "They suggested I get a job with a bank for the financial experience. ... I thought a couple of years in a bank would be fun."So Bobins joined American National Bank. As a trainee, making "$10,000 a year--big money," his job for the next 18 months was "gofer" for bank Chairman Allan Stolz. "I'd get in every morning before he did, get him organized, make sure everything was planned, run his errands, even make sure everything was set for his dinner parties."Much of what Bobins learned in that job he is using today, but on the other side of the desk.Bobins, 63, was named head of LaSalle Bank in 1991, president and CEO of LaSalle Bank Corp. in 2002, and CEO of ABN Amro North America in 2006. ABN Amro, the Dutch financial-services firm, acquired LaSalle Bank in 1979. (This paragraph as published has been corrected in this text.)Q. At what point in your working life did what you're doing now become your goal?A. When I left American National in 1980, and even when I went to Exchange Bank, I assumed I'd gone as far as I was going to go. It was only when I became president of LaSalle, I realized I had a shot to be president of its holding company.It wasn't a done deal by a long shot. When you get too complacent, you're sure to be disappointed.Q. Were any classes particularly helpful to your career?A. When I was an undergrad my dad suggested I take some business courses. I was terrible, particularly in accounting 101. I never got past the debits on the left, credits on the right. I was a bachelor, living on an allowance, having a lot of fun. I wasn't a great studier.In 1966 things were different when I started business school at the University of Chicago. I was married, about to become a father. I had to become serious.Q. What did you do differently?A. My first six months at Chicago were really tough. It was a very quantitative school. As a history major I wasn't accustomed to that.I spent hours and hours in the library. I also met two very bright students with whom I studied. Jim Nicholson is now chairman of our bank in Michigan. Les Bortz also became a banker, but then did something I didn't do. He took over his family's business.Q. Why didn't you want to return?A. I was having so much fun with banking. I kept asking my dad and uncle to give me a few more years. A family business can be cloistered. You're not in the mainstream of events. You see the same people daily.When I was 40 my dad got tired of waiting for me. He gave me one last chance and said he'd sell the company if I didn't return. I thanked him, but said I was doing well and liked what I was doing.Q. What previous job best prepared you for this one?A. Working in a family business that did manufacturing was the best preparation. When I got into banking I could relate to customers. I'd had experiences similar to what they were going through.Too often bankers are finance majors, guys who are afraid to get their hands dirty. They've never had to get a shipment out on time or have a delivery truck break down on the way to a major client.Q. How did your personal life fare while you moved up the ladder?A. I met Virginia during our junior year in high school in Oconomowoc, Wis. There were 110 students in our class.We sat alphabetically. There was no one between Bobins and Gallagher, her last name. We went on to Madison and married a week after I graduated. We've got one son, Robert, a teacher.She's been my bulwark. To get ahead, you don't work 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. You work 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., sometimes 7 a.m. to 9 p.m.She's supported me, backed me and understood when there were times I couldn't be home.- - -Step by step2006-present: Chief executive of ABM Amro North America2002-present: President and chief executive, LaSalle Bank Corp.1991-present: Chairman, president and chief executive, LaSalle Bank1990-91: Vice chairman, LaSalle Bank1983-90: Vice chairman and president, Exchange National Bank, Chicago1981-83: Executive vice president, Exchange National Bank1979-81: Senior vice president, American National Bank, Chicago1976-79: Vice president, American National Bank1973-76: Assistant vice president, American National Bank1971-73: Officer, American National Bank1969-71: Assistant cashier, American National Bank1968-69: Assistant to Chairman, American National Bank1967-68: Trainee, American National Bank1967: MBA, University of Chicago1964-66: Customer service representative, Robert Bobins & Co., Chicago1964: Bachelor's degree in history, University of Wisconsin1958-64: Summer employee, Robert Bobins & Co.

	Norman Bobins | The University of Chicago Booth School of Business








































Norman R. Bobins earned his MBA from Chicago Booth in 1967 and joined American National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago.
During his tenure, Bobins structured a $10 million loan for a potential buyer of troubled rival Exchange National Bank. In 1981, Exchange convinced Bobins to join the bank as senior executive vice president. By employing Bobins's strategies, Exchange grew from a $500 million bank in 1981 into a $3.2 billion Chicago giant by 1989.
In 1990, Netherlands-based giant ABN AMRO Bank purchased Exchange, merged it with ABN AMRO subsidiary LaSalle Bank in 1990, and named Bobins chairman of the merged bank in 1992. By 2003, he was chairman, president, and CEO of LaSalle Bank and president and CEO of LaSalle Bank Corporation (North American subsidiary of ABN AMRO Bank N.V.).  Bobins led the bank through the largest uninterrupted period of growth in its 75-year history.
