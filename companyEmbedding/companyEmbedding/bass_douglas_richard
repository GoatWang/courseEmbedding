A Hero’s Return was written for the West Point Middle School Band, located at the United States Military Academy, West Point, NY. The opening section conveys the celebratory atmosphere of when a hero comes home to friends and family. The middle section represents the quiet tribute we pay to the fond memories of heroes no longer in our midst. The return to the initial theme welcomes not only the hero returning today, but symbolizes the hopes for the safe return of all our heroes who so bravely serve this nation. (4:10)
