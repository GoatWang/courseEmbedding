	Item 1.01






	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.








	 




	On January 26, 2017, Alliqua BioMedical, Inc.
	(the “

	Company

	”), AquaMed Technologies, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the “

	Guarantor

	”),
	and Perceptive Credit Holdings, L.P. (“

	Perceptive

	”) entered into a Forbearance and Amendment Agreement (the
	“

	Amendment Agreement

	”), pursuant to which the parties agreed to certain amendments and modifications to the
	terms of the Credit Agreement and Guaranty, dated May 29, 2015, by and among the Company, the Guarantor and Perceptive (the “

	Credit
	Agreement

	”). The Amendment Agreement provides for, among other things, an extension to the currently effective forbearance
	period in respect of the Company’s default of a covenant pertaining to trailing twelve-month revenue under the Credit Agreement
	as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 (the “

	Specified Defaults

	”). Under the Amendment Agreement,
	Perceptive has agreed to forbear from exercising any rights and remedies related to the Specified Defaults until the earlier of
	(i) March 31, 2017, (ii) the date when Perceptive becomes aware that any other default (other than the Specified Defaults) has
	occurred and is continuing and (iii) the date on which Perceptive becomes aware that the previously announced Contribution Agreement
	and Plan of Merger, dated October 5, 2016 (the “

	Contribution and Merger Agreement

	”), by and among the Company,
	Alliqua Holdings, Inc. (“

	Parent

	”), Chesapeake Merger Corp. and Soluble Systems, LLC (“

	Soluble

	”)
	has been terminated and the transactions contemplated thereby (the “

	Transactions

	”) will not be consummated (such
	earlier date, the “

	Termination Date

	”). Perceptive reserved the right, commencing on the Termination Date, to
	pursue any rights and remedies available to it under the Credit Agreement with respect to either or both of the Specified Defaults.


	 


	In addition, the Amendment Agreement grants
	a one-time waiver of certain restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement in order to allow the Company to lend $350,000 to
	Soluble in order to extend the outside date of the Contribution and Merger Agreement to February 28, 2017. The Amendment Agreement
	also requires the Company to certify its compliance with certain existing covenants under the Credit Agreement that require the
	Company and its subsidiaries to maintain a weekly minimum balance of $2,000,000 in unrestricted, unencumbered cash on a weekly
	basis.


	 


	In connection with the entry into the Amendment
	Agreement, the Company and Perceptive also entered into an amendment and restatement of the warrant issued to Perceptive in connection
	with the closing of the Credit Agreement on May 29, 2015. The amended and restated warrant (the “

	Amended Warrant

	”)
	is exercisable for 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “

	Common Stock

	”)
	at an exercise price of $0.5832 (the “

	Exercise Price

	”); provided, that (i) if the Transactions occur on or before
	March 31, 2017, the Exercise Price will be automatically adjusted to an amount per share equal to the per share value of the Common
	Stock (or equivalent) of the Company or Parent immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the Transactions, and (ii)
	in the event the Transactions do not occur on or before March 31, 2017 but an eligible equity financing for gross proceeds of at
	least $2 million occurs on or before such date, the Exercise Price will automatically adjust to be an amount per share equal to
	the per share value of the Common Stock (or equivalent) issued to non-affiliates pursuant to such eligible equity financing.


	 


	The foregoing descriptions of the Amendment
	Agreement and the Amended Warrant do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text
	of the Amendment Agreement and the Amended Warrant, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively,
	and incorporated herein by reference.

	The Amended Warrant offered and issued to Perceptive was not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	Act

	”), or the securities laws of any state, and was issued in reliance on the exemption from registration under the Securities
	Act provided by Section 4(a)(2) and Regulation D (Rule 506) under the Securities Act. Perceptive represented that it was an accredited
	investor (as defined by Rule 501 under the Securities Act).

	Defaults, pursue any rights and remedies available to it under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or pursuant to
	law or otherwise, with respect to any Defaults that have then occurred and are outstanding (including the Specified Defaults),
	including, but not limited to, declaring all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount of the Loan and other Obligations
	to be immediately due and payable, imposing a default rate of interest in respect of the Obligations in accordance with Section
	3.6 of the Credit Agreement, or pursuing any or all other rights and remedies of the Lender as a secured party under the UCC, the
	Pledge and Security Agreement or any other Loan Document.

	to the Company of the Aggregate Exercise Price in accordance with

	Section 3(b)

	.


	 


	(b)          

	Payment
	of the Aggregate Exercise Price

	. Payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price shall be made, at the option of the Holder as expressed
	in the Exercise Agreement, by the following methods:


	 


	(i)          by
	delivery to the Company of a certified or official bank check payable to the order of the Company or by wire transfer of immediately
	available funds to an account designated in writing by the Company, in either case in the amount of such Aggregate Exercise Price
	(collectively, a “

	Cash Payment

	”);


	 






	 



	6



	 







	 




	 


	(ii)         by
	instructing the Company to withhold a number of Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with an aggregate Fair
	Market Value as of the Exercise Date equal to such Aggregate Exercise Price; or


	 


	(iii)        any
	combination of the foregoing;


	 



	provided

	that, any term or provision
	of this

	Section (b)

	to the contrary notwithstanding, with respect to any exercise of this Warrant, not less than one-half
	(1/2) of the Aggregate Exercise Price payable as a result of such exercise shall be in the form of a Cash Payment. In the event
	of any withholding of Warrant Shares pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) above where the number of shares whose value is equal to
	the Aggregate Exercise Price is not a whole number, the number of shares withheld by the Company shall be rounded up to the nearest
	whole share and the Company shall make a cash payment to the Holder (by delivery of a certified or official bank check or by wire
	transfer of immediately available funds) based on the incremental fraction of a share being so withheld by the Company in an amount
	equal to the product of (x) such incremental fraction of a share being so withheld multiplied by (y) the Fair Market Value per
	Warrant Share as of the Exercise Date.


	 


	(c)          

	Delivery
	of Stock Certificates

	. Upon receipt by the Company of the Exercise Agreement and payment of the Aggregate Exercise Price (in
	accordance with

	Section 3(a)

	hereof), the Company shall, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within five (5) Business
	Days thereafter, execute (or cause to be executed) and deliver (or cause to be delivered) to the Holder a certificate or certificates
	representing the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, together with cash in lieu of any fraction of a share, as provided
	in

	Section 3(d)

	hereof. The stock certificate or certificates so delivered shall be, to the extent possible, in such denomination
	or denominations as the exercising Holder shall reasonably request in the Exercise Agreement and shall be registered in the name
	of the Holder or, subject to compliance with

	Section 7

	below, such other Person’s name as shall be designated in the
	Exercise Agreement. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised and such certificate or certificates of Warrant Shares
	shall be deemed to have been issued, and the Holder or any other Person so designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have
	become a holder of record of such Warrant Shares for all purposes, as of the Exercise Date.


	 


	(d)          

	Fractional
	Shares

	. The Company shall not be required to issue a fractional Warrant Share upon exercise of any Warrant. As to any fraction
	of a Warrant Share that the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall pay to such Holder
	an amount in cash (by delivery of a certified or official bank check or by wire transfer of immediately available funds) equal
	to the product of (i) such fraction multiplied by (ii) the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock on the Exercise Date
	as reported by Bloomberg L.P.

	(e)          

	Surrender
	of this Warrant

	. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
	this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has been
	exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Business
	Days of the date the final Exercise Agreement is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases
	of a portion of the total number of Warrant Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number
	of Warrant Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Shares purchased. The Holder and
	the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Holder and
	any assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following
	the purchase of a portion of the Warrant Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Shares available for purchase hereunder at any
	given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.


	 


	(f)          

	Valid
	Issuance of Warrant and Warrant Shares; Payment of Taxes

	. With respect to the exercise of this Warrant, the Company hereby
	represents, covenants and agrees:


	 


	(i)          This
	Warrant is, and any Warrant issued in substitution for or replacement of this Warrant shall be, upon issuance, duly authorized
	and validly issued.


	 


	(ii)         All
	Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant pursuant to the terms hereof shall be, upon issuance, and the Company
	shall take all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order that such Warrant Shares are, validly issued, fully paid
	and non-assessable, issued without violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any stockholder of the Company and free and
	clear of all taxes, liens and charges.


	 


	(iii)        The
	Company shall take all such actions as may be necessary to ensure that all such Warrant Shares are issued without violation by
	the Company of any applicable law or governmental regulation or any requirements of any domestic securities exchange upon which
	shares of Common Stock or other securities constituting Warrant Shares may be listed at the time of such exercise (except for official
	notice of issuance which shall be immediately delivered by the Company upon each such issuance).


	 


	(iv)        The
	Company shall cause the Warrant Shares, immediately upon such exercise, to be listed on any domestic securities exchange upon which
	shares of Common Stock or other securities constituting Warrant Shares are listed at the time of such exercise.


	 


	(v)         The
	Company shall pay all expenses in connection with, and all taxes and other governmental charges that may be imposed with respect
	to, the issuance or delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.

	(g)          

	Conditional
	Exercise

	. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if an exercise of any portion of this Warrant is to be made in connection
	with a public offering or a sale of the Company (pursuant to a merger, sale of stock, or otherwise), such exercise may at the election
	of the Holder be conditioned upon the consummation of such transaction, in which case such exercise shall not be deemed to be effective
	until immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction.


	 


	(h)          

	Reservation
	of Shares

	. During the Exercise Period, the Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but
	unissued Common Stock or other securities constituting Warrant Shares, solely for the purpose of issuance upon the exercise of
	this Warrant, the maximum number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant, and the par value per Warrant Share
	shall at all times be less than or equal to the applicable Exercise Price. The Company shall not increase the par value of any
	Warrant Shares receivable upon the exercise of this Warrant above the Exercise Price then in effect, and shall take all such actions
	as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable shares
	of Common Stock upon the exercise of this Warrant.


	 


	Section
	4.           

	Adjustment to Exercise Price and Number of Warrant
	Shares

	. In order to prevent dilution of the purchase rights granted under this Warrant, the Exercise Price and the number
	of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in this

	Section
	4

	.


	 


	(a)          

	Adjustment
	to Exercise Price Upon Issuance of Common Stock

	. Except as provided in

	Section 4(b)

	and except in the case of an event
	described in either

	Section 4(d)

	or

	Section 4(e)

	, if the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after the
	Issue Date, issue or sell, or in accordance with

	Section 4(d)

	is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock
	without consideration or for consideration per share less than the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such issuance
	or sale (or deemed issuance or sale), then immediately upon such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale), the Exercise Price
	in effect immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) shall be reduced (and in no event increased)
	to an Exercise Price equal to the quotient obtained by dividing:


	 


	(i)          the
	sum of (A) the product obtained by multiplying the Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or
	deemed issuance or sale) by the Exercise Price then in effect plus (B) the aggregate consideration, if any, received (or to be
	received) by the Company upon such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale); by


	 


	(ii)         the
	sum of (A) the Common Stock Deemed Outstanding immediately prior to such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale) plus (B)
	the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued or sold (or to be issued or sold or deemed issued or sold) by the Company
	in such issuance or sale (or deemed issuance or sale).

	(b)          

	Exceptions
	To Adjustment Upon Issuance of Common Stock

	. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall be no adjustment
	to the Exercise Price or the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to any Excluded Issuance.


	 


	(c)          

	Effect
	of Certain Events on Adjustment to Exercise Price

	. For purposes of determining the adjusted Exercise Price under

	Section
	4(a)

	hereof, the following shall be applicable:


	 


	(i)          

	Issuance
	of Options

	. If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after the Issue Date, in any manner grant or sell (whether
	directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any Options, whether or not such Options or the right to convert or exchange
	any Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options are immediately exercisable, and the price per share (determined
	as provided in this paragraph and in

	Section 4(c)(v)

	) for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options
	or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Exercise
	Price in effect immediately prior to the time of the granting or sale of such Options, then the total maximum number of shares
	of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount of Convertible
	Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of granting or sale of
	such Options (and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of adjusting the Exercise Price under

	Section 4(a))

	,
	at a price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum (which sum shall constitute the applicable consideration
	received for purposes of

	Section 4(a))

	of (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration
	for the granting or sale of all such Options, plus (y) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable
	to the Company upon the exercise of all such Options, plus (z), in the case of such Options which relate to Convertible Securities,
	the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Company upon the issuance or sale of all such
	Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities, by (B) the total maximum number of shares
	of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of all Convertible Securities
	issuable upon the exercise of all such Options. Except as otherwise provided in

	Section 4(c)(iii)

	, no further adjustment
	of the Exercise Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of Common Stock or of Convertible Securities upon exercise of such
	Options or upon the actual issuance of Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise
	of such Options.


	 






	 



	10



	 







	 




	 


	(ii)         

	Issuance
	of Convertible Securities

	. If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after the Issue Date, in any manner grant
	or sell (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) any Convertible Securities, whether or not the right to convert
	or exchange any such Convertible Securities is immediately exercisable, and the price per share (determined as provided in this
	paragraph and in

	Section 4(c)(v)

	) for which Common Stock is issuable upon the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
	Securities is less than the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to the time of the granting or sale of such Convertible
	Securities, then the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exchange of the total maximum amount
	of such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of granting or sale of such Convertible Securities
	(and thereafter shall be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of adjusting the Exercise Price pursuant to

	Section 4(a))

	,
	at a price per share equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the sum (which sum shall constitute the applicable consideration
	received for purposes of

	Section 4(a))

	of (x) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Company as consideration
	for the granting or sale of such Convertible Securities, plus (y) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if
	any, payable to the Company upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities, by (B) the total maximum number
	of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. Except as otherwise provided
	in

	Section 4(c)(iii)

	, (A) no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of Common Stock
	upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities and (B) no further adjustment of the Exercise Price shall be made by
	reason of the issue or sale of Convertible Securities upon exercise of any Options to purchase any such Convertible Securities
	for which adjustments of the Exercise Price have been made pursuant to the other provisions of this

	Section 4(c)

	.


	 


	(iii)        

	Change
	in Terms of Options or Convertible Securities

	. Upon any change in any of (A) the total amount received or receivable by the
	Company as consideration for the granting or sale of any Options or Convertible Securities referred to in

	Section 4(c)(i)

	or

	Section 4(c)(ii)

	hereof, (B) the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Company
	upon the exercise of any Options or upon the issuance, conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities referred to in

	Section
	4(c)(i)

	or

	Section 4(c)(ii)

	hereof, (C) the rate at which Convertible Securities referred to in

	Section 4(c)(i)

	or

	Section 4(c)(ii)

	hereof are convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or (D) the maximum number of shares of
	Common Stock issuable in connection with any Options referred to in

	Section 4(c)(i)

	hereof or any Convertible Securities
	referred to in

	Section 4(c)(ii)

	hereof (in each case, other than in connection with an Excluded Issuance), then (whether
	or not the original issuance or sale of such Options or Convertible Securities resulted in an adjustment to the Exercise Price
	pursuant to this

	Section 4

	) the Exercise Price in effect at the time of such change shall be adjusted or readjusted, as
	applicable, to the Exercise Price which would have been in effect at such time pursuant to the provisions of this

	Section 4

	had such Options or Convertible Securities still outstanding provided for such changed consideration, conversion rate or maximum
	number of shares, as the case may be, at the time initially granted, issued or sold, but only if as a result of such adjustment
	or readjustment the Exercise Price then in effect is reduced.


	 


	(iv)        

	Treatment
	of Expired or Terminated Options or Convertible Securities

	. Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option (or
	portion thereof) or any unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof) for which any adjustment (either upon
	its original issuance or upon a revision of its terms) was made pursuant to this

	Section 4

	(including without limitation
	upon the redemption or purchase for consideration of all or any portion of such Option or Convertible Security by the Company),
	the Exercise Price then in effect hereunder shall forthwith be changed pursuant to the provisions of this

	Section 4

	to the
	Exercise Price which would have been in effect at the time of such expiration or termination had such unexercised Option (or portion
	thereof) or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Security (or portion thereof), to the extent outstanding immediately prior to
	such expiration or termination, never been issued.

	(v)         

	Calculation
	of Consideration Received

	. If the Company shall, at any time or from time to time after the Issue Date, issue or sell, or is
	deemed to have issued or sold in accordance with

	Section 4(d)

	, any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities:
	(A) for cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the net amount received by the Company therefor; (B) marketable
	securities, the amount of consideration shall be the Fair Market Value of such securities; (C) for consideration other than cash
	or marketable securities, the amount of the consideration other than cash or marketable securities received by the Company shall
	be the fair value of such consideration; (D) for no specifically allocated consideration in connection with an issuance or sale
	of other securities of the Company, together comprising one integrated transaction, the amount of the consideration therefor shall
	be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the aggregate consideration received by the Company in such transaction as is
	attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be, issued in such transaction;
	or (E) to the owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving corporation,
	the amount of consideration therefor shall be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the
	non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be,
	issued to such owners. For purposes of this

	clause (v)

	, the net amount of any cash consideration and the fair value of any
	consideration other than cash or marketable securities shall be determined in good faith jointly by the Board and the Holder.


	 


	(vi)        

	Record
	Date

	. For purposes of any adjustment to the Exercise Price or the number of Warrant Shares in accordance with this

	Section
	4

	, in case the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive
	a dividend or other distribution payable in Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase
	Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date shall be deemed to be the date of the issue or sale of the
	shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
	or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase, as the case may be.


	 


	(vii)       

	Treasury
	Shares

	. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or for
	the account of the Company or any of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the disposition of any such shares (other than the cancellation
	or retirement thereof or the transfer of such shares among the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries) shall be considered an
	issue or sale of Common Stock for the purpose of this

	Section 4

	.

	(viii)      

	Other
	Dividends and Distributions

	. Subject to the provisions of this

	Section 4(c)

	, if the Company shall, at any time or from
	time to time after the Issue Date, make or declare, or fix a record date for the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled
	to receive, a dividend or any other distribution payable in cash, securities of the Company (other than a dividend or distribution
	of shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities in respect of outstanding shares of Common Stock), or other property,
	then, and in each such event, provision shall be made so that the Holder shall receive upon exercise of the Warrant, in addition
	to the number of Warrant Shares receivable thereupon, the kind and amount of cash, securities of the Company, or other property
	which the Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Warrant been exercised in full into Warrant Shares on the date of
	such event and had the Holder thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including the Exercise Date, retained
	such cash, securities or other property receivable by them as aforesaid during such period, giving application to all adjustments
	called for during such period under this

	Section 4

	with respect to the rights of the Holder;

	provided

	, that no such
	provision shall be made if (i) the Holder receives, simultaneously with the distribution to the holders of Common Stock, a dividend
	or other distribution of such securities, cash or other property in an amount equal to the amount of such cash, securities or other
	property as the Holder would have received if the Warrant had been exercised in full into Warrant Shares on the date of such event
	or (ii) an adjustment is made to this Warrant pursuant to

	Section 4(d)

	.


	 


	(d)          

	Adjustment
	to Exercise Price and Warrant Shares Upon Dividend, Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock

	. If the Company shall, at any
	time or from time to time after the Issue Date, (i) pay a dividend or make any other distribution upon the Common Stock or any
	other capital stock of the Company payable in shares of Common Stock or in Options or Convertible Securities, or (ii) subdivide
	(by any stock split, recapitalization or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, the
	Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to any such dividend, distribution or subdivision shall be proportionately reduced and
	the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately increased. If the Company at any time
	combines (by combination, reverse stock split or otherwise) its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
	the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased and the number of Warrant
	Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately decreased. Any adjustment under this

	Section 4(d)

	shall become effective at the close of business on the date the dividend, subdivision or combination becomes effective.

	(e)          

	Adjustment
	to Exercise Price and Warrant Shares Upon Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation or Merger

	. In the event of any (i)
	capital reorganization of the Company, (ii) reclassification of the stock of the Company (other than a change in par value or from
	par value to no par value or from no par value to par value or as a result of a stock dividend or subdivision, split-up or combination
	of shares), (iii) consolidation, merger or similar transaction of the Company with or into one or more other Persons, (iv) sale
	of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to one or more other Persons or (v) other similar transaction (other
	than any such transaction covered by

	Section 4(d))

	, in each case which entitles the holders of Common Stock to receive (either
	directly or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock, each Warrant
	shall, immediately after such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction, remain outstanding
	and shall thereafter, in lieu of or in addition to (as the case may be) the number of Warrant Shares then exercisable under this
	Warrant, be exercisable for the kind and number of shares of stock or other securities or assets of the Company or of each successor
	Person resulting from such transaction to which the Holder would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification,
	consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction if the Holder had exercised this Warrant in full immediately prior to the time
	of such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction and acquired the applicable number
	of Warrant Shares then issuable hereunder as a result of such exercise (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions
	on the exercisability of this Warrant); and, in such case, appropriate adjustment (in form and substance satisfactory to the Holder)
	shall be made with respect to the Holder’s rights under this Warrant to insure that the provisions of this

	Section 4

	hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as possible, to this Warrant in relation to any shares of stock, securities or
	assets thereafter acquirable upon exercise of this Warrant (including, in the case of any consolidation, merger, sale or similar
	transaction in which the successor or purchasing Person is other than the Company, an immediate adjustment in the Exercise Price
	to the value per share for the Common Stock reflected by the terms of such consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction,
	if the value so reflected is less than the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such consolidation, merger, sale or similar
	transaction). The provisions of this

	Section 4(e)

	shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations, reclassifications,
	consolidations, mergers, sales or similar transactions. The Company shall not effect any such reorganization, reclassification,
	consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction unless, prior to the consummation thereof, the successor Person (if other than
	the Company) resulting from such reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale or similar transaction, shall assume,
	by written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Warrant and satisfactory to the Holder, the obligation
	to deliver to the Holder such shares of stock, securities or assets which, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such Holder
	shall be entitled to receive upon exercise of this Warrant. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, with respect
	to any corporate event or other transaction contemplated by the provisions of this

	Section 4(e)

	, the Holder shall have the
	right to elect prior to the consummation of such event or transaction, to give effect to the exercise rights contained in

	Section
	2

	instead of giving effect to the provisions contained in this

	Section 4(e)

	with respect to this Warrant.


	 


	(f)          

	Certain
	Events

	. If any event of the type contemplated by the provisions of this

	Section 4

	but not expressly provided for by
	such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights
	with equity features) occurs, then the Board shall make an appropriate adjustment in the Exercise Price and the number of Warrant
	Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant so as to protect the rights of the Holder in a manner consistent with the provisions
	of this

	Section 4

	;

	provided

	, that no such adjustment pursuant to this

	Section 4(f)

	shall increase the Exercise
	Price or decrease the number of Warrant Shares issuable as otherwise determined pursuant to this

	Section 4

	.

	Certificate
	as to Adjustment

	.


	 


	(i)          As
	promptly as reasonably practicable following any adjustment of the Exercise Price, but in any event not later than five (5) Business
	Days thereafter, the Company shall furnish to the Holder a certificate of an executive officer setting forth in reasonable detail
	such adjustment and the facts upon which it is based and certifying the calculation thereof.


	 


	(ii)         As
	promptly as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the Company of a written request by the Holder, but in any event not
	later than five (5) Business Days thereafter, the Company shall furnish to the Holder a certificate of an executive officer certifying
	the Exercise Price then in effect and the number of Warrant Shares or the amount, if any, of other shares of stock, securities
	or assets then issuable upon exercise of the Warrant.


	 


	(h)          

	Notices

	.
	In the event:


	 


	(i)          that
	the Company shall take a record of the holders of its Common Stock (or other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon
	exercise of the Warrant) for the purpose of entitling or enabling them to receive any dividend or other distribution, to vote at
	a meeting (or by written consent), to receive any right to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or
	any other securities, or to receive any other security; or


	 


	(ii)         of
	any capital reorganization of the Company, any reclassification of the Common Stock of the Company, any consolidation or merger
	of the Company with or into another Person, or sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to another Person;
	or


	 


	(iii)        of
	the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the Company;


	 


	then, and in each such case, the Company shall
	send or cause to be sent to the Holder at least five (5) Business Days prior to the applicable record date or the applicable expected
	effective date, as the case may be, for the event, a written notice specifying, as the case may be, (A) the record date for such
	dividend, distribution, meeting or consent or other right or action, and a description of such dividend, distribution or other
	right or action to be taken at such meeting or by written consent, or (B) the effective date on which such reorganization, reclassification,
	consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is proposed to take place, and the date, if any is to be fixed,
	as of which the books of the Company shall close or a record shall be taken with respect to which the holders of record of Common
	Stock (or such other capital stock or securities at the time issuable upon exercise of the Warrant) shall be entitled to exchange
	their shares of Common Stock (or such other capital stock or securities) for securities or other property deliverable upon such
	reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, and the amount per share
	and character of such exchange applicable to the Warrant and the Warrant Shares.

	Section
	5.           

	Purchase Rights

	. In addition to any adjustments
	pursuant to

	Section 4

	above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any shares of Common Stock, Options,
	Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of
	Common Stock (the “

	Purchase Rights

	”), then the Holder shall be entitled to (but shall not be obligated to)
	acquire, upon the same terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder would have
	acquired if the Holder had held the number of Warrant Shares acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant immediately
	before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is
	taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such
	Purchase Rights. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the Holder shall not be entitled to the Purchase
	Rights granted herein with respect to any Excluded Issuance.


	 


	Section
	6.           

	Registration Rights

	. The parties hereto agree that all
	Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of this Warrant are and shall be subject to, and shall have the benefit of, the
	registration rights (the “

	Registration Rights

	”) set forth in

	Addendum I

	hereto (the
	“

	Registration Rights Addendum

	”). The terms and provisions of the Registration Rights Addendum shall be
	binding upon the Company, the Holder and their respective successors, transferees and assigns, as if set forth in full within
	this Warrant. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Holder shall be entitled to request any Demand Registration or
	Piggyback Registration unless such Holder, either individually or acting in concert with other Holders participating in such
	request, hold at least 25% of the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant on the Issue Date.


	 


	Section
	7.           

	Transfer of Warrant

	. Subject to

	Section 6

	above
	and the transfer conditions referred to in the legend endorsed hereon, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are
	transferable, in whole or in part, by the Holder without charge to the Holder, upon surrender of this Warrant to the Company
	at its then principal executive offices with a properly completed and duly executed Assignment in the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit
	B

	, together with funds sufficient to pay any transfer taxes described in

	Section 3(f)(v)

	in connection with the
	making of such transfer. Upon such compliance, surrender and delivery and, if required, such payment, the Company shall
	execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees and in the denominations specified in
	such instrument of assignment, and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant, if
	any, not so assigned and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled.

	Section
	8.            

	Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder; Limitations on
	Liability

	. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein (including

	Section 4(c)(viii)

	), prior to the issuance
	to the Holder of the Warrant Shares to which the Holder is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this Warrant,
	the Holder shall not be entitled to vote or receive dividends or be deemed the holder of shares of capital stock of the
	Company for any purpose, nor shall anything contained in this Warrant be construed to confer upon the Holder, as such, any of
	the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote, give or withhold consent to any corporate action (whether
	any reorganization, issue of stock, reclassification of stock, consolidation, merger, conveyance or otherwise),
	receive notice of meetings, receive dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise. In addition, nothing contained in this
	Warrant shall be construed as imposing any liabilities on the Holder to purchase any securities (upon exercise of this
	Warrant or otherwise) or as a stockholder of the Company, whether such liabilities are asserted by the Company or by
	creditors of the Company. Notwithstanding this

	Section 8

	, the Company shall provide the Holder with copies of the same
	notices and other information given to the stockholders of the Company generally, contemporaneously with the giving thereof
	to the stockholders.


	 


	Section 9.             

	Replacement
	on Loss; Division and Combination

	.


	 


	(i)          

	Replacement
	of Warrant on Loss

	. Upon receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation
	of this Warrant and upon delivery of an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it (it being understood that a written indemnification
	agreement or affidavit of loss of the Holder shall be a sufficient indemnity) and, in case of mutilation, upon surrender of such
	Warrant for cancellation to the Company, the Company at its own expense shall execute and deliver to the Holder, in lieu hereof,
	a new Warrant of like tenor and exercisable for an equivalent number of Warrant Shares as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated
	or destroyed;

	provided

	, that, in the case of mutilation, no indemnity shall be required if this Warrant in identifiable
	form is surrendered to the Company for cancellation.


	 


	(j)          

	Division
	and Combination of Warrant

	. Subject to compliance with the applicable provisions of this Warrant as to any transfer or other
	assignment which may be involved in such division or combination, this Warrant may be divided or, following any such division of
	this Warrant, subsequently combined with other Warrants, upon the surrender of this Warrant or Warrants to the Company at its then
	principal executive offices, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants are to
	be issued, signed by the respective Holders or their agents or attorneys. Subject to compliance with the applicable provisions
	of this Warrant as to any transfer or assignment which may be involved in such division or combination, the Company shall at its
	own expense execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant or Warrants so surrendered in accordance
	with such notice. Such new Warrant or Warrants shall be of like tenor to the surrendered Warrant or Warrants and shall be exercisable
	in the aggregate for an equivalent number of Warrant Shares as the Warrant or Warrants so surrendered in accordance with such notice.

	No Impairment

	. The Company shall not, by amendment of its Certificate
	of Incorporation or Bylaws, through any shareholders, voting or similar agreement, or through any reorganization, transfer of
	assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to
	avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms to be observed or performed by it hereunder, but shall at all times
	in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions of this Warrant and in the taking of all such action as may
	reasonably be requested by the Holder in order to protect the exercise rights of the Holder against dilution or other
	impairment, consistent with the tenor and purpose of this Warrant.


	 


	Section 11.          

	Compliance
	with the Securities Act

	.


	 


	(k)          

	Agreement
	to Comply with the Securities Act; Legend

	. The Holder, by acceptance of this Warrant, agrees to comply in all respects with
	the provisions of this

	Section 11

	and the restrictive legend requirements set forth on the face of this Warrant and further
	agrees that such Holder shall not offer, sell or otherwise dispose of this Warrant or any Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise
	hereof except under circumstances that will not result in a violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “

	Securities
	Act

	”). This Warrant and all Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of this Warrant (unless registered under the Securities
	Act) shall be stamped or imprinted with a legend in substantially the following form:


	 


	“THIS WARRANT AND THE
	SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE OF THIS WARRANT HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “

	ACT

	”),
	OR QUALIFIED UNDER ANY STATE OR FOREIGN SECURITIES LAWS AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, PLEDGED, HYPOTHECATED OR OTHERWISE
	TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED UNLESS (I) A REGISTRATION STATEMENT COVERING SUCH SHARES IS EFFECTIVE UNDER THE ACT AND IS QUALIFIED UNDER
	APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN LAW OR (II) THE TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM THE REGISTRATION AND PROSPECTUS DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS UNDER
	THE ACT AND THE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS UNDER APPLICABLE STATE AND FOREIGN LAW AND, IF THE CORPORATION REQUESTS, AN OPINION
	SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION TO SUCH EFFECT HAS BEEN RENDERED BY COUNSEL.”


	 


	(l)          

	Representations
	of the Holder

	. In connection with the issuance of this Warrant, the Holder specifically represents, as of the date hereof,
	to the Company by acceptance of this Warrant as follows:


	 


	(i)          The
	Holder is an “accredited investor” as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The
	Holder is acquiring this Warrant and the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise hereof for investment for its own account and
	not with a present view towards, or for resale in connection with, the public sale or distribution of this Warrant or the Warrant
	Shares, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.


	 






	 



	18



	 







	 




	 


	(ii)         The
	Holder understands and acknowledges that this Warrant and the Warrant Shares to be issued upon exercise hereof are “restricted
	securities” under the federal securities laws inasmuch as they are being acquired from the Company in a transaction not involving
	a public offering and that, under such laws and applicable regulations, such securities may be resold without registration under
	the Securities Act only in certain limited circumstances. In addition, the Holder represents that it is familiar with Rule 144
	under the Securities Act, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed thereby and by the Securities
	Act.


	 


	(iii)        The
	Holder acknowledges that it can bear the economic and financial risk of its investment for an indefinite period, and has such knowledge
	and experience in financial or business matters that it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in the
	Warrant and the Warrant Shares. The Holder has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from the Company regarding
	the terms and conditions of the offering of the Warrant and the business, properties, prospects and financial condition of the
	Company.


	 


	Section 12.          

	Warrant
	Register

	. The Company shall keep and properly maintain at its principal executive offices a register (the “

	Warrant
	Register

	”) for the registration of the Warrant and any transfers thereof. The Company may deem and treat the Person in
	whose name the Warrant is registered on such register as the Holder thereof for all purposes, and the Company shall not be affected
	by any notice to the contrary, except any assignment, division, combination or other transfer of the Warrant effected in accordance
	with the provisions of this Warrant.


	 


	Section 13.          

	Notices

	.
	All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder or under the Registration Rights Addendum

	(ii) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested); (iii) on the date
	sent by facsimile or e-mail of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if sent during normal business hours of the recipient,

	(a)          The
	Company shall at all times use its reasonable best efforts to qualify and remain qualified to register securities under the Securities
	Act pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-3 or any successor form thereto. The Holders shall have the right to request
	3 registrations of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration (each a “

	Upon receipt of any such request, the Company shall promptly (but in no event later than ten (10) days following receipt thereof)
	deliver notice of such request to all other holders of Registrable Securities who shall then have ten (10) days from the date such

	SEC as soon as practicable thereafter.


	 






	 



	2



	 







	 




	 


	(b)          The
	Company shall not be obligated to effect any Demand Registration within one hundred twenty (120) days after the effective date
	of a previous Demand Registration pursuant to which Holders of Registrable Securities were permitted to register, and actually
	sold, at least 50% of the shares of Registrable Securities requested to be included therein. The Company may postpone for up to
	ninety (90) days the filing or effectiveness of a Registration Statement for a Demand Registration if the Company’s Board
	determines in its reasonable good faith judgment that such Demand Registration would (i) materially interfere with a significant
	acquisition, corporate organization, public or private offering of the Company’s securities or other transaction similar
	to any of the foregoing involving the Company; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a
	bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under
	the Securities Act or Exchange Act. The Company may delay a Demand Registration hereunder only once in any period of twelve consecutive
	months. If any registration is withdrawn or delayed pursuant to this

	clause (b)

	the Company shall pay all expenses
	associated with such registration.


	 


	(c)          If
	the Holders initially requesting a Demand Registration elect to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request
	in an underwritten offering, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to

	Section 2(a)

	,
	and the Company shall include such information in its notice to the other Holders of Registrable Securities. The Company shall
	select the investment banking firm or firms to act as the managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with such offering;

	provided

	, that such selection shall be subject to the consent of Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities, which
	consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.


	 


	(d)          If
	a Demand Registration involves an underwritten offering and the managing underwriter of the requested Demand Registration advises
	the Company in writing that in its opinion the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be included in the Demand Registration,
	including all Registrable Securities and all other shares of Common Stock proposed to be included in such underwritten offering,
	exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock which can be sold in such underwritten offering and/or the number of shares of Common
	Stock proposed to be included in such registration would adversely affect the price per share of the Registrable Securities proposed
	to be sold in such underwritten offering, the Company shall include in such Demand Registration (i) first, the number of shares
	of Common Stock that the Holders propose to sell, and (ii) second, the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be included
	therein by any other Persons (including shares of Common Stock to be sold for the account of the Company and/or other holders of
	Common Stock) allocated among such Persons in such manner as they may agree. If the managing underwriter determines that less than
	all of the Registrable Securities held by Holders proposed to be sold can be included in such offering, then such Registrable Securities
	that can be included in such offering shall be allocated pro rata among the respective Holders thereof on the basis of the number
	of Registrable Securities owned by each such Holder.

	4.           

	Piggyback
	Registration

	.


	 


	(a)          Whenever
	the Company proposes to register any shares of its Common Stock under the Securities Act (other than a registration effected solely
	to implement an employee benefit plan or a transaction to which Rule 145 of the Securities Act is applicable, or a Registration
	Statement on Form S-4, S-8 or any successor form thereto or another form not available for registering the Registrable Securities
	for sale to the public), whether for its own account or for the account of one or more stockholders of the Company and the form
	of Registration Statement to be used may be used for any registration of Registrable Securities (a “

	Piggyback Registration

	”),
	the Company shall give prompt written notice (in any event no later than ten (10) Business Days prior to the filing of such Registration
	Statement) to the Holders of the Company’s intention to effect such a registration and, subject to

	Section 4(b)

	and

	Section 4(c)

	, shall include in such registration all Registrable Securities that the Holders have requested to be included
	within such registration;

	provided

	to have its Registrable Securities included in such registration a Holder must provide
	such request in writing to the Company within three (3) Business Days after the Company’s notice has been given to each such
	Holder. A Piggyback Registration shall not be considered a Demand Registration for purposes of

	Section 3

	of this Addendum.


	 


	(b)          If
	a Piggyback Registration is initiated as a primary underwritten offering on behalf of the Company and the managing underwriter
	advises the Company in writing that in its opinion the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be included in such registration,
	including all Registrable Securities (if any Holders of Registrable Securities have elected to include Registrable Securities in
	such Piggyback Registration) and all other shares of Common Stock proposed to be included in such underwritten offering, exceeds
	the number of shares of Common Stock which can be sold in such offering and/or that the number of shares of Common Stock proposed
	to be included in any such registration would adversely affect the price per share of the Common Stock to be sold in such offering,
	the Company shall include in such registration (i) first, the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company proposes to sell;
	(ii) second, the number of shares of Common Stock, if any, requested to be included therein by Holders allocated pro rata among
	all such Holders on the basis of the number of Registrable Securities owned by each such Holder or in such manner as they may otherwise
	agree; and (iii) third, the number of shares of Common Stock requested to be included therein by other holders of Common Stock
	(other than Holders), allocated among such holders in such manner as they may agree.


	 


	(c)          If
	a Piggyback Registration is initiated as an underwritten offering on behalf of a holder of Common Stock other than a Holder, and
	the managing underwriter advises the Company in writing that in its opinion the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be
	included in such registration, including all Registrable Securities held by Holders held by Holders and all other shares of Common
	Stock proposed to be included in such underwritten offering, exceeds the number of shares of Common Stock which can be sold in
	such offering and/or that the number of shares of Common Stock proposed to be included in any such registration would adversely
	affect the price per share of the Common Stock to be sold in such offering, the Company shall include in such registration (i)
	first, the number of shares of Common Stock requested to be included therein by the holder(s) requesting such registration and
	by the Holders, allocated pro rata among all such stockholders on the basis of the number of shares of Common Stock (on a fully
	diluted, as converted basis) and the number of Registrable Securities, as applicable, owned by all such stockholders or in such
	manner as they may otherwise agree; and (ii) second, the number of shares of Common Stock requested to be included therein by other
	holders of Common Stock, allocated among such holders in such manner as they may agree.


	 






	 



	4



	 







	 




	 


	(d)          If
	any Piggyback Registration is initiated as a primary underwritten offering on behalf of the Company, the Company shall select the
	investment banking firm or firms to act as the managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with such offering.


	 


	(e)          Notwithstanding
	anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to any Piggyback Registration that (i) occurs and is effective on or before
	December 31, 2017 and (ii) relates solely to the offering of shares of Common Stock or other Capital Securities, the Holder shall
	not request that any of its Registrable Securities be included in such registration.


	 


	5.           

	Registration
	Procedures

	. If and whenever Holders request that any Registrable Securities be registered pursuant to the provisions of this
	Addendum, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to effect the registration and the sale of such Registrable Securities
	in accordance with the intended method of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall as soon as reasonably practicable:


	 


	(a)          Subject
	to

	Section 2(a)

	, prepare and file with the SEC a Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and
	use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective.


	 


	(b)          Prepare
	and file with the SEC such amendments, post-effective amendments and supplements to such Registration Statement and the Prospectus
	used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such Registration Statement effective for a period of not less than ninety
	(90) days, or if earlier, until all of such Registrable Securities have been disposed of and to comply with the provisions of the
	Securities Act with respect to the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended methods of disposition
	set forth in such Registration Statement.


	 


	(c)          At
	least five (5) Business Days before filing such Registration Statement, Prospectus or amendments or supplements thereto, furnish
	to one counsel selected by Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities copies of such documents proposed to be filed, which
	documents shall be subject to the review, comment and approval of such counsel.


	 






	 



	5



	 







	 




	 


	(d)          Notify
	each selling Holder, promptly after the Company receives notice thereof, of the time when such Registration Statement has been
	declared effective or a supplement to any Prospectus forming a part of such Registration Statement has been filed.


	 


	(e)          Furnish
	to each selling Holder such number of copies of the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement (including each preliminary
	Prospectus) and any supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits and documents incorporated by reference therein) and
	such other documents as such seller may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
	owned by such Holder.


	 


	(f)          Use
	its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify such Registrable Securities under such other securities or “blue sky”
	laws of such jurisdictions as any selling Holder reasonably requests and do any and all other acts and things which may be reasonably
	necessary or advisable to enable such Holders to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions;

	provided

	, that the Company shall not be required to qualify generally to do business, subject itself to general taxation
	or consent to general service of process in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to do so but for this

	Section
	4

	.


	 


	(g)          Notify
	each selling Holder, at any time when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the
	occurrence of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in such Registration Statement contains an untrue statement
	of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, at the request of any such Holder,
	the Company shall prepare a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such
	Registrable Securities, such Prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary
	to make the statements therein not misleading.


	 


	(h)          Make
	available for inspection by any selling Holder, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration
	Statement and any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such Holder or underwriter (collectively, the “

	Inspectors

	”),
	all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and properties of the Company (collectively, the “

	Records

	”),
	and cause the Company’s officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Inspector
	in connection with such Registration Statement;

	provided

	, that such Inspectors enter into a written, reasonable and customary
	confidentiality agreement with the Company.


	 


	(i)          Provide
	a transfer agent and registrar (which may be the same entity) for all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective
	date of such registration.


	 


	(j)          Use
	its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which the Common Stock
	is then listed or, if the Common Stock is not then listed, on a national securities exchange selected by the Holders of a majority
	of such Registrable Securities.

	(k)          In
	connection with an underwritten offering, enter into such customary agreements (including underwriting and lock-up agreements in
	customary form) and take all such other customary actions as the Holders or the managing underwriter of such offering reasonably
	request in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities (including, without limitation, making
	appropriate officers of the Company available to participate in a “road show” and other customary marketing activities
	(including one-on-one meetings with prospective purchasers of the Registrable Securities);

	provided

	,

	however

	, that
	the officers of the Company shall not be required to be available for more than ten (10) Business Days during any twelve (12) month
	period for any “road show,” marketing activities or one-on-one meetings.


	 


	(l)          Otherwise
	use its reasonable best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and make available to its stockholders
	an earnings statement (in a form that satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder)
	no later than thirty (30) days after the end of the 12-month period beginning with the first day of the Company’s first full
	fiscal quarter after the effective date of such Registration Statement, which earnings statement shall cover said 12-month period,
	and which requirement will be deemed to be satisfied if the Company timely files complete and accurate information on Forms 10-Q,
	10-K and 8-K under the Exchange Act and otherwise complies with Rule 158 under the Securities Act.


	 


	(m)          Furnish
	to each selling Holder and each underwriter, if any, with (i) a legal opinion of the Company’s outside counsel, dated the
	effective date of such Registration Statement (and, if such registration includes an underwritten public offering, dated the date
	of the closing under the underwriting agreement), in form and substance as is customarily given in opinions of the Company’s
	counsel to underwriters in underwritten public offerings; and (ii) a “comfort” letter signed by the Company’s
	independent certified public accountants in form and substance as is customarily given in accountants’ letters to underwriters
	in underwritten public offerings.


	 


	(n)          Without
	limiting

	Section 4

	above, use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Registrable Securities to be registered with or
	approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of the
	Company to enable the Holders to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with their intended method
	of distribution thereof.


	 


	(o)          Notify
	the Holders promptly of any request by the SEC to amend or supplement such Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional
	information.


	 






	 



	7



	 







	 




	 


	(p)          Notify
	the Holders, which notice shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the Prospectus until the requisite changes
	have been made, as promptly as reasonably possible (i) of the issuance by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental
	authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities
	or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose, (ii) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the
	suspension of the qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any jurisdiction,
	or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for such purpose, (iii) of the occurrence of any event or passage of time that
	makes the financial statements included in a Registration Statement ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made in a
	Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any
	material respect or that requires any revisions to a Registration Statement, Prospectus or other documents so that, in the case
	of a Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
	or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
	under which they were made, not misleading, and (iv) of the occurrence or existence of any pending corporate development with respect
	to the Company that the Company believes may be material and that, in the determination of the Company, makes it not in the best
	interest of the Company to allow continued availability of a Registration Statement or Prospectus,

	provided

	,

	however

	,
	in no event shall any such notice contain any information which would constitute material, non-public information regarding the
	Company. If the Company notifies the Holders in accordance with this paragraph to suspend the use of any Registration Statement
	or Prospectus until the requisite changes to such Registration Statement or Prospectus have been made, then the Holders shall suspend
	use of such Registration Statement or Prospectus. The Company will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to prevent the
	issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or Prospectus, and, if any such order suspending
	the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or Prospectus is issued, shall promptly use its commercially reasonable best efforts
	to cause all stop orders to be withdrawn, to update or correct any financial statements or other information contained in the Registration
	Statement or Prospectus, as the case may be, and to otherwise ensure that the use of the Registration Statement or Prospectus may
	be resumed as promptly as is practicable.


	 


	(q)          Permit
	any Holder that, in such Holder’s sole and exclusive judgment, might be deemed to be an underwriter or a controlling person
	of the Company, to participate in the preparation of such Registration Statement and to require the insertion therein of language,
	furnished to the Company in writing, which in the reasonable judgment of such Holder and its counsel, should be included.


	 


	(r)          Otherwise
	use its reasonable best efforts to take all other steps necessary to effect the registration of such Registrable Securities contemplated
	hereby.


	 


	6.           

	Expenses

	.
	All expenses (other than Selling Expenses) incurred by the Company in complying with its obligations pursuant to this Addendum
	and in connection with the registration and disposition of Registrable Securities, including, without limitation, all registration
	and filing fees, underwriting expenses (other than fees, omissions or discounts), expenses of any audits incident to or required
	by any such registration, fees and expenses of complying with securities and “blue sky” laws, printing expenses, reasonable
	fees and expenses of the Company’s counsel and accountants and reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel for the Holders
	participating in such registration as a group (selected by Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities initially requesting
	such registration, and, in the case of all other registrations hereunder, the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities
	included in the registration), shall be paid by the Company. All Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities held by Holders
	and registered pursuant to this Addendum shall be borne and paid by the Holders of such Registrable Securities, in proportion to
	the number of Registrable Securities registered for each such Holder.

	7.            

	Indemnification

	.


	 


	(a)          The
	Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder, such Holder’s officers, directors,
	managers, members, partners, stockholders and Affiliates, each underwriter, broker or any other Person acting on behalf of such
	Holder and each other Person, if any, who controls any of the foregoing Persons within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities
	Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against all losses, claims, actions, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several,
	to which any of the foregoing Persons may become subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims,
	actions, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
	contained in any Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated
	under the Securities Act) or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
	required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or any violation or alleged violation
	by the Company of the Securities Act or any other similar federal or state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated
	thereunder applicable to the Company and relating to action or inaction required of the Company in connection with any such registration,
	qualification or compliance; and shall reimburse such Persons for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by any of them
	in connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, action, damage or liability, except insofar as the same are
	caused by or contained in any information furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use therein or by such
	Holder’s failure to deliver a copy of the Registration Statement, Prospectus, free-writing prospectus (as defined in Rule
	405 promulgated under the Securities Act) or any amendments or supplements thereto (if the same was required by applicable law
	to be so delivered) after the Company has furnished such Holder with a sufficient number of copies of the same prior to any written
	confirmation of the sale of Registrable Securities.


	 


	(b)          In
	connection with any registration in which a Holder is participating, each such Holder shall furnish to the Company in writing such
	information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus
	and, to the extent permitted by law, such Holder shall indemnify and hold harmless, the Company, each director of the Company,
	each officer of the Company who shall sign such Registration Statement, each underwriter, broker or other Person acting on behalf
	of the Holders and each Person who controls any of the foregoing Persons within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
	or Section 20 of the Exchange Act against any losses, claims, actions, damages, liabilities or expenses resulting from any untrue
	or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, Prospectus, preliminary Prospectus, free
	writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 promulgated under the Securities Act) or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
	or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
	not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished
	in writing by such Holder;

	provided

	, that the obligation to indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, for each
	Holder and shall be limited to the net proceeds (after underwriting fees, commissions or discounts) actually received by such Holder
	from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.


	 






	 



	9



	 







	 




	 


	(c)          Promptly
	after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action involving a claim referred to in this

	Section
	6

	, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is made against an indemnifying party, give written notice to
	the latter of the commencement of such action. The failure of any indemnified party to notify an indemnifying party of any such
	action shall not (unless such failure shall have a material adverse effect on the indemnifying party) relieve the indemnifying
	party from any liability in respect of such action that it may have to such indemnified party hereunder. In case any such action
	is brought against an indemnified party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume the defense of
	the claims in any such action that are subject or potentially subject to indemnification hereunder, jointly with any other indemnifying
	party similarly notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after
	written notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying
	party shall not be responsible for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with
	the defense thereof;

	provided

	, that if (i) any indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or
	more legal or equitable defenses available to such indemnified party which are additional to or conflict with those available to
	the indemnifying party, or that such claim or litigation involves or could have an effect upon matters beyond the scope of the
	indemnity provided hereunder, or (ii) such action seeks an injunction or equitable relief against any indemnified party or involves
	actual or alleged criminal activity, the indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action on behalf
	of such indemnified party without such indemnified party’s prior written consent (but, without such consent, shall have the
	right to participate therein with counsel of its choice) and such indemnifying party shall reimburse such indemnified party and
	any Person controlling such indemnified party for that portion of the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by the indemnified
	party which is reasonably related to the matters covered by the indemnity provided hereunder. If the indemnifying party is not
	entitled to, or elects not to, assume the defense of a claim, it shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than
	one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment
	of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties
	with respect to such claim. In such instance, the conflicting indemnified parties shall have a right to retain one separate counsel,
	chosen by the Holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in the registration, at the expense of the indemnifying
	party. In no event will any indemnified party settle or compromise any claim for which it may seek indemnification hereunder without
	the prior written consent of the indemnifying party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.


	 






	 



	10



	 







	 




	 


	(d)          If
	the indemnification provided for hereunder is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an indemnified party
	with respect to any loss, claim, damage, liability or action referred to herein, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying
	such indemnified party hereunder, shall contribute to the amounts paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
	loss, claim, damage, liability or action in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
	party on the one hand and of the indemnified party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
	such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as well as any other relevant equitable considerations;

	provided

	, that the
	maximum amount of liability in respect of such contribution shall be limited, in the case of each Holder to an amount equal to
	the net proceeds (after underwriting fees, commissions or discounts) actually received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable
	Securities effected pursuant to such registration. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall
	be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission
	or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party
	and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
	omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant hereto were determined by pro rata
	allocation or by any other method or allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to herein.
	No Person guilty or liable of fraudulent misrepresentation shall be entitled to contribution from any Person.


	 


	8.           

	Participation
	in Underwritten Registrations

	. No Person may participate in any registration hereunder which is underwritten unless such Person
	(i) agrees to sell such Person’s securities on the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Person
	or Persons entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
	indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements;

	provided

	,
	that, in connection with any underwritten registration, no Holder shall be required to make any representations or warranties to
	the Company or the underwriters (other than representations and warranties regarding such Holder, such Holder’s ownership
	of its shares of Common Stock to be sold in the offering and such Holder’s intended method of distribution) or to undertake
	any indemnification obligations to the Company or the underwriters with respect thereto, except as otherwise provided in

	Section
	7

	.


	 


	9.           

	Rule
	144 Compliance

	. With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and any other
	rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit a holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration
	or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3 (or any successor form), the Company shall:


	 


	(a)          make
	and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, at all times
	after the Registration Date;


	 






	 



	11



	 







	 




	 


	(b)          use
	reasonable best efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the
	Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and


	 


	(c)          furnish
	to any Holder so long as the Holder owns Registrable Securities, promptly upon request, a written statement by the Company as to
	its compliance with the reporting requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and of the Securities Act and the Exchange
	Act, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other reports and documents so filed or furnished
	by the Company as such holder may reasonably request in connection with the sale of Registrable Securities without registration.


	 


	10.         

	Preservation
	of Rights

	. The Company shall not (i) grant any registration rights to third parties which are more favorable than or inconsistent
	with the rights granted hereunder, or (ii) enter into any agreement, take any action, or permit any change to occur, with respect
	to its securities that violates or subordinates the rights expressly granted to the holders of Registrable Securities in this Addendum.


	 


	11.         

	Termination

	.
	The terms and provisions of this Addendum shall be of no further force or effect upon the earlier to occur of (i) when there shall
	no longer be any Registrable Securities outstanding and (ii) the date that is 3 years after the expiration of the Exercise Period
	(as defined in the Warrant);

	provided

	, that the provisions of

	Section 5

	and

	Section 6

	shall survive any such
	termination.


	 


	12.         

	Existing
	Shelf

	. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall any Holder be entitled to have any Registrable
	Securities included in any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to the Company’s existing registration statement
	on Form S-3 (SEC File No. 333-197844).

	Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.




	﻿




	On March 31, 2017, Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) and the lenders party thereto entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”)




	to the Third Amended and Restated Convertible 




	Credit Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2015


	(the “2015 Credit Agreement”).  Under the terms of the Third Amendment, principal payments owed under the 2015 Credit Agreement, in the amount of $380,000 per month, have been deferred until January 31, 2018.  Additionally, the parties amended a Future Capital Raising covenant, pursuant to which the company was required to raise $40.0 million through the sale of qualified equity interests, by


	extending the time period by which the Company is required to raise the remaining $17.0 million of capital by six months, from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  All other material terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement remain the same. 




	The Third Amendment also amends certain terms of the warrants to purchase an aggregate of 617,651 shares of the Company’s common stock issued in connection with the 2015 Credit Agreement (the “2015 Warrants”).  Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the warrants may now only be exercised for cash and the exercise price was reduced from $10.20 per share to $4.50 per share. 


	The redemption feature in the


	2015 Warrants


	was also amended such that the warrant holder may demand a redemption of the warrant shares upon the occurrence of, and during the continuance of, an event of default.  Prior to this amendment, the warrant could be redeemed by the warrant holder at any time after the 51


	st


	month.


	 As amended, if these warrants are exercised, the Company will receive approximately $2.8 million in proceeds.




	The lenders party to the 2015 Credit Agreement and the Third Amendment, or their affiliates, are significant stockholders of the Company.  In addition, Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund LTD, an affiliate of Perceptive Credit Holdings, L.P., participated in the Company’s March 2017 private placement.




	The foregoing summary of the Third Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete text of the Third Amendment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

	Item 1.01. Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.




	﻿




	On March 31, 2017, Kadmon Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) and the lenders party thereto entered into Amendment No. 3 (the “Third Amendment”)




	to the Third Amended and Restated Convertible 




	Credit Agreement, dated as of August 28, 2015


	(the “2015 Credit Agreement”).  Under the terms of the Third Amendment, principal payments owed under the 2015 Credit Agreement, in the amount of $380,000 per month, have been deferred until January 31, 2018.  Additionally, the parties amended a Future Capital Raising covenant, pursuant to which the company was required to raise $40.0 million through the sale of qualified equity interests, by


	extending the time period by which the Company is required to raise the remaining $17.0 million of capital by six months, from June 30, 2017 to December 31, 2017.  All other material terms of the 2015 Credit Agreement remain the same. 




	The Third Amendment also amends certain terms of the warrants to purchase an aggregate of 617,651 shares of the Company’s common stock issued in connection with the 2015 Credit Agreement (the “2015 Warrants”).  Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the warrants may now only be exercised for cash and the exercise price was reduced from $10.20 per share to $4.50 per share. 


	The redemption feature in the


	2015 Warrants


	was also amended such that the warrant holder may demand a redemption of the warrant shares upon the occurrence of, and during the continuance of, an event of default.  Prior to this amendment, the warrant could be redeemed by the warrant holder at any time after the 51


	st


	month.


	 As amended, if these warrants are exercised, the Company will receive approximately $2.8 million in proceeds.




	The lenders party to the 2015 Credit Agreement and the Third Amendment, or their affiliates, are significant stockholders of the Company.  In addition, Perceptive Life Sciences Master Fund LTD, an affiliate of Perceptive Credit Holdings, L.P., participated in the Company’s March 2017 private placement.




	The foregoing summary of the Third Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full and complete text of the Third Amendment, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.




	﻿




	Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.


	  



	 



	The information included in Item 1.01 above is incorporated by reference into this Item 2.03.




	Item 8.01. Other Events.




	On April 3, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing the Third Amendment. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.






	Item 9.01. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

	(iii)


	No Default or Event of Default has occurred or is continuing or will result after giving effect to this Third Amendment. 
















	(b)


	Each Obligor hereby ratifies, confirms, reaffirms, and acknowledges its obligations under each Loan Document (including without limitation the Credit Agreement) to which it is a party and agrees that each such Loan Document remains in full force and effect, undiminished by this Third Amendment, except as expressly provided herein;


	provided


	that, after the Third Amendment Effective Date, all references in any Loan Document to the “Credit Agreement”, “Loan Document”, “thereunder”, “thereof”, or words of similar import shall mean the Existing Credit Agreement and the Loan Documents, as amended or otherwise modified by this Third Amendment.  By executing this Third Amendment, each Obligor acknowledges that it has read, consulted with its attorneys regarding, and understands, this Third Amendment.

	SECTION 7.


	Miscellaneous


	.
















	(a)


	No Waiver

	(b)


	Severability


	.  In case any provision of or obligation under this Third Amendment shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and











	 







	enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
















	(c)


	Headings


	.  Headings and captions used in this Third Amendment (including the Exhibits, Schedules and Annexes hereto, if any) are included for convenience of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect.
















	(d)


	Integration


	.  This Third Amendment constitutes a Loan Document and, together with the other Loan Documents, incorporates all negotiations of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and is the final expression and agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof.  This Third Amendment shall (unless otherwise expressly indicated therein) be construed, administered and applied in accordance with all of the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement, including


	Section 13


	thereof (including, without limitation,


	Sections 13.09


	,  


	13.10


	and


	13.11


	).
