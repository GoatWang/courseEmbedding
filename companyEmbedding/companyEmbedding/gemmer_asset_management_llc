Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

After careful research into global longer term – three to five years – and shorter term – up to 12 months – market trends, we look to overweight certain sectors that appear undervalued or offer compelling opportunities, as well as to underweight areas of the market that appear overvalued. To learn more about how we make our Tactical Asset Class Shifts, click here.
 Manager/ETF Selection. At Gemmer, we take scrupulous care when evaluating managers and/or ETFs to be included in our portfolios. That’s why we perform comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analysis on institutional money managers before we hire them.

About us 









Gemmer Asset Management LLC is an employee-owned, independent firm that specializes in providing advisors with a suite of services to make their lives easier so they can better serve their clients. These services include sound investment strategies, comprehensive back-office support and high levels of personalized attention.
Our investment philosophy is simple. We follow a risk-managed, asset allocation approach that works with world-class investment managers to provide top-rated mutual funds, ETFs, separately managed accounts and other vehicles that help build portfolios.Our clients are independent financial professionals in Northern California. Our commitment is to enable them to focus on the unique needs of their clients, while we focus on the investment management and back office duties they need to be successful.Gemmer Asset Management LLC is a SEC Registered Investment Advisor.
 
WHY GEMMER
Since 1992, we have been providing high quality, unbiased investment management services to the local Bay Area community. From our very first day, our focus has been on supporting independent financial advisors and their clients through sound investment strategies, comprehensive back-office support and high levels of personalized service. We pride ourselves on the strength of the partnerships we have with advisors and, in turn, helping them partner successfully with their clients. 
 
When he decided to open the doors of the firm that bears his name, David Gemmer knew that it was virtually impossible for an advisor to become an expert in everything – portfolio management, estate planning, insurance, marketing, reporting, etc. – and also to give clients the attention they need and deserve. Gemmer’s model, therefore, was to provide a full suite of “outsourced” services for advisors, enabling them to focus on their own clients while growing their businesses. 
 
Back then, the concept of “outsourcing” asset management services was virtually unheard of. Today, an entire industry has evolved around this business. And as the industry has grown, so too has Gemmer. Today, as a wholly employee-owned firm, we are committed to working with our advisors to provide objective portfolio management and a level of customization not found anywhere else.

For Clients of Advisors 









For Clients of Advisors
Working with an advisor
For many investors, working with a knowledgeable, objective, financial advisor is the best way to understand their financial situation and create an investment strategy that helps meet their goals. Finding holistic solutions to financial challenges is critical, and advisors need to be able to deliver advice that is crafted to their clients’ specific needs. You can expect your advisor to:


Define your financial goals and time horizon


Determine your risk tolerance – how much volatility can you handle?


Develop an investment policy statement – document how your account will be managed and implemented


Supervise the implementation of your portfolio – work directly with the portfolio managers to make this happen


Regularly report and interpret your allocation and performance – monitor your portfolio and make adjustments accordingly to meet your goals


When your advisor partners with Gemmer
By partnering with Gemmer, your advisor has access to our expertise in portfolio management, asset allocation, trading and reporting to help them build effective financial solutions for you that meet your goals today and tomorrow. We work together to:


Design your portfolio – by utilizing proven, time-tested investment principles


Reduce your investment risk – by diversifying across asset classes and styles to reduce overall risk and enhance return


Continuously monitor the market – so that your advisor can review your portfolio as conditions change and make recommendations as needed


Do extensive due diligence on money managers  – to help ensure only superior managers handle your investing dollars


Provide thorough reporting – to make sure advisors receive all the important information about your account they need


Act as thought leaders – to help advisors & clients stay abreast of the market, we strive to publish pieces that are understandable and educational


 
Working together, your advisor and Gemmer Asset Management focus locally and invest globally to build a strong investment plan that will give you security and comfort.

Market Update

Posted on July 28, 2017 by
            Gemmer Asset



  We saw a bit of a correction in the domestic equity markets this week, but international stocks posted gains, due in part to a weak dollar. The S&P dipped a fraction (-0.02%) while the small-cap Russell 2000 slipped -0.5. The NASDAQ closed -0.2% lower. The international markets bucked the trend with the EAFE up +0.4% and emerging +0.3%. The advance in equities over the last few months has been relentless. It was only a…Continue reading >>









Market Update

Posted on June 30, 2017 by
            Gemmer Asset



    For the first time in a while we saw some volatility in the markets. Equities bounced around quite a bit this week on mixed economic news, a possible change of heart by central banks, and a renewed stalemate over the healthcare bill. For the week the S&P lost -0.6% while small-cap equities were basically flat. The worst of the selling for the week was in the FANG stocks. The NASDAQ lost -2.0% with…Continue reading >>

            Gemmer Asset



  On the surface, it was a flat week for the U.S. indexes, but below the surface small-caps and tech stocks sold off about -1% for the week.  The international markets were a mixed bag.  Europe and Japan were modestly higher after adjusting for the currency move while the emerging world was down.  China and Hong Kong fell -1.1% and -1.6% respectively while Brazil sagged -0.9%.   Bond yields dipped modestly on the week on…Continue reading >>









Market Update

            Gemmer Asset



  It was a solid week for almost all markets.  The global equity indexes pushed higher around the world with the S&P gaining +1.0% for the week while the small-cap Russell 2000 added +1.8%.  Europe and Japan also performed well.  The European indexes added +1.5% for the week while Japan was up +3.2% (both in dollar terms).  Emerging markets lagged, with Brazil losing -2.4%.   Bond yields dipped meaningfully after Friday’s weekly employment report.  The…Continue reading >>









Market Update

            Gemmer Asset



  Watching the news on Wednesday or reading the papers Thursday morning you would have thought we were down big this week. But only the small-cap Russell 2000 index stands out with a loss of over -1%. The S&P was little changed, and even emerging equities hardly budged despite the turmoil in Brazil (more below). The EAFE stands out with a +1.3% weekly gain, bringing the YTD advance to +14.5%. The gain in the developed…Continue reading >>

            Gemmer Asset



  Market Summary   It was a choppy week for the equity markets, but most major indexes gained ground.  The S&P was up +0.6% for the week while the NASDAQ added +0.9%.  Only small-caps and energy stocks really lost ground.  Europe had a very good week.  Germany was up +2.4% while France added +3.1%.  Japan was solid as well (+1.3%).   Interest rates backed up slightly after the Fed meeting mid-week.  The yield on the…Continue reading >>

            Gemmer Asset



  Market Summary   It was a solid week for the global equity markets.  The French election results provided the spark on Monday and solid earnings reports underpinned the gains.  For the week both the S&P and Russell 2000 were up +1.5%.   The NASDAQ jumped +2.3% to close solidly above the 6,000 level for the first time ever.  Amazon and Google earnings impressed investors.   While the big tech behemoths garner a lot of attention,…Continue reading >>









Market Update

Posted on March 31, 2017 by
            Gemmer Asset



    A broadly positive week for the developed market equity indexes.  For the week the S&P gained +0.8% while the small-cap Russell 2000 was up +2.5%.   Only emerging equities lagged, losing -1.1%.  An upcoming meeting between the U.S. and Chinese leaders is leading to jitters about a possible trade conflict.  Chinese mainland equities lost -0.7% while Hong Kong stocks were down -1.9%.   Bond yields were unchanged and most bond asset classes did very…Continue reading >>

  Now this is something we haven’t see for a while – a marked underperformance in the S&P 500. For the week the S&P inched out a +0.2% gain versus +2% to +4% gains for the overseas markets. A weak dollar certainly helped turn the tide, as did growing confidence the Fed would not undermine the global economy in the months to come.   Bond yields fell and bond prices rallied right after Wednesday’s Fed…Continue reading >>

Europe and Japan performed well (+2.3% and +1.0% respectively) but emerging lost -0.7%.   The market story of the week was the pop higher in bond yields and the dollar. The yield on the 10-year added 17bps while the 2-year was also…Continue reading >>

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

WHY GEMMER
Since 1992, we have been providing high quality, unbiased investment management services to the local Bay Area community. From our very first day, our focus has been on supporting independent financial advisors and their clients through sound investment strategies, comprehensive back-office support and high levels of personalized service. We pride ourselves on the strength of the partnerships we have with advisors and, in turn, helping them partner successfully with their clients. 
 
When he decided to open the doors of the firm that bears his name, David Gemmer knew that it was virtually impossible for an advisor to become an expert in everything – portfolio management, estate planning, insurance, marketing, reporting, etc. – and also to give clients the attention they need and deserve. Gemmer’s model, therefore, was to provide a full suite of “outsourced” services for advisors, enabling them to focus on their own clients while growing their businesses. 
 
Back then, the concept of “outsourcing” asset management services was virtually unheard of. Today, an entire industry has evolved around this business. And as the industry has grown, so too has Gemmer. Today, as a wholly employee-owned firm, we are committed to working with our advisors to provide objective portfolio management and a level of customization not found anywhere else.
