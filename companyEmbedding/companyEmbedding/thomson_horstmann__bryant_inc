History
Investment Team
Client Service Team







1982
THB is founded and launches Small Cap Special Situations strategy


1997
THB becomes wholly owned subsidiary of United Asset Management 


1998
THB Micro Cap strategy launched


2010
THB becomes 100% employee-owned via management buyout


2014
THB Mid Cap strategy launched


2015
THB International Opportunities strategy launched



As we did in 1998 with the launch of one of the industry’s first US Micro Cap portfolios, we recently launched the THB International Opportunities strategy in anticipation of a similar opportunity for alpha generation vs larger cap stocks.  In order to provide a better long term understanding of the risk, return and alpha opportunity in this space, we’ve also created a custom benchmark – the THB International Opportunities Index.  We’re happy to share our analysis with you. 
In regard to the less capacity constrained strategies, THB is focused in terms of holdings (typically 60-80 in small cap and approximately 30 in mid cap portfolios) and exhibits a high active share.  As a natural extension of our smaller company expertise, THB launched a US Mid Cap strategy in February 2014.  Our expertise in micro and small cap provides a great base for the mid cap strategy as we’ve been analyzing and owning these managements and companies for decades ahead of their graduation to mid cap.
We have a robust due diligence process that encompasses all facets of risk including ESG factors. It was natural extension to our rigorous fundamental research process and 25 years of experience with SRI to become a signatory of the Principles for Responsible Investment Initiative (UNPRI) and the Montreal Carbon Pledge.
THB is employee-owned and we would greatly enjoy the opportunity to share our process and philosophy with you.




Since its inception, THB has been managed with a long-term focus and an understanding that we are partners with our clients. Our experienced portfolio management team is supported by a dedicated team of research analysts, traders, and administrative personnel.

Principal, Portfolio Manager





 1Q 2017  Newsletter 



Portfolio Objective
THB Micro Cap seeks long term capital appreciation over full market cycles by using a disciplined, valuation based approach. We invest primarily in companies within the Russell Microcap Index that we believe are trading below their intrinsic value and have superior operating metrics. We utilize a proprietary Quality Assessment and Risk Ranking during the research and portfolio construction processes. The product will typically hold 100-130 securities and have a high active share.
Investment Philosophy
 THB believes that stocks of Micro Cap companies are relatively inefficient, and that a focused portfolio of high quality names can offer superior risk-adjusted returns.
THB takes a very long term view of the investment horizon, and seeks to outperform over full market cycles by seeking out investment opportunities trading below their intrinsic value. We think like owners and look to invest alongside proven management teams with sound alignment to us as shareholders. We aim to construct a portfolio of high quality, self-funded, low risk companies with valuation metrics similar to or lower than the benchmark, yet with superior long term characteristics. We believe the best companies are able to grow their businesses organically and via acquisitions using internally generated cash flows. Debt should be kept to a minimum with a preference for companies who retire shares outstanding.
Approach
We have an active approach which utilizes quantitative and qualitative screening to help focus our fundamental analysis on companies that fit our desired profile. Our goal is to find stocks of companies that are trading below their intrinsic value and have superior operating metrics. We also utilize a proprietary Quality Assessment and Risk Ranking during the research and portfolio construction process which allows our investment team to more universally evaluate, compare, size, and manage risk.

Thomson Horstmann & Bryant, Inc. and Carolon Capital Launch a European UCITS Fund Focused on U.S. Micro and Small Cap Equities
JERSEY, Channel Islands – (11 October 2016) – Carolon Capital Ltd (“Carolon”) and Thomson Horstmann & Bryant, Inc. (“THB”) today announced the launch of a UCITS fund with an investment strategy focused on U.S. micro cap equities. The THB U.S. Opportunities UCITS Fund (the “Fund”) is a sub-fund of Carolon’s Dublin-based umbrella entity, Carolon Investment Funds plc.   Founded in 1982, THB is a boutique investment firm specializing in long-only micro, small and mid-cap U.S. equity strategies. THB has approximately $800 million in assets under management in the U.S. and Australia.   “We are proud to partner with THB in offering this highly specialized UCITS product,” commented Tim Smith, President of Carolon. “THB brings three decades of experience in the U.S. micro cap market, delivering superior returns above the benchmark since inception. We look forward to working with THB to expand its investor base into Europe and beyond through this UCITS offering.”   Carolon will serve as the Fund’s Distributor and Promoter. Through its relationships with institutional investors and its experience in building and advising on fund structures, Carolon brings a vast network and deep operational acumen to the Fund.   “Carolon’s unique UCITS model offers us a full suite of services to help us structure, launch and distribute our UCITS fund,” said Keith Dickinson, THB Principal and Portfolio Manager. “We have been looking for ways to expand and diversify our investor base and the UCITS model is a perfect opportunity for us to leverage and extend our deep experience in a micro cap strategy.”   The Fund will utilize a proprietary multi-factor quality assessment to review new opportunities, including management quality, financial strength, industry position and environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors. THB tracks carbon intensity, estimates portfolio revenue exposure to both positive and negative factors and continuously reviews company ESG ratings. THB is a signatory of the Principle for Responsible Investment and the Montreal Carbon Pledge.   To access additional investor information, click here to access the Carolon website.
