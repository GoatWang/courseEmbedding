Confirmed Complaints: the number of confirmed complaints closed 
	against the company for the line of insurance and year indicated. 
	A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating that a company 
  committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal requirement
  the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an insurance policy or
  certificate.  A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, 
  considered together, suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid
  reason for the complaint.

Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, 
	is the number of closed confirmed complaints divided by 
	the number of policies the company had in force for 
	the line of insurance and year indicated. 

Complaint Index: indicates how a company's ratio of 
	the number of complaints to the number of policyholders 
	compares to the average for all insurers. 
	The index is calculated by dividing the company's percentage of 
	complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's 
	percentage of the policies in force for the same line of insurance. 
	The average index is 1.00. A number less than 1 indicates 
	fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates 
	more complaints than average. For the most recent completed year, 
	a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy count data is 
	received by TDI. This will affect each insurer's percentage of the total. 

Complaints against an insurance company are not part of 
	the complaint tally above if the insurance company served 
	only as a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a company hired 
	simply to administer the paperwork of a health plan. 
	Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the 
	insurance company or HMO that hired the TPA. 
	If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, 
	no complaint numbers are recorded as a part of the company/TPA's profile. 
	Neither are profiles available for self-insured plans, 
	as such plans are regulated under federal law.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.
