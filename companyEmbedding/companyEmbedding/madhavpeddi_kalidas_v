The firm operates its business through five segments: Pinto Valley, Cozamin, Minto, Santo Domingo and Other.

                    Trilogy Metals, Inc. is an exploration stage company, which engages in the development and exploration of mineral properties. The company was founded on April 27, 2011 and is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada.                  




Independent Director

                    2007 - Current                  


Novagold Resources Inc.

                    NovaGold Resources Inc. (NYSE-AMEX, TSX: NG) capped a successful year of achieving key milestones at all of its projects by announcing a strategic plan to unlock the value of its world-class suite of mining development and exploration assets.

The Company is focused on permitting and developing its 50%-owned flagship property, Donlin Gold, one of the world's largest known undeveloped gold deposits. NovaGold is also committed to maximizing value of its non-core assets and is currently exploring opportunities to sell its interest in the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in British Columbia, Canada. Its interest in NovaCopper Inc., which held its interest in the Ambler District, also known as the Upper Kobuk Mineral Project, was spun out to shareholders of NovaGold on April 30, 2012.

As envisioned, NovaGold is now a well-financed, jurisdictionally secure Company well on its way of becoming a pure gold play exclusively focused on the advancement of Donlin Gold.

Donlin Gold, which is equally and jointly held with Barrick Gold Corporation — the world's largest gold company — is a uniquely attractive asset. In terms of the combined size, grade, exploration potential, production profile and jurisdiction, it is quite possibly the most important gold development project in the world today. Donlin Gold has approximately 39 million ounces of gold mineral resources, inclusive of mineral reserves (541 million tonnes at 2.24 g/t), not including an additional approximately six million ounces of inferred mineral resources (92 million tonnes at 2.0 g/t) with tremendous growth opportunities.¹

These numbers already place Donlin Gold well within the top 1% of known global gold deposits in terms of size. Yet, more potential exists. With the current mineral estimates from along just two miles of a well-established mineralized corridor that is five miles long, the site will undoubtedly yield further discoveries. Once in production, Donlin Gold should be the largest gold mine among seven major producing mines in Alaska.

NovaGold is well-financed with a cash balance of approximately US$350 million, which is sufficient to take Donlin Gold through permitting. Management has expertise in permitting, mine development, and operations and a track record for delivering projects on time and on budget.

Committed to responsible development and operating to the highest environmental standards, we act with a long-term view, creating mutually beneficial relationships with our communities, employees, investors, partners and other people critical to our success and the economic development of Alaska
