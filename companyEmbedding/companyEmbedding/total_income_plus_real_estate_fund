Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund (TIPRX, TIPPX, TIPWX)

Multi.
Total Income+ Real Estate Fund:
Diversifying through a multi-manager, multi-strategy, and multi-sector investment approach.









The Bluerock Total Income+ Real Estate Fund (the “Fund”) is a public fund utilizing a multi-manager, multi-strategy, and multi-sector approach. The Fund allows individuals to invest in private, institutional real estate securities alongside some of the nation’s largest endowment and pension plans. The Total Income+ Real Estate Fund is a continuously offered, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that is operated as an interval fund.
Potential Investment Benefits:

Income
Primarily derived from investing in income producing institutional real estate investment funds.
Portfolio Diversification
To seek a combination of current income, capital preservation and long-term capital appreciation, the Fund’s portfolio is intended to be widely diversified by manager, strategy, property sector and geography. The Fund intends to pursue an 80% private/20% public real estate allocation.
Daily Net Asset Value (NAV)
The Fund’s NAV is calculated and published each day after the close of the New York Stock Exchange.
Liquidity
The Fund’s interval structure allows for the redemption at NAV of a stated portion of outstanding shares each quarter.
Capital Appreciation
Sought through the selection of investments that provide the opportunity to achieve long-term growth with low to moderate volatility.
Low Correlation
The Fund strategically invests in a combination of institutional, private and publicly traded real estate investments that may be lower correlated to the broader equity and fixed income markets.
Low Volatility
The Fund primarily invests in institutional private equity real estate which has historically experienced less volatility than the broader markets.
This is an actively managed dynamic portfolio. There is no guarantee that any investment (or this investment) will achieve its objectives, goals, generate positive returns, or avoid losses.






Access.
Total Income+ Real Estate Fund:
Access to top institutional fund managers.








Asset Allocation
Decades ago, portfolio construction was simply a matter of allocating to stocks and bonds. Today, portfolio construction suggets a need for additional types of investments often referred to as "alternatives," including assets such as real estate, and many others.




            Learn More:Asset Allocation





Institutional Private Equity Real Estate (iPERE)
Institutional private equity real estate (iPERE) can be described as high-quality commercial properties that are usually congregated in large investment portfolios managed professionally on behalf of third-party owners or beneficiaries.
Since the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) began measuring iPERE in 1978, only four years have experienced negative returns. NPI tends to perform much like the traded REIT sector over long periods of time only with much less volatility.




           Institutional Private EquityReal Estate (iPERE)





Our Strategy
Adding real estate to a traditional investment portfolio of stocks, bonds, and treasury bills introduces a historically non-correlated asset that may reduce risk and enhance overall return. The Fund provides access to a diversified holding of large, private, real estate securities typically available only to institutions (and without the large minimum investment and long holding period normally required).

Bluerock launches Total Income+ Real Estate Fund

Articles and Features











Investment firm Bluerock has launched the Total Income+ Real Estate Fund, a public fund of funds, that provides individual investors with an opportunity to invest alongside endowments and pension plans in leading institutional real estate managers otherwise inaccessible to them due to large minimum investment size or other restrictions.
Mercer Investment Management, Inc., a top-ranked global investment manager selection specialist, will serve as sub-advisor on the TI+ Fund under an exclusive long-term agreement with Bluerock. Mercer is a top-ranked advisor to sovereign wealth funds, pension plans, banks, family offices, insurance companies, endowments and foundations globally, and has over USD6.6 trillion in assets under advisement.
Access, says Dr Randy Anderson, Bluerock President and TI+ Portfolio Manager, is perhaps the most compelling attribute of the fund. “TI+ provides access to a carefully-vetted real estate portfolio whose objective is multi-strategy, multi-manager, and multi-sector.” he says. “Absent TI+, an individual investor seeking to access to the same managers and investments and build the same portfolio would require a USD50 - USD100 million investment. With TI+ an individual can access that investment portfolio for a USD2,500 minimum.”
“Additionally, TI+ provides individual investors the ability to invest like large pension and sovereign wealth funds using the ‘Endowment Model,’ popularised by the regularly top performing Yale Investment Office which attempts to capture the premium associated with private assets, while providing liquidity to the investor through quarterly redemptions at NAV,’ says Randy Anderson, TI+ Portfolio Manager.
Mercer and Bluerock will seek to invest in a select group of institutional funds that meet the primary TI+ investment criteria: stable current income plus capital appreciation, low volatility, and low correlation to the broader equity markets. Decision-making begins with Mercer’s proprietary screening process, which incorporates rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments of fund management teams and their track records, in a process not generally available at the individual investor level. In addition, the partnership with Mercer provides an opportunity to invest at a much lower threshold.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

	Asset Allocator
TI+ » Asset Allocator








Decades ago, portfolio construction was simply a matter of allocating to stocks and bonds. 
            
            Today, portfolio construction suggets a need for additional types of investments often referred to as "alternatives," including assets such as real estate, and many others. 
            
            Despite what their name may imply, alternative investments are increasingly less of an alternate and more a mainstream option for many investors seeking to expand their reach beyond traditional asset classes. Use the slider below to adjust assets and see how adding public and private real estate can affect a portfolio compared to traditional asset allocation.
            

Public and Private Real Estate Assets are rebalanced after each year. The results shown are a hypothetical representation based on the variable input values chosen. The information provided is for informational purposes only and does not represent that of the Total Income+ Real Estate Fund. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
            The indices shown are for informational purposes only and are not reflective of any investment. As it is not possible to invest in the indices, the data shown does not reflect or compare features of an actual investment, such as its objectives, costs and expenses, liquidity, safety, guarantees or insurance, fluctuation of principal or return, or tax features. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.
Stocks (S&P 500): An index of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity and industry grouping, among other factors. The S&P 500 is designed to be a leading indicator of U.S. equities and is meant to reflect the risk/return characteristics of the large cap universe (Investopedia). Risks include the dynamic fluctuations of the market and possible loss of principal.
Bonds: Federal Reserve of St. Louis 10-year yields, represents medium term fixed income yields.
Private Real Estate (The NPI Property Index): a quarterly time series composite total rate of return measure of investment performance of a very large pool of individual commercial real estate properties acquired in the private market for investment purposes only. All properties in the NPI have been acquired, at least in part, on behalf of tax-exempt institutional investors – the great majority being pension funds. As such, all properties are held in a fiduciary environment.
NAREIT All Equity Return: The FTSE NAREIT US Real Estate Index Series is designed to present investors with a comprehensive family of REIT performance indexes that span the commercial real estate space across the US economy, offering exposure to all investment and property sectors. The FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs index contains all tax-qualified REITs with more than 50 percent of total assets in qualifying real estate assets other than mortgages secured by real property that also meet minimum size and liquidity criteria.

Objective

            Seeks maximum real return, consistent with prudent investment management
        
Primary Portfolio

            Real estate-linked derivatives backed by a portfolio of inflation indexed and other fixed income securities
        



























Overview






Fund Overview
Capture the inflation-hedging potential of real estate
Harnessing PIMCO’s innovative Double Real® approach, the fund seeks to capture the performance potential of a broad real estate investment trust (REIT) index backed by a collateral portfolio of Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).
Why Invest In This Fund
A Double Real inflation hedge 
The fund seeks to capture the performance potential of real estate through derivative exposure to the broad-based Dow Jones U.S. Select Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Index. This exposure is collateralized with a portfolio of TIPS that provide additional return and inflation hedging potential.
Diversification potential
Real estate has a low correlation, or tendency not to move in lockstep, with stock and bond returns. This gives real estate the potential to enhance returns and lower risk in a diversified investment portfolio. Of course, diversification cannot guarantee a profit or protect against loss.
Combined expertise
The fund combines the benefits of real estate as an asset class with the industry leading experience of PIMCO as an active manager of real estate-linked derivatives and TIPS collateral.
Our Expertise
The strategy is managed by veteran real return investors Mihir Worah, CIO Real Return and Asset Allocation and head of the real return and multi-asset portfolio management teams, Nicholas Johnson and Jeremie Banet. PIMCO, a leading global manager in inflation-related assets, launched its first enhanced index strategy more than two decades ago and its first real estate-linked strategy in 2002 


PRIMARY BENCHMARK
Dow Jones U.S. Select REIT Total Return Index
PRIMARY BENCHMARK DESCRIPTION
The Dow Jones U.S. Select Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) Total Return Index is a subset of the Dow Jones Americas Select Real Estate Securities Index (RESI) and includes only REITs and REIT-like securities. The objective of the index is to measure the performance of publicly traded real estate securities. The indexes are designed to serve as proxies for direct real estate investment, in part by excluding companies whose performance may be driven by factors other than the value of real estate. It is not possible to invest directly in the index. Prior to April 1st, 2009, this index was named Dow Jones Wilshire REIT Total Return Index.

Disclosures 




Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results.

A word about risk: Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market, interest-rate, issuer, credit, and inflation risk; investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. The value of most bond funds and fixed income securities are impacted by changes in interest rates.Bonds and bond funds with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and more volatile than securities with shorter durations;bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations,and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High-yield,lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investments in value securities involve the risk the market's value assessment may differ from the manager and the performance of the securities may decline. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous.

Yields & Distributions Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
1The distribution yield for monthly paying Funds is calculated by annualizing actual dividends distributed for the monthly period ended on the date shown and dividing by the net asset value on the last business day for the same period. The distribution yield for quarterly paying Funds is calculated by taking the average of the prior four quarterly distribution yields. The quarterly distribution yields are calculated by annualizing actual dividends distributed for the quarterly period ended on the most recent quarterly distribution date and dividing by the net asset value for the same date. The distribution yield for annual paying Funds is calculated by taking the annual distribution divided by the Fund’s net asset value on ex-date. The yield is annualized if the Fund incepted less than a year ago.   The yield does not include long- or short-term capital gains distributions.
2The 30-Day SEC yield is an annualized yield based on the most recent 30 day period.
3Data does not include special cash dividends.
4Data is based on distributions since the most recent calendar year end and does not include special cash dividends.

             The SEC yield is an annualized yield based on the most recent 30 day period. The fund’s yield quotation includes an adjustment to the principal value of the TIPS securities to reflect changes in the government’s official inflation rate, if any; changes in the government’s official inflation rate can cause the fund’s yield to vary substantially from one month to the next. At times, including during periods of deflation, the SEC yield calculation may result in a negative number. If the current 30-day SEC yield is denoted with a “‡,” we believe it is attributable to a rise in the inflation rate, and might not be repeated.
Due to the consolidation of operations and permanence of the fund’s fee waivers, such waivers do not materially affect the fund’s SEC yield.
        

             Unless stated, the Fund does not have an unsubsidized yield.

High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

Market NAV as of 






Market-Based NAV (Per Share): The Market-Based NAV is the net asset value per share, calculated using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) rounded to the fourth decimal place.  The Market-Based NAV is not indicative of future Market-Based NAVs or the future performance of any of the Funds and classes set forth above. The Market-Based NAV may change daily and may deviate from $1.0000 even when financial markets are stable. Although the Market-Based NAV is intended to reflect the price at which a Fund's securities could be sold, the actual sales price could be more or less.


Money Market funds are not insured or guaranteed by FDIC or any other government agency and although such funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in Money Market funds.

             Performance figures presented reflect the total return performance after fees and reflect changes in share price and reinvestment of dividend and capital gain distributions on the payable date. All periods longer than one year are annualized.
        

             Total return performance does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares. The minimum initial investment for Institutional class shares is $1 million; however, it may be modified for certain financial intermediaries who submit trades on behalf of eligible investors.
        

             Daily YTD return is from the most recent calendar year end.
        

             Growth of $10,000 is calculated at NAV and assumes that all dividend and capital gain distributions were reinvested. It does not take into account sales charges or the effect of taxes. Results are not indicative of future performance.
        

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is a weighted average of the performance figures for its 3-, 5- and 10-yr (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar, Inc.® 2017. All rights reserved. The information contained herein; (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its affiliates; (2) may not be copied or distributed; (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Portfolio Composition Footnotes & Disclosures


disclosures
5The Sharpe Ratio measures the risk-adjusted performance. The risk-free rate is subtracted from the rate of return for a portfolio and the result is divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio returns.
6The information ratio is defined as the portfolio's excess return per unit of risk, or tracking error. For example, an information ratio of 1 means that a portfolio manager generates 100 basis points, or one percent of excess return for every 100 basis points of risk taken.
7Tracking error, a measure of risk, is defined as the standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return vs. the benchmark expressed in percent.

             Portfolio information in the charts is based on the fund's net assets. These percentages may differ from those used for the fund's compliance calculations, including the fund's prospectus, regulatory, and other investment limitations and policies, which may be based on total assets of the fund or other measurements, may include or exclude various categories of investments from those covered in the portfolio allocation categories shown in this report, and may be based on different classifications and measurements of the fund’s investments and other criteria.
        

             References to specific sectors, securities or issuers are for illustrative purposes only. All holdings are subject to change daily. All share classes have the same portfolio but different expenses.
        

             Duration is a measure of a portfolio’s price sensitivity expressed in years. Effective duration is the duration for a bond with an embedded option when the value is calculated to include the expected change in cash flow caused by the option as interest rates change.
        

             Index exposure may not equal 100% due to market value changes in the derivatives and overall portfolio.

Disclosures 




Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


             Double Real refers to a strategy that looks to provide exposure to two asset classes (real estate and TIPS) that have historically had a positive correlation to inflation.


A word about risk:

 
Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Inflation-linked bonds (ILBs) issued by a government are fixed-income securities whose principal value is periodically adjusted according to the rate of inflation; ILBs decline in value when real interest rates rise. Sovereign securities are generally backed by the issuing government, obligations of U.S. Government agencies and authorities are supported by varying degrees but are generally not backed by the full faith of the U.S. Government; portfolios that invest in such securities are not guaranteed and will fluctuate in value. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. REITs are subject to risk, such as poor performance by the manager, adverse changes to tax laws or failure to qualify for tax-free pass-through of income. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Diversification does not ensure against loss.

        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.
