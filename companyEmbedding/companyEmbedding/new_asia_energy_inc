Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors…
























 
































HOME


























How This New Fuel Source Is Set to Create Billions in New Wealth for Investors… 

By MONEY MORNING STAFF REPORTSIt can light and heat your home…
Run factories…
Propel space ships…
It can even power the ENTIRE U.S. electrical grid…
Even tech giants like Google are getting in early to related technologies – they’ve invested $1.8 billion into solar and wind power systems that simply will not work when it’s cloudy or not windy…
 
That is, without the use of this fuel.
And Apple is investing nearly $1 billion in the same thing!
Everywhere you look, America’s biggest companies are investing in systems that will be compatible with this fuel including:

Facebook
Amazon
AT&T
General Motors
Costco
Target

The list goes on.
But to truly reap the benefits and rewards of investing in OBL, you must act quickly to stake your claim before the mainstream media blows this story open and ordinary investors become privy to this opportunity. 
Historically, those who invested early in new energy sources made fortunes that allowed them total financial freedom.
Looking back, according to our estimates…

A $100 investment in Standard Oil would now be worth $153,285…
A $1,000 investment would be worth $1.5 million…
A $10,000 investment would be worth $15.3 million…

We are talking about staggering generational wealth, the kind that could make your family mega-rich today – and keep it that way 100 years from now.
And it all starts with ONE COMPANY at the heart of this massive shift.
Even if you only start with a few dollars, that’s fine. As you saw, even a thousand bucks could make you a fortune.
With an opportunity like this – pure ground floor – it doesn’t always matter how much you put in… what matters is that you get in early.
