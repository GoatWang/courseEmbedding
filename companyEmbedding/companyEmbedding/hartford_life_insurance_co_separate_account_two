	Information Regarding

	following:




	 




	The required minimum
	distribution (RMD) amount for each year is determined generally by dividing the
	account balance by the applicable life expectancy.  This account balance is generally based upon
	the account value as of the close of business on the last day of the previous
	calendar year.  The RMD rules also
	contain a minimum benefit rule which may require a larger annual RMD
	amount, particularly when distributions are made over the joint lives of the
	Owner and an individual other than his or her spouse.  RMDs also can be made in the form of annuity
	payments that satisfy the rules set forth in regulations under the Code
	relating to RMDs, including incidental benefit restrictions.

Group Retiree Health Insurance | The Hartford




















































Group Retiree Health Insurance



















Home
 Employee Benefits
Group Retiree Health

















	Reduce your risk, not their coverage.


Baby boomers are retiring at record levels, which means companies that offer retiree health insurance are at greater risk, especially those that self-fund their plan. The Hartford can help. For over 25 years, we’ve offered flexible group retiree health insurance solutions that shift the risk away from employers while providing flexible solutions to meet the unique needs of their retirees.
 

Retiree health coverage makes sense.
In today’s economy, medical inflation is putting great pressure on retirees and the medical plans they rely on. As administrative resources continue to shrink, the retirement population is expanding. Fortunately, The Hartford’s Group Retiree Insurance Plan is a solution that can work for employers and their retirees.
 

Be good to your retirees and your budget.
Our Group Retiree Insurance Plan helps employers accomplish 3 key goals:
 


		Fulfills an important obligation to retirees.

		Integrates with Medicare, taking advantage of Medicare's cost-containment measures.

		Takes retirees out of the active employee medical plan, which can improve the efficiency of the employee plan.
		 





We’ll help integrate your plan with Medicare.
The Hartford's fully insured Group Retiree Health Insurance Plan can help pay Medicare-eligible deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket medical expenses not covered by Medicare. This helps relieve companies of the retirement benefit burden and may even lower their costs. Here are some other benefits employers can expect from The Hartford:
 


		We can support multiple group sizes, from as few as two to thousands and can customize plans for groups of 100 or more.

		Retirees, their spouses, widow(er)s, and domestic partners age 65+ who are entitled to Medicare are all eligible and coverage is guaranteed (subject to any applicable pre-existing condition limitation).

		We can help employers better control overall costs by segmenting age 65+ retirees into our voluntary and non-contributory plans.

		Rx Prescription Drug Plans can be accessed through separate providers with the ability to combine billing with medical.

		Employers can choose from a variety of prescription drug plan options to best suit the needs of their retirees.

		Retirees have access to any provider or hospital nationwide – at home or away. (There are no medical networks to worry about.)

		Our plan integrates with Medicare Parts A and B. Medicare pays first; our group plan pays second.
		 


Your employees will love these optional enhancements.
Offer custom fit coverage to your employees with these great enhancements1:
 
Hearing – Provides:
 


		One routine hearing and balance exam every 12 months.

		Two hearing aids every three years.

		One hearing aid fitting evaluation every three years.

		Flexible plan design options with various calendar year maximums and deductibles.

 
Vision – Provides:
 


		One routine vision exam every 12 months.

		One pair of glasses every 12 months, or a 12 month supply of contact lenses.

		Flexible plan design options with various calendar year maximums and deductibles.


 

Annual Physical – Provides:
 


		Review of medical history.

		Check of memory and mental quickness.

		Check of blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and temperature.

		Examination of the heart, lungs, head and neck, abdominal, neurological, and dermatological areas.

		Laboratory testing for a complete blood count, chemistry panel, and lipid panel.



Add great coverage enhancements not typically covered by Medicare1:


Acupuncture

Acupuncture has been known to treat conditions such as anxiety, arthritis, chronic pain, stress and more.  Although Medicare doesn’t cover these types of services, our Group Retiree Health Plan gives retirees access to this traditional practice.
 


Chiropractic

Chiropractic care focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system and is used most often to treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including but not limited to back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. Although Medicare doesn’t cover chiropractic services, your Group Retiree Health Plan can. 
 

Making it easier to administer.
Why shoulder the administrative burden when it can be offloaded to The Hartford's approved third-party administrators? Our services help ensure employers receive the best administration support:
 


		A choice of billing options including list, direct or a combination, with the ability to manage all types of vesting schedules.

		A variety of enrollment options to meet employer needs.

		Electronic claims processing and payment.

		A toll-free customer service number for retirees, employers and providers.

		Online capabilities to support inquiries about benefits and claims.

		Customer service representatives trained in senior care relations.

		HIPAA compliant administration.

 

Flexible alternatives for outpatient Rx.
Medicare participants now have access to prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D. This allows for more cost-saving options through Medicare programs. The Hartford offers a flexible alternative to include prescription drug coverage through our partnership with a leading Medicare Part D carrier. Some of the benefits of this approach include:
 


		Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) solutions using CMS-approved group products.

		One plan to cover all of an employer’s retirees located in the United States.

		Access to pharmacies across the country, and coverage under a broad formulary for retirees.

		Combined billing with our medical plans – a simplified approach provided by The Hartford.



	We support a wide demographic of eligible enrollees.
We extend our coverage to one of the broadest demographics in the insurance industry. These are some of the many groups that we cover:
 


		Retirees plus their spouses, widow(er)s, and domestic partners who are 65+ and entitled to Medicare

		Corporations

		Partnerships

		Individual employers

		Labor unions

		Religious organizations

		Multiple Employer Trusts (MET)

		Most government agencies or departments

 
Customized plans are available for groups of 100 or more.
 
 

The Hartford® is The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including issuing companies Hartford Life Insurance Company and Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company. Home Office is Hartford, CT.”

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549-0102 (telephone (202) 942-8090).
Applicants' Representations
1. Hartford Life is a stock life insurance company engaged in the business of writing life insurance and annuities, both individual and group, in all states and the District of Columbia. Hartford Life is ultimately controlled by Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Hartford Life is the depositor and sponsor of HL Account Two, HL Account Seven and the Putnam Account.
2. Hartford L&A is a stock life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group life insurance and annuity contracts in the District of Columbia and all states but New York. Hartford L&A  is ultimately controlled by Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Hartford L&A is the depositor and sponsor of HLA Account One, HLA Account Seven and Putnam Account Two.
3. Each Account was established either by Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  as a separate account and is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust on Form N-4. Each Account is divided into a number of subaccounts that invest exclusively in shares representing an interest in a separate corresponding investment portfolio (each, a “Portfolio”) of one of several series-type open-end management investment companies. The assets of each Account support several varieties of variable annuity contracts, including the Contracts.
4. HSDCI is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford Life. It serves as the principal underwriter of a number of Hartford Life and Hartford L&A separate accounts registered as unit investment trusts under the Act, including the Accounts, and is the distributor of the variable life insurance contracts and variable annuity contracts issued through such separate accounts, including the Contracts. HSDCI is registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is a member of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the “NASD”). In addition, each Future Underwriter will be registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the NASD.
5. The Contracts are flexible premium variable annuity contracts that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  may issue to individuals or groups on a “non-qualified” basis or in connection with employee benefit plans that receive favorable federal income tax treatment under Sections 401, 403(b), 408, 408A or 457 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Contracts make available a number of subaccounts of an Account to which owners may allocate net premium payments and associated credits and to which owners may transfer contract value. The Contracts also offer fixed-interest allocation options under which Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  credits guaranteed rates of interest for periods of one year or more. Transfers of contract value among and between the subaccounts and, subject to certain restrictions, among and between the subaccounts and the fixed-interest options, may be made at any time. The Contracts offer a variety of fixed and variable annuity payment options to owners. In the event of an owner's or annuitant's death prior to the annuity Start Printed Page 56349commencement date, beneficiaries may elect to receive death benefits in the form of one of the annuity payment options instead of a lump sum.
6. The Contracts generally may only be purchased with a minimum initial premium of $10,000. Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  may deduct a premium tax charge from premium payments in certain states, but otherwise deducts a charge for premium taxes upon surrender or annuitization of the Contract or upon the payment of a death benefit, depending upon the jurisdiction. The Contracts provide for an annual contract maintenance fee of $30 that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  deducts on each Contract Anniversary and upon a full surrender of a Contract, a daily administrative charge deducted from the assets of each Account at an annual rate of up to 0.15% of such Accounts' average daily net assets and a daily mortality and expense risk charge deducted from the assets of each Account at annual rates ranging from 1.45% to 1.60% of such  Accounts' average daily net assets. The Contracts also provide for a charge of $25 for each transfer of contract value in excess of 12 per contract year. An optional death benefit rider is available with the Contracts. If purchased, the charge for the optional death benefit is 0.15% of the applicable Account's average daily net assets.
7. The Contracts have a surrender charge in the form of a contingent deferred sales charge (“CDSC”). The CDSC is equal to the percentage of each premium payment surrendered or withdrawn as specified in the table below. The CDSC is separately calculated and applied to each premium payment at any time that the payment (or part of the payment) is surrendered or withdrawn. The CDSC applicable to each premium payment diminishes as the payment ages beyond four years. No CDSC applies to contract value representing an annual withdrawal amount or to contract value in excess of aggregate premium payments (less prior withdrawals of premium payments) (“earnings”).
Number of years since payment of each premiumCharge  (In percent)18.028.038.048.057.066.075.08 and over0.0
During the first seven contract years, the CDSC is calculated using the assumption that contract value is withdrawn in the following order: (1) The annual withdrawal amount for that contract year, (2) premium payments, (3) bonus credits (explained below), and (4) earnings. Starting in the eighth contract year, the CDSC is calculated using the assumption that contract value is withdrawn in the following order: (1) The annual withdrawal amount for that contract year, (2) earnings, (3) premium payments no longer subject to a CDSC, (4) bonus credits on premium payments no longer subject to a CDSC, (5) premium payments still subject to a CDSC, and (6) bonus credits on premium payments still subject to a CDSC. In all contract years, the CDSC is calculated using the assumption that premium payments are withdrawn on a first-in, first-out basis. The annual withdrawal amount is 10% of premium payments still subject to a CDSC measured at the time of withdrawal.
8. If an owner or annuitant dies before the annuity commencement date, the Contracts provide, under most circumstances, for a death benefit payable to a beneficiary. The death benefit is the greatest of (1), (2) or (3) (or (4), if the optional death benefit rider is purchased), computed as of the date that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  receives proof of death, where:
(1) Contract value reduced by the amount of any bonus credit applied during the twelve months prior to the date of computation;
(2) Total premiums payments reduced by the amount of all withdrawals of contact value;
(3) The maximum anniversary value (as defined in the Contract), reduced by the amount of any bonus credits applied during the twelve months prior to the date of computation; or
(4) Interest accumulation value (as defined in the Contract).
9. The Contracts include a bonus payment provision pursuant to which Hartford Life or Hartford L&A  credits an owner's contract value with an additional amount when a net premium payment is applied. The amount of the bonus payment is a percentage of each premium payment made by the owner. The percentage is a function of premiums received under a Contract, as shown in the following table.
Aggregate premiumsCredit  (in percent)From $10,000 to $49,9993.0$50,000 or more4.0
If a premium payment raises the amount of aggregate payments above $49,999, then Hartford Life or Hartford L&A will add another bonus credit to the owner's contract value in an amount equal to 1% of the prior premium payments.
10. Hartford Life or Hartford L&A recaptures or retains the credited amount in the event that the owner exercises his or her cancellation right during the right to examine period. In addition the owner elects to annuitize the Contract, the amount applied to purchase any annuity payment option is the contract value less bonus credits applied during the twenty-four months prior to annuitization. Also, as indicated above, in computing death benefits, Hartford Life or Hartford L&A may “recapture” bonus credits applied within twelve months prior to the date as of which the death benefit is computed. Finally, in the event of a surrender or withdrawal of contract value where the surrender charge is waived due to the owner's or annuitant's confinement to a hospital, nursing home or other long-term care facility (as defined in the Contract), Hartford Life or Hartford L&A will “recapture” all bonus credits applied during the period of confinement (a “confinement period”).
11. As a result of the recapture provisions, increases in the value of accumulation units representing bonus credits accrue to the owner immediately, but the initial value of such units only belongs to the owner when, or to the extent that, the recapture period for the bonus payment expires and the units vest. On the other hand, decreases in the value of accumulation units representing bonus credits do not diminish the dollar amount of contract value subject to recapture. Therefore, additional units must become subject to recapture as their value decreases and the proportionate share of any owner's variable contract value (or the owner's interest in an Account) that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A can “recapture” increases as variable contract value (or the owner's interest in an Account) decreases. This dilutes the owner's interest in the Account vis-a-vis Hartford Life or Hartford L&A and in his or her variable contract value vis-a-vis Hartford Life or Hartford L&A.
12. Because it is not administratively feasible to track the value of bonus credits in an Account that have not vested, Hartford Life or Hartford L&A deducts the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge from the entire net asset value of the Accounts. As a result, the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge paid by any owner is greater than that which he Start Printed Page 56350or she would pay without the bonus credit.
13. Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act, exempting them as well as Future Accounts and Future Underwriters from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the recapture of certain credits applied to premium payments made in consideration of the Contracts and Future Contracts.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Subsection (i) of section 27 provides that section 27 does not apply to any registered separate account supporting variable annuity contracts, or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account, except as provided in paragraph (2) of subsection (i). Paragraph (2) provides that it shall be unlawful for a registered separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a variable annuity contract supported by the separate account unless, among other things, the contract is a redeemable security. Section 2(a)(32) defines a “redeemable security” as any security, other than short-term paper, under the terms of which the holder, upon presentation to the issuer, is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuer's current net assets, or the cash equivalent thereof.
2. Section 22(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of, and dealers in, the redeemable securities of any registered investment company. Rule 22c-1 thereunder imposes requirements with respect to both the amount payable on redemption of a redeemable security and the time as of which such amount is calculated. Specifically, Rule 22c-1, in pertinent part, prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security, a person designated in such issuer's prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security, and a principal underwriter of, or dealer in, such security from selling, redeeming or repurchasing any such security, except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption, or of an order to purchase or sell such security.
3. Section 6(c) of the Act authorizes the Commission to exempt any person, security, or transaction or any class of persons, securities, or transactions from any provision or provisions of the Act and/or any rule under it if, and to the extent that, such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
4. Applicants assert that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act.
5. Applicants assert that the recapture of bonus credits would not, at any time, deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the current net assets of an Account. Until the appropriate recapture period expires, Hartford Life or Hartford L&A retains the right to and interest in each owner's contract value representing the dollar amount of any unvested bonus credits. Therefore, if Hartford Life or Hartford L&A recaptures any bonus credit or part of a bonus credit in the circumstances described above, it would merely be retrieving its own assets. Hartford Life or Hartford L&A would grant bonus credits out of its general account assets and the amount of the credits (although not the earnings on such amounts) would remain Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's until such amounts vest with the owner. Thus, to the extent that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A may grant and recapture bonus credits in connection with variable contract value, it would not, at either time, deprive any owner of his or her then proportionate share of an Account's assets.
6. Applicants state that the nature of the bonus recapture provisions as they apply to variable contract value dictate that an owner will obtain a benefit from a bonus credit in a rising market because any earnings on the bonus credit amount will vest immediately and over time cause the owner's share of both the Contract's variable contract value and an Account's net assets to be greater on a relative basis than it would have been without the bonus credit. Conversely, in a falling market an owner will suffer a detriment from a bonus credit because losses on the bonus credit amount also will “vest” immediately and cause the owner's share of both the Contract's variable contract value and the Account's net assets to decrease on a relative basis.
7. Applicants do not believe that the dynamics of Hartford Life's and Hartford L&A's proposed bonus credit provisions violate sections 2(a)(32) or 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act. Nonetheless, in order to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, Applicants seek exemptions from these two sections.
8. Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's recapture of any bonus credit could be viewed as the redemption of such an interest at a price other than net asset value. If such is the case, then the bonus credit provisions could be viewed as conflicting with section 22(c) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. Applicants believe that the recapture of the bonus credits does not violate section 22(c) of the Act or Rule 22c-1 thereunder. Nonetheless, in order to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the Act, Applicants seek exemptions from section 22(c) and Rule 22c-1.
9. Applicants argue that the bonus credit recapture provisions do not give rise to the evils that Rule 22c-1 was designated to address. The Rule was intended to eliminate or reduce, as far as was reasonably practicable, the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their redemption at a price above net asset value, or other unfair results, including speculative trading practices. The evils prompting the adoption of Rule 22c-1 were primarily the result of backward pricing, the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day. Backward pricing permitted certain investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price, thereby diluting the values of outstanding shares. The proposed bonus credit recapture provisions pose no such threat of dilution.
10. Recaptures of bonus credits result in a redemption of Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's interest in an owner's contract value or in an Account at a price determined on the basis of the Account's current net asset value and not at an inflated price. Moreover, Applicants represent that the amount recaptured will always equal the amount that Hartford Life or Hartford L&A paid from its general account for the credits. Similarly, although owners are entitled to retain any investment gains attributable to the bonus credits, the amount of such gains would always be computed at a price determined on the basis of net asset value.
11. Applicants assert that even if the proposed bonus credit provisions conflict with sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) or 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act or Rule 22c-1 thereunder, the Commission should grant the exemptions because the bonus credit provisions are generally favorable for prospective owners. The bonus credits are beneficial to prospective Start Printed Page 56351owners. The recapture provisions do not, on balance, diminish the overall value of the bonus credit provisions and are fully disclosed in the prospectus for the Contracts.
12. Applicants assert that the bonus credit recapture provisions are necessary if Hartford Life or Hartford L&A are to offer the bonus credits. it would be unfair to Hartford Life or Hartford L&A to permit owners to keep their bonus credits upon their exercise of the Contracts' right to examine provision. Because no CDSC applies to the exercise of the right to examine provision, the owner could obtain a quick profit in the amount of the bonus credit at Hartford Life's or Hartford L&A's expense by exercising that right. Likewise, because no additional CDSC applies upon death of an owner or annuitant or upon annuitization, and no CDSC applies during a confinement period, such a death, annuitization or confinement period surrender or withdrawal shortly after the award of bonus credits would afford an owner or a beneficiary a similar profit. In the event of such profits to owners or beneficiaries, Hartford Life and Hartford L&A could not recover the cost of granting the bonus credits. This is because Hartford Life and Hartford L&A both intend to recoup the costs of providing the bonus credits through the charges under the Contract, particularly the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge. If the profits described above are permitted, certain owners could take advantage of them, greatly reducing the base from which the daily charges are deducted and greatly increasing the amount of bonus credits that Hartford Life and Hartford L&A must provide. Therefore, the recapture provisions are the price of offering the bonus credits. Hartford Life and Hartford Life and Hartford L&A simply cannot offer the proposed bonus credits without the ability to recapture those credits in the limited circumstances described herein.
13. Applicants assert that the Commission's authority under Section 6(c) of the Act to grant exemptions from various provisions of the Act and rules thereunder is broad enough to permit orders of exemption that cover classes of unidentified persons. Applicants request an order of the Commission that would exempt them, Future Accounts and Future Underwriters from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder. The exemption of these classes of persons is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act because all of the potential members of the class could obtain the foregoing exemptions for themselves on the same basis as the Applicants, but only at a cost to each of them that is not justified by any public policy purpose. The Commission has previously granted exemptions to classes of similarly situated persons in various contexts and in a wide variety of circumstances, including future exemptions for recapturing bonus credits under variable annuity contracts.
14. Applicants represent that Future Contracts will be substantially similar in all material respects to the Contracts and that each factual statement and representation about the bonus credit provisions of the Contracts will be equally true of Future Contracts. Applicants also represent that each material representation made by them about Hartford Life and Hartford L&A, each Account and HSDCI will be equally true of Future Accounts and Future Underwriters, to the extent that such representations relate to the issues discussed in this application.
Conclusion
Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act exempting them as well as Future Accounts and Future Underwriters from the provisions of sections 2(a)(32), 22(c) and 27(i)(2)(A) of the Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit the recapture of certain credits applied to purchase payments made in consideration of the Contracts and Future Contracts.

This Prospectus describes information you should know before you purchase       
[Product Name] variable annuity. Please read it carefully.                      

[Product Name] variable annuity is a Contract between you and Hartford Life     
Insurance Company where you agree to make at least one payment to us and we     
agree to make a series of annuity payments to you at a later date. This annuity 
is a flexible premium, tax-deferred, variable annuity offered to both           
individuals and groups. It is:                                                  

X  Flexible, because you may add premium payments at any time.                  

X  Tax-deferred, which means you don't pay taxes until you take money out or    
until we start to make annuity payments to you.                         

X  Variable, because the value of your annuity will fluctuate with the          
performance of the underlying funds.                                    

At purchase, you allocate your premium payment, which is any purchase payment   
less any Premium Taxes, to "Sub-Accounts". These are subdivisions of our        
Separate Account, an account that keeps your annuity assets separate from our   
company assets. The Sub-Accounts then purchase shares of mutual funds set up    
exclusively for variable annuity or variable life insurance products. These     
funds are not the same mutual funds that you buy through your stockbroker or    
through a retail mutual fund. They may have similar investment strategies and   
the same portfolio managers as retail mutual funds. This annuity offers you     
funds with investment strategies ranging from conservative to aggressive and you
may pick those funds that meet your investment goals and risk tolerance. The    
Sub-Accounts and the funds are listed below:                                    

- Advisers Sub-Account which purchases shares of Class IA of Hartford Advisers

You may also allocate some or all of your premium payment to one of the "Fixed
Accounts", which pays an interest rate guaranteed for a certain time period from
the time the payment is made. Premium payments put in a Fixed Account are not   
segregated from our company assets like the assets of the Separate Account.

 The purpose of this table is to assist you in understanding various costs
and expenses that your will bear directly or indirectly. The table reflects     
expenses of the Separate Account and underlying Funds. We will deduct any       
Premium Taxes that apply.                                                       

  In the Example, the Annual Maintenance Fee is approximately a 0.08% annual
asset charge based on the experience of the Contracts. This Example should not  
be considered a representation of past or future expenses and actual expenses   
may be greater or less than those shown.                                        

  Pursuant to requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Annual
Maintenance Fee has been reflected in the Examples by a method intended to show 
the "average" impact of the Annual Maintenance Fee on an investment in the      
Separate Account.

SUMMARY 
HOW DO I PURCHASE THIS ANNUITY?                                                 

  You must complete our application or order request and submit it to us for
approval with your first premium payment. Your first premium payment must be at 
least $1,000 and subsequent premium payments must be at least $500. The minimum 
premium payment requirements may differ if you are participating in our         
automatic investing ("InvestEase") program.                                     

-  For a limited time, usually within ten days after you receive your annuity,  
you may cancel your annuity without paying a Contingent Deferred Sales    
Charge. You bear the investment risk for your premium payment prior to our
receipt of your request for cancellation.                                 

WHAT TYPE OF SALES CHARGE WILL I PAY?                                           
CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE ("CDSC")                                       

The CDSC covers expenses relating to the sale and distribution of the   
Contracts, including commissions paid to distributing organizations and the cost
of preparing sales literature and other promotional activities.                 

We assess a CDSC when you request a full or partial Surrender. The      
percentage of the CDSC is based on how long each premium payment has been in the
Contract. Each premium payment has its own CDSC schedule. Premium payments are  
Surrendered in the order that they were received. The longer you leave your     
premium payment in the Contract, the lower the CDSC will be when you Surrender. 

   The CDSC is a percentage of the amount Surrendered (not to exceed the total
amount of the premium payments made) and equals:                                

                                                                [Download Table]

IS THERE AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE?                                             

  Yes. We deduct this $30 fee each year on your Contract Anniversary or when
you completely Surrender your annuity, if, on either of those dates, the value  
of your annuity is less than $50,000.                                           

WHAT CHARGES WILL I PAY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?                                     

  You pay two different types of charges each year. The first type of charge
is the fee you pay for insurance. This charge is:                               

    A mortality and expense risk charge that is subtracted daily and is equal to
an annual charge of 1.25% of your Contract Value invested in the Funds.         

The second type of charge is the fee you pay for the Funds.             

Currently, fund charges range from 0.35% to 0.895% of the average daily 
value of the amount you have invested in the fund. See the Annual Operation     
Expense Table for more complete information and the funds' prospectuses attached
to this Prospectus.                                                             

   If you elect the Optional Death Benefit we will deduct an additional charge
daily from your Contract Value and is equal to 0.15% per year of your Contract  
Value invested in the Funds.                                                    

CAN I TAKE OUT ANY OF MY MONEY?                                                 

  You can partially or fully Surrender your Contract subject to a Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge (CDSC). You can partially Surrender your Contract without 
any CDSC applied to the Surrender under the following conditions:               

- Surrenders which don't exceed 15% of premium payments per Contract Year       
(Annual Withdrawal Amount);                                                 

- Surrenders made from premium payments invested more than seven years;         

- 100% Surrender of earnings after the seventh Contract Year;                   

- Surrenders under the nursing home waiver (described as Eligible Confinement in
the Contract); or                                                           

- Surrenders eligible for disability waiver under a group qualified plan.       

WILL HARTFORD PAY A DEATH BENEFIT?                                              

Your Contract has a Death Benefit and we offer an Optional Interest     
Accumulation Death Benefit ("Optional Death Benefit") that you can elect for an 
additional fee. There is a Death Benefit if the Contract Owner, joint owner or  
Annuitant, die before we begin to make annuity payments. The Death Benefit will 
remain invested in the Sub-Accounts according to your last instructions (unless 
otherwise mutually specified by your Beneficiaries) and will be subject to      
market fluctuations.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   IF YOU DO NOT ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, the Death Benefit, which we
will calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be the greater
of:                                                                             

1)  100% of the total premium payments you have made to us reduced by any       
subsequent Surrenders;                                                  

2)  The Contract Value of your annuity, or                                      

3)  Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                   

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on   
Contract Anniversaries, of Contract Values, premium payments and partial        
Surrenders. We will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary
prior to the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death. The Anniversary Value is
equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by the      
dollar amount of any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by
the dollar amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary. The Maximum 
Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value attained from this 
series of calculations.                                                         

 IF YOU ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, the Death Benefit, which we will
calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be the greater of: 

1)  100% of the total premium payments you have made to us reduced by any       
subsequent Surrenders;                                                  

2)  The Contract Value of your annuity;                                         

3)  Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is the highest Anniversary Value      
before the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death; or                

4)  Your Interest Accumulation Value.                                           

 The INTEREST ACCUMULATION VALUE is calculated by accumulating interest on
your premium payments at a rate of 5% per year up to the deceased's 81st        
birthday or date of death, assuming you have not taken any Surrenders. If you   
have taken any Surrenders, the 5% will be accumulated on your premium payments, 
but there will be an adjustment for any of the Surrenders. This adjustment will 
reduce the Optional Death Benefit proportionally for the Surrenders. The        
Optional Death Benefit is limited to a maximum of 200% of premium payments, less
proportional adjustments for any Surrenders. For examples on how the Optional   
Death Benefit is calculated see "Appendix II". If you elect the Optional Death  
Benefit, we will deduct an additional charge daily from your Contract Value     
equal to .15% of the Sub-Account value.                                         

   SPOUSAL CONTRACT CONTINUATION -- If the Beneficiary is the Contract Owner's
spouse, the Contract will continue with the spouse as Contract Owner, unless the
spouse elects to receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum payment. If the        
Contract continues with the spouse as Contract Owner, we will adjust the        
Contract Value to the amount that we would have paid as the Death Benefit       
payment, had the spouse elected to receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum      
payment or as an annuity payment option. This provision will only apply one time
for each Contract.                                                              

WHAT ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?                                     

   When you purchase your annuity, you may choose one of the following annuity
payment options, or receive a lump sum payment:                                 

LIFE ANNUITY where we make scheduled payments for the Annuitant's life. 

-  Payments under this option stop upon the death of the Annuitant, even if the 
Annuitant dies after one payment.                                         

   LIFE ANNUITY WITH CASH REFUND where we make payments during the life of the
Annuitant and when the Annuitant dies, we pay the remaining value to the        
Beneficiary. The remaining value is calculated at the time we receive Due Proof 
of Death by subtracting the annuity payments already made from the Contract     
Value, less any applicable Premium Taxes, applied to this annuity payment       
option.                                                                         

-  This option is only available if you select a variable dollar amount payment 
with the 5% AIR or fixed dollar amount annuity payments.                  

  LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN where we make payments for
the life of the Annuitant but you are at least guaranteed payments for a time   
period you select which is a minimum of 5 years and a maximum of 100 years minus
your annuitant's age.                                                           

-  If the Annuitant dies prior to the end of the period selected, we will pay   
   the value of the remaining payments to your Beneficiary, either in a lump sum
or we will continue payments until the end of the period selected.        

   JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR ANNUITY where we make payments during the lifetimes
of the Annuitant and another designated individual called the Joint Annuitant.  
At the time of electing this annuity payment option, the Contract Owner may     
elect reduced payments over the remaining lifetime of the survivor.             

-  Payments under this option STOP UPON THE DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT AND JOINT    
 ANNUITANT, even if the Annuitant and Joint Annuitant die after one payment.

JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN 
where we make payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant and a Joint         
Annuitant, and we guarantee that those payments for a time period you select    
which is a minimum of 5 years and a maximum 100 years minus the younger         
Annuitant's age. At the time of electing

this Annuity Option, the Contract Owner may elect reduced payments over the     
remaining lifetime of the survivor.                                             

-  If the Annuitant and the Joint Annuitant die prior to the end of the period  
selected, we will pay the value of the remaining payments to your         
  Beneficiary, either in a lump sum or we will continue payments until the end
of the period selected.                                                   

PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN where we agree to make payments for a     
specified time. The minimum period that you can select is 10 years during the   
first two Contract Years and 5 years after the second Contract Anniversary. The 
maximum period that you can select is 100 years minus your Annuitant's age.     

-  If you select this option under a variable dollar amount payment, YOU MAY    
 SURRENDER YOUR ANNUITY after annuity payments have started and we will give
you the present value of the remaining payments less any applicable       
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.                                         

-  If the Annuitant dies prior to the end of the period selected, we will pay   
   the value of the remaining payments to your Beneficiary, either in a lump sum
or we will continue payments until the end of the period selected.        

   You must begin to take payments before the Annuitant's 90th birthday or the
end of the 10th Contract Year, which ever comes later, unless you elect a later 
date to begin receiving payments subject to the laws and regulations then in    
effect and our approval. If you do not tell us what annuity payment option you  
want before that time, we will pay you under the Life Annuity with a 10 year    
period certain. You and Hartford can agree to start payments at a later date if 
the laws in effect allow us to defer payment and we agree to allow you to defer.

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT

   The Separate Account is where we set aside and invest the assets of some of
our annuity contracts, including this Contract. The Separate Account was        
established on June 2, 1986 and is registered as a unit investment trust under  
the Investment Company Act of 1940. This registration does not involve          
supervision by the Commission of the management or the investment practices of  
the Separate Account or Hartford. The Separate Account meets the definition of  
"Separate Account" under federal securities law. This Separate Account holds    
only assets for variable annuity contracts. The Separate Account:               

- Holds assets for the benefit of you and other Contract Owners, and the persons
entitled to the payments described in the Contract.                         

- Is not subject to the liabilities arising out of any other business Hartford  
may conduct.                                                                

- Is not affected by the rate of return of Hartford's General Account or by the 
investment performance of any of Hartford's other Separate Accounts.        

- May be subject to liabilities from a Sub-Account of the Separate Account which
holds assets of other variable annuity contracts offered by the Separate    
Account which are not described in this Prospectus.                         

- Is credited with income and gains, and takes losses, whether or not realized, 
from the assets it holds.                                                   

    We do not guarantee the investment results of the Separate Account. There is
no assurance that the value of your Annuity will equal the total of the payments
you make to us.                                                                 

THE FUNDS 

   All of the Funds are sponsored by us and are incorporated under the laws of
the State of Maryland. HL Investment Advisors, Inc. ("HL Advisors") serves as   
the investment adviser to each of these Funds. Wellington Management Company,   
LLP ("Wellington Management") and The Hartford Investment Management Company    
("HIMCO") serve as sub-investment advisors and provide day to day investment    
services.                                                                       

  We do not guarantee the investment results of any of the underlying Funds.
Since each underlying Fund has different investment objectives, each is subject 
to different

and our insurance company affiliates or other unaffiliated insurance companies  
to serve as the underlying investment for both variable annuity contracts and   
variable life insurance contracts, a practice known as "mixed funding." As a    
result, there is a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the   
interests of Contract Owners, and of owners of other contracts whose contract   
values are allocated to one or more of these other Separate Accounts investing  
in any one of the Funds. In the event of any such material conflicts, we will   
consider what action may be appropriate, including removing the Fund

from the Separate Account or replacing the Fund with another Fund. There are    
certain risks associated with mixed funding, as disclosed in the funds'         
prospectus.                                                                     
VOTING RIGHTS -- We are the legal owners of all Fund shares held in the 
Separate Account and we have the right to vote at the Fund's shareholder        
meetings. To the extent required by federal securities laws or regulations, we  
will:                                                                           

- Notify you of any Fund shareholders' meeting if the shares held for your      
Contract may be voted.                                                      

- Send proxy materials and a form of instructions that you can use tell us how  
to vote the Fund shares held for your Contract.                             

- Arrange for the handling and tallying of proxies received from Contract       
Owners.                                                                     

- Vote all Fund shares attributable to your Contract according to instructions  
received from you, and                                                      

- Vote all Fund shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same
proportion as shares for which instructions have been received.             

If any federal securities laws or regulations, or their present         
interpretation, change to permit us to vote Fund shares on our own, we may      
decide to do so. You may attend any Shareholder Meeting at which shares held for
your Contract may be voted. After we begin to make payments to you, the number  
of votes you have will decrease.                                                

SUBSTITUTIONS, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS OF FUNDS -- We reserve the right,
subject to any applicable law, to make certain changes to the Funds offered     
under your Contract. We may, in our sole discretion, establish new Funds. New   
Funds will be will be made available to existing Contract Owners as we          
determined appropriate. We may also close one or more Funds to additional       
payments or transfers from existing Sub-Accounts.                               

We reserve the right to eliminate the shares of any of the Funds for any
reason and to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the
shares of any Fund already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the    
Separate Account. To the extent required by the 1940 Act, substitutions of      
shares attributable to your interest in a Fund will not be made until we have   
the approval of the Commission and we have notified you of the change.          

In the event of any substitution or change, We may, by appropriate      
endorsement, make such changes in the Contract as may be necessary or           
appropriate to reflect such substitution or change. If we decide that it is in  
the best interest Contracts Owners, the Separate Account may be operated as a   
management company under the 1940 Act or any other form permitted by law, may be
de-registered under the 1940 Act in the event such registration is no longer    
required, or may be combined with one or more other Separate Accounts.          

PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION 

  The Separate Account may advertise certain performance-related information
concerning the Sub-Accounts. Performance information about a Sub-Account is     
based on the Sub-Account's past performance only and is no indication of future 
performance.                                                                    

    When a Sub-Account advertises its STANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN, it will usually
be calculated for one year, five years, and ten years or some other relevant    
periods if the Sub-Account has not been in existence for at least ten years.    
Total return is measured by comparing the value of an investment in the         
Sub-Account at the beginning of the relevant period to the value of the         
investment at the end of the period.                                            

   In addition to the standardized total return, the Sub-Account may advertise
a NON-STANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN. This figure will usually be calculated for one 
year, five years, and ten years or other periods. Non-standardized total return 
is measured in the same manner as the standardized total return described above,
except that the Annual Maintenance Fee is not deducted. Therefore,              
non-standardized total return for a Sub-Account is higher than standardized     
total return for a Sub-Account.                                                 

The Separate Account may also advertise NON-STANDARD TOTAL RETURNS THAT 
PRE-DATE THE INCEPTION DATE OF THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT. These non-standardized     
total returns are calculated by assuming that the Sub-Accounts have been in     
existence for the same periods as the underlying Funds and by taking deductions 
for charges equal to those currently assessed against the Sub-Accounts. These   
non-standardized returns must be accompanied by standardized total returns.     

If applicable, the Sub-Accounts may advertise YIELD IN ADDITION TO TOTAL
RETURN. The yield will be computed in the following manner: The net investment  
income per unit earned during a recent one month period, divided by the unit    
value on the last day of the period. This figure reflects the recurring charges 
at the Separate Account level including the Annual Maintenance Fee.             

  The Money Market Fund Sub-Account may advertise yield and effective yield.
The yield of a Sub-Account is based upon the income earned by the Sub-Account   
over a seven-day period and then annualized, i.e. the income earned in the      
period is assumed to be earned every seven days over a 52-week period and stated
as a percentage of the investment. Effective yield is calculated similarly but  
when annualized, the income earned by the investment is assumed to be reinvested
in Sub-Account units and thus compounded in the course of a 52-week period.     
Yield and effective yield reflect the recurring charges at the Separate Account 
level including the Annual Maintenance Fee.

  The Separate Account may also disclose yield for periods prior to the date
the Separate Account commenced operations. For periods prior to the date the    
Separate Account commenced operations, performance information for the          
Sub-Accounts will be calculated based on the performance of the underlying Funds
and the assumption that the Sub-Accounts were in existence for the same periods 
as those of the underlying Funds, with a level of charges equal to those        
currently assessed against the Sub-Accounts.                                    

We may provide information on various topics to Contract Owners and     
prospective Contract Owners in advertising, sales literature or other materials.
These topics may include the relationship between sectors of the economy and the
economy as a whole and its effect on various securities markets, investment     
strategies and techniques (such as value investing, dollar cost averaging and   
asset allocation), the advantages and disadvantages of investing in tax-deferred
and taxable instruments, customer profiles and hypothetical purchase scenarios, 
financial management and tax and retirement planning, and other investment      
alternatives, including comparisons between the Contracts and the               
characteristics of and market for such alternatives.                            

THE FIXED ACCOUNTS
    IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW: THIS PORTION OF THE CONTRACT RELATING
TO THE FIXED ACCOUNTS IS NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 ("1933 
ACT") AND THE FIXED ACCOUNTS ARE NOT REGISTERED AS INVESTMENT COMPANIES UNDER   
THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940 ("1940 ACT"). NONE OF THE FIXED ACCOUNTS OR  
ANY OF THEIR INTERESTS ARE SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OR RESTRICTIONS OF THE 1933
ACT OR THE 1940 ACT, AND THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS
NOT REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE FIXED ACCOUNTS. THE FOLLOWING         
DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FIXED ACCOUNTS MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN GENERALLY         
APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS REGARDING THE ACCURACY AND 
COMPLETENESS OF DISCLOSURE.                                                     

  Payments and Contract Values allocated to a Fixed Account become a part of
our general assets. We invest the assets of the General Account in accordance   
with applicable law governing the investments of insurance company General      
Accounts. We have more than one fixed account. The standard Fixed Account (the  
"Fixed Account") and then a number of DCA Program Fixed Accounts, which we      
collectively refer to as the "Fixed Accounts."
  CURRENTLY, WE GUARANTEE THAT WE WILL CREDIT INTEREST AT A RATE OF NOT LESS
THAN 3% PER YEAR, COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY, TO AMOUNTS YOU ALLOCATE TO THE FIXED     
ACCOUNT. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION, TO CREDIT INTEREST AT A  
RATE IN EXCESS OF 3% PER YEAR. YOU ASSUME THE RISK THAT INTEREST CREDITED TO THE
FIXED ACCOUNT MAY NOT EXCEED THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF 3% FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.    

  We will periodically publish the Fixed Account interest rates currently in
effect. There is no specific formula for the determination of interest rates.   
Some of the factors that we may consider in determining whether to credit excess
interest are: general economic trends, rates of return currently available and  
anticipated on our investments, regulatory and tax requirements and competitive 
factors. We will account for any deductions, Surrenders or transfers from the   
Fixed Account on a "first-in", "first-out" basis. For Contracts issued in the   
state of New York, Fixed Account interest rates may vary from other states.     

    From time to time, we may credit increased interest rates to Contract Owners
under certain programs established at our sole discretion.                      

    DOLLAR COST AVERAGING ("DCA") PROGRAMS -- These programs will use designated
DCA Program Fixed Accounts. Currently, Contract Owners may enroll in a special  
pre-authorized transfer program known as our Dollar Cost Averaging Bonus Program
(the "Program"). Under this Program, Contract Owners who enroll may allocate a  
minimum of $5,000 of their payment into the appropriate DCA Program Fixed       
Account (we may allow a lower minimum payment for qualified plan transfers or   
rollovers, including IRAs) and pre-authorize transfers to any of the            
Sub-Accounts under either the 6 Month Transfer Program or 12 Month Transfer     
Program. The 6-Month Transfer Program and the 12-Month Transfer Program will    
generally have different credited interest rates. Under the 6 Month Transfer    
Program, the interest rate can accrue up to 6 months and all payments and       
accrued interest must be transferred from the DCA Program Fixed Account in use  
to the selected Sub-Accounts in 3 to 6 months. Under the 12-Month Transfer      
Program, the interest rate can accrue up to 12 months and all payments and      
accrued interest must be transferred to the selected Sub-Accounts in 7 to 12    
months. This will be accomplished by monthly transfers for the period selected  
and a final transfer of the entire amount remaining in the Program, which will  
generally be less than the prior monthly transfer amounts. Contract Owners who  
purchase their Contracts in New York have a different DCA Bonus Program, which  
includes different credited interest rates. Currently, only one DCA Bonus       
Program transfer period is available in New York, but that period allows        
transfers to selected Sub-Accounts in 3 to 12 months.                           

   The pre-authorized transfers will begin within 15 days after we receive the
initial Program payment and complete enrollment instructions. If We do not      
receive complete Program enrollment instructions within 15 days of receipt of   
the initial Program payment, the Program will be voided and the entire balance  
in the Program will be transferred to the Accounts designated by you. If you do 
not designate an Account, we will transfer any remaining amounts to the Fixed   
Account and you will receive the Fixed Account's current effective interest     
rate. Any subsequent payments we receive within the Program period selected will
be allocated

to the Sub-Accounts over the remainder of that Program transfer period, unless  
otherwise directed by You.                                                      

 You may only have one dollar cost averaging program in place at one time,
this means one standard dollar cost averaging plan or one Dollar Cost Averaging 
Bonus Program.                                                                  

You may elect to terminate the pre-authorized transfers by calling or   
writing us of your intent to cancel enrollment in the Program. Upon cancellation
of enrollment in the Program, you will no longer receive the increased interest 
rate and unless we receive instructions to the contrary, the amounts remaining  
in the DCA Program Fixed Account may be transferred to the Fixed Account and    
accrue the interest rate currently in effect.                                   

We reserve the right to discontinue, modify or amend the Program or any 
other interest rate program established by Hartford. Any change to the Program  
will not affect Contract Owners currently enrolled in the Program. This Program 
may not be available in all states; please contact us to determine if it is     
available in your state.                                                        

THE CONTRACT

  THE CONTRACT OFFERED -- The Contracts are individual or group tax-deferred
variable annuity contracts. They are designed for retirement planning purposes  
and may be purchased by any individual, group or trust, including; (a) any      
trustee or custodian for a retirement plan qualified under Sections 401(a), or  
403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (which includes Section 401(k)); (b) annuity
purchase plans adopted by public school systems and certain tax-exempt          
organizations according to Section 403(b) of the Code; (c) Individual Retirement
Annuities adopted according to Section 408 of the Code; (d) employee pension    
plans established for employees by a state, a political subdivision of a state, 
or an agency or instrumentality of either a state or a political subdivision of 
a state, and (e) certain eligible deferred compensation plans as defined in     
Section 457 of the Code ("Qualified Contracts").                                

PURCHASING A CONTRACT -- A prospective Contract Owner may purchase a    
Contract by completing and submitting an application or an order request along  
with an initial premium payment to the Administrative Office of the Company. The
maximum age for Annuitant, Owner and Joint Owner on the Contract Issue Date is  
85. Generally, the minimum premium payment is $1,000. The minimum subsequent    
premium payment is $500. Certain plans may be allowed to make smaller periodic  
premium payments. Unless we give our prior approval, we will not accept a       
premium payment in excess of $1,000,000. Each premium payment, which is your    
premium payment after the deduction of any applicable Premium Taxes, may be     
split among the various Accounts subject to minimum amounts then in effect. We  
will send you a confirmation notice upon receipt and acceptance of your premium 
payment.                                                                        

RIGHT TO EXAMINE THE CONTRACT -- If you are not satisfied with your     
purchase, you may cancel the Contract by returning it within 10 days (or longer 
in some states) after you receive it. You must send a written request for       
cancellation along with the Contract. We will, without deduction for any CDSC   
normally assessed, pay you an amount equal to the Contract Value. YOU BEAR THE  
INVESTMENT RISK DURING THE PERIOD PRIOR TO OUR RECEIPT OF YOUR REQUEST FOR      
CANCELLATION. We will refund the premium paid only for Individual Retirement    
Annuities, if returned within seven days of receipt, and in those states where  
required by law.                                                                

CREDITING AND VALUATION -- Your premium payment, which is the balance   
remaining after the deduction of any Premium Tax, is credited to your Contract  
within two business days of receipt by us at our Administrative Office of a     
properly completed application or an order to purchase a Contract and the       
premium payment. The payment will be credited to the Accounts according to the  
instructions we receive from you.                                               

  If your application or other information is incomplete when received, your
payment will be credited to the Accounts within five business days of receipt of
complete information. If the payment is not credited within five business days, 
it will be immediately returned to you unless you have been informed of the     
delay and tell us not to return it.                                             

  Subsequent premium payments are priced on the Valuation Day we receive the
payment in our Administrative Office, provided it is received before the New    
York Stock Exchange closes. Unless otherwise specified, We will allocate any    
subsequent payments to Accounts according to your most recent instructions.     

CONTRACT VALUE -- BEFORE THE ANNUITY
COMMENCEMENT DATE 

    Your Contract Value reflects interest rate credited any amounts allocated to
the Fixed Accounts and the investment performance of the Sub-Accounts where you 
have payments allocated.                                                        

SUB-ACCOUNT VALUES -- Your Sub-Account Values on the date we issue your 
Contract is the amount of your premium payment allocated to any Sub-Account.    
After that, we determine your Sub-Account value by determining the Accumulation 
Unit value for each Sub-Account, and then multiplying that value by the number  
of those units. Sub-Account Value reflects any variation of the interest income,
dividends, net capital gains or losses, realized or unrealized, and any amounts 
transferred into or out of that Sub-Account.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ACCUMULATION UNITS -- The number of Accumulation Units credited to a    
Sub-Account you have is determined by dividing the dollar amount you allocated  
to that Sub-Account by the value of one Accumulation Unit for that Sub-Account. 
The number of Accumulation Units of a Sub-Account increases when you allocate a 
payment or a portion of a payment to the Sub-Account or transfer Contract Value 
to a Sub-Account. The number of Accumulation Units of a Sub-Account decreases   
when you apply Contract Value less Premium Tax to an annuity payment option on  
the Annuity Calculation Date, when you Surrender, when you make transfers out of
a Sub-Account, and when we pay a Death Benefit before the Annuity Commencement  
Date. Accumulation Units are valued as of the end of the Valuation Period.      

   ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUE -- The Accumulation Unit value for each Sub-Account
was arbitrarily set initially at $1 when the Sub-Account began operations. After
that, the Accumulation Unit value for each Sub-Account will equal (a) the       
Accumulation Unit value at the end of the preceding Valuation Day multiplied by 
(b) the Net Investment Factor (see the definition below) for the Valuation Day  
for which the Accumulation Unit value is being calculated.                      

 You will be advised, at least semiannually, of the number of Accumulation
Units credited to each Sub-Account, the current Accumulation Unit values, and   
the total value of your Contract.                                               

  THE NET INVESTMENT FACTOR (BEFORE AND AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE)
-- The Net Investment Factor is an index applied to measure the investment      
performance of a Sub-Account from one Valuation Period to the next. For each    
Sub-Account, the Net Investment Factor reflects the investment performance of   
the Fund in which that Sub-Account invests and the charges assessed against that
Sub-Account for a Valuation Period. The Net Investment Factor is calculated by  
dividing (a) by (b) and subtracting (c) from the result, where:                 

(a) Is the Net Asset Value of the Fund held in that Sub-Account, determined at  
 the end of the current Valuation Period (plus the per share amount of any
dividends or capital gains distributions made by that Fund);            

(b) Is the Net Asset Value of the Fund held in the Sub-Account, determined at   
the beginning of the Valuation Period;                                  

(c) Is a daily factor representing the mortality and expense risk charge and any
  optional charges deducted from the Sub-Account, adjusted for the number of
days in the Valuation Period.                                           

CONTRACT VALUE TRANSFERS BEFORE AND AFTER 
THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE 

  You may transfer your Contract Values from one or more Accounts to another
Account free of charge. WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO LIMIT THE NUMBER OF TRANSFERS TO
12 PER CONTRACT YEAR, WITH NO 2 TRANSFERS OCCURRING ON CONSECUTIVE VALUATION    
DAYS. Transfers by telephone may be made by you or by your attorney-in-fact     
pursuant to a power of attorney by calling us at 1-800-862-6668 or by the agent 
of record by calling 1-800-862-7155 . Telephone transfers may not be permitted  
by some states. There may be limitations on transfers to and from the Fixed     
Accounts that are described in your Contract. Some states may allow us to limit 
the dollar amount transferred.                                                  

We, or our agents and affiliates will not be responsible for losses     
resulting from acting upon telephone requests reasonably believed to be genuine.
We will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions communicated  
by telephone are genuine. The procedure we follow for transactions initiated by 
telephone include requirements that callers provide certain information for     
identification purposes. All transfer instructions by telephone are tape-       
recorded.                                                                       

 We may permit you to pre-authorize transfers under certain circumstances.
Transfers between the Accounts may be made both before and after the Annuity    
Commencement Date. Generally, the minimum allocation to any Sub-Account may not 
be less than $500. All percentage (%) allocations must be in whole numbers      
(e.g., 1%). No minimum balance is presently required in any Account.            

IT IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO VERIFY THE ACCURACY OF ALL CONFIRMATIONS OF
TRANSFERS AND TO PROMPTLY ADVISE US IN OUR ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES OF ANY        
INACCURACIES WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE DATE YOU RECEIVE YOUR CONFIRMATION.          

The right to reallocate Contract Values is subject to modification if we
determine, in our sole opinion, that the exercise of that right by one or more  
Contract Owners is, or would be, to the disadvantage of other Contract Owners.  
Any modification could be applied to transfers to or from some or all of the    
Accounts and could include, but not be limited to, the requirement of a minimum 
time period between each transfer, not accepting transfer requests of an agent  
acting under a power of attorney on behalf of more than one Contract Owner, or  
limiting the dollar amount that may be transferred between the Sub-Accounts by  
you at any one time. SUCH RESTRICTIONS MAY BE APPLIED IN ANY MANNER REASONABLY  
DESIGNED TO PREVENT ANY USE OF THE TRANSFER RIGHT WHICH WE CONSIDER TO BE TO THE
DISADVANTAGE OF OTHER CONTRACT OWNERS.                                          

    For Contracts issued in the STATES OF NEW YORK, FLORIDA, MARYLAND OR OREGON,
the reservation of rights set forth in the preceding paragraph is limited to:   
(i) requiring up to a

maximum of 10 Valuation Days between each transfer; (ii) limiting the amount to 
be transferred on any one Valuation Day to no more than $2 million; and (iii)   
upon 30 days prior written notice, to only accepting transfer instructions from 
you and not from your representative, agent or person acting under a power of   
attorney for you.                                                               

   Currently, we will not accept instructions from agents acting under a power
of attorney of multiple Contract Owners whose Accounts aggregate more than $2   
million, unless the agent has entered into a third party transfer services      
agreement with us.                                                              

SURRENDERS
Contract Owners should consult their tax adviser regarding the tax      
consequences of a Surrender.                                                    

-  A Surrender made before age 59 1/2 may result in adverse tax consequences,   
   including a penalty tax of 10% of the taxable portion of the Surrender Value.
(See "Federal Tax Considerations").                                       

    PAYMENT OF SURRENDER AMOUNTS -- Payment of any request for a full or partial
Surrender from the Accounts will be made as soon as possible and in any event no
later than seven days after we receive the request at our Administrative Office.

  There may be postponement in the payment of Surrender Amounts whenever (a)
the New York Stock Exchange is closed; (b) trading on the New York Stock        
Exchange is restricted as determined by the Commission; (c) the Commission      
permits postponement and so orders; or (d) the Commission determines that an    
emergency exists making valuation of the amounts or disposal of securities not  
reasonably practicable.                                                         

   FULL SURRENDERS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- At any time prior
to the Annuity Commencement Date, you have the right to fully Surrender the     
Contract. In such event, the Surrender Value of the Contract may be taken in the
form of a lump sum cash payment.                                                

   The Surrender Value of the Contract is equal to the Contract Value less any
Premium Taxes, the Annual Maintenance Fee and any Contingent Deferred Sales     
Charge, if applicable. The Surrender Value may be more or less than the amount  
of the payments made to your Contract.                                          

   PARTIAL SURRENDERS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may make a
partial Surrender of your Contract Value at any time prior to the Annuity       
Commencement Date so long as the amount Surrendered is at least equal to our    
minimum amount rules then in effect. Additionally, if the remaining Contract    
Value following a Surrender is less than $500, we may terminate the Contract and
pay the Surrender Value. For Contracts issued in TEXAS, the Contract will not be
terminated when the remaining Contract Value after a Surrender is less than $500
unless there were no payments made during the previous 2 Contract Years.        

   WHEN REQUESTING A PARTIAL SURRENDER, YOU SHOULD SPECIFY THE ACCOUNT(S) FROM
WHICH THE PARTIAL SURRENDER WILL BE TAKEN; OTHERWISE, THE SURRENDER WILL BE     
TAKEN ON A PRO RATA BASIS ACCORDING TO THE VALUE IN EACH ACTIVE ACCOUNT.        

We may permit you to pre-authorize partial Surrenders subject to certain
limitations then in effect. We permit partial Surrenders by telephone subject to
dollar amount limitations in effect at the time you request the Surrender. To   
request partial Surrenders by telephone, you must have completed and returned to
us a Telephone Redemption Program Enrollment Form authorizing telephone         
Surrenders. If there are joint Contract Owners, both must authorize us to accept
telephone instructions and agree that We may accept telephone instructions for  
partial Surrenders from either Contract Owner. Partial Surrender requests will  
not be honored until we receive all required documents in proper form.          

Telephone authorization will remain valid until (a) we receive written  
notice of revocation by you, or, in the case of joint Contract Owners, written  
notice from either Contract Owner; (b) we discontinue the privilege; or (c) we  
have reason to believe that you have entered into a market timing agreement with
an investment adviser and/or broker/ dealer.                                    

    We may record any telephone calls to verify data concerning transactions and
may adopt other procedures to confirm that telephone instructions are genuine.  
We will not be liable for losses or expenses arising out of telephone           
instructions reasonably believed to be genuine.                                 

In order to obtain that day's unit values on Surrender, We must receive 
telephone Surrender instructions prior to the close of trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange (generally 4:00 p.m.).                                           

    We may modify, suspend, or terminate telephone transaction privileges at any
time.                                                                           

 SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may fully Surrender
your Contract on or after the Annuity Commencement Date if you elect the Payment
For a Period Certain Settlement Option. We pay you the commuted value that is   
equal to the present value of the remaining payments we are scheduled to make   
less any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. The commuted value is     
determined as of the date we receive your written request for Surrender at our  
Administrative Office.                                                          

No partial Surrenders are permitted after the Annuity Commencement Date.

CONTRACT MADE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 1988 AND ANY INCREASES IN CASH VALUE AFTER     
DECEMBER 31, 1988 MAY NOT BE DISTRIBUTED UNLESS THE CONTRACT OWNER/EMPLOYEE HAS 
A) ATTAINED AGE 59 1/2, B) SEPARATED FROM SERVICE, C) DIED, D) BECOME DISABLED  
OR E) EXPERIENCED FINANCIAL HARDSHIP (CASH VALUE INCREASES MAY NOT BE           
DISTRIBUTED FOR HARDSHIPS PRIOR TO AGE 59 1/2). DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO AGE      
59 1/2 DUE TO FINANCIAL HARDSHIP OR SEPARATION FROM SERVICE MAY STILL BE SUBJECT
TO A PENALTY TAX OF 10%. WE WILL NOT ASSUME ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR DETERMINING  
WHETHER A SURRENDER IS PERMISSIBLE, WITH OR WITHOUT TAX PENALTY, IN ANY         
PARTICULAR SITUATION; OR IN MONITORING SURRENDER REQUESTS REGARDING PRE OR POST 
JANUARY 1, 1989 CONTRACT VALUES. ANY FULL OR PARTIAL SURRENDER DESCRIBED ABOVE  
MAY AFFECT THE CONTINUING TAX-QUALIFIED STATUS OF SOME CONTRACTS OR PLANS AND   
MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THE CONTRACT OWNER. THE CONTRACT 
OWNER, THEREFORE, SHOULD CONSULT WITH A TAX ADVISER BEFORE UNDERTAKING ANY SUCH 
SURRENDER. (SEE "FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS").                                  

CONTRACT CHARGES
CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE ("CDSC")                                       

The CDSC covers expenses relating to the sale and distribution of the   
Contracts, including commissions paid to distributing organizations and the cost
of preparing sales literature and other promotional activities.                 

We assess a CDSC when you request a full or partial Surrender. The      
percentage of the CDSC is based on how long each premium payment has been in the
Contract. Each premium payment has its own CDSC schedule. Premium payments are  
Surrendered in the order that they were received. The longer you leave your     
premium payment in the Contract, the lower the CDSC will be when you Surrender. 

   The CDSC is a percentage of the amount Surrendered (not to exceed the total
amount of the premium payments made) and equals:                                

                                                                [Download Table]

  ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT -- During the first seven Contract years, you may
make a partial Surrender of Contract Values of up to 15% of the premium payments
each Contract Year on a non-cumulative basis, as determined on the date of the  
requested Surrender, without the application of the CDSC. After the seventh     
Contract Year, you may make a partial Surrender each Contract Year of 15% of    
premium payments made during the seven years prior to the Surrender and 100% of 
the Contract Value less the premium payments made during the seven years prior  
to the Surrender.                                                               

   EXTENDED SURRENDER PRIVILEGE -- This privilege allows Annuitants who attain
age 70 1/2 with a Contract held under an Individual Retirement Account or 403(b)
plan to Surrender an amount equal to the required minimum distribution for the  
stated Contract without incurring any CDSC.                                     

WAIVERS OF CDSC                                                                 
CONFINEMENT IN A NURSING HOME, HOSPITAL OR LONG TERM CARE FACILITY      
(DESCRIBED AS ELIGIBLE CONFINEMENT IN THE CONTRACT) -- We will waive any CDSC   
applicable to a partial or full Surrender if the Annuitant, Contract Owner or   
joint annuitant is confined, at the recommendation of a physician for medically 
necessary reasons, for at least 180 calendar days to: a hospital recognized as a
general hospital by the proper authority of the state in which it is located; or
a hospital recognized as a general hospital by the Joint Commission on the      
Accreditation of Hospitals; or a facility certified as a hospital or long-term  
care facility; or a nursing home licensed by the state in which it is located   
and offers the services of a registered nurse 24 hours a day.                   

  The Annuitant, Contract Owner or joint annuitant cannot be confined at the
time the Contract is purchased in order to receive this waiver and the Contract 
Owner(s) must have been the Contract Owner(s) continuously since the Contract   
issue date. You must provide written proof of confinement satisfactory to       
Hartford and you must request the partial or full Surrender within 91 calendar  
days of the last day of confinement.                                            

This waiver may not be available in all states. Please contact your     
registered representative or contact Us to determine availability.              

    DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT OR CONTRACT OWNER OR PAYMENTS UNDER AN ANNUITY OPTION
-- No CDSC otherwise applicable will be assessed in the event of death of the   
Annuitant, death of the Contract Owner or if payments are made under an Annuity 
option (other than a Surrender of variable payments for a Period Certain Annuity
option) provided for under the Contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   OTHER PLANS OR PROGRAMS -- Certain plans or programs established by us from
time to time may have different Surrender privileges.                           

   MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE -- For assuming risks under the Contract,
We deduct a daily charge at the rate of 1.25% per year against all Contract     
Values held in the Accounts during the life of the Contract. Although variable  
annuity payments made under the Contracts will vary in accordance with the      
investment performance of the underlying Fund shares held in the Sub-Account(s),
the payments will not be affected by (a) our actual mortality experience among  
Annuitants before or after the Annuity Commencement Date or (b) our actual      
expenses, if greater than the deductions provided for in the Contracts because  
of the expense and mortality undertakings by us.                                

  There are two types of mortality risks: those made during the accumulation
or deferral phase and those made during the annuity payout phase. The mortality 
risk we take in the accumulation phase is that we may experience a loss         
resulting from the assumption of the mortality risk relative to the death       
benefit in event of the death of an Annuitant or Contract Owner before          
commencement of Annuity payments, in periods of declining value. The mortality  
risk we take during the annuity payout phase is to make monthly Annuity payments
(determined in accordance with the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality Table and 
other provisions contained in the Contract) to Annuitants regardless of how long
an Annuitant may live, and regardless of how long all Annuitants as a group may 
live. These mortality undertakings are based on our determination of expected   
mortality rates among all Annuitants. If actual experience among Annuitants     
during the Annuity payment period deviates from our actuarial determination of  
expected mortality rates among Annuitants because, as a group, their longevity  
is longer than anticipated, we must provide amounts from our general funds to   
fulfill our contractual obligations. We will bear the loss in such a situation. 

 During the accumulation phase, we also provide an expense undertaking. We
assume the risk that the Annual Maintenance Fee for maintaining the Contracts   
prior to the Annuity Commencement Date may be insufficient to cover the actual  
cost of providing such items.                                                   

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE -- Each year, on each Contract Anniversary on or 
before the Annuity Commencement Date, we will deduct an Annual Maintenance Fee, 
if applicable, from Contract Values to reimburse us for expenses relating to the
maintenance of the Contract and Accounts. If during a Contract Year the Contract
is Surrendered for its full value, we will deduct the Annual Maintenance Fee at 
the time of such Surrender. The fee is a flat fee that will be due in the full  
amount regardless of the time of the Contract Year that Contract Values are     
Surrendered. The Annual Maintenance Fee is $30 per Contract Year for Contracts  
with less than $50,000 Contract Value on the Contract Anniversary. Fees will be 
deducted on a pro rata basis according to the value in each Account under a     
Contract.                                                                       

   WAIVERS OF THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE -- Annual Maintenance Fees are waived
for Contracts with Contract Value equal to or greater than $50,000. In addition,
we will waive one Annual Maintenance Fee for Contract Owners who own one or more
Contracts with a combined Contract Value of $50,000 up to $100,000. If you have 
multiple Contracts with a combined Contract Value of $100,000 or greater, we    
will waive the Annual Maintenance Fee on all Contracts. However, we reserve the 
right to limit the number of Annual Maintenance Fee waivers to a total of six   
Contracts. We reserve the right to waive the Annual Maintenance Fee under other 
conditions.                                                                     

  PREMIUM TAXES -- Charges are also deducted for Premium Tax, if applicable,
imposed by state or other governmental entity. Certain states impose a Premium  
Tax, currently ranging up to 3.5%. Some states assess the tax at the time       
purchase payments are made; others assess the tax at the time of annuitization. 
We will pay Premium Taxes at the time imposed under applicable law. At our sole 
discretion, we may deduct Premium Taxes at the time we pay such taxes to the    
applicable taxing authorities, at the time the Contract is Surrendered, at the  
time a death benefit is paid, or at the time the Contract annuitizes.           

 OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT FEE -- If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we
will deduct daily from your Contract Value an additional charge which equals    
.15% of the Sub-Account value.                                                

    EXCEPTIONS TO CHARGES UNDER THE CONTRACT -- We may offer, at our discretion,
reduced fees and charges including, but not limited to, CDSC, the mortality and 
expense risk charge, administration charges, optional charges and the Annual    
Maintenance Fee for certain sales (including employer sponsored savings plans)  
under circumstances which may result in savings of certain costs and expenses.  
Reductions in these fees and charges will not be unfairly discriminatory against
any Contract Owner.                                                             

DEATH BENEFITS
DEATH BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE                                      

  DETERMINATION OF THE BENEFICIARY -- If the Contract Owner or the Annuitant
dies before the Annuity Commencement Date, we will pay a Death Benefit to the   
Beneficiary.                                                                    

- IF THE CONTRACT OWNER DIES before the Annuity Commencement Date, any surviving
joint Contract Owner becomes the Beneficiary. If there is no surviving joint
Contract Owner, the designated Beneficiary will be the Beneficiary. If the  
  Contract Owner's spouse is the sole Beneficiary, the spouse may elect, in lieu
of receiving the

Contract Value, to be treated as the Contract Owner. If the Annuitant is not
  living and there is no Contingent Annuitant, the spouse will be presumed to be
  the Contingent Annuitant. If no Beneficiary designation is in effect or if the
Beneficiary has predeceased the Contract Owner, the Contract Owner's estate 
will be the Beneficiary.                                                    

- IF THE ANNUITANT DIES before the Annuity Commencement Date, the Contingent    
Annuitant will become the Annuitant. If either (a) there is no Contingent   
Annuitant, (b) the Contingent Annuitant predeceases the Annuitant, or (c) if
any sole Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Commencement Date, the      
  Beneficiary, as determined under the Contract control provisions, will receive
the Death Benefit. However, if the Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity      
Commencement Date and the Contract Owner is living, the Contract Owner shall
be the Beneficiary. In that case, the rights of any designated Beneficiary  
shall be void.                                                              

DETERMINATION OF THE DEATH BENEFIT                                              

  IF YOU DID NOT ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, Your Death Benefit, which
we will calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be         
calculated as follows:                                                          

 If the deceased HAD NOT REACHED THEIR 81ST BIRTHDAY, the Death Benefit is
the greater of:                                                                 

1)  100% of the total premium payments made to the Contract, reduced by any     
subsequent Surrenders, or                                               

2)  The Contract Value of your annuity, or                                      

3)  Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                   

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on   
Contract Anniversaries of Contract Values, premium payments and partial         
Surrenders. We will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary
prior to the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death. The Anniversary Value is
equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by the      
dollar amount of any premium payments made since that anniversary and reduced by
the dollar amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary. The Maximum 
Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value attained from this 
series of calculations.                                                         

  IF THE DECEASED REACHED THEIR 81ST BIRTHDAY, then the Death Benefit is the
greater of:                                                                     

1)  100% of the total premium payments made to us, reduced by any subsequent    
Surrenders, or                                                          

2)  The Contract Value of your annuity, or                                      

3)  The Maximum Anniversary Value.                                              

IF YOU DID ELECT THE OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT, the Death Benefit, which we
will calculate as of the date we receive Due Proof of Death, will be the greater
of:                                                                             

1)  100% of the total premium payments made to us, reduced by any subsequent    
Surrenders;                                                             

2)  The Contract Value of your annuity;                                         

3)  The Maximum Anniversary Value; or                                           

4)  The Interest Accumulation Value, which is described below.                  

 The Interest Accumulation Value is calculated by accumulating interest on
your premium payments at a rate of 5% per year up to the deceased's 81st        
birthday or date of death, assuming you have not taken any Surrenders. If you   
have taken any Surrenders, the 5% will be accumulated on your premium payments, 
but there will be an adjustment for any of the Surrenders. This adjustment will 
reduce the Optional Death Benefit proportionally for the Surrenders. We stop    
compounding interest on the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death. After    
that date, the Interest Accumulation Value will be adjusted by adding any       
subsequent payments and subtracting proportional adjustments for any partial    
Surrenders. The Optional Death Benefit is limited to a maximum of 200% of       
premium payments, less proportional adjustments for any Surrenders. For examples
on how the Optional Death Benefit is calculated see "Appendix II".              

SPOUSAL CONTRACT CONTINUATION -- If the Death Benefit beneficiary is the
Contract Owner's spouse, the Contract will continue with the spouse as Contract 
Owner, unless the spouse elects to receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum      
payment or as an annuity payment option. If the Contract continues with the     
spouse as Contract Owner, we will adjust the Contract Value to the amount that  
we would have paid as the Death Benefit payment, had the spouse elected to      
receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum payment. This provision will only apply 
one time for each Contract.                                                     

   CALCULATION OF THE DEATH BENEFIT -- If the Contract Owner or Annuitant dies
before the Annuity Commencement Date and a Death Benefit is payable to the      
Beneficiary, the Death Benefit will be calculated as of the date we receive     
written notification of Due Proof of Death. THE DEATH BENEFIT REMAINS INVESTED  
IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT ACCORDING TO YOUR LAST INSTRUCTIONS UNTIL THE PROCEEDS  
ARE PAID OR WE RECEIVE NEW SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE BENEFICIARY. DURING 
THE TIME PERIOD BETWEEN OUR RECEIPT OF WRITTEN NOTIFICATION OF DUE PROOF OF     
DEATH AND OUR RECEIPT OF THE COMPLETE SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS, THE CALCULATED   
DEATH BENEFIT WILL BE SUBJECT TO MARKET FLUCTUATIONS. UPON RECEIPT OF COMPLETE  
SETTLEMENT INSTRUCTIONS, WE WILL CALCULATE THE PAYABLE AMOUNT.                  

   Any Annuity payments made on or after the date of death, but before receipt
of written notification of Due Proof of Death will be recovered by us from the  
Payee.

DEATH ON OR AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE                                 

  If, on or after the Annuity Commencement Date, the Contract Owner dies and
the Annuitant is living, the Beneficiary becomes the Contract Owner. If the     
Annuitant dies and the Contract Owner is living, the Contract Owner becomes the 
Beneficiary.                                                                    

If the Annuitant dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date, a Death
Benefit may be paid or payments may continue under the following annuity payment
options:                                                                        

X  Life Annuity with Cash Refund                                                

X  Life Annuity with payments for a Period Certain                              

X  Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity with payments for a Period Certain and  

X  payments for a Period Certain.                                               

SETTLEMENT PROVISIONS 

 You select an Annuity Commencement Date which will not be deferred beyond
the Valuation Day immediately following the later of the Annuitant's 90th       
birthday or the end of the tenth Contract Year. You may elect a later Annuity   
Commencement Date if we allow and subject to the laws and regulations then in   
effect. If the Contract is sold as part of a Charitable Remainder Trust, the    
Annuity Commencement Date may be deferred to the Annuitant's 100th birthday. The
Annuity Commencement Date may be changed from time to time, but ANY CHANGE MUST 
BE WITHIN 30 DAYS PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH ANNUITY PAYMENTS ARE SCHEDULED TO  
BEGIN.                                                                          

    You also elect in writing an annuity payment option, which may be any of the
options described below or any annuity payment option then being offered by us. 
The annuity payment option may not be changed on or after the Annuity           
Commencement Date. The Contract contains the six annuity payment options        
described below and the Annuity Proceeds Settlement Option.                     

For Qualified Contracts, the following annuity payment options are only 
available if the guaranteed payment period is less than the life expectancy of  
the Annuitant at the time the option becomes effective. The Annuity Proceeds    
Settlement option is available for Qualified Contracts only if the guaranteed   
payment period is less than the life expectancy of the Beneficiary at the time  
the option becomes effective. Such life expectancies are computed on the basis  
of the mortality table prescribed by the IRS, or if none is prescribed, the     
mortality table in use by us. If you do not elect otherwise, fixed dollar amount
annuity payments will begin automatically on the Annuity Commencement Date,     
under the Life Annuity Payment Option.                                          

For Non-Qualified Contracts, if you do not elect otherwise, fixed dollar
amount annuity payments will automatically begin on the Annuity Commencement    
Date under the annuity payment option Life Annuity with payments for a Period   
Certain of 10 years. For Contracts and Contracts issued in Texas, if you do not 
elect otherwise, fixed dollar amount annuity payments will begin automatically  
on the Annuity Commencement Date, under the Life Annuity Payment Option.        

With the exception of the option Payments for a Period Certain, if the  
variable dollar amount payment is selected, no Surrenders are permitted after   
annuity payments begin.                                                         

ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS                                                         

  OPTION 1 -- LIFE ANNUITY where we make Annuity payments for as long as the
Annuitant lives.                                                                

-  Payments under this option STOP UPON THE DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT, even if the 
Annuitant dies after one payment.                                         

   OPTION 2 -- LIFE ANNUITY with Cash Refund where we make payments during the
life of the Annuitant and when the Annuitant dies, we pay the remaining value to
the Beneficiary. The remaining value is calculated at the time we receive Due   
Proof of Death by subtracting the annuity payments already made from the        
Contract Value less any applicable Premium Taxes applied to this annuity payment
option.                                                                         

-  This option is only available if you select payments using a VARIABLE DOLLAR 
AMOUNT PAYMENT OPTION WITH THE 5% AIR OR FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY      
PAYMENTS.                                                                 

 OPTION 3 -- LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN where we make
payments to you for the life of the Annuitant but you are at least guaranteed   
payments for a time period you select which is a minimum of 5 years and a       
maximum of 100 years minus your Annuitant's age.                                

-  If the Annuitant dies prior to the end of the period selected, we will pay   
your Beneficiary the present value of the remaining payments, either in a 
lump sum payment or we will continue payments until the end of the period 
selected.                                                                 

 OPTION 4 -- JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR ANNUITY where we make payments during
the lifetimes of the Annuitant and another designated individual called the     
Joint Annuitant At the time of electing this Annuity Option, the Contract Owner 
may elect reduced payments over the remaining lifetime of the survivor.         

-  Payments under this option STOP UPON THE DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT AND JOINT    
 ANNUITANT, even if the Annuitant and Joint Annuitant die after one payment.

   OPTION 5 -- JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD
CERTAIN where we make payments during the lifetime of the Annuitant and a Joint 
Annuitant, and we guarantee that those payments for a time period you select    
which is not less than 5 years and no more than 100

years minus the younger Annuitant's age. At the time of electing this Annuity   
Option, the Contract Owner may elect reduced payments over the remaining        
lifetime of the survivor.                                                       

-  If the Annuitant and Joint Annuity die prior to the end of the period        
selected, we will pay your Beneficiary the present value of the remaining 
   payments, either in a lump sum payment or We will continue payments until the
end of the period selected.                                               

 OPTION 6 -- PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN where we agree to make payments
for a specified time. The minimum period that you can select is 10 years during 
the first two Contract years and 5 years after the second Contract Anniversary. 
The maximum period that you can select is 100 years minus your Annuitant's age. 

-  If you select this option under a variable dollar amount payment, YOU MAY    
 SURRENDER YOUR ANNUITY after annuity payments have started and we will give
you the present value of the remaining payments less any applicable       
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.                                         

-  If the Annuitant dies prior to the end of the period selected, we will pay   
your Beneficiary the present value of the remaining payments, either in a 
lump sum payment or we will continue payments until the end of the period 
selected.                                                                 

   OPTION 7 -- THE ANNUITY PROCEEDS SETTLEMENT OPTION. Proceeds from the Death
Benefit may be left with us for at least 5 years from the date of the Contract  
Owner's death if the death occurs prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. These 
proceeds will remain in the Account(s) to which they were allocated at the time 
of death unless the Beneficiary elects to reallocate them. Full or partial      
Surrenders may be made at any time. In the event of a complete Surrender, the   
remaining value will equal the Contract Value of the proceeds left with us,     
minus any partial Surrenders. This option may not be available under certain    
Contracts issued in connection with Qualified Plans.                            

WE MAY OFFER OTHER ANNUITY PAYMENT OPTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME.           

ANNUITY PAYMENTS

    When your decide to begin to take payments, we calculate your Contract Value
minus any Premium Tax which we must pay and, unless you instruct us otherwise,  
we apply that amount to a variable annuity with the same Sub-Account values. You
may however, choose to have your Contract Value applied to a fixed annuity      
instead.                                                                        

IMPORTANT -- YOU SHOULD CONSIDER THE QUESTION OF ALLOCATION OF CONTRACT 
VALUES (LESS APPLICABLE PREMIUM TAXES) AMONG ACCOUNTS TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT      
ANNUITY PAYMENTS ARE BASED ON THE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVE BEST SUITED TO YOUR    
NEEDS FOR RETIREMENT.                                                           

  ANNUITY PAYMENTS -- The minimum Annuity payment is $50. No election may be
made which results in a first payment of less than $50. If at any time Annuity  
payments are or become less than $50, we have the right to change the frequency 
of payment to intervals so that payments will at least be $50. For Contracts    
issued in the State of New York, the minimum monthly Annuity payment is $20. If 
any amount due is less than the minimum amount per year, we make such other     
settlement as may be equitable to the Payee.                                    

  All Annuity payments under any option will occur the same day of the month
as the Annuity Commencement Date, based on the payment frequency selected by    
you. Available payment frequencies include monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and  
annual. The payment frequency may be changed within 30 days prior to the        
anniversary of your Annuity Commencement Date.                                  

ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You select the Annuity Commencement Date in
your application or order request. The Annuity Calculation Date will be no more 
than five Valuation Days before the Annuity Commencement Date.                  

  ANNUITY CALCULATION DATE -- On the Annuity Calculation Date, your Contract
Value less any applicable Premium Tax is applied to purchase Annuity Units of   
the Sub-Accounts selected by you. The first Annuity payment is computed using   
the value of these Annuity Units as of the Annuity Calculation Date.            

    INCOME PAYMENT DATES -- All Annuity payments after the first Annuity payment
are computed and payable as of the Income Payment Dates. These dates are the    
same day of the month as the Annuity Commencement Date, based on the Annuity    
payment frequency selected by you. They are also shown on the specification page
of your Contract. You may choose from monthly, quarterly, semi-annual and annual
payments. The Annuity payment frequency may not be changed once selected by you.

 IN THE EVENT THAT YOU DO NOT SELECT A PAYMENT FREQUENCY, ANNUITY PAYMENTS
WILL BE MADE MONTHLY.                                                           
VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENTS                                                       

    THE FIRST VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENT -- Variable Annuity payments are periodic
payments we pay to your designated Payee, the amount of which varies from one   
Income Payment Date to the next as a function of the net investment performance 
of the Sub-Accounts selected by you. The dollar amount of the first Variable    
Annuity payment depends on the annuity payment option chosen, the age of the    
Annuitant, the gender of the Annuitant (if applicable), the amount of Contract  
Value less applicable Premium Tax

applied to purchase the Annuity payments, and the applicable annuity purchase   
rates based on the 1983a Individual Annuity Mortality table using projection    
scale G projected to the year 2000 and an AIR of not less than 3.0%.            

    The dollar amount of the first Variable Annuity payment attributable to each
Sub-Account is determined by dividing the dollar amount of the Contract Value   
less applicable Premium Tax applied to that Sub-Account on the Annuity          
Calculation Date by $1,000 and multiplying the result by the payment factor in  
the Contract for the selected annuity payment option. The dollar value of the   
first Variable Annuity payment is the sum of the first Variable Annuity payments
attributable to each Sub-Account.                                               

  ANNUITY UNITS -- The number of Annuity Units attributable to a Sub-Account
is derived by dividing the first Variable Annuity payment attributable to that  
Sub-Account by the Annuity Unit value for that Sub-Account for the Valuation    
Period ending on the Annuity Calculation Date or during which the Annuity       
Calculation Date falls if the Valuation Period does not end on such date. The   
number of Annuity Units attributable to each Sub-Account under a Contract       
remains fixed unless there is a transfer of Annuity Units between Sub-Accounts. 

    SUBSEQUENT VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENTS -- The dollar amount of each subsequent
Variable Annuity payment attributable to each Sub-Account is calculated on the  
Income Payment Date. It is determined by multiplying (a) by (b), where:         

(a) is the number of Annuity Units of each Sub-Account credited under the       
Contract and                                                            

(b) is the Annuity Unit value (described below) for that Sub-Account.           

   The total subsequent Variable Annuity payments equal the sum of the amounts
attributable to each Sub-Account.                                               

   When an Income Payment Date falls on a day that is not a Valuation Day, the
Income Payment is computed as of the prior Valuation Day. If the date of the    
month elected does not occur in a given month, i.e., the 29th, 30th, or 31st of 
a month, the payment will be computed as of the last Valuation Day of the month.

    The Annuity Unit value of each Sub-Account for any Valuation Period is equal
to (a) multiplied by (b) multiplied by (c) where:                               

(a) is the Net Investment Factor for the Valuation Period for which the Annuity 
Unit value is being calculated;                                         

(b) is the Annuity Unit value for the preceding Valuation Period; and           

(c) is the Annuity Unit Factor                                                  

   The Annuity Unit Factor neutralizes the AIR percentage (3%, 5%, or 6%). The
daily Annuity Unit Factor corresponding to the AIR percentages of 3%, 5%, and 6%
are 0.999919, 0.999866, and 0.999840, respectively                              

   THE ASSUMED INVESTMENT RETURN (AIR) -- The Annuity Unit value will increase
or decrease from one Income Payment Date to the next in direct proportion to the
net investment return of the Sub-Account(s) supporting the Variable Annuity     
payments, less an adjustment to neutralize the selected AIR. Dividing what would
otherwise be the Annuity Unit value by the AIR factor is necessary in order to  
adjust the change in the Annuity Unit value (resulting from the Net Investment  
Factor) so that the Annuity Unit value only changes to the extent that the Net  
Investment Factor represents a rate of return greater than or less than the AIR 
selected by you. Without this adjustment, the Net Investment Factor would       
decrease the Annuity Unit value to the extent that such value represented an    
annualized rate of return of less than 0.0% and increase the Annuity Unit value 
to the extent that such value represented an annualized rate of return of       
greater than 0.0%.                                                              

   The Contract permits Contract Owners to select one of three AIRs: 3%, 5% or
6%. A higher AIR will result in a higher initial payment, a more slowly rising  
series of subsequent payments when actual investment performance (minus any     
deductions and expenses) exceeds the AIR, and a more rapid drop in subsequent   
payments when actual investment performance (minus any deductions and expenses) 
is less than the AIR. The following examples may help clarify the impact of     
selecting one AIR over another:                                                 

- If you select a 3% AIR and if the net investment return of the Sub-Account for
  an Annuity payment period is equal to the pro-rated portion of the 3% AIR, the
  Variable Annuity payment attributable to that Sub-Account for that period will
equal the Annuity payment for the prior period. To the extent that such net 
investment return exceeds an annualized rate of return of 3% for a payment  
period, the Annuity payment for that period will be greater than the Annuity
payment for the prior period and to the extent that such return for a period
falls short of an annualized rate of 3%, the Annuity payment for that period
will be less than the Annuity payment for the prior period.                 

- If you select a 5% AIR and if the net investment return of the Sub-Account for
  an Annuity payment period is equal to the pro-rated portion of the 5% AIR, the
  Variable Annuity payment attributable to that Sub-Account for that period will
equal the Annuity payment for the prior period. To the extent that such net 
investment return exceeds an annualized rate of return of 5% for a payment  
period, the Annuity payment for that period will be greater than the Annuity
payment for the prior period and to the extent that such return for a period
falls short of an annualized rate of 5%, the Annuity payment for that period
will be less than the Annuity payment for the prior period.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If you select a 6% AIR and if the net investment return of the Sub-Account for
  an Annuity payment period is equal to the pro-rated portion of the 6% AIR, the
  Variable Annuity payment attributable to that Sub-Account for that period will
equal the Annuity payment for the prior period. To the extent that such net 
investment return exceeds an annualized rate of return of 6% for a payment  
period, the Annuity payment for that period will be greater than the Annuity
payment for the prior period and to the extent that such return for a period
falls short of an annualized rate of 6%, the Annuity payment for that period
will be less than the Annuity payment for the prior period.                 

LEVEL VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENTS WOULD BE PRODUCED IF THE INVESTMENT RATE
RETURNS REMAINED CONSTANT AND EQUAL TO THE AIR. IN FACT, PAYMENTS WILL VARY UP  
OR DOWN AS THE INVESTMENT RATE VARIES UP OR DOWN FROM THE AIR.                  

   EXCHANGE (TRANSFER) OF ANNUITY UNITS -- After the Annuity Calculation Date,
you may exchange (i.e., transfer) the dollar value of a designated number of    
Annuity Units of a particular Sub-Account for an equivalent dollar amount of    
Annuity Units of another Sub-Account. On the date of the transfer, the dollar   
amount of a Variable Annuity payment generated from the Annuity Units of either 
Sub-Account would be the same. Transfers are executed as of the day Hartford    
receives a written request for a transfer. For guidelines refer to Sub-Account  
Value Transfers Before and After the Annuity Commencement Date.                 

FIXED DOLLAR ANNUITY -- Fixed Annuity payments are determined at        
annuitization by multiplying the Contract Value (less applicable Premium Taxes) 
by a rate to be determined by Hartford which is no less than the rate specified 
in the Fixed Annuity option tables in the Contract. The Annuity payment will    
remain level for the duration of the Annuity. Any Fixed Annuity allocation may  
not be changed.                                                                 

OTHER INFORMATION 

  ASSIGNMENT -- Ownership of this Contract is generally assignable. However,
if the Contracts are issued pursuant to some form of Qualified Plan, it is      
possible that the ownership of the Contracts may not be transferred or assigned 
depending on the type of tax-qualified retirement plan involved. An assignment  
of a Non-Qualified Contract may subject the Contract Values or assignment       
proceeds to income taxes and certain penalty taxes.                             

CONTRACT MODIFICATION -- The Annuitant may not be changed; however, the 
Contingent Annuitant may be changed at any time prior to the Annuity            
Commencement Date by sending us written notice. We may modify the Contract, but 
no modification will effect the amount or term of any Contract unless a         
modification is required to conform the Contract to applicable Federal or State 
law. No modification will effect the method by which Contract Values are        
determined.                                                                     

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS

   What are some of the federal tax consequences which affect these Contracts?

GENERAL 
   SINCE THE TAX LAW IS COMPLEX AND SINCE TAX CONSEQUENCES WILL VARY ACCORDING
TO THE ACTUAL STATUS OF THE CONTRACT OWNER INVOLVED AND THE TYPE OF PLAN UNDER  
WHICH THE CONTRACT IS PURCHASED, LEGAL AND TAX ADVICE MAY BE NEEDED BY A PERSON,
TRUSTEE OR OTHER ENTITY CONTEMPLATING THE PURCHASE OF A CONTRACT DESCRIBED      
HEREIN.                                                                         

   It should be understood that any detailed description of the federal income
tax consequences regarding the purchase of these Contracts cannot be made in    
this Prospectus and that special tax rules may be applicable with respect to    
certain purchase situations not discussed herein. In addition, no attempt is    
made here to consider any applicable state or other tax laws. For detailed      
information, a qualified tax adviser should always be consulted. The discussion 
here and in Appendix I, commencing on page 29, is based on Hartford's           
understanding of existing federal income tax laws as they are currently         
interpreted.                                                                    

TAXATION OF HARTFORD AND
THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT

  The Separate Account is taxed as part of Hartford which is taxed as a life
insurance company in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as      
amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, the Separate Account will not be taxed as a  
"regulated investment company" under subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code.     
Investment income and any realized capital gains on the assets of the Separate  
Account are reinvested and are taken into account in determining the value of   
the Accumulation and Annuity Units (See "Accumulation Unit Values" commencing on
page 15). As a result, such investment income and realized capital gains are    
automatically applied to increase reserves under the Contract.                  

   No taxes are due on interest, dividends and short-term or long-term capital
gains earned by the Separate Account with respect to Qualified or Non-Qualified 
Contracts.

TAXATION OF ANNUITIES -- GENERAL PROVISIONS 
AFFECTING PURCHASERS OTHER THAN 
QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS

Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation of annuities in general.    

1. NON-NATURAL PERSONS, CORPORATIONS, ETC.                                    

Section 72 contains provisions for Contract Owners which are non-natural
persons. Non-natural persons include corporations, trusts, limited liability    
companies and partnerships. The annual net increase in the value of the Contract
is currently includable in the gross income of a non-natural person, unless the 
non-natural person holds the Contract as an agent for a natural person. There   
are additional exceptions from current inclusion for (i) certain annuities held 
by structured settlement companies, (ii) certain annuities held by an employer  
with respect to a terminated qualified retirement plan and (iii) certain        
immediate annuities. A non-natural person which is a tax-exempt entity for      
federal tax purposes will not be subject to income tax as a result of this      
provision.                                                                      

  If the Contract Owner is not an individual, the primary Annuitant shall be
treated as the Contract Owner for purposes of making distributions which are    
required to be made upon the death of the Contract Owner. If there is a change  
in the primary Annuitant, such change shall be treated as the death of the      
Contract Owner.                                                                 

2. OTHER CONTRACT OWNERS (NATURAL PERSONS)                                    

A Contract Owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the Contract 
until an amount is received or deemed received, e.g., in the form of a lump sum 
payment (full or partial value of a Contract) or as Annuity payments under the  
settlement option elected.                                                      

The provisions of Section 72 of the Code concerning distributions are   
summarized briefly below. Also summarized are special rules affecting           
distributions from Contracts obtained in a tax-free exchange for other annuity  
contracts or life insurance contracts which were purchased prior to August 14,  
1982.                                                                           

A. DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE                 

i. Total premium payments less amounts received which were not includable in  
   gross income equal the "investment in the contract" under Section 72 of the
Code.                                                                   

ii. To the extent that the value of the Contract (ignoring any surrender      
charges except on a full Surrender) exceeds the "investment in the    
contract," such excess constitutes the "income on the contract."      

iii. Any amount received or deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement 
  Date (e.g., upon a partial Surrender) is deemed to come first from any
     such "income on the contract" and then from "investment in the contract,"
     and for these purposes such "income on the contract" shall be computed by
      reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph 2.c. below. As a result,
  any such amount received or deemed received (1) shall be includable in
gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such
     "income on the contract," and (2) shall not be includable in gross income
to the extent that such amount does exceed any such "income on the  
    contract." If at the time that any amount is received or deemed received
      there is no "income on the contract" (e.g., because the gross value of the
Contract does not exceed the "investment in the contract" and no    
   aggregation rule applies), then such amount received or deemed received
will not be includable in gross income, and will simply reduce the  
"investment in the contract."                                       

 iv. The receipt of any amount as a loan under the Contract or the assignment or
   pledge of any portion of the value of the Contract shall be treated as an
amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a. and the next     
subparagraph b.                                                       

v. In general, the transfer of the Contract, without full and adequate        
 consideration, will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this
subparagraph a. and the next subparagraph b. This transfer rule does not
    apply, however, to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident
to divorce.                                                             

B. DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE. Annuity payments made 
periodically after the Annuity Commencement Date are includable in gross income 
to the extent the payments exceed the amount determined by the application of   
the ratio of the "investment in the contract" to the total amount of the        
payments to be made after the Annuity Commencement Date (the "exclusion ratio").

i. When the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the       
    exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the Annuity
 Commencement Date, any additional payments (including Surrenders) will be
entirely includable in gross income.                                    

ii. If the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the Annuitant and,
     as of the date of death, the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross
income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the   
     contract as of the Annuity Commencement Date, then the remaining portion of
     unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable
year of the Annuitant.                                                

iii. Generally, non-periodic amounts received or deemed received after the    
 Annuity Commencement Date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and
     shall be fully includable in gross income. However, upon a full Surrender
after such date, only the excess of the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   amount received (after any surrender charge) over the remaining "investment
      in the contract" shall be includable in gross income (except to the extent
 that the aggregation rule referred to in the next subparagraph c. may
apply).                                                             

C. AGGREGATION OF TWO OR MORE ANNUITY CONTRACTS. Contracts issued after 
October 21, 1988 by the same insurer (or affiliated insurer) to the same        
Contract Owner within the same calendar year (other than certain contracts held 
in connection with a tax-qualified retirement arrangement) will be treated as   
one annuity Contract for the purpose of determining the taxation of             
distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. An annuity contract       
received in a tax-free exchange for another annuity contract or life insurance  
contract may be treated as a new Contract for this purpose. Hartford believes   
that for any annuity subject to such aggregation, the values under the Contracts
and the investment in the contracts will be added together to determine the     
taxation under subparagraph 2.a., above, of amounts received or deemed received 
prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Surrenders will first be treated as     
surrenders of income until all of the income from all such Contracts is         
withdrawn. As of the date of this Prospectus, there are no regulations          
interpreting this provision.                                                    

   D. 10% PENALTY TAX -- APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN SURRENDERS AND ANNUITY PAYMENTS

i. If any amount is received or deemed received on the Contract (before or    
  after the Annuity Commencement Date), the Code applies a penalty tax equal
to ten percent of the portion of the amount includable in gross income, 
unless an exception applies.                                            

ii. The 10% penalty tax will not apply to the following distributions         
(exceptions vary based upon the precise plan involved):               

  1.  Distributions made on or after the date the recipient has attained the
age of 59 1/2                                                   

2.  Distributions made on or after the death of the holder or where the 
holder is not an individual, the death of the primary annuitant.

3.  Distributions attributable to a recipient's becoming disabled.      

    4.  A distribution that is part of a scheduled series of substantially equal
        periodic payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the recipient (or
the joint lives or life expectancies of the recipient and the   
recipient's Beneficiary).                                       

  5.  Distributions of amounts which are allocable to the "investment in the
contract" prior to August 14, 1982 (see next subparagraph e.).  

E. SPECIAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING CONTRACTS OBTAINED THROUGH A TAX-FREE   
      EXCHANGE OF OTHER ANNUITY OR LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS PURCHASED PRIOR TO
AUGUST 14, 1982.                                                  

  If the Contract was obtained by a tax-free exchange of a life insurance or
annuity Contract purchased prior to August 14, 1982, then any amount received or
deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date shall be deemed to come  
(1) first from the amount of the "investment in the contract" prior to August   
14, 1982 ("pre-8/14/82 investment") carried over from the prior Contract, (2)   
then from the portion of the "income on the contract" (carried over to, as well 
as accumulating in, the successor Contract) that is attributable to such        
pre-8/14/82 investment, (3) then from the remaining "income on the contract" and
(4) last from the remaining "investment in the contract." As a result, to the   
extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed such        
pre-8/14/82 investment, such amount is not includable in gross income., In      
addition, to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not   
exceed the sum of (a) such pre-8/14/82 investment and (b) the "income on the    
contract" attributable thereto, such amount is not subject to the 10% penalty   
tax. In all other respects, amounts received or deemed received from such post- 
exchange Contracts are generally subject to the rules described in this         
subparagraph 3.                                                                 

F. REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS                                               

i. Death of Contract Owner or Primary Annuitant                               

  Subject to the alternative election or spouse beneficiary provisions in ii
or iii below:                                                           

    1.  If any Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date and
    before the entire interest in the Contract has been distributed, the
   remaining portion of such interest shall be distributed at least as
        rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of
such death;                                                     

2.  If any Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Commencement Date, the
        entire interest in the Contract will be distributed within 5 years after
such death; and                                                 

  3.  If the Contract Owner is not an individual, then for purposes of 1. or
      2. above, the primary annuitant under the Contract shall be treated as
    the Contract Owner, and any change in the primary annuitant shall be
        treated as the death of the Contract Owner. The primary annuitant is the
       individual, the events in the life of whom are of primary importance in
affecting the timing or amount of the payout under the Contract.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ii. Alternative Election to Satisfy Distribution Requirements                 

   If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner described in i. above is
   payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary, such beneficiary
    may elect to have the portion distributed over a period that does not extend
beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary. The election and 
payments must begin within a year of the death.                         

iii. Spouse Beneficiary                                                       
   If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner is payable to or for the
  benefit of his or her spouse, and the Annuitant or Contingent Annuitant is
  living, such spouse shall be treated as the Contract Owner of such portion
for purposes of section i. above.                                       

3. DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS                                               

  Section 817 of the Code provides that a variable annuity contract will not
be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments   
made by the Separate Account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified  
in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury Department. If a      
Contract is not treated as an annuity contract, the Contract Owner will be      
subject to income tax on the annual increases in cash value.                    

The Treasury Department has issued diversification regulations which    
generally require, among other things, that no more than 55% of the value of the
total assets of the segregated asset account underlying a variable contract is  
represented by any one investment, no more than 70% is represented by any two   
investments, no more than 80% is represented by any three investments, and no   
more than 90% is represented by any four investments. In determining whether the
diversification standards are met, all securities of the same issuer, all       
interests in the same real property project, and all interests in the same      
commodity are each treated as a single investment. In addition, in the case of  
government securities, each government agency or instrumentality shall be       
treated as a separate issuer.                                                   

   A Separate Account must be in compliance with the diversification standards
on the last day of each calendar quarter or within 30 days after the quarter    
ends. If an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification   
requirements, the company may comply within a reasonable period and avoid the   
taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis. However, either the company or 
the Contract Owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which the
diversification requirements were not met.                                      

Hartford monitors the diversification of investments in the Separate    
Accounts and tests for diversification as required by the Code. Hartford intends
to administer all contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a    
manner that will maintain adequate diversification.                             

4. OWNERSHIP OF THE ASSETS IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT                            

    In order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral, assets
in the segregated asset accounts supporting the variable contract must be       
considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the variable contract
owner. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has issued several rulings which    
discuss investor control. The IRS has ruled that certain incidents of ownership 
by the contract owner, such as the ability to select and control investments in 
a Separate Account, will cause the contract owner to be treated as the owner of 
the assets for tax purposes.                                                    

Further, in the explanation to the temporary Section 817 diversification
regulations, the Treasury Department noted that the temporary regulations "do   
not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of  
the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor, rather    
than the insurance company, to be treated as the owner of the assets in the     
Account." The explanation further indicates that "the temporary regulations     
provide that in appropriate cases a segregated asset account may include        
multiple sub-accounts, but do not specify the extent to which policyholders may 
direct their investments to particular sub-accounts without being treated as the
owners of the underlying assets. Guidance on this and other issues will be      
provided in regulations or revenue rulings under Section 817(d), relating to the
definition of variable contract." The final regulations issued under Section 817
did not provide guidance regarding investor control, and as of the date of this 
prospectus, no other such guidance has been issued. Further, Hartford does not  
know if or in what form such guidance will be issued. In addition, although     
regulations are generally issued with prospective effect, it is possible that   
regulations may be issued with retroactive effect. Due to the lack of specific  
guidance regarding the issue of investor control, there is necessarily some     
uncertainty regarding whether a Contract Owner could be considered the owner of 
the assets for tax purposes. Hartford reserves the right to modify the          
contracts, as necessary, to prevent Contract Owners from being considered the   
owners of the assets in the Separate Accounts.                                  

FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING

   The portion of a distribution which is taxable income to the recipient will
be subject to federal income tax withholding, pursuant to Section 3405 of the   
Code. The application of this provision is summarized below:                    

1. NON-PERIODIC DISTRIBUTIONS                                                 

   The portion of a non-periodic distribution which constitutes taxable income
will be subject to federal income tax withholding unless the recipient elects   
not to have taxes withheld. If an election not to have taxes withheld is not    
provided, 10% of the taxable distribution will be withheld as

HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                               27
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

federal income tax. Election forms will be provided at the time distributions   
are requested. If the necessary election forms are not submitted to Hartford,   
Hartford will automatically withhold 10% of the taxable distribution.           

 2. PERIODIC DISTRIBUTIONS (DISTRIBUTIONS PAYABLE OVER A PERIOD GREATER THAN ONE
YEAR)                                                                   

    The portion of a periodic distribution which constitutes taxable income will
be subject to federal income tax withholding as if the recipient were married   
claiming three exemptions. A recipient may elect not to have income taxes       
withheld or have income taxes withheld at a different rate by providing a       
completed election form. Election forms will be provided at the time            
distributions are requested.                                                    

GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING QUALIFIED
RETIREMENT PLANS

   The Contract may be used for a number of qualified retirement plans. If the
Contract is being purchased with respect to some form of qualified retirement   
plan, please refer to Appendix I commencing on page 29 for information relative 
to the types of plans for which it may be used and the general explanation of   
the tax features of such plans.                                                 

ANNUITY PURCHASES BY NONRESIDENT ALIENS 
AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS

The discussion above provides general information regarding U.S. federal
income tax consequences to annuity purchasers that are U.S. citizens or         
residents. Purchasers that are not U.S. citizens or residents will generally be 
subject to U.S. federal income tax and withholding on annuity distributions at a
30% rate, unless a lower treaty rate applies. In addition, purchasers may be    
subject to state Premium Tax, other state and/or municipal taxes, and taxes that
may be imposed by the purchaser's country of citizenship or residence.          
Prospective purchasers are advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser      
regarding U.S., state, and foreign taxation with respect to an annuity purchase.

MISCELLANEOUS 

HOW CONTRACTS ARE SOLD

  Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") serves as Principal
Underwriter for the securities issued with respect to the Separate Account. HSD 
is an affiliate of Hartford. Hartford's parent company indirectly owns 100% of  
HSD. The principal business address of HSD is the same as that of Hartford.     

   The securities will be sold by salesperson of HSD who represent Hartford as
insurance and variable annuity agents and who are registered representatives of 
Broker-Dealers who have entered into distribution agreements with HSD.          

  HSD is registered with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of the National Association of          
Securities Dealers, Inc.                                                        

    Commissions will be paid by Hartford and will not be more than 6% of premium
payments. From time to time, Hartford may pay or permit other promotional       
incentives, in cash or credit or other compensation.                            

Broker-dealers or financial institutions are compensated according to a 
schedule set forth by HSD and any applicable rules or regulations for variable  
insurance compensation. Compensation is generally based on premium payments made
by policyholders or contract owners. This compensation is usually paid from the 
sales charges described in this Prospectus.                                     

In addition, a broker-dealer or financial institution may also receive  
additional compensation for, among other things, training, marketing or other   
services provided. HSD, its affiliates or Hartford may also make compensation   
arrangements with certain broker-dealers or financial institutions based on     
total sales by the broker-dealer or financial institution of insurance products.
These payments, which may be different for different broker-dealers or financial
institutions, will be made by HSD, its affiliates or Hartford out of their own  
assets and will not effect the amounts paid by the policyholders or contract    
owners to purchase, hold or Surrender variable insurance products.              

YEAR 2000 

   The Year 2000 issue relates to the ability or inability of computer systems
to properly process information and data containing or related to dates         
beginning with the year 2000 and beyond. The Year 2000 issue exists because,    
historically, many computer systems that are in use today were developed years  
ago when a year was identified using a two-digit field rather than a four-digit 
field. As information and data containing or related to the century date are    
introduced to computer hardware, software and other systems, date sensitive     
systems may recognize the year 2000 as 1900, or not at all, which may result in 
computer systems processing information incorrectly. This, in turn, may         
significantly and adversely affect the integrity and reliability of information 
databases and may result in a wide variety of adverse consequences to a company.
In addition, Year 2000 problems that occur with third parties with which a      
company does business, such as suppliers, computer vendors and others, may also 
adversely affect any given company.                                             

 As an insurance and financial services company, Hartford has thousands of
individual and business customers

that have purchased or invested in insurance policies, annuities, mutual funds  
and other financial products. Nearly all of these policies and products contain 
date sensitive data, such as policy expiration dates, birth dates, premium      
payments dates and the like. In addition, Hartford has business relationships   
with numerous third parties that affect virtually all aspects of its business,  
including, without limitation, suppliers, computer hardware and software        
vendors, insurance agents and brokers, securities broker-dealers and other      
distributors of financial products.                                             

Beginning in 1990, Hartford began working on making its computer systems
Year 2000 ready, either by installing new programs or by replacing systems. In  
January 1998, Hartford commenced a company-wide program to further identify,    
assess and remediate the impact of Year 2000 problems in all of Hartford's      
business segments. Hartford currently anticipates that this internal program    
will be substantially completed by the end of 1998, and testing of computer     
systems will continue through 1999.                                             

    In addition, as part of its Year 2000 program, Hartford is identifying third
parties with which it has significant business relations in order to attempt to 
assess any potential impact on Hartford as a result of such third-party Year    
2000 issues and remediation plans. Hartford currently anticipates that it will  
substantially complete this evaluation by the end of 1998, and will conduct     
systems testing with certain third parties through 1999. Hartford does not have 
control over these third parties and, as a result, Hartford cannot currently    
determine to what extent future operating results may be adversely affected by  
the failure of these third parties to successfully address their Year 2000      
issues. Hartford will continue to assess Year 2000 risk exposures related to its
own operations and its third-party relationships and is in the process of       
developing contingency plans.                                                   

   The costs of addressing the Year 2000 issue that have been incurred through
the six months ended June 30, 1998 have not been material to Hartford's         
financial condition or results of operations. Hartford will continue to incur   
costs related to its Year 2000 efforts and does not anticipate that the costs to
be incurred will be material to its financial condition or results of           
operations.                                                                     

LEGAL MATTERS 

There are no material legal proceedings pending to which the Separate   
Account is a party.

APPENDIX I
INFORMATION REGARDING TAX-QUALIFIED PLANS 

The tax rules applicable to tax-qualified contract owners, including    
restrictions on contributions and distributions, taxation of distributions and  
tax penalties, vary according to the type of plan as well as the terms and      
conditions of the plan itself. Various tax penalties may apply to contributions 
in excess of applicable limits, distributions prior to age 59 1/2 (subject to   
certain exceptions), distributions which do not conform to applicable           
commencement and minimum distribution rules, and certain other transactions with
respect to tax-qualified plans. Therefore, this summary does not attempt to     
provide more than general information about the tax rules associated with use of
a Contract by a tax-qualified retirement plan. Contract owners, plan            
participants and beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights and benefits of any
person to benefits may be controlled by the terms and conditions of the         
tax-qualified retirement plan itself, regardless of the terms and conditions of 
a Contract, but that Hartford is not bound by the terms and conditions of such  
plans to the extent such terms conflict with a Contract, unless Hartford        
specifically consents to be bound. Additionally, some tax-qualified retirement  
plans are subject to distribution and other requirements which are not          
incorporated into Hartford's administrative procedures. Contract owners,        
participants and beneficiaries are responsible for determining that             
contributions, distributions and other transactions comply with applicable law. 
Because of the complexity of these rules, owners, participants and beneficiaries
are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors as to specific tax             
consequences.                                                                   

  A. TAX-QUALIFIED PENSION OR PROFIT-SHARING PLANS -- Provisions of the Code
permit eligible employers to establish tax-qualified pension or profit sharing  
plans (described in Section 401(a) and 401(k), if applicable, and exempt from   
taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code), and Simplified Employee Pension     
Plans (described in Section 408(k)). Such plans are subject to limitations on   
the amount that may be contributed, the persons who may be eligible to          
participate and the time when distributions must commence. Employers intending  
to use these contracts in connection with tax-qualified pension or              
profit-sharing plans should seek competent tax and other legal advice.          

B. TAX SHELTERED ANNUITIES UNDER SECTION 403(B) -- Section 403(b) of the
Code permits public school employees and employees of certain types of          
charitable, educational and scientific organizations, as specified in Section   
501(c)(3) of the Code, to purchase annuity contracts, and, subject to certain   
limitations, to exclude such contributions from gross income. Generally, such   
contributions may not exceed the lesser of $10,000 (indexed) or 20% of an       
employee's "includable compensation" for such employee's most recent full year  
of employment, subject to other adjustments. Special provisions under the Code  
may allow some employees to elect a different overall limitation.               

Tax-sheltered annuity programs under Section 403(b) are subject to a    
PROHIBITION AGAINST DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO             
CONTRIBUTIONS MADE PURSUANT TO A SALARY REDUCTION AGREEMENT, unless such        
distribution is made:                                                           

(1) after the participating employee attains age 59 1/2;                        

(2) upon separation from service;                                               

(3) upon death or disability; or                                                

(4) in the case of hardship (and in the case of hardship, any income            
attributable to such contributions may not be distributed).             

    Generally, the above restrictions do not apply to distributions attributable
to cash values or other amounts held under a Section 403(b) contract as of      
December 31, 1988.                                                              

C. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER SECTION 457 -- Employees and       
independent contractors performing services for eligible employers may have     
contributions made to an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan of their employer  
in accordance with the employer's plan and Section 457 of the Code. Section 457 
places limitations on contributions to Eligible Deferred Compensation Plans     
maintained by a State or other tax-exempt organization. For these purposes, the 
term "State" means a State, a political sub-division of a State, and an agency  
or instrumentality of a State or political sub-division of a State. Generally,  
the limitation is 33 1/3% of includable compensation (typically 25% of gross    
compensation) or, for 1998, $8,000 (indexed), whichever is less. Such a plan may
also provide for additional "catch-up" deferrals during the three taxable years 
ending before a Participant attains normal retirement age.                      

An employee electing to participate in an Eligible Deferred Compensation
Plan should understand that his or her rights and benefits are governed strictly
by the terms of the plan and that the employer is the legal owner of any        
contract issued with respect to the plan. The employer, as owner of the         
contract(s), retains all voting and redemption rights which may accrue to the   
contract(s) issued with respect to the plan. The participating employee should  
look to the terms of his or her plan for any charges in regard to participating 
therein other than those disclosed in this Prospectus. Participants should also 
be aware that effective

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

August 20, 1996, the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 requires that all
assets and income of an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan established by a    
governmental employer which is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or  
any agency or instrumentality of a State or political subdivision of a State,   
must be held in trust (or under certain specified annuity contracts or custodial
accounts) for the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries.    
Special transition rules apply to such Eligible governmental Deferred           
Compensation Plans already in existence on August 20, 1996, and provide that    
such plans need not establish a trust before January 1, 1999. However, this     
requirement of a trust does not apply to amounts under an Eligible Deferred     
Compensation Plan of a tax-exempt (non-governmental) organization, and such     
amounts will be subject to the claims of such tax-exempt employer's general     
creditors.                                                                      

 In general, distributions from an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan are
prohibited under Section 457 of the Code unless made after the participating    
employee attains age 70 1/2, separates from service, dies, or suffers an        
unforeseeable financial emergency. Present federal tax law does not allow       
tax-free transfers or rollovers for amounts accumulated in a Section 457 plan   
except for transfers to other Section 457 plans in limited cases.               

  D. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES UNDER SECTION 408 -- Section 408 of the
Code permits eligible individuals to establish individual retirement programs   
through the purchase of Individual Retirement Annuities ("IRAs"). IRAs are      
subject to limitations on the amount that may be contributed, the contributions 
that may be deducted from taxable income, the persons who may be eligible and   
the time when distributions may commence. Also, distributions from certain      
qualified plans may be "rolled-over" on a tax-deferred basis into an IRA.       

   The Contracts may be offered as SIMPLE IRAs in connection with a SIMPLE IRA
plan of an employer. Special rollover rules apply to SIMPLE IRAs. Amounts can be
rolled over from one SIMPLE IRA to another SIMPLE IRA. However, amounts can be  
rolled over from a SIMPLE IRA to a regular IRA only after two years have expired
since the participant first commenced participation in your employer's SIMPLE   
IRA plan. Amounts cannot be rolled over to a SIMPLE IRA from a qualified plan or
a regular IRA. Hartford is a non-designated financial institution.              

  Beginning in 1998, the Contracts may be offered as ROTH IRAs under Section
408A of the Code. Contributions to a ROTH IRA are not deductible. Subject to    
special limitations, a regular IRA may be converted into a ROTH IRA or a        
distribution from a regular IRA may be rolled over to a ROTH IRA. However, a    
conversion or a rollover from a regular IRA to a ROTH IRA is not excludable from
gross income. If certain conditions are met, qualified distributions from a ROTH
IRA are tax-free.                                                               

 E. FEDERAL TAX PENALTIES AND WITHHOLDING -- Distributions from retirement
plans are generally taxed under Section 72 of the Code. Under these rules, a    
portion of each distribution may be excludable from income. The excludable      
amount is the portion of the distribution which bears the same ratio as the     
after-tax contributions bear to the expected return.                            

1. PREMATURE DISTRIBUTION                                                       

  Distributions from a tax-qualified plan before the Participant attains age
59 1/2 are generally subject to an additional penalty tax equal to 10% of the   
taxable portion of the distribution. The 10% penalty does not apply to          
distributions made after the employee's death, on account of disability, for    
eligible medical expenses and distributions in the form of a life annuity and,  
except in the case of an IRA, certain distributions after separation from       
service after age 55. For these purposes, a life annuity means a scheduled      
series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy 
of the Participant (or the joint lives or life expectancies of the Participant  
and Beneficiary).                                                               

    In addition, effective for distributions made from an IRA after December 31,
1997, there is no such penalty tax on distributions that do not exceed the      
amount of certain qualifying higher education expenses, as defined by Section   
72(t)(7) of the Code, or which are qualified first-time home buyer distributions
meeting the requirements of Section 72(t)(8) of the Code.                       

   If you are a participant in a SIMPLE IRA plan, you should be aware that the
10% penalty tax discussed above is increased to 25% with respect to non-exempt  
premature distributions made from your SIMPLE IRA during the first two years    
following the date you first commenced participation in any SIMPLE IRA plan of  
your employer.                                                                  

2. MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION TAX                                                     

    If the amount distributed is less than the minimum required distribution for
the year, the Participant is subject to a 50% tax on the amount that was not    
properly distributed.                                                           

  An individual's interest in a tax-qualified retirement plan generally must
be distributed, or begin to be distributed, not later than April 1 of the       
calendar year following the later of (i) the calendar year in which the         
individual attains age 70 1/2 or (ii) the calendar year in which the individual 
retires from service with the employer sponsoring the plan ("required beginning 
date"). However, the required beginning date for an individual who is a five (5)
percent owner (as defined in the Code), or who is the owner of an IRA, is April 
1 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual      
attains age 70 1/2. The entire interest of the Participant must be distributed  
beginning no later than the required beginning date over a period which may not 
extend beyond a maximum of the life expectancy of

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the Participant and a designated Beneficiary. Each annual distribution must     
equal or exceed a "minimum distribution amount" which is determined by dividing 
the account balance by the applicable life expectancy. This account balance is  
generally based upon the account value as of the close of business on the last  
day of the previous calendar year. In addition, minimum distribution incidental 
benefit rules may require a larger annual distribution.                         

 If an individual dies before reaching his or her required beginning date,
the individual's entire interest must generally be distributed within five years
of the individual's death. However, this rule will be deemed satisfied, if      
distributions begin before the close of the calendar year following the         
individual's death to a designated Beneficiary (or over a period not extending  
beyond the life expectancy of the beneficiary). If the Beneficiary is the       
individual's surviving spouse, distributions may be delayed until the individual
would have attained age 70 1/2.                                                 

  If an individual dies after reaching his or her required beginning date or
after distributions have commenced, the individual's interest must generally be 
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at
the time of the individual's death.                                             

3. WITHHOLDING                                                                  

 In general, distributions from IRAs and plans described in Section 457 of
the Code are subject to regular wage withholding rules. Periodic distributions  
from other tax-qualified retirement plans that are made for a specified period  
of 10 or more years or for the life or life expectancy of the participant (or   
the joint lives or life expectancies of the participant and beneficiary) are    
generally subject to federal income tax withholding as if the recipient were    
married claiming three exemptions. The recipient of periodic distributions may  
generally elect not to have withholding apply or to have income taxes withheld  
at a different rate by providing a completed election form.                     

Other distributions from such other tax-qualified retirement plans are  
generally subject to mandatory income tax withholding at the flat rate of 20%   
unless such distributions are:                                                  

a)  the non-taxable portion of the distribution;                                

b)  required minimum distributions; or                                          

c)  direct transfer distributions.                                              

 Direct transfer distributions are direct payments to an IRA or to another
eligible retirement plan under Code section 401(a)(31).

APPENDIX II -- OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT -- EXAMPLES 
EXAMPLE 1                                                                       

   Assume that you deposited a premium payment of $100,000 on January 1, 1998.
If you made no Surrenders during the year, your Interest Accumulation Value on  
January 1, 1999 would be $105,000, calculated as follows:                       

                                                                [Download Table]

$105,000      Interest Accumulation Value on January 1, 1999.

  If you elected the Optional Death Benefit, you would be guaranteed a Death
Benefit payment equal to at least $105,000.                                     

EXAMPLE 2                                                                       

   Assume that you deposited a premium payment of $100,000 on January 1, 1998.
If you Surrendered $10,000 on January 1, 1999 and your Contract Value           
immediately prior to the partial Surrender was $100,000, your Interest          
Accumulation Value on January 1, 1999 would be $94,500, calculated as follows:  

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                               
 $100,000       Premium deposited on January 1, 1998
5,000       Interest accumulated at 5% per year on premiums
 ($10,500)      Adjustment for partial Surrender*              
---------                                                      
  $94,500       Interest Accumulation Value on January 1, 1999.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* The Adjustment for the partial Surrender reduces the Interest Accumulation    
Value by an amount equal to the proportion of the partial Surrender to the  
  Contract Value prior to the partial Surrender. Therefore, in this example, the
  $10,500 reduction to the Interest Accumulation Value is calculated by dividing
 the amount of the Surrender, $10,000, by the Contract Value paid prior to the
 Surrender, $100,000. This ratio (Surrender DIVIDED BY Contract Value prior to
Surrender) is multiplied by the Interest Accumulation Value prior to        
Surrenders and results in the adjustment for the partial Surrender.         

                                                                [Download Table]
                                                                 
Interest Accumulation Value prior to Surrenders........  $105,000
Multiplied by ratio of Surrenders  DIVIDED BY Contract           
 Value prior to Surrenders                                       
 ($10,000 DIVIDED BY 100,000)..........................   X   .10

Adjustment for the partial Surrender...................  $ 10,500

The Surrender reduced the Interest Accumulation Value by $10,500        
($105,000-94,500).

SECTION 403(b)(11) ACKNOWLEDGMENT FORM

   The Hartford Variable Annuity Contract which you have recently purchased is
subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.          
Contributions to the Contract after December 31, 1988 and any increases in cash 
value after December 31, 1988 may not be distributed to you unless you have:

Contracts on a continuous basis.                                                

HSD is an affiliate of Hartford.  Hartford's parent company indirectly owns 100%

National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD").                      

 CALCULATION OF YIELD AND RETURN

YIELD OF THE MONEY MARKET FUND SUB-ACCOUNT.  As summarized in the Prospectus    
under the heading "Performance Related Information," the yield of the Money     
Market Fund Sub-Account for a seven day period (the "base period") will be      
computed by determining the "net change in value" (calculated as set forth      
below) of a hypothetical account having a balance of one accumulation unit of   
the Sub-Account at the beginning of the period, subtracting a hypothetical      
charge reflecting deductions from Contract Owner accounts, and dividing the     
difference by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period to   
obtain the base period return, and then multiplying the base period return by   
365/7 with the resulting yield figure carried to the nearest hundredth of one   
percent.  Net changes in value of a hypothetical account will include net       
investment income of the account (accrued daily dividends as declared by the    
underlying funds, less daily expense charges of the account) for the period, but
will not include realized gains or losses or unrealized appreciation or         
depreciation on the underlying fund shares.                                     

The effective yield is calculated by compounding the base period return by      
adding 1, raising the sum to a power equal to 365/7 and subtracting 1 from the  
result, according to the following formula:                                     

                   365/7
Effective Yield = [(Base Period Return + 1)      ] - 1                  

THE MONEY MARKET FUND SUB-ACCOUNT'S YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD WILL VARY IN      
RESPONSE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND IN THE EXPENSES OF THE           
SUB-ACCOUNT. THE CURRENT YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD REFLECT RECURRING CHARGES ON 
THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT LEVEL, INCLUDING THE MAXIMUM ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE.       

The yield and effective yield for the seven day period ending December 31, 1997 
for the

* Yield and effective yield for the seven day period ending December 31, 1997.  

YIELDS OF BOND FUND, HIGH YIELD FUND, AND MORTGAGE SECURITIES FUND SUB-ACCOUNTS.
As summarized in the Prospectus under the heading "Performance Related
Information," yields of the above Sub-Accounts will be computed by annualizing a
recent month's net investment income, divided by a Fund share's net asset value 
on the last trading day of that month.  Net changes in the value of a           
hypothetical account will assume the change in the underlying mutual fund's "net
asset value per share" for the same period in addition to the daily expense     
charge assessed, at the sub-account level for the respective period.  The       
Sub-Accounts' yields will vary from time to time depending upon market          
conditions and, the composition of the underlying funds' portfolios. Yield      
should also be considered relative to changes in the value of the Sub-Accounts' 
shares and to the relative risks associated with the investment objectives and  
policies of the underlying Fund.                                                

THE YIELD REFLECTS RECURRING CHARGES ON THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT LEVEL, INCLUDING   
THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE.                                                     

Yield calculations of the Sub-Accounts used for illustration purposes reflect   
the interest earned by the Sub-Accounts, less applicable asset charges assessed 
against a Contract Owner's account over the base period.  Yield quotations based
on a 30 day period were computed by dividing the dividends and interests earned 
during the period by the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the 
period, according to the following formula:                                     

Example:

Current Yield Formula for the Sub-Account  2[((A-B)/(CD) + 1)  - 1]             

Where    A = Dividends and interest earned during the period.                   
B = Expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements).  
     C = The average daily number of units outstanding during the period
that were entitled to receive dividends.            
        D = The maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the period.

**  Yield quotation based on a 30 day period ended December 31, 1997.           

The yield for the Hartford High Yield Fund is not yet available because the Fund
is new.  At any time in the future, yields and total return may be higher or    
lower than past yields and there can be no assurance that any historical results
will continue.                                                                  

The method of calculating yields described above for these Sub-Accounts differs 
from the method used by the Sub-Accounts prior to May 1, 1988.  The denominator 
of the fraction used to calculate yield was previously the average unit value   
for the period calculated.  That denominator will hereafter be the unit value of
the Sub-Accounts on the last trading day of the period calculated.              

CALCULATION OF TOTAL RETURN.  As summarized in the Prospectus under the heading 
"Performance Related Information," total return is a measure of the change in   
value of an investment in a Sub-Account over the period covered.  The formula   
for total return used herein includes three steps: (1) calculating the value of 
the hypothetical initial investment of $1,000 as of the end of the period by    
multiplying the total number of units owned at the end of the period by the unit
value per unit on the last trading day of the period; (2) assuming redemption at
the end of the period and deducting any applicable contingent deferred sales    
charge and (3) dividing this account value for the hypothetical investor by the 
initial $1,000 investment and annualizing the result for periods of less than   
one year.  Total return will be calculated for one year, five years and ten     
years or some other relevant periods if a Sub-Account has not been in existence 
for at least ten years.                                                         

The following are the standardized average annual total return quotations for   
the Sub-Accounts for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997.  No information is
included for the Global Leaders Fund, Growth and Income Fund, and High Yield    
Fund Sub-Accounts because as of December 31, 1997, the Sub-Account had not      
commenced operations.

*Figures represent performance since inception for Sub-Accounts in      
existence for less than 10 years, or performance for 10 years for Sub-Accounts  
in existence for more than 10 years.                                            

In addition to the standardized total return, the Sub-Account may advertise a   
non-standardized total return.  This figure will usually be calculated for one  
year, five years, and ten years or other periods. Non-standardized total return 
is measured in the same manner as the standardized total return described above,
except that the contingent deferred sales charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee 
are not deducted.  Therefore, non-standardized total return for a Sub-Account is
higher than standardized total return for a Sub-Account.                        

The following are the non-standardized annualized total return quotations for   
the Sub-Accounts for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1997. No information is 
included for the Global Leaders Fund, Growth and Income Fund, and High Yield    
Fund Sub-Accounts because as of December 31, 1997, the Sub-Account had not      
commenced

 PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS

YIELD AND TOTAL RETURN.  Each Sub-Account may from time to time include its     
total return in advertisements or in information furnished to present or        
prospective shareholders.  Each Sub-Account may from time to time include its   
yield and total return in advertisements or information furnished to present or 
prospective shareholders.  Each Sub-Account may from time to time include in    
advertisements its total return (and yield in the case of certain Sub-Accounts) 
the ranking of those performance figures relative to such figures for groups of 
other annuities analyzed by Lipper Analytical Services and Morningstar, Inc. as 
having the same investment objectives.

Sub-Accounts against certain widely acknowledged outside standards or indices   
for stock and bond market performance.  The Standard & Poor's Composite Index of
500 Stocks (the "S&P 500") is a market value-weighted and unmanaged index       
showing the changes in the aggregate market value of 500 stocks relative to the 
base period 1941-43.  The S&P 500 is composed almost entirely of common stocks  
of companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the common stocks  
of a few companies listed on the American Stock Exchange or traded              
over-the-counter are included.  The 500 companies represented include 400       
industrial, 60 transportation and 40 financial services concerns.  The S&P 500  
represents about 80% of the market value of all issues traded on the New York   
Stock Exchange.                                                                 

The NASDAQ-OTC Composite Price Index (The "NASDAQ Index") is a market           
value-weighted and unmanaged index showing the changes in the aggregate market  
value of approximately 3,500 stocks relative to the base measure of 100.00 on   
February 5, 1971.  The NASDAQ Index is composed entirely of common stocks of    
companies traded over-the-counter and often through the National Association of 
Securities Dealers Automated Quotations ("NASDAQ") system.  Only those          
over-the-counter stocks having only one market maker or traded on exchanges are 
excluded.                                                                       

The Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE Index (the "EAFE Index") is an    
unmanaged index, which includes over 1,000 companies representing the stock     
markets of Europe,  Australia, New Zealand, and the Far East.  The EAFE Index is
weighted by market capitalization, and therefore, it has a heavy representation 
in countries with large stock markets, such as Japan.                           

The Shearson Lehman Government Bond Index (the "SL Government Index") is a      
measure of the market value of all public obligations of the U.S. Treasury; all 
publicly issued debt of all agencies of the U.S. Government and all             
quasi-federal corporations; and all corporate debt guaranteed by the U.S.       
Government.  Mortgage-backed securities, flower bonds and foreign targeted      
issues are not included in the SL Government Index.                             

The Shearson Lehman Government/Corporate Bond Index (the "SL                    
Government/Corporate Index") is a measure of the market value of approximately  
5,300 bonds with a face value currently in excess of $1.3 trillion.  To be      
included in the SL Government/Corporate Index, an issue must have amounts       
outstanding in excess of $1 million, have at least one year to maturity and be  
rated "Baa" or higher ("investment grade") by a nationally recognized rating    
agency.                                                                         

The Composite Index for Hartford Advisers Fund is comprised of the S&P 500      
(55%), the Lehman Government/Corporate Bond Index (35%), both mentioned above,  
and 90 Day U.S. Treasury Bills (10%).

Unless otherwise indicated, the principal business address of each the above    
individuals is P.O. Box 2999, Hartford, CT 06104-2999.                         

*Denotes Board of Directors.                                                    

Item 26.  Persons Controlled By or Under Common Control with the Depositor or   
Registrant
Filed herewith as Exhibit 16.

Item 27.  Number of Contract Owners                                             

      As of October 31, 1998, there were ______________ Contract Owners.

Item 28.  Indemnification                                                       

    Under Section 33-772 of the Connecticut General Statutes, unless
    limited by its certificate of incorporation, the Registrant must
    indemnify a director who was wholly successful, on the merits or
       otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he was a party
         because he is or was a director of the corporation against reasonable
expenses incurred by him in connection with the proceeding. 

The Registrant may indemnify an individual made a party to a
proceeding because he is or was a director against liability
 incurred in the proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a
     manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
  interests of the Registrant, and, with respect to any criminal
  proceeding, had no reason to believe his conduct was unlawful.
       Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 33-771(a). Additionally, pursuant to Conn.
    Gen. Stat. Section 33-776, the Registrant may indemnify officers
       and employees or agents for liability incurred and for any expenses
      to which they becomes subject by reason of being or having been an
      employees or officers of the Registrant.  Connecticut law does not
      prescribe standards for the indemnification of officers, employees
     and agents and expressly states that their indemnification may be
   broader than the right of indemnification granted to directors.

 The foregoing statements are specifically made subject to the
detailed provisions of Section 33-770 et seq.               

Notwithstanding the fact that Connecticut law obligates the 
    Registrant to indemnify a only a director that was successful on
the merits in a suit, under Article VIII, Section 1 of the  
     Registrant's bylaws, the Registrant must indemnify both directors
     and officers of the Registrant for (1) any claims and liabilities
    to which they become subject by reason of being or having been a
directors or officers of the company and legal and (2) other
expenses

   incurred in defending against such claims, in each case, to the
extent such is consistent with statutory provisions.        

     Additionally, the directors and officers of Hartford and Hartford
     Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") are covered under a
   directors and officers liability insurance policy issued to The
       Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.  Such
       policy will reimburse the Registrant for any payments that it shall
       make to directors and officers pursuant to law and will, subject to
     certain exclusions contained in the policy, further pay any other
     costs, charges and expenses and settlements and judgments arising
from any proceeding involving any director or officer of the
     Registrant in his past or present capacity as such, and for which
    he may be liable, except as to any liabilities arising from acts
that are deemed to be uninsurable.                          

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
      Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and
   controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing
     provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in
the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such  
    indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act
    and is, therefore, unenforceable.  In the event that a claim for
       indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by
      the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer
     or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense
    of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
   officer or controlling person in connection with the securities
       being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its
 counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,
      submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
       such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in
  the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such
issue.                                                      

Item 29.  Principal Underwriters                                                

       (a)  HSD acts as principal underwriter for the following investment
companies:

This prospectus describes information you should know before you purchase Series
VIII and Series VIIIR of The Director variable annuity. Please read it carefully
before you purchase your variable annuity.


This variable annuity prospectus describes a contract between each Owner and
joint Owner ("you") and Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company or Hartford
Life Insurance Company ("us," "we" or "our"). This Contract is a flexible
premium, tax-deferred, variable annuity offered to both individuals and groups.
It is:


X  Flexible, because you may add Premium Payments at any time.


X  Tax-deferred, which means you don't pay taxes until you take money out or
until we start to make Annuity Payouts.


X  Variable, because the value of your Contract will fluctuate with the
performance of the underlying Funds.


At the time you purchase your Contract, you allocate your Premium Payment to
"Sub-Accounts." These are subdivisions of our Separate Account, an account that
keeps your Contract assets separate from our company assets. The Sub-Accounts
then purchase shares of mutual funds set up exclusively for variable annuity or
variable life insurance products. These are not the same mutual funds that you
buy through your stockbroker or through a retail mutual fund. They may have
similar investment strategies and the same portfolio managers as retail mutual
funds. This Contract offers you Funds with investment strategies ranging from
conservative to aggressive and you may pick those Funds that meet your
investment goals and risk tolerance. The Funds are part of the following
Portfolio companies: Hartford Series Fund, Inc., and Hartford HLS Series Fund
II, Inc.


You may also allocate some or all of your Premium Payment to the Fixed
Accumulation Feature, which pays an interest rate guaranteed for a certain time
period from the time the Premium Payment is made. Premium Payments allocated to
the Fixed Accumulation Feature are not segregated from our company assets like
the assets of the Separate Account.


If you decide to buy this Contract, you should keep this prospectus for your
records. You can also call us at 1-800-862-6668 to get a Statement of Additional
Information, free of charge. The Statement of Additional Information contains
more information about this Contract and, like this prospectus, is filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). We have included the Table of
Contents for the Statement of Additional Information at the end of this
prospectus.


Although we file the prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information with
the SEC, the SEC doesn't approve or disapprove these securities or determine if
the information in this prospectus is truthful or complete. Anyone who
represents that the SEC does these things may be guilty of a criminal offense.
This prospectus and the Statement of Additional Information can also be obtained
from the SEC's website (http://www.sec.gov).



This Contract IS NOT:



-   A bank deposit or obligation


-   Federally insured


-   Endorsed by any bank or governmental agency


This Contract and its features may not be available for sale in all states.

initial Benefit Amount is your Premium Payments if you elected the benefit upon
purchase or your Contract Value on the date we add the benefit to your Contract
if you elect the benefit at a later date.


BENEFIT PAYMENT: The maximum guaranteed payment that can be made each Contract
Year under The Hartford's Principal First and The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred. The initial Benefit Payment is equal to a percentage of your Premium
Payments if you elect the benefit upon purchase or a percentage of your Contract
Value on the date we add the benefit to your Contract. The percentage is
different for The Hartford's Principal First and The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred. The Benefit Payment can never exceed the Benefit Amount.


CHARITABLE REMAINDER TRUST: An irrevocable trust, where an individual donor
makes a gift to the trust, and in return receives an income tax deduction. In
addition, the individual donor has the right to receive a percentage of the
trust earnings for a specified period of time.


CODE: The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.


COMMUTED VALUE: The present value of any remaining guaranteed Annuity Payouts.
This amount is calculated using the Assumed Investment Return for variable
dollar amount Annuity Payouts and a rate of return determined by us for fixed
dollar amount Annuity Payouts.


CONTINGENT ANNUITANT: The person you may designate to become the Annuitant if
the original Annuitant dies before the Annuity Commencement Date. You must name
a Contingent Annuitant before the original Annuitant's death.


CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE: The deferred sales charge that may apply when
you make a full or partial Surrender.


CONTRACT: The individual Annuity Contract and any endorsements or riders. Group
participants and some individuals may receive a certificate rather than a
Contract.


CONTRACT ANNIVERSARY: The anniversary of the date we issued your Contract. If
the Contract Anniversary falls on a Non-Valuation Day, then the Contract
Anniversary will be the next Valuation Day.


CONTRACT OWNER, OWNERS OR YOU: The owner or holder of the Contract described in
this prospectus including any joint Owner(s). We do not capitalize "you" in the
prospectus.

EXAMPLE



THIS EXAMPLE IS INTENDED TO HELP YOU COMPARE THE COST OF INVESTING IN THE
CONTRACT WITH THE COST OF INVESTING IN OTHER VARIABLE ANNUITY CONTRACTS. THE
EXAMPLE REFLECTS A DEDUCTION FOR ANY CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE, ANNUAL
MAINTENANCE FEE, MAXIMUM SEPARATE ACCOUNT ANNUAL EXPENSES INCLUDING THE HIGHEST
COMBINATION OF OPTIONAL CHARGES, AND THE HIGHEST TOTAL ANNUAL FUND OPERATING
EXPENSES OF THE UNDERLYING FUNDS. THE EXAMPLE DOES NOT REFLECT THE DEDUCTION OF
ANY APPLICABLE PREMIUM TAXES, INCOME TAXES OR TAX PENALTIES YOU MAY BE REQUIRED
TO PAY IF YOU SURRENDER YOUR CONTRACT. IF YOU DO NOT SELECT ALL OF THE OPTIONAL
BENEFITS, YOUR EXPENSES WOULD BE LOWER THAN THOSE SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE.


THE EXAMPLE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE EXPENSES
AND ACTUAL EXPENSES MAY BE GREATER OR LESS THAN THOSE SHOWN. IN THE FOLLOWING
EXAMPLE TABLE, HARTFORD ASSUMES A CONTRACT VALUE OF $40,000 TO ILLUSTRATE THE
CHARGES THAT WOULD BE DEDUCTED. OUR AVERAGE CONTRACT VALUE IS $80,000, BUT WE
USE A SMALLER CONTRACT VALUE SO THAT WE CAN SHOW YOU THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE
DEDUCTIONS. THE EXAMPLE ASSUMES THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE WILL ALWAYS BE
DEDUCTED IF THE CONTRACT IS SURRENDERED. IF YOUR CONTRACT VALUE IS $50,000 OR
MORE, HARTFORD WAIVES THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE, SO THE EXAMPLE SHOWS CHARGES
THAT ARE HIGHER THAN YOU WOULD HAVE TO PAY. WE CHANGE THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE
FOR A $40,000 CONTRACT VALUE INTO A PERCENTAGE TO MORE EASILY CALCULATE THE
CHARGES. THE PERCENTAGE WE USE IS 0.075%.




THE EXAMPLE ASSUMES THAT YOU INVEST $10,000 IN THE CONTRACT FOR THE TIME PERIODS
INDICATED. THE EXAMPLE ALSO ASSUMES THAT YOUR INVESTMENT HAS A 5% RETURN EACH
YEAR AND ASSUMES THE HIGHEST TOTAL ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES. ALTHOUGH YOUR
ACTUAL COSTS MAY BE HIGHER OR LOWER, BASED ON THESE ASSUMPTIONS, YOUR COSTS
WOULD BE:


(1)  If you Surrender your Contract at the end of the applicable time period:






1 year
3 years
5 years
10 years








(2)  If you annuitize at the end of the applicable time period:








1 year
3 years
5 years
10 years








(3)  If you do not Surrender your Contract:








1 year
3 years
5 years
10 years









CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION





When Premium Payments are credited to your Sub-Accounts, they are converted into
Accumulation Units by dividing the amount of your Premium Payments, minus any
Premium Taxes, by the Accumulation Unit Value for that day. For more information
on how Accumulation Unit Values are calculated see "How is the value of my
Contract calculated before the Annuity Commencement Date?." Please refer to
Appendix V for information regarding the minimum and maximum class of
Accumulation Unit Values. All classes of Accumulation Unit Values may be
obtained, free of charge, by calling us at 1-800-862-6668.

HIGHLIGHTS




HOW DO I PURCHASE THIS CONTRACT?



You must complete our application or order request and submit it to us for
approval with your first Premium Payment. Your first Premium Payment must be at
least $1,000 and subsequent Premium Payments must be at least $500, unless you
take advantage of our InvestEase(R) Program or are part of certain retirement
plans.


-     For a limited time, usually within ten days after you receive your
Contract, you may cancel your Contract without paying a Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge. You may bear the investment risk for your Premium
Payment prior to our receipt of your request for cancellation.



WHAT TYPE OF SALES CHARGE WILL I PAY?



You don't pay a sales charge when you purchase your Contract. We may charge you
a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge when you partially or fully Surrender your
Contract. The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will depend on the amount you
choose to Surrender and the length of time the Premium Payment you made has been
in your Contract.


The percentage used to calculate the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is equal
to:








NUMBER OF YEARS FROM     CONTINGENT DEFERRED
   PREMIUM PAYMENT           SALES CHARGE
-----------------------------------------------
          1                        7%
          2                        7%
          3                        7%
          4                        6%
          5                        5%
          6                        4%
          7                        3%
      8 or more                    0%








You won't be charged a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge on:



X  The Annual Withdrawal Amount



X  Premium Payments or earnings that have been in your Contract for more than
seven years


X  Distributions made due to death


X  Distributions under a program for substantially equal periodic payments made
for your life or life expectancy


X  Most payments we make to you as part of your Annuity Payout



IS THERE AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE?



We deduct this $30 fee each year on your Contract Anniversary or when you fully
Surrender your Contract, if, on either of those dates, the value of your
Contract is less than $50,000.



WHAT CHARGES WILL I PAY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?



In addition to the Annual Maintenance Fee, you pay the following charges each
year:


-   MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE -- This charge is deducted daily and is
equal to an annual charge of 1.15% of your Contract Value invested in the
Sub-Accounts.


-   ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES -- These are charges for the underlying
Funds. See the Funds' prospectuses for more complete information.



WHAT CHARGES WILL I PAY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS IF I ELECT OPTIONAL BENEFITS?



-   MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT CHARGE -- You may elect an optional Death Benefit for
an additional charge. We call the optional Death Benefit the "MAV/EPB Death
Benefit," which is short for "Maximum Anniversary Value/Earnings Protection
Benefit Death Benefit." If you elect the MAV/EPB Death Benefit, we will
deduct an additional charge on a daily basis that is equal to an annual
charge of 0.30% of your Contract Value invested in the Sub-Accounts. Once
you elect this benefit, you cannot cancel it and we will continue to deduct
the charge until we begin to make Annuity Payouts.


-   THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST CHARGE -- The Hartford's Principal First is
an option that can be elected at an additional charge. If you elect The
Hartford's Principal First, we will deduct an additional charge on a daily
basis based on your Contract Value invested in the Sub-Accounts. Once you
elect this benefit, you cannot cancel it and we will continue to deduct the
charge until we begin to make Annuity Payouts.


-   THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED CHARGE -- The Hartford's Principal
First Preferred is an option that can be elected at an additional charge. If
you elect The Hartford's Principal First Preferred, we will deduct an
additional charge on a daily basis that is equal to an annual charge of
0.20% of your Contract Value invested in the Sub-Accounts.


Charges and fees may have a significant impact on Contract Values and the
investment performance of Sub-Accounts. This impact may be more significant with
Contracts with lower Contract Values.



CAN I TAKE OUT ANY OF MY MONEY?



You may Surrender all or part of the amounts you have invested at any time
before we start making Annuity Payouts. Once Annuity Payouts begin, you may take
full or partial Surrenders under the Payments for a Period Certain, Life Annuity
with Payments for a Period Certain or the Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity
with Payments for a Period Certain Annuity Options.


-     You may have to pay income tax on the money you take out and, if you
Surrender before you are age 59 1/2, you may have to pay a federal income
tax penalty.

-     You may have to pay a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge on the money you
Surrender.






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                            9






WILL HARTFORD PAY A DEATH BENEFIT?



There is a Death Benefit if the Contract Owner, joint Contract Owner or the
Annuitant die before we begin to make Annuity Payouts. The Death Benefit will be
calculated as of the date we receive a certified death certificate or other
legal document acceptable to us. The Death Benefit amount will remain invested
in the Sub-Accounts and Fixed Accumulation Feature according to your last
instructions and will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying Funds.


You may purchase this Contract with either the Asset Protection Death Benefit or
the Premium Protection Death Benefit. You cannot choose both. We will issue your
Contract with the Asset Protection Death Benefit unless you choose the Premium
Protection Death Benefit.


We describe the Asset Protection Death Benefit and the Premium Protection Death
Benefit in the Death Benefit Section of the prospectus.


You may also elect an optional Death Benefit when you purchase your Contract at
an additional charge. We describe the optional Death Benefit in the Death
Benefit Section of the prospectus.



WHAT ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?



When it comes time for us to make payouts, you may choose one of the following
Annuity Payout Options: Life Annuity, Life Annuity with Payments for a Period
Certain, Life Annuity with a Cash Refund, Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity,
Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity with Payments for a Period Certain and
Payments for a Period Certain. We may make other Annuity Payout Options
available at any time.


You must begin to take payments before the Annuitant's 90th birthday or the end
of the 10th Contract Year, whichever comes later, unless you elect a later date
to begin receiving payments subject to the laws and regulations then in effect
and our approval. If you do not tell us what Annuity Payout Option you want
before that time, we will make Automatic Annuity Payouts under the Life Annuity
with Payments for a Period Certain Payout Option with a ten-year period certain
payment option.


Depending on the investment allocation of your Contract in effect on the Annuity
Commencement Date, we will make Automatic Annuity Payouts that are:


-   fixed dollar amount Automatic Annuity Payouts,


-   variable dollar amount Automatic Annuity Payouts, or


-   a combination of fixed dollar amount and variable dollar amount Automatic
Annuity Payouts.


You may not choose a fixed dollar amount Annuity Payout if you purchase your
Contract in Oregon or Pennsylvania.

insurance and individual and group annuities in every state as well as the
District of Columbia (except that, Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company

Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company was originally incorporated under
the laws of Wisconsin on January 9, 1956, and subsequently redomiciled to

cross guarantees the obligations of the other. We are ultimately controlled by
The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., one of the largest financial
service providers in the United States.



THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT



We set aside and invest the assets of some of our annuity contracts, including
this Contract, in a Separate Account. These Separate Accounts are registered as
a unit investment trust under the 1940 Act. This registration does not involve
supervision by the SEC of the management or the investment practices of a
Separate Account or us. Separate Accounts meet the definition of "Separate
Account" under federal securities law. The Separate Accounts referenced in this
prospectus hold only assets for variable annuity contracts. These Separate
Accounts:


-   Hold assets for your benefit and the benefit of other Contract Owners, and
the persons entitled to the payouts described in the Contract.


-   Are not subject to the liabilities arising out of any other business we may

investment performance of any of our other Separate Accounts.


-   May be subject to liabilities from a Sub-Account of a Separate Account that
holds assets of other variable annuity contracts offered by a Separate
Account, which are not described in this prospectus.


-   Are credited with income and gains, and takes losses, whether or not
realized, from the assets they hold without regard to our other income,
gains or loss.

you make to us.

We do not guarantee the investment results of any of the underlying Funds. Since
each underlying Fund has different investment objectives, each is subject to
different risks. These risks and the Funds' expenses are more fully described in
the Funds' prospectus, and the Funds' Statement of Additional Information which
may be ordered from us. The Funds' prospectus should be read in conjunction with
this prospectus before investing.


The Funds may not be available in all states.


MIXED AND SHARED FUNDING -- Shares of the Funds may be sold to our other
separate accounts and our insurance company affiliates or other unaffiliated
insurance companies to serve as the underlying investment for both variable
annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, a practice known as
"mixed and shared funding." As a result, there is a possibility that a material
conflict may arise between the interests of Contract Owners, and of owners of
other contracts whose contract values are allocated to one or more of these
other separate accounts investing in any one of the Funds. In the event of any
such material conflicts, we will consider what action may be appropriate,
including removing the Fund from the Separate Account or replacing the Fund with
another underlying fund. There are certain risks associated with mixed and
shared funding. These risks are disclosed in the Funds' prospectus.


VOTING RIGHTS -- We are the legal owners of all Fund shares held in the Separate
Account and we have the right to vote at the Fund's shareholder meetings. To the
extent required by federal securities laws or regulations, we will:


-   Notify you of any Fund shareholders' meeting if the shares held for your
Contract may be voted.


-   Send proxy materials and a form of instructions that you can use to tell us
how to vote the Fund shares held for your Contract.


-   Arrange for the handling and tallying of proxies received from Contract
Owners.


-   Vote all Fund shares attributable to your Contract according to instructions
received from you, and


-   Vote all Fund shares for which no voting instructions are received in the
same proportion as shares for which instructions have been received.


If any federal securities laws or regulations, or their present interpretation,
change to permit us to vote Fund shares on our own, we may decide to do so. You
may attend any shareholder meeting at which shares held for your Contract may be
voted. After we begin to make Annuity Payouts to you, the number of votes you
have will decrease.


SUBSTITUTIONS, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS OF FUNDS -- We may, subject to any
applicable law, make certain changes to the Funds offered under your contract.
We may, in our sole discretion, establish new Funds. New Funds will be made
available to existing Contract Owners as we determine appropriate. We may also
close one or more Funds to additional Premium Payments or transfers from
existing Sub-Accounts.


We may eliminate the shares of any of the Funds from the Contract for any reason
and we may substitute shares of another registered investment company for the
shares of any Fund already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the
Separate Account. To the extent required by the Investment Company Act of 1940
(the "1940 Act"), substitutions of shares attributable to your interest in a
Fund will not be made until we have the approval of the Commission and we have
notified you of the change.


In the event of any substitution or change, we may, by appropriate endorsement,
make any changes in the Contract necessary or appropriate to reflect the
substitution or change. If we decide that it is in the best interest of the
Contract Owners, the Separate Account may be operated as a management company
under the 1940 Act or any other form permitted by law, may be de-registered
under the 1940 Act in the event such registration is no longer required, or may
be combined with one or more other Separate Accounts.


FEES WE RECEIVE FROM FUNDS AND RELATED PARTIES -- We receive substantial and
varying administrative service payments and Rule 12b-1 fees from certain Funds
or related parties. These types of payments and fees are sometimes referred to
as "revenue sharing" payments. We consider these payments and fees among a
number of factors when deciding to add or keep a fund on the menu of Funds that
we offer through the Contract. We collect these payments and fees under
agreements between us and a Fund's principal underwriter, transfer agent,
investment adviser and/or other entities related to the Fund. We expect to make
a profit on these fees.


The availability of these types of arrangements creates an incentive for us to
seek and offer Funds (and classes of shares of such Funds) that pay us revenue
sharing. Other funds (or available classes of shares) may have lower fees and
better overall investment performance.

TYPE OF PAYMENT       WHAT WE RECEIVE
Administrative        We receive compensation from certain Funds
Service Fees          or related parties (typically its
                      investment adviser or principal
                      underwriter) as compensation in exchange
                      for, or in consideration of savings
                      associated with, administrative services
                      and/or distribution services we provide
                      through one or more separate accounts. The
                      services generally include record keeping
                      (e.g., shareholder records), shareholder
                      services (e.g., maintenance of toll free
                      numbers, web access to statements and
                      associated staffing expenses), and the
                      mailing of periodic reports (e.g.,
                      confirmations, quarterly and annual, fund
                      prospectuses and supplements and proxy
                      materials), processing of purchase,
                      transfer and redemption transactions,
                      marketing assistance (e.g., development and
                      distribution or advertising materials or
                      sales literature) and distribution related
                      services (e.g., continuing education, trail
                      commissions and Marketing Expense
                      Allowances).
Rule 12b-1 Fees       We (or an affiliate) receive fees through
                      distribution and/or servicing plans adopted
                      pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act.
                      These fees compensate us (or an affiliate)
                      for distribution, marketing and servicing
                      functions.








As of December 31, 2005, we have entered into arrangements to receive
administrative service payments and/or Rule 12b-1 fees from each of the
following Fund complexes (or affiliated entities): AIM Advisors, Inc.,
AllianceBernstein Variable Products Series Funds & Alliance Bernstein Investment
Research and Management, Inc., American Variable Insurance Series & Capital
Research and Management Company, Branch Banking & Trust Company, Mentor

We are affiliated with Hartford Series Fund, Inc. and Hartford HLS Series Fund
II, Inc. (collectively, the "HLS Funds") based on our affiliation with their
investment advisers HL Investment Advisors, LLC and Hartford Investment
Management Company. In addition to investment advisory fees, we, or our other
insurance company affiliates, are paid to provide administrative, processing,
accounting and shareholder services for the HLS Funds.


Not all Fund complexes pay the same amounts of revenue sharing payments and/or
Rule 12b-1 fees. Therefore, the amount or fees we collect may be greater or
smaller based on the Funds you select. Revenue sharing and Rule 12b-1 fees do
not exceed 0.50% and 0.25%, respectively, of the annual percentage of the
average daily net assets (for instance, assuming that you invested in a Fund
that paid us the maximum fees and you maintained a hypothetical average balance
of $10,000, we would collect $75 from that Fund). We will endeavor to update
this listing annually and interim arrangements may not be reflected. For the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, revenue sharing and Rule 12b-1 fees did not
exceed $            million. These fees do not take into consideration indirect
benefits received by offering HLS Funds as investment options.






PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION



The Separate Account may advertise certain performance-related information
concerning the Sub-Accounts. Performance information about a Sub-Account is
based on the Sub-Account's past performance only and is no indication of future
performance.


When a Sub-Account advertises its standardized total return, it will usually be
calculated since the date of the Separate Accounts inception for one year, five
years, and ten years or some other relevant periods if the Sub-Account has not
been in existence for at least ten years. Total return is measured by comparing
the value of an investment in the Sub-Account at the beginning of the relevant
period to the value of the investment at the end of the period. Total return
calculations reflect a deduction for Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses, any
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, Separate Account Annual Expenses without any
optional charge deductions, and the Annual Maintenance Fee.


The Separate Account may also advertise non-standardized total returns that
pre-date the inception of the Separate Account. These non-standardized total
returns are calculated by assuming that the Sub-Accounts have been in existence
for the same periods as the underlying Funds and by taking deductions






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           13





for charges equal to those currently assessed against the Sub-Accounts.
Non-standardized total return calculations reflect a deduction for Total Annual
Fund Operating Expenses and Separate Account Annual Expenses without any
optional charge deductions, and do not include deduction for Contingent Deferred
Sales Charge or the Annual Maintenance Fee. This means the non-standardized
total return for a Sub-Account is higher than the standardized total return for
a Sub-Account. These non-standardized returns must be accompanied by
standardized returns.


If applicable, the Sub-Accounts may advertise yield in addition to total return.
This yield is based on the 30-day SEC yield of the underlying Fund less the
recurring charges at the Separate Account level.


A money market Sub-Account may advertise yield and effective yield. The yield of
a Sub-Account is based upon the income earned by the Sub-Account over a
seven-day period and then annualized, i.e. the income earned in the period is
assumed to be earned every seven days over a 52-week period and stated as a
percentage of the investment. Effective yield is calculated similarly but when
annualized, the income earned by the investment is compounded in the course of a
52-week period. Yield and effective yield include the recurring charges at the
Separate Account level.


We may provide information on various topics to Contract Owners and prospective
Contract Owners in advertising, sales literature or other materials. These
topics may include the relationship between sectors of the economy and the
economy as a whole and its effect on various securities markets, investment
strategies and techniques (such as systematic investing, Dollar Cost Averaging
and asset allocation), the advantages and disadvantages of investing in
tax-deferred and taxable instruments, customer profiles and hypothetical
purchase scenarios, financial management and tax and retirement planning, and
other investment alternatives, including comparisons between the Contract and
the characteristics of and market for such alternatives.



FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE



IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW: THIS PORTION OF THE PROSPECTUS RELATING
TO THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE IS NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933 ("1933 ACT") AND THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE IS NOT REGISTERED AS AN
INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE 1940 ACT. THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE OR ANY OF
ITS INTERESTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OR RESTRICTIONS OF THE 1933 ACT
OR THE 1940 ACT, AND THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS NOT
REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE. THE FOLLOWING
DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN
GENERALLY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS REGARDING THE
ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF DISCLOSURE.


Premium Payments and Contract Values allocated to the Fixed Accumulation Feature
become a part of our General Account assets. We invest the assets of the General
Account according to the laws governing the investments of insurance company
General Accounts. Premium Payments and Contract Values allocated to the Fixed
Accumulation Feature are available to our general creditors.


We guarantee that we will credit interest to amounts you allocate to the Fixed
Accumulation Feature at a rate that meets your state's minimum requirements. We
may change the minimum guaranteed interest rate subject only to applicable state
insurance law. We may credit interest at a rate in excess of the minimum
guaranteed interest rate. We will periodically publish the Fixed Accumulation
Feature interest rates currently in effect. There is no specific formula for
determining interest rates. Some of the factors that we may consider in
determining whether to credit excess interest are: general economic trends,
rates of return currently available and anticipated on our investments,
regulatory and tax requirements and competitive factors.


We will account for any deductions, Surrenders or transfers from the Fixed
Accumulation Feature on a "first-in first-out" basis. The Fixed Accumulation
Feature interest rates may vary by state.


IMPORTANT: ANY INTEREST CREDITED TO AMOUNTS YOU ALLOCATE TO THE FIXED
ACCUMULATION FEATURE IN EXCESS OF THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED INTEREST RATE WILL BE
DETERMINED AT OUR SOLE DISCRETION. YOU ASSUME THE RISK THAT INTEREST CREDITED TO
THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE MAY NOT EXCEED THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED INTEREST
RATE FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.


From time to time, we may credit increased interest rates under certain programs
established in our sole discretion.


We may restrict your ability to allocate Contract Values or Premium Payments to
the Fixed Accumulation Feature at any time in our sole discretion. We may close
the Fixed Accumulation Feature to new Premium Payments or transfers of existing
Contract Value. We may also make the Fixed Accumulation Feature available only
through enrollment in a program that we establish.

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PLUS ("DCA PLUS") PROGRAMS -- You may enroll in one or
more special pre-authorized transfer programs known as our DCA Plus Programs
(the "Programs"). Under these Programs, Contract Owners who enroll may allocate
a minimum of $5,000 of their Premium Payment into a Program (we may allow a
lower minimum Premium Payment for qualified plan transfers or rollovers,
including IRAs) and pre-authorize transfers from our Fixed Accumulation Feature
to any of the Sub-Accounts under either a 6-Month Transfer Program or 12-Month
Transfer Program subject to Program rules. The 6-Month Transfer Program and the
12-Month Transfer Program will generally have different credited interest rates.
Under the 6-Month Transfer Program, the interest rate can accrue up to 6 months
and all Premium Payments and accrued interest must be transferred from the
Program to the selected Sub-Accounts in 3 to 6 months. Under the 12-Month
Transfer Program, the interest rate can accrue up to 12 months and all Premium
Payments and accrued interest must be transferred to the selected Sub-Accounts
in 7 to 12 months. This will be accomplished by monthly transfers for the period
selected and with the final transfer of the entire amount remaining in the
Program.


The pre-authorized transfers will begin within 15 days of receipt of the Program
payment provided we receive complete enrollment instructions. If we do not
receive complete Program enrollment instructions within 15 days of receipt of
the initial Program payment, the Program will be voided and the entire balance
in the Program will be transferred to the Accounts designated by you. If you do
not designate an Account, we will return your Program payment to you for further
instruction. If your Program payment is less than the required minimum amount,
we will apply it to your Contract according to your instructions on record for a
subsequent Premium Payment.


Under the DCA Plus Programs, the credited interest rate is not earned on the
full amount of your Premium Payment for the entire length of the Program. This
is because Program transfers to the Sub-Accounts decrease the amount of your
Premium Payment remaining in the Program.


All Program payments, including any subsequent Program payment, must meet the
Program minimum. Any subsequent Program payments we receive during an active
Program transfer period which are received during the same interest rate
effective period will be credited to the current Program. Any subsequent Program
payments we receive during an active Program transfer period which are received
during a different interest rate effective period will be used to start a new
Program. That Program will be credited with the interest rate in effect on the
date we start the new Program. Unless you send us different instructions, the
new Program will be the same length of time as your current Program and will
allocate the subsequent Program payments to the same Sub-Accounts.


The DCA Plus Program may credit a higher interest rate but it does not ensure a
profit or protect you against a loss in declining markets.


Hartford may limit the total number of DCA Programs and DCA Plus Programs to 5
Programs open at any one time.


We determine, in our sole discretion, the interest rates credited to the
Program. These interest rates may vary depending on the Contract you purchased.
Please consult your Registered Representative to determine the interest rate for
your Program.


You may elect to terminate the transfers by calling or writing us of your intent
to cancel enrollment in the Program. Upon cancellation, all the amounts
remaining in the Program will be immediately transferred to the Sub-Accounts you
selected for the Program unless you provide us with different instructions.


We may discontinue, modify or amend the Programs or any other interest rate
program we establish. Any change to a Program will not affect Contract Owners
currently enrolled in the Program.


If you make systematic transfers from the Fixed Accumulation Feature under a
Dollar Cost Averaging Program or DCA Plus Program, you must wait 6 months after
your last systematic transfer before moving Sub-Account Values back to the Fixed
Accumulation Feature.


In Oregon, you may only sign up for DCA Plus Programs that are 6 months or
longer.



THE CONTRACT




PURCHASES AND CONTRACT VALUE




WHAT TYPES OF CONTRACTS ARE AVAILABLE?



The Contract is an individual or group tax-deferred variable annuity contract.
It is designed for retirement planning purposes and may be purchased by any
individual, group or trust, including:


-   Any trustee or custodian for a retirement plan qualified under Sections
401(a) or 403(a) of the Code;


-   Annuity purchase plans adopted by public school systems and certain
tax-exempt organizations according to Section 403(b) of the Code;


-   Individual Retirement Annuities adopted according to Section 408 of the
Code;


-   Employee pension plans established for employees by a state, a political
subdivision of a state, or an agency of either a state or a political

the Code.






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           15





The examples above represent qualified Contracts, as defined by the Code. In
addition, individuals and trusts can also purchase Contracts that are not part
of a tax qualified retirement plan. These are known as non-qualified Contracts.


If you are purchasing the Contract for use in an IRA or other qualified
retirement plan, you should consider other features of the Contract besides tax
deferral, since any investment vehicle used within an IRA or other qualified
plan receives tax-deferred treatment under the Code.


This prospectus describes two versions of the Contract. Series VIII of the
Contract was sold before January 30, 2004. Series VIIIR of the Contract is sold
on or after January 30, 2004.



HOW DO I PURCHASE A CONTRACT?



You may purchase a Contract by completing and submitting an application or an
order request along with an initial Premium Payment. For most Contracts, the
minimum initial Premium Payment is $1,000. For additional Premium Payments, the
minimum Premium Payment is $500. Under certain situations, we may allow smaller
Premium Payments, for example, if you enroll in our InvestEase Program or are
part of certain tax qualified retirement plans. Prior approval is required for
any Premium Payment that would equal or exceed $1,000,000 when combined with the
total Premium Payments made to this Contract and any other Contract we issue to
you or to your Annuitant.


You and your Annuitant must not be older than age 85 on the date that your
Contract is issued. You must be of legal age in the state where the Contract is
being purchased or a guardian must act on your behalf.


If you purchase your Contract in Alabama, we will accept subsequent Premium
Payments only during the first Contract Year. If you purchase your Contract in
Oregon, we will accept subsequent Premium Payments only during the first three
Contract Years. If you purchase your Contract in Massachusetts, we will accept
subsequent Premium Payments only until the Annuitant's 63rd birthday or the
third Contract Anniversary, whichever is later.



HOW ARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS APPLIED TO MY CONTRACT?



Your initial Premium Payment will be invested within two Valuation Days of our
receipt of a properly completed application or an order request and the Premium
Payment. If we receive your subsequent Premium Payment before the close of the
New York Stock Exchange, it will be invested on the same Valuation Day. If we
receive your Premium Payment after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, it
will be invested on the next Valuation Day. If we receive your subsequent
Premium Payment on a Non-Valuation Day, the amount will be invested on the next
Valuation Day. Unless we receive new instructions, we will invest the Premium
Payment based on your last allocation instructions on record. We will send you a
confirmation when we invest your Premium Payment.


If the request or other information accompanying the initial Premium Payment is
incomplete when received, we will hold the money in a non-interest bearing
account for up to five Valuation Days while we try to obtain complete
information. If we cannot obtain the information within five Valuation Days, we
will either return the Premium Payment and explain why the Premium Payment could
not be processed or keep the Premium Payment if you authorize us to keep it
until you provide the necessary information.



CALIFORNIA SENIORS -- THE SENIOR PROTECTION PROGRAM



Any Contract Owner 60 years old or older when purchasing this Contract in the
state of California must either:


-   Elect the Senior Protection Program, or


-   Elect to immediately allocate the initial Premium Payments to the other
investment options.


Under the Senior Protection Program we will allocate your initial Premium
Payment to the Hartford Money Market HLS Fund Sub-Account for the first 35 days
your initial Premium Payment is invested. After the 35th day we will
automatically allocate your Contract Value according to your most current
investment instructions.


If you elect the Senior Protection Program you will not be able to participate
in any InvestEase or Dollar Cost Averaging Program until after the Program has
terminated. The Dollar Cost Averaging Plus and certain Automatic Income Programs
are not available if you elect the Senior Protection Program. Under the Senior
Protection Program any subsequent Premium Payment received during the 35 days
after the initial Premium Payment is invested will also be invested in the
Hartford Money Market HLS Fund Sub-Account unless you direct otherwise.


You may voluntarily terminate your participation in the Senior Protection
Program by contacting us in writing or by telephone. You will automatically
terminate your participation in the Senior Protection Program if you allocate a
subsequent Premium Payment to any other investment option or transfer Account
value from the Hartford Money Market HLS Fund Sub-Account to another investment
option.


When you terminate your participation in the Senior Protection Program:


-   You may reallocate your Contract Value in the Program to other investment
options; or


-   we will automatically reallocate your Account value in the Program according
to your original instructions 35 days after your initial Premium Payment.



CAN I CANCEL MY CONTRACT AFTER I PURCHASE IT?



We want you to be satisfied with the Contract you have purchased. We urge you to
closely examine its provisions. If for any reason you are not satisfied with
your Contract, simply return it within ten days after you receive it with a
written request for cancellation that indicates your tax-withholding
instructions. In some states, you may be allowed more time to cancel your
Contract. We will not deduct any Contingent Deferred Sales Charges during this
time. We may require





16                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




additional information, including a signature guarantee, before we can cancel
your Contract.


Unless otherwise required by state law, Hartford will pay you your Contract
Value on the day we receive your request to cancel. The Contract Value may be
more or less than your Premium Payments depending upon the performance of your
Sub-Accounts. This means that you bear the risk of any decline in your Contract
Value until we receive your notice of cancellation. We do not refund any fees or
charges deducted during this period. In certain states, we are required to
return your Premium Payment if you decide to cancel your Contract.



HOW IS THE VALUE OF MY CONTRACT CALCULATED BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE?



The Contract Value is the sum of the value of the Fixed Accumulation Feature and
all Sub-Accounts. There are two things that affect your Sub-Account value: (1)
the number of Accumulation Units and (2) the Accumulation Unit Value. The
Sub-Account value is determined by multiplying the number of Accumulation Units
by the Accumulation Unit Value. On any Valuation Day the investment performance
of the Sub-Accounts will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying Funds.


When Premium Payments are credited to your Sub-Accounts, they are converted into
Accumulation Units by dividing the amount of your Premium Payments, minus any
Premium Taxes, by the Accumulation Unit Value for that day. The more Premium
Payments you make to your Contract, the more Accumulation Units you will own.
You decrease the number of Accumulation Units you have by requesting Surrenders,
transferring money out of a Sub-Account, settling a Death Benefit claim or by
annuitizing your Contract.


To determine the current Accumulation Unit Value, we take the prior Valuation
Day's Accumulation Unit Value and multiply it by the Net Investment Factor for
the current Valuation Day.


The Net Investment Factor is used to measure the investment performance of a
Sub-Account from one Valuation Day to the next. The Net Investment Factor for
each Sub-Account equals:


-   The net asset value per share plus applicable distributions per share of
each Fund at the end of the current Valuation Day; divided by


-   The net asset value per share of each Fund at the end of the prior Valuation
Day; multiplied by


-   Contract charges including the daily expense factor for the mortality and
expense risk charge and any other periodic expenses, including charges for
optional benefits, adjusted for the number of days in the period.


We will send you a statement at least annually, which tells you how many
Accumulation Units you have, their value and your total Contract Value.



CAN I TRANSFER FROM ONE SUB-ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER?



You may make transfers between the Sub-Accounts offered in this Contract
according to our policies and procedures as amended from time to time.



WHAT IS A SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFER?



A Sub-Account transfer is a transaction requested by you that involves
reallocating part or all of your Contract Value among the Funds available in
your Contract. Your transfer request will be processed as of the end of the
Valuation Day that it received is in good order. Otherwise, your request will be
processed on the following Valuation Day. We will send you a confirmation when
we process your transfer. You are responsible for verifying transfer
confirmations and promptly advising us of any errors within 30 days of receiving
the confirmation.



WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU REQUEST A SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFER?



Many Contract Owners request Sub-Account transfers. Some request transfers into
(purchases) a particular Sub-Account, and others request transfers out of
(redemptions) a particular Sub-Account. In addition, some Contract Owners
allocate new Premium Payments to Sub-Accounts, and others request Surrenders. We
combine all the daily requests to transfer out of a Sub-Account along with all
Surrenders from that Sub-Account and determine how many shares of that Fund we
would need to sell to satisfy all Contract Owners' "transfer-out" requests. At
the same time, we also combine all the daily requests to transfer into a
particular Sub-Account or new Premium Payments allocated to that Sub-Account and
determine how many shares of that Fund we would need to buy to satisfy all
Contract Owners' "transfer-in" requests.


In addition, many of the Funds that are available as investment options in our
variable annuity products are also available as investment options in variable
life insurance policies, retirement plans, funding agreements and other products
offered by us or our affiliates. Each day, investors and participants in these
other products engage in similar transfer transactions.


We take advantage of our size and available technology to combine sales of a
particular Fund for many of the variable annuities, variable life insurance
policies, retirement plans, funding agreements or other products offered by us
or our affiliates. We also combine many of the purchases of that particular Fund
for many of the products we offer. We then "net" these trades by offsetting
purchases against redemptions. This means that we sometimes reallocate shares of
a Fund rather than buy new shares or sell shares of the Fund.


For example, if we combine all transfer-out (redemption) requests and Surrenders
of a stock Fund Sub-Account with all other sales of that Fund from all our other
products, we may have to sell $1 million dollars of that Fund on any particular
day. However, if other Contract Owners and the owners of other products offered
by us, want to transfer-in (purchase) an amount equal to $300,000 of that same

order minus the purchase order of $300,000) rather than making two or more
transactions.



WHAT RESTRICTIONS ARE THERE ON YOUR ABILITY TO MAKE A SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFER?



FIRST, YOU MAY MAKE ONLY ONE SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFER REQUEST EACH DAY. We limit
each Contract Owner to one Sub-Account transfer request each Valuation Day. We
count all Sub-Account transfer activity that occurs on any one Valuation Day as
one "Sub-Account transfer", however, you cannot transfer the same Contract Value
more than once a Valuation Day.





EXAMPLES







TRANSFER REQUEST PER VALUATION DAY                               PERMISSIBLE?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transfer $10,000 from a money market Sub-Account to                   Yes
a growth Sub-Account
Transfer $10,000 from a money market Sub-Account to                   Yes
any number of other Sub-Accounts (dividing the $10,000
among the other Sub-Accounts however you chose)
Transfer $10,000 from any number of different Sub-Accounts            Yes
to any number of other Sub-Accounts
Transfer $10,000 from a money market Sub-Account to a                  No
growth Sub-Account and then, before the end of that same
Valuation Day, transfer the same $10,000 from the growth
Sub-Account to an international Sub-Account








SECOND, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SUBMIT A TOTAL OF 20 SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFERS EACH
CONTRACT YEAR (the "Transfer Rule") by U.S. Mail, Voice Response Unit, Internet
or telephone. Once you have reached the maximum number of Sub-Account transfers,
you may only submit any additional Sub-Account transfer requests and any trade
cancellation requests in writing through U.S. Mail or overnight delivery
service. In other words, Voice Response Unit, Internet or telephone transfer
requests will not be honored. We may, but are not obligated to, notify you when
you are in jeopardy of approaching these limits. For example, we will send you a
letter after your 10th Sub-Account transfer to remind you about the Transfer
Policy. After your 20th transfer request, our computer system will not allow you
to do another Sub-Account transfer by telephone, Voice Response Unit or via the
Internet. You will then be instructed to send your Sub-Account transfer request
by U.S. Mail or overnight delivery service.


We reserve the right to aggregate your Contracts (whether currently existing or
those recently surrendered) for the purposes of enforcing these restrictions.


The Transfer Rule does not apply to Sub-Account transfers that occur
automatically as part of a Company sponsored asset allocation or Dollar Cost
Averaging program. Reallocations made based on a Fund merger, substitution or
liquidation also do not count toward this transfer limit. Restrictions may vary
based on state law.


We make no assurances that the Transfer Rule is or will be effective in
detecting or preventing market timing.


THIRD, POLICIES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO RESTRICT EXCESSIVE SUB-ACCOUNT
TRANSFERS. You should not purchase this Contract if you want to make frequent
Sub-Account transfers for any reason. In particular, don't purchase this
Contract if you plan to engage in "market timing," which includes frequent
transfer activity into and out of the same Fund, or frequent Sub-Account
transfers in order to exploit any inefficiencies in the pricing of a Fund. Even
if you do not engage in market timing, certain restrictions may be imposed on
you, as discussed below:



ABUSIVE TRANSFER POLICY (EFFECTIVE UNTIL JULY 1, 2007):



Regardless of the number of Sub-Account transfers you have done under the
Transfer Rule, you still may have your Sub-Account transfer privileges
restricted if you violate the Abusive Transfer Policy.


We rely on the Funds to identify a pattern or frequency of Sub-Account transfers
that the Fund wants us to investigate. Most often, the Fund will identify a
particular day where it experienced a higher percentage of shares bought
followed closely by a day where it experienced the almost identical percentage
of shares sold. Once a Fund contacts us, we run a report that identifies all
Contract Owners who transferred in or out of that Fund's Sub-Account on the day
or days identified by the Fund. We may share tax identification numbers and
other shareholder identifying information contained in our records with Funds.
We then review the Contracts on that list to determine whether transfer activity
of each identified Contract violates our written Abusive Transfer Policy. We
don't reveal the precise details of our analysis to help make it more difficult
for abusive traders to adjust their behavior to escape detection.


We consider some or all of the following factors:


-   the dollar amount of the transfer;


-   the total assets of the Funds involved in the transfer;





18                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




-   the number of transfers completed in the current calendar quarter;


-   whether the transfer is part of a pattern of transfers designed to take
advantage of short term market fluctuations or market inefficiencies; or


-   the frequent trading policies and procedures of a potentially affected Fund.


If you violate the Abusive Trading Policy, we will terminate your Sub-Account
transfer privileges until your next Contract Anniversary.



FUND TRADING POLICIES (EFFECTIVE AFTER JULY 1, 2007)



You are subject to Fund trading policies, if any. We are obligated to provide,
at the Fund's request, tax identification numbers and other shareholder
identifying information contained in our records to assist Funds in identifying
any pattern or frequency of Sub-Account transfers that may violate their trading
policy. In certain instances, we have agreed to serve as a Fund's agent to help
monitor compliance with that Fund's trading policy.


We are obligated to follow each Fund's instructions regarding enforcement of
their trading policy. Penalties for violating these policies may include, among
other things, temporarily or permanently limiting or banning Sub-Account
transfers into a Fund or other funds within that fund complex. We are not
authorized to grant exceptions to a Fund's trading policy. Please refer to each
Fund's prospectus for more information.


Fund trading policies do not apply or may be limited. For instance:


-   Certain types of financial intermediaries may not be required to provide us
with shareholder information.


-   "Excepted funds" such money market funds and any Fund that affirmatively
permits short-term trading of its securities may opt not to adopt this type
of policy. This type of policy may not apply to any financial intermediary
that a Fund treats as a single investor.


-   A Fund can decide to exempt categories of contract holders whose contracts
are subject to inconsistent trading restrictions or none at all.


-   Non-shareholder initiated purchases or redemptions may not always be
monitored. These include Sub-Account transfers that are executed: (i)
automatically pursuant to a company sponsored contractual or systematic
program such as transfers of assets as a result of "dollar cost averaging"
programs, asset allocation programs, automatic rebalancing programs, annuity
payouts, loans, or systematic withdrawal programs; (ii) as a result of the
payment of a Death Benefit; (iii) as a step-up in Contract Value pursuant to
a Contract Death Benefit or guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit; (iv) as a
result of any deduction of charges or fees under a Contract; or (v) as a
result of payments such as loan repayments, scheduled contributions,
scheduled withdrawals or surrenders, retirement plan salary reduction
contributions, or planned premium payments.


POSSIBILITY OF UNDETECTED ABUSIVE TRADING OR MARKET TIMING. We may not be able
to detect or prevent all abusive trading or market timing activities. For
instance,


-   Since we net all the purchases and redemptions for a particular Fund for
this and many of our other products, transfers by any specific market timer
could be inadvertently overlooked.


-   Certain forms of variable annuities and types of Funds may be attractive to
market timers. We can not provide assurances that we will be capable of
addressing possible abuses in a timely manner.


-   These policies apply only to individuals and entities that own this Contract
or have the right to make transfers (regardless of whether requests are made
by you or anyone else acting on your behalf) However, the Funds that make up
the Sub-Accounts of this Contract are also available for use with many
different variable life insurance policies, variable annuity products and
funding agreements, and are offered directly to certain qualified retirement
plans. Some of these products and plans may have less restrictive transfer
rules or no transfer restrictions at all.



HOW ARE YOU AFFECTED BY FREQUENT SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFERS?



We are not responsible for losses or lost investment opportunities associated
with the effectuation of these policies. Frequent Sub-Account transfers may
result in the dilution of the value of the outstanding securities issued by a
Fund as a result of increased transaction costs and lost investment
opportunities typically associated with maintaining greater cash positions. This
can adversely impact Fund performance and, as a result, the performance of your
Contract. This may also lower the Death Benefit paid to your Beneficiary or
lower Annuity Payouts for your Payee as well as reduce value of other optional
benefits available under your Contract.


Separate Account investors could be prevented from purchasing Fund shares if we
reach an impasse on the execution of a Fund's trading instructions. In other
words, a Fund complex could refuse to allow new purchases of shares by all our
variable product investors if the Fund and we can not reach a mutually
acceptable agreement on how to treat an investor who, in a Fund's opinion, has
violated the Fund's trading policy.


In some cases, we do not have the tax identification number or other identifying
information requested by a Fund in our records. In those cases, we rely on the
Contract Owner to provide the information. If the Contract Owner does not
provide the information, we may be directed by the Fund to restrict the Contract
Owner from further purchases of Fund shares. In those cases, all participants
under a plan funded by the Contract will also be precluded from further
purchases of Fund shares.


FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE TRANSFERS -- During each Contract Year, you may make
transfers out of the Fixed Accumulation Feature to the Sub-Accounts, subject to
the transfer restrictions discussed below. All transfer allocations must be in
whole numbers (e.g., 1%).






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           19






FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS -- Each Contract Year you may


transfer the greater of:


-   30% of the greatest Contract Value in the Fixed Accumulation Feature as of
any Contract Anniversary or Contract issue date. When we calculate the 30%,
we add Premium Payments made after that date but before the next Contract
Anniversary. The 30% does not include Contract Value in any DCA Plus
Program; or


-   An amount equal to your largest previous transfer from the Fixed
Accumulation Feature in any one Contract Year.


We apply these restrictions to all transfers from the Fixed Accumulation
Feature, including all systematic transfers and Dollar Cost Averaging Programs,
except for transfers under our DCA Plus Program.


If your interest rate renews at a rate at least 1% lower than your prior
interest rate, you may transfer an amount equal to up to 100% of the amount to
be invested at the renewal rate. You must make this transfer request within 60
days of being notified of the renewal rate.


We may defer transfers and Surrenders from the Fixed Accumulation Feature for up
to 6 months from the date of your request.


You must wait 6 months after your most recent transfer from the Fixed
Accumulation Feature before moving Sub-Account Values back to the Fixed
Accumulation Feature. If you make systematic transfers from the Fixed
Accumulation Feature under a Dollar Cost Averaging Program or DCA Plus Program,
you must wait 6 months after your last systematic transfer before moving
Sub-Account Values back to the Fixed Accumulation Feature.


TELEPHONE AND INTERNET TRANSFERS -- You can make transfers by contacting us.


Transfer instructions received by telephone on any Valuation Day before the
close of the New York Stock Exchange will be carried out that day. Otherwise,
the instructions will be carried out at the end of the next Valuation Day.


Transfer instructions you send electronically are considered to be received by
Hartford at the time and date stated on the electronic acknowledgement Hartford
returns to you. If the time and date indicated on the acknowledgement is before
the end of any Valuation Day, the instructions will be carried out that day.
Otherwise, the instructions will be carried out at the end of the next Valuation
Day. If you do not receive an electronic acknowledgement, you should telephone
us as soon as possible.


We will send you a confirmation when we process your transfer. You are
responsible for verifying transfer confirmations and promptly advising us of any
errors within 30 days of receiving the confirmation.


Telephone or Internet transfer requests may currently only be cancelled by
calling us before the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the day you made
the transfer request.


Hartford, our agents or our affiliates are NOT responsible for losses resulting
from telephone or electronic requests that we believe are genuine. We will use
reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions received by telephone or
through our website are genuine, including a requirement that contract owners
provide certain identification information, including a personal identification
number. We record all telephone transfer instructions. We may suspend, modify,
or terminate telephone or electronic transfer privileges at any time.


POWER OF ATTORNEY -- You may authorize another person to make transfers on your
behalf by submitting a completed power of attorney form. Once we have the
completed form on file, we will accept transfer instructions, subject to our
transfer restrictions, from your designated third party until we receive new
instructions in writing from you. You will not be able to make transfers or
other changes to your Contract if you have authorized someone else to act under
a power of attorney.



CHARGES AND FEES



The following charges and fees are associated with the Contract:



THE CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE



The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge covers some of the expenses relating to the
sale and distribution of the Contract, including commissions paid to Registered
Representatives and the cost of preparing sales literature and other promotional
activities.


We may assess a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge when you request a full or
partial Surrender. The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is based on the amount
you choose to Surrender and how long your Premium Payments have been in the
Contract. Each Premium Payment has its own Contingent Deferred Sales Charge
schedule. Premium Payments are Surrendered in the order in which they were
received. The longer you leave your Premium Payments in the Contract, the lower
the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will be when you Surrender. The amount
assessed a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will not exceed your total Premium
Payments.


The percentage used to calculate the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is equal
to:








NUMBER OF YEARS FROM     CONTINGENT DEFERRED
   PREMIUM PAYMENT           SALES CHARGE
-----------------------------------------------
          1                        7%
          2                        7%
          3                        7%
          4                        6%
          5                        5%
          6                        4%
          7                        3%
      8 or more                    0%











20                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




SURRENDER ORDER -- During the Contract Years when a Contingent Deferred Sales
Charge applies to the initial Premium Payment, all Surrenders in excess of the
Annual Withdrawal Amount (which is equal to 10% of total Premium Payments) will
be taken first from Premium Payments, then from earnings. Surrenders from
Premium Payments in excess of the Annual Withdrawal Amount will be subject to a
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.


Thereafter, Surrenders will be taken first from earnings, then from Premium
Payments not subject to a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, then from 10% of
Premium Payments still subject to a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge and then
from Premium Payments subject to a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge on a
first-in-first-out basis.


For example, you made an initial Premium Payment of $10,000 five years ago and
an additional Premium Payment of $20,000 one year ago. If you request a partial
withdrawal of $15,000 and you have not taken your Annual Withdrawal Amount for
the year, we will deduct a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge as follows:


-   Hartford will Surrender the Annual Withdrawal Amount which is equal to 10%
of your total Premium Payments or $3,000 without charging a Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge.


-   We will then Surrender the Premium Payments that have been in the Contract
the longest.


-   That means we would Surrender the entire $10,000 initial Premium Payment and
deduct a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 5% on that amount, or $500.


-   The remaining $2,000 will come from the additional Premium Payment made one
year ago and we will deduct a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 7% of the
$2,000, or $140.


-   Your Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is $640.


If you have any questions about these charges, please contact your Registered
Representative or Hartford.



THE FOLLOWING SURRENDERS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO A CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE:



-   ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT -- During the first seven years from each Premium
Payment, you may, each Contract Year, take partial Surrenders up to 10% of
the total Premium Payments. If you do not take 10% one year, you may not
take more than 10% the next year. These amounts are different for group
unallocated Contracts and Contracts issued to a Charitable Remainder Trust.


-   IF YOU ARE A PATIENT IN A CERTIFIED LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY OR OTHER
ELIGIBLE FACILITY -- We will waive any Contingent Deferred Sales Charge for
a partial or full Surrender if you, the joint Contract Owner or the
Annuitant, are confined for at least 180 calendar days to a:


X  facility recognized as a general hospital by the proper authority of the
state in which it is located;


X  facility recognized as a general hospital by the Joint Commission on the
Accreditation of Hospitals;


X  facility certified as a hospital or long-term care facility; or


X  nursing home licensed by the state in which it is located and offers the
services of a registered nurse 24 hours a day.


For this waiver to apply, you must:


-   have owned the Contract continuously since it was issued,


-   provide written proof of your eligibility satisfactory to us, and


-   request the Surrender within 91 calendar days of the last day that you are
an eligible patient in a recognized facility or nursing home.


This waiver is not available if you, the joint Contract Owner or the Annuitant
is in a facility or nursing home when you purchase or upgrade the Contract. We
will not waive any Contingent Deferred Sales Charge applicable to any Premium
Payments made while you are in an eligible facility or nursing home.


This waiver may not be available in all states.


-   UPON DEATH OF THE ANNUITANT, CONTRACT OWNER OR JOINT CONTRACT OWNER -- No
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will be deducted if the Annuitant, Contract
Owner or joint Contract Owner dies.


-   UPON ANNUITIZATION -- The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is not deducted
when you annuitize the Contract. However, we will charge a Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge if the Contract is Surrendered during the Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge period under an Annuity Payout Option which allows
Surrenders.


-   FOR THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST BENEFIT PAYMENTS -- If your Benefit
Payment on your most recent Contract Anniversary exceeds the Annual
Withdrawal Amount, we will waive any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales
Charge for withdrawals up to that Benefit Payment amount.


-   FOR THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED BENEFIT PAYMENTS -- If your
Benefit Payment on your most recent Contract Anniversary exceeds the Annual
Withdrawal Amount, we will waive any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales
Charge for withdrawals up to that Benefit Payment amount.


-   FOR REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS -- This allows Annuitants who are age 70
1/2 or older, with a Contract held under an IRA or 403(b) plan, to Surrender
an amount equal to the Required Minimum Distribution for the Contract
without a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge for one year's











HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           21

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  required minimum distribution for that Contract Year. All requests for
  Required Minimum Distributions must be in writing.








-   FOR SUBSTANTIALLY EQUAL PERIODIC PAYMENTS -- We will waive the Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge if you take partial Surrenders under the Automatic
Income Program where you receive a scheduled series of substantially equal
periodic payments for the greater of five years or to age 59 1/2.


-   UPON CANCELLATION DURING THE RIGHT TO CANCEL PERIOD -- No Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge will be deducted if you cancel your Contract during
the Right to Cancel Period.



MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE



For assuming mortality and expense risks under the Contract, we deduct a daily
charge at an annual rate of 1.15% of the Sub-Account Value.


The mortality and expense risk charge is broken into charges for mortality risks
and for an expense risk:


-   MORTALITY RISK -- There are two types of mortality risks that we assume,
those made while your Premium Payments are accumulating and those made once
Annuity Payouts have begun.


During the period your Premium Payments are accumulating, we are required to
cover any difference between the Death Benefit paid and the Surrender Value.
These differences may occur in periods of declining value or in periods where
the Contingent Deferred Sales Charges would have been applicable. The risk that
we bear during this period is that actual mortality rates, in aggregate, may
exceed expected mortality rates.


Once Annuity Payouts have begun, we may be required to make Annuity Payouts as
long as the Annuitant is living, regardless of how long the Annuitant lives. The
risk that we bear during this period is that the actual mortality rates, in
aggregate, may be lower than the expected mortality rates.


-   EXPENSE RISK -- We also bear an expense risk that the Contingent Deferred
Sales Charges and the Annual Maintenance Fee collected before the Annuity
Commencement Date may not be enough to cover the actual cost of selling,
distributing and administering the Contract.


Although variable Annuity Payouts will fluctuate with the performance of the
underlying Fund selected, your Annuity Payouts will NOT be affected by (a) the
actual mortality experience of our Annuitants, or (b) our actual expenses if
they are greater than the deductions stated in the Contract. Because we cannot
be certain how long our Annuitants will live, we charge this percentage fee
based on the mortality tables currently in use. The mortality and expense risk
charge enables us to keep our commitments and to pay you as planned.


If the mortality and expense risk charge under a Contract is insufficient to
cover our actual costs, we will bear the loss. If the mortality and expense risk
charge exceeds these costs, we keep the excess as profit. We may use these
profits for any proper corporate purpose including, among other things, payment
of sales expenses. We expect to make a profit from the mortality and expense
risk charge.



ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE



The Annual Maintenance Fee is a flat fee that is deducted from your Contract
Value to reimburse us for expenses relating to the administrative maintenance of
the Contract and the Accounts. The annual $30 charge is deducted on a Contract
Anniversary or when the Contract is fully Surrendered if the Contract Value at
either of those times is less than $50,000. The charge is deducted
proportionately from each Account in which you are invested. We do not deduct
the charge for Contracts issued in South Carolina and Washington if it will
cause the rate of interest credited to your Contract Value in the Fixed
Accumulation Feature to fall below state minimum requirements.



WHEN IS THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE WAIVED?



We will waive the Annual Maintenance Fee if your Contract Value is $50,000 or
more on your Contract Anniversary or when you fully Surrender your Contract. In
addition, we will waive one Annual Maintenance Fee for Contract Owners who own
more than one Contract with a combined Contract Value between $50,000 and
$100,000. If you have multiple Contracts with a combined Contract Value of
$100,000 or greater, we will waive the Annual Maintenance Fee on all Contracts.
However, we may limit the number of waivers to a total of six Contracts. We also
may waive the Annual Maintenance Fee under certain other conditions. We do not
include contracts from our Putnam Hartford line of variable annuity contracts
with the Contracts when we combine Contract Value for purposes of this waiver.



PREMIUM TAXES



We deduct Premium Taxes, if required, by a state or other government agency.
Some states collect the taxes when Premium Payments are made; others collect at
Annuitization. Since we pay Premium Taxes when they are required by applicable
law, we may deduct them from your Contract when we pay the taxes, upon
Surrender, or on the Annuity Commencement Date. The Premium Tax rate varies by
state or municipality. Currently, the maximum rate charged by any state is 3.5%
and 1% in Puerto Rico.



CHARGES AGAINST THE FUNDS



ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES -- The Separate Account purchases shares of the
Funds at net asset value. The net asset value of the Fund reflects investment
advisory fees and administrative expenses already deducted from the assets of
the Funds. These charges are described in the Funds' prospectuses.



CHARGES FOR OPTIONAL BENEFITS



-   MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT CHARGE -- You may elect an optional Death Benefit for
an additional charge. We call the optional Death Benefit the "MAV/EPB Death
Benefit," which is short for "Maximum Anniversary Value/Earnings Protection
Death Benefit." If you elect the MAV/EPB Death Benefit, we will deduct an
additional charge on a daily basis that is equal to an annual charge of
0.30% of your Contract Value











22                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  invested in the Sub-Accounts. Once you elect this benefit, you cannot cancel
  it and we will continue to deduct the charge until we begin to make Annuity
  Payouts.

-   THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST CHARGE -- The Hartford's Principal First is
    an option that can be elected at an additional charge. We will deduct this
    charge on a daily basis based on your Contract Value invested in the
    Sub-Accounts. Once you elect this benefit, you cannot cancel it and we will
    continue to deduct the charge until we begin to make Annuity Payouts. You
    may elect the annuitization option at any time. If you bought your Contract
    after June 1, 2003 but before January 30, 2004, you can elect to add this
    benefit to your Contract for an additional charge on a daily basis that is
    equal to an annual charge of 0.35% of your Contract Value invested in the
    Sub-Accounts.

-   THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED CHARGE -- The Hartford's Principal
    First Preferred can be elected for an additional annual charge. We will
    deduct the charge on a daily basis based on your Contract Value invested in
    the Sub-Accounts. We will continue to deduct the charge until we begin to
    make Annuity Payouts or when you cancel it. You may elect the annuitization
    option at any time. You may elect to cancel this rider after the 5th
    anniversary of the date you added The Hartford's Principal First Preferred
    to your Contract.









REDUCED FEES AND CHARGES



WE MAY OFFER, IN OUR DISCRETION, REDUCED FEES AND CHARGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGES, THE MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK
CHARGE, THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE, AND CHARGES FOR OPTIONAL BENEFITS, FOR
CERTAIN CONTRACTS (INCLUDING EMPLOYER SPONSORED SAVINGS PLANS) WHICH MAY RESULT
IN DECREASED COSTS AND EXPENSES. REDUCTIONS IN THESE FEES AND CHARGES WILL NOT
BE UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST ANY CONTRACT OWNER.



THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST AND THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED




ELECTING THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST OR THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST
PREFERRED



You may elect either The Hartford's Principal First or The Hartford's Principal
First Preferred. This means if you elect The Hartford's Principal First you will
never be able to elect The Hartford's Principal First Preferred. Likewise, if
you elect The Hartford's Principal First Preferred you will never be able to
elect The Hartford's Principal First.


Once you elect The Hartford's Principal First you cannot cancel it and we will
continue to deduct The Hartford's Principal First Charge until we begin to make
Annuity Payouts.


You may cancel The Hartford's Principal First Preferred any time after the 5th
Contract Year or the 5th anniversary of the date you added The Hartford's
Principal First Preferred to your Contract. If you cancel The Hartford's
Principal First Preferred, all Benefit Payments and charges for The Hartford's
Principal First Preferred will terminate. Once The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred is cancelled it cannot be reinstated.



OVERVIEW



The Hartford's Principal First and The Hartford's Principal First Preferred are
optional benefits that, if elected, are intended to protect the amount of your
investment from poor market performance. The amount of your investment that is
protected from poor market performance will be different depending on when you
elect your optional benefit. The amount that is protected is your "Benefit
Amount." In other words, The Hartford's Principal First and The Hartford's
Principal First Preferred operate as a guarantee of the Benefit Amount that you
can access through a series of payments.



DETERMINING YOUR BENEFIT AMOUNT



The initial Benefit Amount for both The Hartford's Principal First and The
Hartford's Principal First Preferred depends on when you elect your optional
benefit. If you elect your optional benefit when purchasing the Contract, your
initial Premium Payment is equal to the initial Benefit Amount. If you elect
your optional benefit at a later date, your Contract Value, on the date it is
added to your Contract, is equal to the initial Benefit Amount.


-   Your Benefit Amount can never be more than $5 million dollars.


-   Your Benefit Amount is reduced as you take withdrawals.


Once the initial Benefit Amount has been determined, Hartford calculates the
maximum guaranteed payment that may be made each year ("Benefit Payment"). The
Benefit Payment is 7% or 5% of your Benefit Amount for The Hartford's Principal
First or The Hartford's Principal First Preferred, respectively.



BENEFIT PAYMENTS



Benefit Payments are non-cumulative, which means your Benefit Payment will not
increase in the future if you fail to take your full Benefit Payment for the
current year. For example, for The Hartford's Principal First Preferred if you
do not take 5% one year, you may not take more than 5% the next year.


If you elect your optional benefit when you purchase your Contract, we count one
year as the time between each Contract Anniversary. If you establish your
optional benefit any time after you purchase your Contract, we count the first
year as the time between the date we added the optional benefit to your Contract
and your next Contract Anniversary, which could be less than a year.


The Benefit Payment can be divided up and taken on any payment schedule that you
request. You can continue to take Benefit Payments until the Benefit Amount has
been depleted.


Benefit Payments are treated as partial Surrenders and are deducted from your
Contract Value. Each Benefit Payment reduces the amount you may Surrender under
your Annual Withdrawal Amount. Surrenders in excess of your Benefit Payment
include any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.


If you Surrender more than the Benefit Payment out of your Contract in any one
year we will recalculate the Benefit Amount. Anytime we re-calculate your
Benefit Amount or your Benefit Payment we count one year as the time between the






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           23





date we re-calculate and your next Contract Anniversary, which could be less
than a year.


If, in one year, your Surrenders total more than your Benefit Payment out of
your Contract we will re-calculate your Benefit Amount and your Benefit Payment
may be lower in the future. We recalculate your Benefit Amount by comparing the
results of two calculations. First we deduct the amount of the last Surrender
from your Contract Value ("New Contract Value") and then we deduct the amount of
the last Surrender from the Benefit Amount ("New Benefit Amount"). Then we
compare those results:


-   If the New Contract Value is more than or equal to the New Benefit Amount,
and more than or equal to the Premium Payments invested in the Contract
before the Surrender, the Benefit Payment is unchanged.


-   If the New Contract Value is more than or equal to the New Benefit Amount,
but less than the Premium Payments invested in the Contract before the
Surrender, we have to recalculate your Benefit Payment. For The Hartford's
Principal First, your Benefit Payment becomes 7% of the greater of your New
Contract Value and New Benefit Amount. For The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred, your Benefit Payment becomes 5% of the greater of your New
Contract Value and New Benefit Amount.


-   If the New Contract Value is less than the New Benefit Amount, we have to
recalculate your Benefit Payment. We recalculate the Benefit Payment by
comparing the "old" Benefit Payment to the "new" Benefit Payment for the New
Benefit Amount and your Benefit Payment becomes the lower of those two
values. Your New Benefit Amount is then equal to the New Contract Value.


If your Benefit Payment on your most recent Contract Anniversary exceeds the
Annual Withdrawal Amount, we will waive any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales
Charge for withdrawals up to that Benefit Payment amount.


If you change the ownership or assign this Contract to someone other than your
spouse after 12 months of electing either optional benefit, we will recalculate
the Benefit Amount and the Benefit Payment may be lower in the future.


The Benefit Amount will be recalculated to equal the lesser of:


-   The Benefit Amount immediately prior to the ownership change or assignment;
or


-   The Contract Value at the time of the ownership change or assignment.


Any additional Premium Payments made to your Contract will cause the Benefit
Amount to be increased on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The Benefit Payment will
equal the prior Benefit Payment plus 5% or 7% of the additional Premium Payment
for The Hartford's Principal First Preferred and The Hartford's Principal First,
respectively.



SURRENDERING YOUR CONTRACT



You can Surrender your Contract any time, however, you will receive your
Contract Value at the time you request the Surrender with any applicable charges
deducted and not the Benefit Amount or the Benefit Payment amount you would have
received under The Hartford's Principal First or The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred.


If you still have a Benefit Amount after you Surrender all of your Contract
Value or your Contract Value is reduced to zero, you will still receive a
Benefit Payment through a fixed annuity payout option until your Benefit Amount
is depleted.


The fixed annuity payout option for The Hartford's Principal First is called The
Hartford's Principal First Payout Option. The fixed annuity payout option for
The Hartford's Principal First Preferred is called The Hartford's Principal
First Preferred Payout Option.


While you are receiving payments under either of these fixed annuity payout
options, you may not make additional Premium Payments, and if you die before you
receive all of your payments, your Beneficiary will continue to receive the
remaining payments.



ANNUITIZING YOUR CONTRACT



If you elect The Hartford's Principal First or The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred and later decide to annuitize your Contract, you may choose The
Hartford's Principal First Payout Option or The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred Payout Option in addition to those Annuity Payout Options offered in
the Contract.


Under both of these Annuity Payout Options, Hartford will pay a fixed dollar
amount for a specific number of years ("Payout Period"). If you, the joint
Contract Owner or the Annuitant should die before the Payout Period is complete
the remaining payments will be made to the Beneficiary. The Payout Period is
determined on the Annuity Calculation Date and it will equal the current Benefit
Amount divided by the Benefit Payment. The total amount of the Annuity Payouts
under this option will be equal to the Benefit Amount. We may offer other Payout
Options.


If you, the joint Contract Owner or Annuitant die before the Annuity Calculation
Date and all of the Benefit Payments guaranteed by Hartford have not been made,
the Beneficiary may elect to take the remaining Benefit Payments or any of the
death benefit options offered in your Contract.


If the Annuitant dies after the Annuity Calculation Date and before all of the
Benefit Payments guaranteed by Hartford have been made, the payments will
continue to be made to the Beneficiary.

THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST -- STEP-UP



Any time after the 5th year The Hartford's Principal First has been in effect,
you may elect to "step-up" the Benefit Amount. There is no "step-up" available
for The Hartford's Principal First Preferred. If you choose to "step-up" the
Benefit Amount, your Benefit Amount will be re-calculated to equal your total
Contract Value. Your Benefit Payment then becomes 7% of the new Benefit Amount,
and will never be less than your existing Benefit Payment. You cannot elect to
"step-up" the Benefit Amount if your current Benefit Amount is higher than your
Contract Value. Any time after the 5th year The Hartford's Principal First
"step-up" has been in place, you may choose to "step-up" the Benefit Amount
again. Contract Owners who become owners by virtue of the Spousal Contract
Continuation provision of the Contract can "step-up" without waiting for the 5th
year their Contract has been in force.


We currently allow you to "step-up" The Hartford's Principal First on any day
after the 5th year the benefit has been in effect, however, in the future we may
only allow a "step-up" to occur on your Contract Anniversary. AT THE TIME YOU
ELECT TO "STEP-UP," WE MAY BE CHARGING MORE FOR THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST,
BUT IN NO EVENT WILL THIS CHARGE EXCEED 0.75% ANNUALLY. REGARDLESS OF WHEN YOU
BOUGHT YOUR CONTRACT, UPON "STEP-UP" WE WILL CHARGE YOU THE CURRENT CHARGE.
BEFORE YOU DECIDE TO "STEP-UP," YOU SHOULD REQUEST A CURRENT PROSPECTUS WHICH
WILL DESCRIBE THE CURRENT CHARGE FOR THIS BENEFIT.



THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED -- INVESTMENT RESTRICTIONS



If you elect The Hartford's Principal First Preferred you are not permitted to
transfer more than 10% of your Contract Value as of your last Contract
Anniversary from the Non-Growth Sub-Accounts to the Growth Sub-Accounts in any
one Contract Year. If you transfer more than 10% of your Contract Value The
Hartford's Principal First Preferred will automatically terminate and all
Benefit Payments and The Hartford's Principal First Preferred charge will cease.
We may add or delete Sub-Accounts from the Non-Growth and Growth sub-account
lists at any time. Currently, we do not enforce this investment transfer
restriction. We will provide you 30 days' written notice when we elect to
enforce this investment transfer restriction. For Contracts issued in the state
of Connecticut there are no investment restrictions.








NON-GROWTH SUB-ACCOUNTS              GROWTH SUB-ACCOUNTS
--------------------------------------------------------------
[to be filed by Amendment]









REQUIRED MINIMUM DISTRIBUTIONS



Qualified Contracts are subject to certain federal tax rules requiring that
minimum distributions be withdrawn from the Contract on an annual basis, usually
beginning after age 70 1/2. These withdrawals are called Required Minimum
Distributions. A Required Minimum Distribution may exceed your Benefit Payment,
which will cause a recalculation of your Benefit Amount. Recalculation of your
Benefit Amount may result in a lower Benefit Payment in the future.






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           25





For purposes of The Hartford's Principal First Preferred, if you enroll in our
Automatic Income Program to satisfy the Required Minimum Distributions from the
Contract and, as a result, the withdrawals exceed your Benefit Payment we will
not recalculate your Benefit Amount or Benefit Payment.



OTHER INFORMATION



The Hartford's Principal First and The Hartford's Principal First Preferred may
not be available in all states or through all broker-dealers.


The Hartford's Principal First Preferred is only available to Contracts issued
on or after November 1, 2004.


If you elect The Hartford's Principal First Preferred, and your Contract was
issued in the state of Connecticut, our approval is required for any subsequent
Premium Payments if the Premium Payments for all deferred variable annuity
contracts issued by us or our affiliates to you equals or exceeds $100,000.


For qualified Contracts, The Hartford's Principal First cannot be elected if the
Contract Owner or Annuitant is age 81 or older. The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred cannot be elected if the Contract Owner or Annuitant is age 71 or
older.


We reserve the right to treat all Contracts issued to you by Hartford or one of
its affiliates within a calendar year as one Contract for purposes of The
Hartford's Principal First and The Hartford's Principal First Preferred. This
means that if you purchase two Contracts from us in any twelve month period and
elect either The Hartford's Principal First or The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred on both Contracts, withdrawals from one Contract will be treated as
withdrawals from the other Contract.

"Appendix III." For examples on how The Hartford's Principal First Preferred is
calculated, please see "Appendix IV."



DEATH BENEFIT




WHAT IS THE DEATH BENEFIT AND HOW IS IT CALCULATED?



The Death Benefit is the amount we will pay if the Contract Owner, joint
Contract Owner, or the Annuitant die before we begin to make Annuity Payouts. We
calculate the Death Benefit when we receive a certified death certificate or
other legal document acceptable to us. The calculations for the Death Benefit
that are described below are based on the Contract Value on the date we receive
a certified death certificate or other legal document acceptable to us.


Unless the Beneficiary provides us with instructions to reallocate the Death
Benefit among the Accounts, the calculated Death Benefit will remain invested in
the same Accounts, according to the Contract Owner's last instructions until we
receive complete written settlement instructions from the Beneficiary. This
means the Death Benefit amount will fluctuate with the performance of the
underlying Funds. When there is more than one Beneficiary, we will calculate the
Accumulation Units for each Sub-Account and the dollar amount for the Fixed
Accumulation Feature for each Beneficiary's portion of the proceeds.


You can purchase this Contract with either the Asset Protection Death Benefit or
the Premium Protection Death Benefit. You cannot choose both. If you do not
choose a Death Benefit, we will issue your Contract with the Asset Protection
Death Benefit.


You may also elect an optional Death Benefit for an additional charge. We call
the optional Death Benefit the "MAV/EPB Death Benefit," which is short for
"Maximum Anniversary Value/Earnings Protection Benefit Death Benefit." The
MAV/EPB Death Benefit is in addition to the Asset Protection Death Benefit or
the Premium Protection Death Benefit.


Not all Death Benefit choices are available in all states or through all
broker-dealer firms. For more information, call your Registered Representative
or you can call us at 1-800-862-6668.

ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT



The Asset Protection Death Benefit is one of the two standard Death Benefit
choices.



HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT WORKS.



Assume that:


-     You made an initial Premium Payment of $100,000.

-     In your fourth Contract Year, you made a partial Surrender of $8,000.

-     Your Contract Value in your fourth Contract Year immediately before your
partial Surrender was $110,000.

-     On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was
$115,000.

-     Your Maximum Anniversary Value was $150,000.








We determine the Asset Protection Death Benefit by finding the    Based on the assumptions above, here is how we would do the
greatest of these three values:                                   actual calculations:
-- Contract Value or                                              Contract Value equals $115,000.
-- Contract Value PLUS 25% of the total Premium Payments          $115,000 + [25% (($100,000 - $0) - $8,000)] = $138,000
excluding any subsequent Premium Payments we receive within 12
months of death or after death. Premium Payments are adjusted
for any partial Surrenders; or
-- Contract Value PLUS 25% of your Maximum Anniversary Value      $115,000 + [25% ($150,000)] = $152,500.
excluding any subsequent Premium Payments we receive within 12
months of death or after death.











THE ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT HAS A MAXIMUM. THAT MEANS THE DEATH BENEFIT
CANNOT EXCEED THE ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT MAXIMUM.







Asset Protection Death Benefit Maximum:
The Asset Protection Death Benefit cannot exceed the greatest       Based on the assumptions above, here is the calculation of
of:                                                                 the Asset Protection Death Benefit Maximum:
-- Contract Value;                                                  - Contract Value is $115,000,
-- total Premium Payments you have made to us, adjusted for         - total Premium Payments you have made to us minus an
any partial Surrenders; or                                          adjustment for any partial Surrenders [$100,000 - $8,000 =
                                                                    $92,000], or
-- Your Maximum Anniversary Value.                                  - Your Maximum Anniversary Value is $150,000.
Because the greatest of the three values above is $150,000,
the maximum Death Benefit is $150,000.








The discussion of the Death Benefit choices above says that we make an
ADJUSTMENT TO YOUR TOTAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS when we
calculate the Death Benefit. We calculate the adjustment to your total Premium
Payments for partial Surrenders by reducing your total Premium Payments on a
dollar for dollar basis for total partial Surrenders within a Contract Year up
to 10% of total Premium Payments. After that, we reduce your total Premium
Payments by a factor that we compute by taking into account the amount of your
total partial Surrenders within a Contract Year that exceed 10% of total Premium
Payments and your Contract Value before and after the Surrender. We use this
calculation to determine the adjustment to total Premium Payments for partial
Surrenders for all of the Death Benefits discussed in this prospectus. For
examples of how we calculate the Death Benefit, please see "Appendix II."


The discussion of the Death Benefit choices above also refers to your MAXIMUM
ANNIVERSARY VALUE. The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of
calculations on Contract Anniversaries of Contract Values, Premium Payments and
partial Surrenders. We will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract
Anniversary prior to the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death, whichever is
earlier.


The Anniversary Value is equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract
Anniversary with the following adjustments:


-   Your Anniversary Value is increased by the dollar amount of any Premium
Payments made since the Contract Anniversary; and


-   Your Anniversary Value is reduced by an adjustment for any partial
Surrenders made since the Contract Anniversary.


The Maximum Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value
attained from this series of calculations.


We make an ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS WHEN WE CALCULATE YOUR ANNIVERSARY
VALUE. We calculate the adjustment to your Anniversary Value for partial
Surrenders by reducing your Anniversary Value on a dollar for dollar basis for





28                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




total partial Surrenders within a Contract Year up to 10% of total Premium
Payments. After that, we reduce your Anniversary Value by a factor that we
compute by taking into account the amount of your total partial Surrenders
within a Contract Year that exceed 10% of total Premium Payments and your
Contract Value before and after the Surrender. For examples of how we calculate
the Death Benefit, please see "Appendix II."


We use these calculations to determine your Maximum Anniversary Value for all of
the Death Benefits discussed in this prospectus.



PREMIUM PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT



The Premium Protection Death Benefit is one of the two standard Death Benefit
choices.


The Premium Protection Death Benefit may not currently be available in your
state. You cannot choose the Premium Protection Death Benefit if either you or
your Annuitant are 76 years old or older.



HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE PREMIUM PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT WORKS.



Assume that:


-     You made an initial Premium Payment of $100,000,

-     In your fourth Contract Year, you made a partial Surrender of $8,000,

-     Your Contract Value in your fourth Contract Year immediately before your
partial Surrender was $110,000,

-     On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was
$115,000.








We determine the Premium Protection Death        Based on the assumptions above,
Benefit by finding the greater of these          here is how we would do the
two values:                                      actual
                                                 calculations:
-- Contract Value; or                            - $115,000
-- Total Premium Payments you have made to       - $100,000 - $8,000 = $92,000
us minus an adjustment for any partial
Surrenders.
Because your Contract Value was greater
than the adjusted total Premium Payments,
your Death Benefit is $115,000.








We make an adjustment to your total Premium Payments for partial Surrenders as
discussed above under "Adjustments to total Premium Payments for partial
Surrenders."


If your Contract has the Premium Protection Death Benefit and you transfer
ownership of your Contract to someone who was 76 years old or older at the time
you purchased your Contract, the Premium Protection Death Benefit will not apply
under the Contract after the transfer. Instead, the Death Benefit will be the
Contract Value.



OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT



You may elect an optional Death Benefit for an additional charge. We call the
optional Death Benefit the "MAV/EPB Death Benefit," which is short for "Maximum
Anniversary Value/Earnings Protection Benefit Death Benefit." The MAV/EPB Death
Benefit is in addition to the Asset Protection Death Benefit or the Premium
Protection Death Benefit.


The amount of the MAV/EPB Death Benefit will not be different regardless of
whether your Contract has the Asset Protection Death Benefit or the Premium
Protection Death Benefit.


The MAV/EPB Death Benefit may not currently be available in your state and is
not available in Washington, New York or Minnesota. You cannot elect the MAV/EPB
Death Benefit if you or your Annuitant are age 76 or older. Once you elect the
MAV/EPB Death Benefit, you cannot cancel it.


You can only elect the MAV/EPB Death Benefit at the time that you purchase your
Contract.


The MAV/EPB Death Benefit is described below.





MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT



This table shows how the Death Benefit works if you elect the MAV/EPB Death
Benefit when you purchase your Contract with either of the standard Death
Benefit choices:






 MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT WITH THE ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT   MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT WITH THE PREMIUM PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Death Benefit will be the greatest of the Asset Protection   The Death Benefit will be the greatest of the Premium Protection
Death Benefit or the following three values:                     Death Benefit or the following two values:
- The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus an        - Your Maximum Anniversary Value; or
adjustment for any partial Surrenders;
- Your Maximum Anniversary Value; or                             - The Earnings Protection Benefit, which is discussed below.

HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           29





-     If your Contract has the MAV/EPB Death Benefit and you transfer ownership
of your Contract to someone who was 76 years old or older at the time you
purchased your Contract, the MAV/EPB Death Benefit will not apply under
the Contract after the transfer. Instead, for Contracts with the Asset
Protection Death Benefit only the Asset Protection Death Benefit will
remain in force under the Contract. For Contracts with the Premium
Protection Death Benefit, the Death Benefit will be the Contract Value.
However, we will continue to deduct the charge for the MAV/EPB Death
Benefit until we begin to make Annuity Payouts.


EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT -- If you and your Annuitant are age 69 or under
when you purchase your Contract, the Earnings Protection Benefit is:


-   Your Contract Value on the date we receive a death certificate or other
legal document acceptable to us, plus


-   40% of the Contract gain since the date that you purchased your Contract.


We determine any Contract gain by comparing your Contract Value on the date you
purchase your Contract to your Contract Value on the date we calculate the Death
Benefit. We deduct any Premium Payments and add adjustments for any partial
Surrenders made during that time.


We make an adjustment for partial Surrenders if the amount of a Surrender is
greater than the Contract gain in the Contract immediately prior to the
Surrender. To determine if a partial Surrender is greater than Contract gain we:


-   Add the amount of the partial Surrender to the Contract Value on the date
you purchase your Contract;


-   Then we add any Premium Payments made after the date you purchase your
Contract and before you made the partial Surrender;


-   Next we subtract the Contract Value on the Valuation Day immediately before
you make the partial Surrender; and


-   We subtract the sum of any prior adjustments for all prior partial
Surrenders made after you purchased your Contract.


If that amount is greater than zero, the result becomes the amount of the
adjustment for the partial Surrender.


We use the adjustment for partial Surrenders when we calculate the Contract gain
by:


-   Subtracting the Contract Value on the date you purchase your Contract and
any subsequent Premium Payments from the Contract Value on the date we
receive due proof of death;


-   Then we add any adjustment for partial Surrenders to the result to determine
the Contract gain.


Your Contract gain is limited to or "capped" at a maximum of 200% of Contract
Value on the date you purchased your Contract plus Premium Payments not
previously withdrawn made after you purchased your Contract, excluding any
Premium Payments made in the 12 months before the date of death or after death.
We subtract any adjustments for partial Surrenders.


We take 40% of either the Contract gain or the capped amount and add it back to
your Contract Value to complete the Death Benefit calculation.


If you or your Annuitant are age 70 through 75, we add 25% of the Contract gain
or capped amount back to the Contract Value to complete the Death Benefit
calculation. The percentage used for the Death Benefit calculation is determined
by the oldest age of you and your Annuitant at the time you purchased your
Contract.



HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW THE MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT WORKS WITH THE STANDARD
DEATH BENEFIT CHOICES.



Assume that:


-     You made a single Premium Payment of $100,000,

-     In your fourth Contract Year, you made a partial Surrender of $8,000,

-     Your Contract Value in your fourth Contract Year immediately before your
partial Surrender was $110,000,

-     On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was
$115,000,

-     Your Maximum Anniversary Value was $150,000.

                                                                                              40% of Contract gain plus Contract

Death Benefit Amount          Because the Maximum Anniversary
                              Value was the greatest of the
                              four values compared, the Death
                              Benefit is $150,000








Before you purchase the MAV/EPB Death Benefit, you should also consider the
following:


-   If your Contract has no gain when we calculate the Death Benefit, we will
not pay an Earnings Protection Benefit.


-   Partial Surrenders can reduce or eliminate your Contract gain. So if you
plan to make partial Surrenders, there may be no Earnings Protection
Benefit.


-   If you transfer ownership of your Contract, or your spouse continues your
Contract after your death, and the new Contract Owner would have been
ineligible for the MAV/EPB Death Benefit when you purchased your Contract,
the MAV/EPB Death Benefit charge will continue to be deducted even though no
MAV/EPB Death Benefit will be payable.



OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT FOR CONTRACTS ISSUED IN WASHINGTON, NEW YORK OR MINNESOTA



The optional Death Benefit is different for Contracts issued in Washington, New
York or Minnesota. We call this optional Death Benefit the "Maximum Anniversary
Value Death Benefit." It does not contain the Earnings Protection Benefit.


The charge for the Maximum Anniversary Value Death Benefit is the same as the
charge for the MAV/EPB Death Benefit. It is an additional charge we deduct on a
daily basis that is equal to an annual charge of 0.30% of your Contract Value
invested in the Sub-Accounts.


The Maximum Anniversary Value Death Benefit is described below:


If your Contract has the Asset Protection Death Benefit, the Death Benefit will
be the greatest of the Asset Protection Death Benefit or the following two
values:


-   The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus an adjustment for any
partial Surrenders; or


-   Your Maximum Anniversary Value.


If your Contract has the Premium Protection Death Benefit, the Death Benefit
will be the greater of the Premium Protection Death Benefit or Your Maximum
Anniversary Value.






ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEATH BENEFITS



For more information on how these optional benefits may affect your taxes,
please see the section entitled, "Federal Tax Considerations," under sub-section
entitled "Taxation of Annuities -- General Provisions Affecting Contracts Not
Held in Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans."


Your Contract states that as part of the Death Benefit calculation we deduct any
Premium Payments we receive within 12 months of death or after death as part of
the total






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           31





Premium Payment calculation. If you purchase this Contract, we will waive that
deduction when we calculate the Premium Protection Death Benefit or the MAV/EPB
Death Benefit, except when we calculate the limitation of Contract gain for
purposes of the MAV/EPB Death Benefit. We will also waive the deduction for
purposes of the Asset Protection Death Benefit when we calculate the Asset
Protection Death Benefit Maximum. Your Contract states that we exclude any
Premium Payments that we receive within 12 months of death when we calculate the
Asset Protection Death Benefit. We waive this exclusion for your initial Premium
Payment if death occurs in the first Contract Year.


We impose a limit on total death benefits if:


-   The total death benefits are payable as a result of the death of any one
person under one or more deferred variable annuities issued by Hartford or
its affiliates, and


-   Aggregate Premium Payments total $5 million or more.


When the limit applies, total death benefits cannot exceed the greater of:


-   The aggregate Premium Payments reduced by an adjustment for any Surrenders;
or


-   The aggregate Contract Value plus $1 million.


However, if you add Premium Payments to any of your Contracts such that
aggregate Premium Payments total to $5 million or more, the aggregate death
benefit will be the greater of the maximum death benefit above or:


-   The aggregate Contract Value; plus


-   The aggregate death benefits in excess of the aggregate Contract Values at
the time you added the Premium Payments to your Contracts.


We calculate the adjustment to your aggregate Premium Payments for any
Surrenders by reducing your aggregate Premium Payments on a dollar for dollar
basis for any Surrenders within a Contract Year up to 10% of aggregate Premium
Payments. After that, we reduce your aggregate Premium Payments proportionally
based on the amount of any Surrenders that exceed 10% of aggregate Premium
Payments divided by your aggregate Contract Value at the time of Surrender.


Any reduction in death benefits to multiple variable annuity contracts will be
in proportion to the Contract Value of each Contract at the time of reduction.



HOW IS THE DEATH BENEFIT PAID?



The Death Benefit may be taken in one lump sum or under any of the Annuity
Payout Options then being offered by us, unless the Contract Owner has
designated the manner in which the Beneficiary will receive the Death Benefit.
On the date we receive complete instructions from the Beneficiary, we will
compute the Death Benefit amount to be paid out or applied to a selected Annuity
Payout Option. When there is more than one Beneficiary, we will calculate the
Death Benefit amount for each Beneficiary's portion of the proceeds and then pay
it out or apply it to a selected Annuity Payout Option according to each
Beneficiary's instructions. If we receive the complete instructions on a
Non-Valuation Day, computations will take place on the next Valuation Day.


If your Beneficiary elects to receive the Death Benefit amount as a lump sum
payment, we may transfer that amount to our General Account and issue the
Beneficiary a draftbook. The Beneficiary can write one draft for total payment
of the Death Benefit, or keep the money in the General Account and write drafts
as needed. We will credit interest at a rate determined periodically in our sole
discretion. For Federal income tax purposes, the Beneficiary will be deemed to
have received the lump sum payment on transfer of the Death Benefit amount to
the General Account. The interest will be taxable to the Beneficiary in the tax
year that it is credited. If the Beneficiary resides or the Contract was
purchased in a state that imposes restrictions on this method of lump sum
payment, we may issue a check to the Beneficiary.


The Beneficiary may elect under the Annuity Proceeds Settlement Option "Death
Benefit Remaining with the Company" to leave proceeds from the Death Benefit
invested with us for up to five years from the date of death if death occurred
before the Annuity Commencement Date. Once we receive a certified death
certificate or other legal documents acceptable to us, the Beneficiary can: (a)
make Sub-Account transfers and (b) take Surrenders without paying Contingent
Deferred Sales Charges.


The Beneficiary of a non-qualified Contract or IRA may also elect the "Single
Life Expectancy Only" option. This option allows the Beneficiary to take the
Death Benefit in a series of payments spread over a period equal to the
Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy. Distributions are calculated based on
IRS life expectancy tables. This option is subject to different limitations and
conditions depending on whether the Contract is non-qualified or an IRA.


REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS -- If the Contract Owner dies before the Annuity
Commencement Date, the Death Benefit must be distributed within five years after
death or be distributed under a distribution option or Annuity Payout Option
that satisfies the Alternatives to the Required Distributions described below.


If the Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date under an
Annuity Payout Option that permits the Beneficiary to elect to continue Annuity
Payouts or receive the Commuted Value, any remaining value must be distributed
at least as rapidly as under the payment method being used as of the Contract
Owner's death.


If the Contract Owner is not an individual (e.g. a trust), then the original
Annuitant will be treated as the Contract Owner in the situations described
above and any change in the original Annuitant will be treated as the death of
the Contract Owner.



WHAT SHOULD THE BENEFICIARY CONSIDER?



ALTERNATIVES TO THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS -- The selection of an Annuity Payout
Option and the timing of the selection will have an impact on the tax treatment
of the Death Benefit.





32                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




To receive favorable tax treatment, the Annuity Payout Option selected: (a)
cannot extend beyond the Beneficiary's life or life expectancy, and (b) must
begin within one year of the date of death.


If these conditions are NOT met, the Death Benefit will be treated as a lump sum
payment for tax purposes. This sum will be taxable in the year in which it is
considered received.


SPOUSAL CONTRACT CONTINUATION -- If the Contract Owner dies and a Beneficiary is
the Contract Owner's spouse, that portion of the Contract for which the spouse
is considered the Beneficiary will continue with the spouse as Contract Owner,
unless the spouse elects to receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum payment or
as an annuity payment option. If the Contract continues with the spouse as
Contract Owner, we will adjust the Contract Value to the amount that we would
have paid as the Death Benefit payment, had the spouse elected to receive the
Death Benefit as a lump sum payment. Spousal Contract Continuation will only
apply one time for each Contract.


If your spouse continues any portion of the Contract as Contract Owner and
elects the MAV/EPB Death Benefit, Hartford will use the date the Contract is
continued with your spouse as Contract Owner as the effective date the optional
Death Benefit was added to the Contract. This means we will use the date the
Contract is continued with your spouse as Contract Owner as the effective date
for calculating the MAV/EPB Death Benefit. The percentage used for the MAV/EPB
Death Benefit will be determined by the oldest age of any remaining joint
Contract Owner or Annuitant at the time the Contract is continued.



WHO WILL RECEIVE THE DEATH BENEFIT?



The distribution of the Death Benefit applies only when death is before the
Annuity Commencement Date.


If death occurs on or after the Annuity Commencement Date, there may be no
payout at death unless the Contract Owner has elected an Annuity Payout Option
that permits the Beneficiary to elect to continue Annuity Payouts or receive the
Commuted Value.

SURRENDERS




WHAT KINDS OF SURRENDERS ARE AVAILABLE?



FULL SURRENDERS BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- When you Surrender your
Contract before the Annuity Commencement Date, the Surrender Value of the
Contract will be made in a lump sum payment. The Surrender Value is the Contract
Value minus any applicable Premium Taxes, Contingent Deferred Sales Charges and
the Annual Maintenance Fee. The Surrender Value may be more or less than the
amount of the Premium Payments made to a Contract.


PARTIAL SURRENDERS BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may request a
partial Surrender of Contract Values at any time before the Annuity Commencement
Date. We will deduct any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. You can
ask us to deduct the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge from the amount you are
Surrendering or from your remaining Contract Value. If we deduct the Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge from your remaining Contract Value, that amount will also
be subject to Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.


There are two restrictions on partial Surrenders before the Annuity Commencement
Date:


-   The partial Surrender amount must be at least equal to $100, our current
minimum for partial Surrenders, and


-   After a Surrender, your Contract Value must be equal to or greater than our
then current minimum Contract Value that we establish according to our
current policies and procedures. We may change the minimum Contract Value in
our sole discretion, with notice to you. Our current minimum Contract Value
is $500 after the Surrender. The minimum Contract Value in New York must be
$1000 after the Surrender. We will close your Contract and pay the full
Surrender Value if the Contract Value is under the minimum after a
Surrender.


FULL SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may Surrender your
Contract on or after the Annuity Commencement Date only if you selected the
Payment for a Period Certain Annuity Payout Option. Under this option, we pay
you the Commuted Value of your Contract minus any applicable Contingent Deferred
Sales Charges. The Commuted Value is determined on the day we receive your
written request for Surrender.


PARTIAL SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- Partial Surrenders are
permitted after the Annuity Commencement Date if you select the Life Annuity
With Payments for a Period Certain, Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity With
Payments for a Period Certain or the Payment for a Period Certain Annuity Payout
Options. You may take partial Surrenders of amounts equal to the Commuted Value
of the payments that we would have made during the "Period Certain" for the
number of years you select under the Annuity Payout Option that we guarantee to
make Annuity Payouts.


To qualify for partial Surrenders under these Annuity Payout Options you must
make the Surrender request during the Period Certain.


Hartford will deduct any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charges.


If you elect to take the entire Commuted Value of the Annuity Payouts we would
have made during the Period Certain, Hartford will not make any Annuity Payouts
during the remaining Period Certain. If you elect to take only some of the
Commuted Value of the Annuity Payouts we would have made during the Period
Certain, Hartford will reduce the remaining Annuity Payouts during the remaining
Period Certain. Annuity Payouts that are to be made after the Period Certain is
over will not change.


Please check with your qualified tax adviser because there could be adverse tax
consequences for partial Surrenders after the Annuity Commencement Date.



HOW DO I REQUEST A SURRENDER?



Requests for full Surrenders must be in writing. Requests for partial Surrenders
can be made in writing or by telephone. We will send your money within seven
days of receiving complete instructions. However, we may postpone payment of
Surrenders whenever: (a) the New York Stock Exchange is closed, (b) trading on
the New York Stock Exchange is restricted by the SEC, (c) the SEC permits and
orders postponement or (d) the SEC determines that an emergency exists to
restrict valuation.


WRITTEN REQUESTS -- To request a full or partial Surrender, complete a Surrender
Form or send us a letter, signed by you, stating:


-   the dollar amount that you want to receive, either before or after we
withhold taxes and deduct for any applicable charges,


-   your tax withholding amount or percentage, if any, and


-   your mailing address.


If there are joint Contract Owners, both must authorize all Surrenders. For a
partial Surrender, specify the Accounts that you want your Surrender to come
from, otherwise, the Surrender will be taken in proportion to the value in each
Account.


TELEPHONE REQUESTS -- To request a partial Surrender by telephone, we must have
received your completed Telephone Redemption Program Enrollment Form. If there
are joint Contract Owners, both must sign this form. By signing the form, you
authorize us to accept telephone instructions for partial Surrenders from either
Contract Owner. Telephone authorization will remain in effect until we receive a
written cancellation notice from you or your joint Contract Owner, we
discontinue the program, or you are no longer the owner of the Contract. There
are some restrictions on telephone surrenders, please call us with any
questions.





34                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




We may record telephone calls and use other procedures to verify information and
confirm that instructions are genuine. We will not be liable for losses or
expenses arising from telephone instructions reasonably believed to be genuine.

WE MAY MODIFY THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TELEPHONE REDEMPTIONS AT ANY TIME.


Telephone Surrender instructions received before the close of the New York Stock
Exchange will be processed on that Valuation Day. Otherwise, your request will
be processed on the next Valuation Day.







COMPLETING A POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM FOR ANOTHER PERSON TO ACT ON YOUR BEHALF MAY
PREVENT YOU FROM MAKING SURRENDERS VIA TELEPHONE.




WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ABOUT TAXES?



There are certain tax consequences associated with Surrenders:


PRIOR TO AGE 59 1/2 -- If you make a Surrender prior to age 59 1/2, there may be
adverse tax consequences including a 10% federal income tax penalty on the
taxable portion of the Surrender payment. Surrendering before age 59 1/2 may
also affect the continuing tax-qualified status of some Contracts.


WE DO NOT MONITOR SURRENDER REQUESTS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER A SURRENDER IS
PERMISSIBLE, WITH OR WITHOUT FEDERAL INCOME TAX PENALTY, PLEASE CONSULT YOUR
PERSONAL TAX ADVISER.


MORE THAN ONE CONTRACT ISSUED IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR -- If you own more than
one contract issued by us or our affiliates in the same calendar year, then
these contracts may be treated as one contract for the purpose of determining
the taxation of distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Please
consult your tax adviser for additional information.


INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 403(b) ANNUITIES-- As of December 31, 1988, all
section 403(b) annuities have limits on full and partial Surrenders.
Contributions to your Contract made after December 31, 1988 and any increases in
cash value after December 31, 1988 may not be distributed unless you are: (a)
age 59 1/2, (b) no longer employed, (c) deceased, (d) disabled, or (e)
experiencing a financial hardship (cash value increases may not be distributed
for hardships prior to age 59 1/2). Distributions prior to age 59 1/2 due to
financial hardship; unemployment or retirement may still be subject to a penalty
tax of 10%.


WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONSULT WITH YOUR QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER BEFORE MAKING ANY
SURRENDERS. PLEASE SEE THE "FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS" SECTION FOR MORE
INFORMATION.



ANNUITY PAYOUTS



THIS SECTION DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BEGIN TO MAKE REGULAR ANNUITY
PAYOUTS FROM YOUR CONTRACT. YOU, AS THE CONTRACT OWNER, SHOULD ANSWER FIVE
QUESTIONS:


-   When do you want Annuity Payouts to begin?


-   Which Annuity Payout Option do you want to use?


-   How often do you want the Payee to receive Annuity Payouts?


-   What is the Assumed Investment Return?


-   Do you want Annuity Payouts to be fixed dollar amount or variable dollar
amount?


Please check with your Registered Representative to select the Annuity Payout
Option that best meets your income needs.


1. WHEN DO YOU WANT ANNUITY PAYOUTS TO BEGIN?


You select an Annuity Commencement Date when you purchase your Contract or at
any time before you begin receiving Annuity Payouts. You may choose to begin
receiving a variable dollar amount Annuity Payout at any time. You may not
choose a fixed dollar amount Annuity Payout during the first two Contract Years.
If the annuity reaches the maximum Annuity Commencement Date, which is the later
of the 10th Contract Anniversary or the date the annuitant reaches age 90, the
Contract will automatically be annuitized unless we and the Owner(s) agree to
extend the Annuity Commencement Date, which approval may be withheld or delayed
for any reason. If this Contract is issued to the trustee of a Charitable
Remainder Trust, the Annuity Commencement Date may be deferred to the
Annuitant's 100th birthday.


The Annuity Calculation Date is when the amount of your Annuity Payout is
determined. This occurs within five Valuation Days before your selected Annuity
Commencement Date.


All Annuity Payouts, regardless of frequency, will occur on the same day of the
month as the Annuity Commencement Date. After the initial payout, if an Annuity
Payout date falls on a Non-Valuation Day, the Annuity Payout is computed on the
prior Valuation Day. If the Annuity Payout date does not occur in a given month
due to a leap year or months with only 28 days (i.e. the 31st), the Annuity
Payout will be computed on the last Valuation Day of the month.


2. WHICH ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION DO YOU WANT TO USE?


Your Contract contains the Annuity Payout Options described below. The Annuity
Proceeds Settlement Option is an option that can be elected by the Beneficiary
and is described in the "Death Benefit" section. The Hartford's Principal First
Payout Option is available only to Contract Holders who elect The Hartford's
Principal First rider. The Hartford's Principal First Preferred Payout Option is
available only to Contract Holders who elect The Hartford's Principal First
Preferred rider. We may at times offer other Annuity Payout Options. Once we
begin to make Annuity Payouts, the Annuity Payout Option cannot be changed.






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           35






LIFE ANNUITY



We make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living. When the Annuitant
dies, we stop making Annuity Payouts. A Payee would receive only one Annuity
Payout if the Annuitant dies after the first payout, two Annuity Payouts if the
Annuitant dies after the second payout, and so forth.



LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN



We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living, but we at least
guarantee to make Annuity Payouts for a time period you select, between 5 years
and 100 years minus the Annuitant's age. If the Annuitant dies before the
guaranteed number of years have passed, then the Beneficiary may elect to
continue Annuity Payouts for the remainder of the guaranteed number of years or
receive the Commuted Value in one sum.



LIFE ANNUITY WITH A CASH REFUND



We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living. When the
Annuitant dies, if the Annuity Payouts already made are less than the Contract
Value on the Annuity Commencement Date minus any Premium Tax, the remaining
value will be paid to the Beneficiary. The remaining value is equal to the
Contract Value minus any Premium Tax minus all Annuity Payouts already made.
This option is only available for fixed dollar amount Annuity Payouts.



JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY



We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant and Joint Annuitant are
living. When one Annuitant dies, we continue to make Annuity Payouts until that
second Annuitant dies. When choosing this option, you must decide what will
happen to the Annuity Payouts after the first Annuitant dies. You must select
Annuity Payouts that:


-   Remain the same at 100%, or


-   Decrease to 66.67%, or


-   Decrease to 50%.


For variable Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent Annuity Units; for
fixed Annuity Payouts, they represent actual dollar amounts. The percentage will
also impact the Annuity Payout amount we pay while both Annuitants are living.
If you pick a lower percentage, your original Annuity Payouts will be higher
while both Annuitants are alive.



JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN



We will make Annuity Payouts as long as either the Annuitant or Joint Annuitant
are living, but we at least guarantee to make Annuity Payouts for a time period
you select, between 5 years and 100 years minus your younger Annuitant's age. If
the Annuitant and the Joint Annuitant both die before the guaranteed number of
years have passed, then the Beneficiary may continue Annuity Payouts for the
remainder of the guaranteed number of years or receive the Commuted Value in one
sum.


When choosing this option, you must decide what will happen to the Annuity
Payouts after the first Annuitant dies. You must select Annuity Payouts that:


-   Remain the same at 100%, or


-   Decrease to 66.67%, or


-   Decrease to 50%.


For variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent Annuity
Units. For fixed dollar amount Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent
actual dollar amounts. The percentage will also impact the Annuity Payout amount
we pay while both Annuitants are living. If you pick a lower percentage, your
original Annuity Payouts will be higher while both Annuitants are alive.



PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN



We agree to make payments for a specified time. The minimum period that you can
select is 10 years during the first two Contract Years and 5 years after the
second Contract Anniversary. The maximum period that you can select is 100 years
minus your Annuitant's age. If, at the death of the Annuitant, Annuity Payouts
have been made for less than the time period selected, then the Beneficiary may
elect to continue the remaining Annuity Payouts or receive the Commuted Value in
one sum. You may not choose a fixed dollar amount Annuity Payout during the
first two Contract Years.



THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PAYOUT OPTION



If you elect The Hartford's Principal First and later decide to annuitize your
Contract, you may choose another Annuity Payout Option in addition to those
Annuity Payout Options offered in the Contract. Under this Fixed Annuity Payout
Option, called The Hartford's Principal First Payout Option, Hartford will pay a
fixed dollar amount for a specific number of years ("Payout Period"). If you,
the joint Contract Owner or the Annuitant should die before the Payout Period is
complete the remaining payments will be made to the Beneficiary. The Payout
Period is determined on the Annuity Calculation Date and it will equal the
current Benefit Amount divided by the Benefit Payment. The total amount of the
Annuity Payouts under this option will be equal to the Benefit Amount.



THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED PAYOUT OPTION



If you elect The Hartford's Principal First Preferred and later decide to
annuitize your Contract, you may choose another Annuity Payout Option in
addition to those Annuity Payout Options offered in the Contract. Under this
Fixed Annuity Payout Option, called The Hartford's Principal First Preferred
Payout Option, Hartford will pay a fixed dollar amount for a specific number of
years ("Payout Period"). If you, the joint Contract Owner or the Annuitant
should die before the Payout Period is complete the remaining payments will be
made to the Beneficiary. The Payout Period is determined on the Annuity
Calculation Date and it will equal the current Benefit Amount divided by the
Benefit Payment. The total amount of the Annuity Payouts under this option will
be equal to the Benefit Amount.





36                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY





IMPORTANT INFORMATION:



-   YOU CANNOT SURRENDER YOUR CONTRACT ONCE ANNUITY PAYOUTS BEGIN, UNLESS YOU
HAVE SELECTED LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN, JOINT AND
LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN, OR PAYMENTS
FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION. A CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES
CHARGE MAY BE DEDUCTED.


-   For qualified Contracts, if you elect an Annuity Payout Option with a Period
Certain, the guaranteed number of years must be less than the life
expectancy of the Annuitant at the time the Annuity Payouts begin. We
compute life expectancy using the IRS mortality tables.


-   AUTOMATIC ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- If you do not elect an Annuity Payout Option,
monthly Annuity Payouts will automatically begin on the Annuity Commencement
Date under the Life Annuity with Payments for a Period Certain Annuity
Payout Option with a ten-year period certain. Automatic Annuity Payouts will
be fixed dollar amount Annuity Payouts, variable dollar amount Annuity
Payouts, or a combination of fixed or variable dollar amount Annuity
Payouts, depending on the investment allocation of your Account in effect on
the Annuity Commencement Date. Automatic variable Annuity Payouts will be
based on an Assumed Investment Return equal to 5%.


3.    HOW OFTEN DO YOU WANT THE PAYEE TO RECEIVE ANNUITY PAYOUTS?


In addition to selecting an Annuity Commencement Date and an Annuity Payout
Option, you must also decide how often you want the Payee to receive Annuity
Payouts. You may choose to receive Annuity Payouts:


-   monthly,


-   quarterly,


-   semi-annually, or


-   annually.


Once you select a frequency, it cannot be changed. If you do not make a
selection, the Payee will receive monthly Annuity Payouts. You must select a
frequency that results in an Annuity Payout of at least $50. If the amount falls
below $50, we have the right to change the frequency to bring the Annuity Payout
up to at least $50. For Contracts issued in New York, the minimum monthly
Annuity Payout is $20.


4. WHAT IS THE ASSUMED INVESTMENT RETURN?


The Assumed Investment Return ("AIR") is the investment return you select before
we start to make Annuity Payouts. It is a critical assumption for calculating
variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts. The first Annuity Payout will be based
upon the AIR. The remaining Annuity Payouts will fluctuate based on the
performance of the underlying Funds.


Subject to the approval of your State, you can select one of three AIRs: 3%, 5%
or 6%. The greater the AIR, the greater the initial Annuity Payout. But a higher
AIR may result in a smaller potential growth in future Annuity Payouts when the
Sub-Accounts earn more than the AIR. On the other hand, a lower AIR results in a
lower initial Annuity Payout, but future Annuity Payouts have the potential to
be greater when the Sub-Accounts earn more than the AIR.


For example, if the Sub-Accounts earned exactly the same as the AIR, then the
second monthly Annuity Payout is the same as the first. If the Sub-Accounts
earned more than the AIR, then the second monthly Annuity Payout is higher than
the first. If the Sub-Accounts earned less than the AIR, then the second monthly
Annuity Payout is lower than the first.


Level variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts would be produced if the investment
returns remained constant and equal to the AIR. In fact, Annuity Payouts will
vary up or down as the investment rate varies up or down from the AIR. The
degree of variation depends on the AIR you select.


5.    DO YOU WANT ANNUITY PAYOUTS TO BE FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT OR VARIABLE DOLLAR
AMOUNT?


You may choose an Annuity Payout Option with fixed dollar amounts or variable
dollar amounts, depending on your income needs. You may not choose a fixed
dollar amount Annuity Payout during the first two Contract Years.


FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- Once a fixed dollar amount Annuity Payout
begins, you cannot change your selection to receive variable dollar amount
Annuity Payouts. You will receive equal fixed dollar amount Annuity Payouts
throughout the Annuity Payout period. Fixed dollar amount Annuity Payout amounts
are determined by multiplying the Contract Value, minus any applicable Premium
Taxes, by an annuity rate set by us.


You may not choose a fixed dollar amount Annuity Payout if you purchase your
Contract in Oregon or Pennsylvania.


VARIABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- Once a variable dollar amount Annuity
Payout begins, you cannot change your selection to receive a fixed dollar amount
Annuity Payout. A variable dollar amount Annuity Payout is based on the
investment performance of the Sub-Accounts. The variable dollar amount Annuity
Payouts may fluctuate with the performance of the underlying Funds. To begin
making variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, we convert the first Annuity
Payout amount to a set number of Annuity Units and then price those units to
determine the Annuity Payout amount. The number of Annuity Units that determines
the Annuity Payout amount remains fixed unless you transfer units between
Sub-Accounts.


The dollar amount of the first variable Annuity Payout depends on:


-   the Annuity Payout Option chosen,


-   the Annuitant's attained age and gender (if applicable),


-   the applicable annuity purchase rates based on the 1983a Individual Annuity
Mortality table adjusted for projections based on accepted actuarial
principles, and


-   the Assumed Investment Return.






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           37





The total amount of the first variable dollar amount Annuity Payout is
determined by dividing the Contract Value minus any applicable Premium Taxes, by
$1,000 and multiplying the result by the payment factor defined in the Contract
for the selected Annuity Payout Option.


The dollar amount of each subsequent variable dollar amount Annuity Payout is
equal to the total of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account multiplied by the
Annuity Unit Value of each Sub-Account.


The Annuity Unit Value of each Sub-Account for any Valuation Period is equal to
the Accumulation Unit Value Net Investment Factor for the current Valuation
Period multiplied by the Annuity Unit Factor, multiplied by the Annuity Unit
Value for the preceding Valuation Period. The Annuity Unit Factor offsets the
AIR used to calculate your first variable dollar amount Annuity Payout. The
Annuity Unit Factor for a 3% AIR is 0.999919%. The Annuity Unit Factor for a 5%
AIR is 0.999866%. The Annuity Unit Factor for a 6% AIR is 0.999840%.


COMBINATION ANNUITY PAYOUT -- You may choose to receive a combination of fixed
dollar amount and variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts as long as they total
100% of your Annuity Payout. For example, you may choose to use 40% fixed dollar
amount and 60% variable dollar amount to meet you income needs.


TRANSFER OF ANNUITY UNITS -- After the Annuity Calculation Date, you may
transfer dollar amounts of Annuity Units from one Sub-Account to another. On the
day you make a transfer, the dollar amounts are equal for both Sub-Accounts and
the number of Annuity Units will be different. We will transfer the dollar
amount of your Annuity Units the day we receive your written request if received
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Otherwise, the transfer will be
made on the next Valuation Day. All Sub-Account transfers must comply with our
Sub-Account transfer restriction policies. For more information on Sub-Account
transfer restrictions please see the sub-section entitled "Can I Transfer from
one Sub-Account to another?" under the section entitled "The Contract."



OTHER PROGRAMS AVAILABLE



We may discontinue, modify or amend any of these Programs or any other programs
we establish. Any change other than termination of a Program will not affect
Contract Owners currently enrolled in the Program. There is no additional charge
for these programs. If you are enrolled in any of these programs while a fund
merger, substitution or liquidation takes place, unless otherwise noted in any
communication from us; your Contract Value invested in such underlying Fund will
be transferred automatically to the designated surviving Fund in the case of
mergers and any available Money Market Fund in the case of Fund liquidations.
Your enrollment instructions will be automatically updated to reflect the
surviving Fund or a Money Market Fund for any continued and future investments.


INVESTEASE PROGRAM -- InvestEase is an electronic transfer program that allows
you to have money automatically transferred from your checking or savings
account, and invested in your Contract. It is available for Premium Payments
made after your initial Premium Payment. The minimum amount for each transfer is
$50. You can elect to have transfers occur either monthly or quarterly, and they
can be made into any Account available in your Contract excluding the DCA Plus
Programs.


AUTOMATIC INCOME PROGRAM -- The Automatic Income Program allows you to Surrender
up to 10% of your total Premium Payments each Contract Year without a Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge. You can Surrender from the Accounts you select
systematically on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis. The minimum
amount of each Surrender is $100. Amounts taken under this Program will count
towards the Annual Withdrawal Amount, and if received prior to age 59 1/2, may
have adverse tax consequences, including a 10% federal income tax penalty on the
taxable portion of the Surrender payment.


ASSET ALLOCATION PROGRAM -- Asset Allocation is a program that allows you to
choose an allocation for your Sub-Accounts to help you reach your investment
goals. The Contract offers static model allocations with pre-selected
Sub-Accounts and percentages that have been established for each type of
investor ranging from conservative to aggressive. Over time, Sub-Account
performance may cause your Contract's allocation percentages to change, but
under the Asset Allocation Program, your Sub-Account allocations are rebalanced
to the percentages in the current model you have chosen. You can transfer freely
between allocation models up to twelve times per year. You can only participate
in one model at a time.


ASSET REBALANCING -- Asset Rebalancing is another type of asset allocation
program in which you customize your Sub-Accounts to meet your investment needs.
You select the Sub-Accounts and the percentages you want allocated to each Sub-
Account. Based on the frequency you select, your model will automatically
rebalance to the original percentages chosen. You can transfer freely between
models up to twelve times per year. You can only participate in one model at a
time.


DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAMS -- We currently offer two different types of
Dollar Cost Averaging Programs in addition to the DCA Plus Program. If you
enroll, you may select either the Fixed Amount DCA Program or the
Earnings/Interest DCA Program. The Fixed Amount DCA Program allows you to
regularly transfer an amount you select from the Fixed Accumulation Feature or
any Sub-Account into a different Sub-Account. The Earnings/Interest DCA Program
allows you to regularly transfer the interest from the Fixed Accumulation
Feature or the earnings from one Sub-Account into a different Sub-Account. For
either Program, you may select transfers on a monthly or quarterly basis, but
you must at least make three





38                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




transfers during the Program. The Fixed Amount DCA Program begins 15 days after
the Contract Anniversary the month after you enroll in the Program. The
Earnings/Interest DCA Program begins at the end of the length of the transfer
period you selected plus two business days. That means if you select a monthly
transfer, your Earnings/Interest DCA Program will begin one month plus two
business days after your enrollment. Dollar Cost Averaging Programs do not
guarantee a profit or protect against investment losses.


If you make systematic transfers from the Fixed Accumulation Feature under a
Dollar Cost Averaging Program or DCA Plus Program, you must wait 6 months after
your last systematic transfer before moving Sub-Account Values back to the Fixed
Accumulation Feature.



OTHER INFORMATION



ASSIGNMENT -- A non-qualified Contract may be assigned. We must be properly
notified in writing of an assignment. Any Annuity Payouts or Surrenders
requested or scheduled before we record an assignment will be made according to
the instructions we have on record. We are not responsible for determining the
validity of an assignment. Assigning a non-qualified Contract may require the
payment of income taxes and certain penalty taxes. Please consult a qualified
tax adviser before assigning your Contract.


A qualified Contract may not be transferred or otherwise assigned, unless
allowed by applicable law.


CONTRACT MODIFICATION -- The Annuitant may not be changed. However, if the
Annuitant is still living, the Contingent Annuitant may be changed at any time
prior to the Annuity Commencement Date by sending us written notice.


We may modify the Contract, but no modification will affect the amount or term
of any Contract unless a modification is required to conform the Contract to
applicable federal or state law. No modification will affect the method by which
Contract Values are determined.


HOW CONTRACTS ARE SOLD -- We have entered into a distribution agreement with our
affiliate Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") under which HSD
serves as the principal underwriter for the Contracts, which are offered on a
continuous basis. HSD is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the 1934 Act as a broker-dealer and is a member of the NASD. The principal
business address of HSD is the same as ours. PLANCO Financial Services, Inc., a
subsidiary of Hartford Life Insurance Company, provides marketing support for
us. Woodbury Financial Services, Inc. is another affiliated broker-dealer that
sells this Contract.


HSD has entered into selling agreements with affiliated and unaffiliated
broker-dealers, and financial institutions ("Financial Intermediaries") for the
sale of the Contracts. We pay compensation to HSD for sales of the Contracts by
Financial Intermediaries. The aggregate dollar amount of underwriting
commissions paid to HSD in its role as principal underwriter for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2005, was $1,878,494. Contracts will be sold by individuals
who have been appointed by us as insurance agents and who are registered
representatives of Financial Intermediaries ("Registered Representatives").


The Core and Edge Contracts may be sold directly to the following individuals
free of any sales commission: (1) current or retired officers, directors,
trustees and employees (and their families) of our ultimate corporate parent and
affiliates; and (2) employees and Registered Representatives (and their
families) of Financial Intermediaries. If applicable, we will credit the
Contract with a one-time only credit of 5.0% of the initial Premium Payment.
This additional percentage of Premium Payment in no way affects current or
future charges, rights, benefits or account values of other Contract Owners.


We list below types of arrangements that help to incentivize sales people to
sell our products. These types of arrangements could be viewed as creating
conflicts of interest.


Financial Intermediaries receive commissions (described below under
"Commissions"). Certain selected Financial Intermediaries also receive
additional compensation (described below under "Additional Payments"). All or a
portion of the payments we make to Financial Intermediaries may be passed on to
Registered Representatives according to a Financial Intermediaries' internal
compensation practices.


Affiliated broker-dealers also employ individuals called "wholesalers" in the
sales process. Wholesalers typically receive commissions based on the type of
Contract or optional benefits sold. Commissions are based on a specified amount
of Premium Payments or Contract Value.


COMMISSIONS -- Up front commissions paid to Financial Intermediaries generally
range from 1% to up to 7% of each Premium Payment you pay for your Contract.
Trail commissions (fees paid for customers that maintain their Contracts
generally for more than 1 year) range up to 1.20% of your Contract Value. We pay
different commissions based on the Contract variation that you buy. We may pay a
lower commission for sales to people over age 80.


Commission arrangements vary from one Financial Intermediary to another. We are
not involved in determining your Registered Representative's compensation. Under
certain circumstances, your Registered Representative may be required to return
all or a portion of the commissions paid.


Check with your Registered Representative to verify whether your account is a
brokerage or an advisory account. Your interests may differ from ours and your
Registered Representative (or the Financial Intermediary with which they are
associated). Please ask questions to make sure you understand your rights and
any potential conflicts of interest. If you are an advisory client, your
Registered Representative (or the Financial Intermediary with which they are
associated) can






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           39





be paid both by you and by us based on what you buy. Therefore, profits, and
your Registered Representative's (or their Financial Intermediary's)
compensation, may vary by product and over time. Contact an appropriate person
at your Financial Intermediary with whom you can discuss these differences.


ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS -- Subject to NASD and Financial Intermediary rules, we (or
our affiliates) also pay the following types of promotional fees to encourage
the sale of this Contract. These additional payments could create an incentive
for your Registered Representative, and the Financial Intermediary with which
they are associated, to recommend products that pay them more than others.

corporate-sponsorship related perquisites) or approximately 0.05% based on
average assets. Marketing Expense Allowances for this period did not exceed $
million or approximately 0.25% of the Premium Payments invested in a particular
Fund.



LEGAL MATTERS



There continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating
to financial services companies, particularly mutual funds companies. These
regulatory inquiries have focused on a number of mutual fund issues, including
market timing and late trading, revenue sharing and directed brokerage, fees,
transfer agents and other fund service providers, and other mutual-fund related
issues. The Hartford, which includes Hartford Life Insurance Company ("HLIC")
and its affiliates, has received requests for information and subpoenas from the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), subpoenas from the New York Attorney
General's Office, a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney General's Office,
requests for information from the Connecticut Securities and Investments
Division of the Department of Banking, and requests for information from the New
York Department of Insurance, in each case requesting documentation and other
information regarding various mutual fund regulatory issues. The Hartford





40                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




continues to cooperate fully with these regulators in these matters.


The SEC's Division of Enforcement and the New York Attorney General's Office are
investigating aspects of The Hartford's variable annuity and mutual fund
operations related to market timing. The Hartford continues to cooperate fully
with the SEC and the New York Attorney General's Office in these matters. The
funds are available for purchase by the Separate Accounts of different variable
universal life insurance policies, variable annuity products, and funding
agreements, and they are offered directly to certain qualified retirement plans.
Although existing products contain transfer restrictions between Sub-Accounts,
some products, particularly older variable annuity products, do not contain
restrictions on the frequency of transfers. In addition, as a result of the
settlement of litigation against The Hartford with respect to certain owners of
older variable annuity contracts, The Hartford's ability to restrict transfers
by these owners has, until recently, been limited. The Hartford has executed an
agreement with the parties to the previously settled litigation which, together
with separate agreements between these Contract Owners and their broker, has
resulted in the exchange or surrender of substantially all of the variable
annuity contracts that were the subject of the previously settled litigation.
Pursuant to an agreement in principle reached in February 2005 with the Board of
Directors of the HLS funds, The Hartford has indemnified the affected funds for
material harm deemed to have been caused to the funds by frequent trading by
these owners for the period from January 2, 2004 through December 31, 2005. The
Hartford does not expect to incur additional costs pursuant to this agreement in
principle in light of the exchange or surrender of these variable annuity
contracts.


The SEC's Division of Enforcement also is investigating aspects of The
Hartford's variable annuity and mutual fund operations related to directed
brokerage and revenue sharing. The Hartford discontinued the use of directed
brokerage in recognition of mutual fund sales in late 2003. The Hartford
continues to cooperate fully with the SEC in these matters.


The Hartford has received subpoenas from the New York Attorney General's Office
and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office requesting information relating to
The Hartford's group annuity products, including single premium group annuities
used in maturity or terminal funding programs. These subpoenas seek information
about how various group annuity products are sold, how The Hartford selects
mutual funds offered as investment options in certain group annuity products,
and how brokers selling The Hartford's group annuity products are compensated.
The Hartford continues to cooperate fully with these regulators in these
matters.


To date, none of the SEC's and New York Attorney General's market timing
investigation, the SEC's directed brokerage investigation, or the New York
Attorney General's and Connecticut Attorney General's single premium group
annuity investigation has resulted in the initiation of any formal action
against The Hartford by these regulators. However, The Hartford believes that
the SEC, the New York Attorney General's Office, and the Connecticut Attorney
General's Office are likely to take some action against The Hartford at the
conclusion of the respective investigations. The Hartford is engaged in active
discussions with the SEC, the New York Attorney General's Office and the
Connecticut Attorney General's Office. The potential timing of any resolution of
any of these matters or the initiation of any formal action by any of these
regulators is difficult to predict. Hartford Life, Inc. ("Hartford Life")
recorded a charge of $66 million, after-tax, to establish a reserve for the
market timing and directed brokerage matters in the first quarter of 2005. Based
on recent developments, Hartford Life recorded an additional charge of $36
million, after-tax, in the fourth quarter of 2005, of which $14 million, after
tax, was attributed to HLIC, to increase the reserve for the market timing,
directed brokerage and single premium group annuity matters. This reserve is an
estimate; in view of the uncertainties regarding the outcome of these regulatory
investigations, as well as the tax-deductibility of payments, it is possible
that the ultimate cost to Hartford Life of these matters could exceed the
reserve by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on Hartford
Life's consolidated results of operations or cash flows in a particular
quarterly or annual period. It is reasonably possible that HLIC may ultimately
be liable for all or a portion of the ultimate cost to Hartford Life in excess
of the $14 million already attributed to HLIC. However, the ultimate liability
of HLIC is not reasonably estimable at this time.


On May 24, 2005, The Hartford received a subpoena from the Connecticut Attorney
General's Office seeking information about The Hartford's participation in
finite reinsurance transactions in which there was no substantial transfer of
risk between the parties. The Hartford is cooperating fully with the Connecticut
Attorney General's Office in this matter.


On June 23, 2005, The Hartford received a subpoena from the New York Attorney
General's Office requesting information relating to purchases of The Hartford's
variable annuity products, or exchanges of other products for The Hartford's
variable annuity products, by New York residents who were 65 or older at the
time of the purchase or exchange. On August 25, 2005, The Hartford received an
additional subpoena from the New York Attorney General's Office requesting
information relating to purchases of or exchanges into The Hartford's variable
annuity products by New York residents during the past five years where the
purchase or exchange was funded using funds from a tax-qualified plan or where
the variable annuity purchased or exchanged for was a Sub-Account of a
tax-qualified plan or was subsequently put into a tax-qualified plan. The
Hartford is cooperating fully with the New York Attorney General's Office in
these matters.


On July 14, 2005, The Hartford received an additional subpoena from the
Connecticut Attorney General's Office concerning The Hartford's structured
settlement business. This subpoena requests information about The Hartford's
sale of annuity products for structured settlements, and about the






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           41





ways in which brokers are compensated in connection with the sale of these
products. The Hartford is cooperating fully with the New York Attorney General's
Office and the Connecticut Attorney General's Office in these matters.


The Hartford has received a request for information from the New York Attorney
General's Office about issues relating to the reporting of workers' compensation
premium. The Hartford is cooperating fully with the New York Attorney General's
Office in this matter.


The Hartford does not expect any of these actions to result in a material
adverse on the Separate Accounts or on the HLS funds that serve as underlying
investments for these accounts.

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS




A. INTRODUCTION



The following summary of tax rules does not provide or constitute any tax
advice. It provides only a general discussion of certain of the expected federal
income tax consequences with respect to amounts contributed to, invested in or
received from a Contract, based on our understanding of the existing provisions
of the Code, Treasury Regulations thereunder, and public interpretations thereof
by the IRS (e.g., Revenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures or Notices) or by
published court decisions. This summary discusses only certain federal income
tax consequences to United States Persons, and does not discuss state, local or
foreign tax consequences. The term United States Persons means citizens or
residents of the United States, domestic corporations, domestic partnerships,
trust or estates that are subject to United States federal income tax,
regardless of the source of their income. See "Annuity Purchases by Nonresident
Aliens and Foreign Corporations," regarding annuity purchases by non-U.S.
Persons or residents.


This summary has been prepared by us after consultation with tax counsel, but no
opinion of tax counsel has been obtained. We do not make any guarantee or
representation regarding any tax status (e.g., federal, state, local or foreign)
of any Contract or any transaction involving a Contract. In addition, there is
always a possibility that the tax treatment of an annuity contract could change
by legislation or other means (such as regulations, rulings or judicial
decisions). Moreover, it is always possible that any such change in tax
treatment could be made retroactive (that is, made effective prior to the date
of the change). Accordingly, you should consult a qualified tax adviser for
complete information and advice before purchasing a Contract.


In addition, this discussion does not address many of the tax consequences if
you use the Contract in various arrangements, including Charitable Remainder
Trusts, tax-qualified retirement arrangements, deferred compensation plans,
split-dollar insurance arrangements, or other employee benefit arrangements. The
tax consequences of any such arrangement may vary depending on the particular
facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement and whether the
arrangement satisfies certain tax qualification or classification requirements.
In addition, the tax rules affecting such an arrangement may have changed
recently, e.g., by legislation or regulations that affect compensatory or
employee benefit arrangements. Therefore, if you are contemplating the use of a
Contract in any arrangement the value of which to you depends in part on its tax
consequences, you should consult a qualified tax adviser regarding the tax
treatment of the proposed arrangement and of any Contract used in it.


THE DISCUSSION SET FORTH BELOW IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL PURPOSES ONLY. SPECIAL
TAX RULES MAY APPLY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN SITUATIONS THAT ARE NOT DISCUSSED
HEREIN. EACH POTENTIAL PURCHASER OF A CONTRACT IS ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH A
QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER AS TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY AMOUNTS INVESTED IN A
CONTRACT UNDER APPLICABLE FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX LAW.



B. TAXATION OF HARTFORD AND THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT



The Separate Account is taxed as part of Hartford which is taxed as a life
insurance company under Subchapter L of Chapter 1 of the Code. Accordingly, the
Separate Account will not be taxed as a "regulated investment company" under
Subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code. Investment income and any realized
capital gains on assets of the Separate Account are reinvested and taken into
account in determining the value of the Accumulation and Annuity Units. As a
result, such investment income and realized capital gains are automatically
applied to increase reserves under the Contract.


Currently, no taxes are due on interest, dividends and short-term or long-term
capital gain earned by the Separate Account with respect to the Contracts.
Hartford is entitled to certain tax





42                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




benefits related to the investment of company assets, including assets of the
Separate Account. These tax benefits, which may include the foreign tax credit
and the corporate dividends received deduction, are not passed back to you since
Hartford is the owner of the assets from which the tax benefits are derived.



C. TAXATION OF ANNUITIES -- GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING CONTRACTS NOT HELD IN
TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS



Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation of annuities in general.


1.   NON-NATURAL PERSONS AS OWNERS


Pursuant to Code Section 72(u), an annuity contract held by a taxpayer other
than a natural person generally is not treated as an annuity contract under the
Code. Instead, such a non-natural Contract Owner generally could be required to
include in gross income currently for each taxable year the excess of (a) the
sum of the Contract Value as of the close of the taxable year and all previous
distributions under the Contract over (b) the sum of net premiums paid for the
taxable year and any prior taxable year and the amount includable in gross
income for any prior taxable year with respect to the Contract under Section

72(u). However, Section 72(u) does not apply to:


-   A contract the nominal owner of which is a non-natural person but the
beneficial owner of which is a natural person (e.g., where the non-natural
owner holds the contract as an agent for the natural person),


-   A contract acquired by the estate of a decedent by reason of such decedent's
death,


-   Certain contracts acquired with respect to tax-qualified retirement
arrangements,


-   Certain contracts held in structured settlement arrangements that may
qualify under Code Section 130, or


-   A single premium immediate annuity contract under Code Section 72(u)(4),
which provides for substantially equal periodic payments and an annuity
starting date that is no later than 1 year from the date of the contract's
purchase.


A non-natural Contract Owner that is a tax-exempt entity for federal tax
purposes (e.g., a tax-qualified retirement trust or a Charitable Remainder
Trust) generally would not be subject to federal income tax as a result of such
current gross income under Code Section 72(u). However, such a tax-exempt
entity, or any annuity contract that it holds, may need to satisfy certain tax
requirements in order to maintain its qualification for such favorable tax
treatment. See, e.g., IRS Tech. Adv. Memo. 9825001 for certain Charitable
Remainder Trusts.


Pursuant to Code Section 72(s), if the Contract Owner is a non-natural person,
the primary annuitant is treated as the "holder" in applying the required
distribution rules described below. These rules require that certain
distributions be made upon the death of a "holder." In addition, for a
non-natural owner, a change in the primary annuitant is treated as the death of
the "holder." However, the provisions of Code Section 72(s) do not apply to
certain contracts held in tax-qualified retirement arrangements or structured
settlement arrangements.


2.   OTHER CONTRACT OWNERS (NATURAL PERSONS).


A Contract Owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the Contract until an
amount is received or deemed received, e.g., in the form of a lump sum payment
(full or partial value of a Contract) or as Annuity payments under the
settlement option elected.


The provisions of Section 72 of the Code concerning distributions are summarized
briefly below. Also summarized are special rules affecting distributions from
Contracts obtained in a tax-free exchange for other annuity contracts or life
insurance contracts which were purchased prior to August 14, 1982.


a.   DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.


i.   Total premium payments less amounts received which were not includable in
gross income equal the "investment in the contract" under Section 72 of the
Code.


ii.  To the extent that the value of the Contract (ignoring any surrender
charges except on a full surrender) exceeds the "investment in the
contract," such excess constitutes the "income on the contract." It is
unclear what value should be used in determining the "income on the
contract." We believe that the current Contract value (determined without
regard to surrender charges) is an appropriate measure. However, the IRS
could take the position that the value should be the current Contract value
(determined without regard to surrender charges) increased by some measure
of the value of certain future benefits.


iii.  Any amount received or deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement
Date (e.g., upon a partial surrender) is deemed to come first from any
such "income on the contract" and then from "investment in the contract,"
and for these purposes such "income on the contract" shall be computed by
reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph 2.c. below. As a result,
any such amount received or deemed received (1) shall be includable in
gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such
"income on the contract," and (2) shall not be includable in gross income
to the extent that such amount does exceed any such "income on the
contract." If at the time that any amount is received or deemed received
there is no "income on the contract" (e.g., because the gross value of the
Contract does not exceed the "investment in the contract" and no
aggregation rule applies), then such amount received or deemed received
will not be includable in gross income, and will simply reduce the
"investment in the contract."


iv.  The receipt of any amount as a loan under the Contract or the assignment or
pledge of any portion of the value of the Contract shall be treated as an
amount received for






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           43





purposes of this subparagraph a. and the next subparagraph b.


v.   In general, the transfer of the Contract, without full and adequate
consideration, will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this
subparagraph a. and the next subparagraph b. This transfer rule does not
apply, however, to certain transfers of property between spouses or
incident to divorce.


vi.  In general, any amount actually received under the Contract as a Death
Benefit, including an optional Death Benefit, if any, will be treated as an
amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a. and the next
subparagraph b.


b.  DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.


Annuity payments made periodically after the Annuity Commencement Date are
includable in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount
determined by the application of the ratio of the "investment in the contract"
to the total amount of the payments to be made after the Annuity Commencement
Date (the "exclusion ratio").


i.   When the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the
exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the
Annuity Commencement Date, any additional payments (including surrenders)
will be entirely includable in gross income.


ii.  If the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the Annuitant and,
as of the date of death, the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross
income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the
contract as of the Annuity Commencement Date, then the remaining portion of
unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable
year of the Annuitant.


iii.  Generally, nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the
Annuity Commencement Date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and
shall be fully includable in gross income. However, upon a full surrender
after such date, only the excess of the amount received (after any
surrender charge) over the remaining "investment in the contract" shall be
includable in gross income (except to the extent that the aggregation rule
referred to in the next subparagraph c. may apply).


c.   AGGREGATION OF TWO OR MORE ANNUITY CONTRACTS.


Contracts issued after October 21, 1988 by the same insurer (or affiliated
insurer) to the same owner within the same calendar year (other than certain
contracts held in connection with tax-qualified retirement arrangements) will be
aggregated and treated as one annuity contract for the purpose of determining
the taxation of distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. An annuity
contract received in a tax-free exchange for another annuity contract or life
insurance contract may be treated as a new contract for this purpose. We believe
that for any Contracts subject to such aggregation, the values under the
Contracts and the investment in the contracts will be added together to
determine the taxation under subparagraph 2.a., above, of amounts received or
deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Withdrawals will first
be treated first as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all such
Contracts is withdrawn. In addition, the Treasury Department has specific
authority under the aggregation rules in Code Section 72(e)(11) to issue
regulations to prevent the avoidance of the income-out-first rules for
non-periodic distributions through the serial purchase of annuity contracts or
otherwise. As of the date of this prospectus, there are no regulations
interpreting these aggregation provisions.


d.  10% PENALTY TAX -- APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN WITHDRAWALS AND ANNUITY
PAYMENTS.


i.   If any amount is received or deemed received on the Contract (before or
after the Annuity Commencement Date), the Code applies a penalty tax equal
to ten percent of the portion of the amount includable in gross income,
unless an exception applies.


ii.  The 10% penalty tax will not apply to the following distributions:


1.   Distributions made on or after the date the recipient has attained
the age of 59 1/2.


2.   Distributions made on or after the death of the holder or where the
holder is not an individual, the death of the primary annuitant.


3.   Distributions attributable to a recipient's becoming disabled.


4.   A distribution that is part of a scheduled series of substantially
equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) for the
life (or life expectancy) of the recipient (or the joint lives or
life expectancies of the recipient and the recipient's designated
Beneficiary). In determining whether a payment stream designed to
satisfy this exception qualifies, it is possible that the IRS could
take the position that the entire interest in the Contract should
include not only the current Contract value, but also some measure
of the value of certain future benefits.


5.   Distributions made under certain annuities issued in connection
with structured settlement agreements.


6.   Distributions of amounts which are allocable to the "investment in
the contract" prior to August 14, 1982 (see next subparagraph e.).


If the taxpayer avoids this 10% penalty tax by qualifying for the substantially
equal periodic payments exception and later such series of payments is modified
(other than by death or disability), the 10% penalty tax will be applied
retroactively to all the prior periodic payments (i.e., penalty tax plus
interest thereon), unless such modification is made after both (a) the taxpayer
has





44                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




reached age 59 1/2 and (b) 5 years have elapsed since the first of these
periodic payments.


e.   SPECIAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING CONTRACTS OBTAINED THROUGH A TAX-FREE
EXCHANGE OF OTHER ANNUITY OR LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS PURCHASED
PRIOR TO AUGUST 14, 1982.


If the Contract was obtained by a tax-free exchange of a life insurance or
annuity Contract purchased prior to August 14, 1982, then any amount received or
deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date shall be deemed to come

(1) first from the amount of the "investment in the contract" prior to August
14, 1982 ("pre-8/14/82 investment") carried over from the prior Contract, (2)
then from the portion of the "income on the contract" (carried over to, as well
as accumulating in, the successor Contract) that is attributable to such
pre-8/14/82 investment, (3) then from the remaining "income on the contract" and

(4) last from the remaining "investment in the contract." As a result, to the
extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed such
pre-8/14/82 investment, such amount is not includable in gross income. In
addition, to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not
exceed the sum of (a) such pre-8/14/82 investment and (b) the "income on the
contract" attributable thereto, such amount is not subject to the 10% penalty
tax. In all other respects, amounts received or deemed received from such
post-exchange Contracts are generally subject to the rules described in this
subparagraph e.


f.   REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS


i.   Death of Contract Owner or Primary Annuitant


Subject to the alternative election or spouse beneficiary provisions in ii
or iii below:


1.   If any Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement
Date and before the entire interest in the Contract has been
distributed, the remaining portion of such interest shall be
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution
being used as of the date of such death;


2.   If any Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Commencement Date,
the entire interest in the Contract shall be distributed within 5
years after such death; and


3.   If the Contract Owner is not an individual, then for purposes of 1.
or 2. above, the primary annuitant under the Contract shall be
treated as the Contract Owner, and any change in the primary
annuitant shall be treated as the death of the Contract Owner. The
primary annuitant is the individual, the events in the life of whom
are of primary importance in affecting the timing or amount of the
payout under the Contract.


ii.  Alternative Election to Satisfy Distribution Requirements


If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner described in i. above
is payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary, such
beneficiary may elect to have the portion distributed over a period that
does not extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary.
Such distributions must begin within a year of the Contract Owner's death.


iii.  Spouse Beneficiary


If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner is payable to or for
the benefit of his or her spouse, and the Annuitant or Contingent
Annuitant is living, such spouse shall be treated as the Contract Owner of
such portion for purposes of section i. above. This spousal contract
continuation shall apply only once for this Contract.


g.   ADDITION OF RIDER OR MATERIAL CHANGE.


The addition of a rider to the Contract, or a material change in the Contract's
provisions, could cause it to be considered newly issued or entered into for tax
purposes, and thus could cause the Contract to lose certain grandfathered tax
status. Please contact your tax adviser for more information.


h.  PARTIAL EXCHANGES.


The IRS in Rev. Rul. 2003-76 has confirmed that the owner of an annuity contract
can direct its insurer to transfer a portion of the contract's cash value
directly to another annuity contract (issued by the same insurer or by a
different insurer), and such a direct transfer can qualify for tax-free exchange
treatment under Code Section 1035 (a "partial exchange"). However, Rev. Rul.
2003-76 also refers to caveats and additional guidance in the companion Notice
2003-51, which discusses cases in which a partial exchange is followed by a
surrender, withdrawal or other distribution from either the old contract or the
new contract. Notice 2003-51 specifically indicates that the IRS is considering

(1) under what circumstances it should treat a partial exchange followed by such
a distribution within 24 months as presumptively for "tax avoidance" purposes
(e.g., to avoid the income-out-first rules on amounts received under Code

Section 72) and (2) what circumstances it should treat as rebutting such a
presumption (e.g., death, disability, reaching age 59 1/2, divorce or loss of
employment). Accordingly, we advise you to consult with a qualified tax adviser
as to potential tax consequences before attempting any partial exchange.


3.   DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.


The Code requires that investments supporting your Contract be adequately
diversified. Code Section 817(h) provides that a variable annuity contract will
not be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the
investments made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately
diversified. If a contract is not treated as an annuity contract, the contract
owner will be subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value.


The Treasury Department's diversification regulations under Code Section 817(h)
require, among other things, that:


-   no more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset
account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment,






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           45





-   no more than 70% is represented by any two investments,


-   no more than 80% is represented by any three investments and


-   no more than 90% is represented by any four investments.


In determining whether the diversification standards are met, all securities of
the same issuer, all interests in the same real property project, and all
interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment. In the
case of government securities, each government agency or instrumentality is
treated as a separate issuer.


A separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on
the last day of each calendar quarter or within 30 days after the quarter ends.
If an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification
requirements, the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid
the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis. However, either the insurer
or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which
the diversification requirements were not met.


4.   TAX OWNERSHIP OF THE ASSETS IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT.


In order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax income deferral,
assets in the separate account supporting the contract must be considered to be
owned by the insurance company, and not by the contract owner, for tax purposes.
The IRS has stated in published rulings that a variable contract owner will be
considered the "owner" of separate account assets for income tax purposes if the
contract owner possesses sufficient incidents of ownership in those assets, such
as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets. In circumstances
where the variable contract owner is treated as the "tax owner" of certain
separate account assets, income and gain from such assets would be includable in
the variable contract owner's gross income. The Treasury Department indicated in
1986 that, in regulations or revenue rulings under Code Section 817(d) (relating
to the definition of a variable contract), it would provide guidance on the
extent to which contract owners may direct their investments to particular
subaccounts without being treated as tax owners of the underlying shares.
Although no such regulations have been issued to date, the IRS has issued a
number of rulings that indicate that this issue remains subject to a facts and
circumstances test for both variable annuity and life insurance contracts.


For instance, the IRS in Rev. Rul. 2003-92 reiterated its position in prior
rulings that, where shares in a fund offered in an insurer's separate account
are not available exclusively through the purchase of a variable insurance
contract (e.g., where such shares can be purchased directly by the general
public or others without going through such a variable contract), such "public
availability" means that such shares should be treated as owned directly by the
contract owner (and not by the insurer) for tax purposes, as if such contract
owner had chosen instead to purchase such shares directly (without going through
the variable contract). None of the shares or other interests in the fund
choices offered in our Separate Account for your Contract are available for
purchase except through an insurer's variable contracts or by other permitted
entities.


The IRS in Rev. Rul. 2003-91 also indicated that an insurer could provide as
many as 20 fund choices for its variable contract owners (each with a general
investment strategy, e.g., a small company stock fund or a special industry
fund) under certain circumstances, without causing such a contract owner to be
treated as the tax owner of any of the underlying fund assets. The ruling does
not specify the number of fund options, if any, that might prevent a variable
contract owner from receiving favorable tax treatment. As a result, we believe
that any owner of a Contract also should receive the same favorable tax
treatment. However, there is necessarily some uncertainty here as long as the
IRS continues to use a facts and circumstances test for investor control and
other tax ownership issues. Therefore, we reserve the right to modify the
Contract as necessary to prevent you from being treated as the tax owner of any
underlying assets.



D. FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING



The portion of an amount received under a Contract that is taxable gross income
to the payee is also subject to federal income tax withholding, pursuant to Code

Section 3405, which requires the following:


1.   Non-Periodic Distributions. The portion of a non-periodic
distribution that is includable in gross income is subject to
federal income tax withholding unless an individual elects not to
have such tax withheld ("election out"). We will provide such an
"election out" form at the time such a distribution is requested.
If the necessary "election out" form is not submitted to us in a
timely manner, generally we are required to withhold 10 percent of
the includable amount of distribution and remit it to the IRS.


2.   Periodic Distributions (payable over a period greater than one
year). The portion of a periodic distribution that is includable in
gross income is generally subject to federal income tax withholding
as if the payee were a married individual claiming 3 exemptions,
unless the individual elects otherwise. An individual generally may
elect out of such withholding, or elect to have income tax withheld
at a different rate, by providing a completed election form. We
will provide such an election form at the time such a distribution
is requested. If the necessary "election out" forms are not
submitted to us in a timely manner, we are required to withhold tax
as if the recipient were married claiming 3 exemptions, and remit
this amount to the IRS.


Regardless of any "election out" (or any amount of tax actually withheld) on an
amount received from a Contract, the payee is generally liable for any failure
to pay the full amount of tax due on the includable portion of such amount
received. A payee





46                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




also may be required to pay penalties under estimated income tax rules, if the
withholding and estimated tax payments are insufficient to satisfy the payee's
total tax liability.



E. GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS



The Contract may be used for a number of qualified retirement plans. If the
Contract is being purchased with respect to some form of qualified retirement
plan, please refer to Appendix I for information relative to the types of plans
for which it may be used and the general explanation of the tax features of such
plans.



F. ANNUITY PURCHASES BY NONRESIDENT ALIENS AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS



The discussion above provides general information regarding U.S. federal income
tax consequences to annuity purchasers that are U.S. citizens or residents.
Purchasers that are not U.S. citizens or residents will generally be subject to
U.S. federal income tax and mandatory withholding on U.S. source taxable annuity
distributions at a 30% rate, unless a lower treaty rate applies and any required
tax forms are submitted to us. If withholding applies, we are required to
withhold tax at the 30% rate, or a lower treaty rate if applicable, and remit it
to the IRS. In addition, purchasers may be subject to state premium tax, other
state and/or municipal taxes, and taxes that may be imposed by the purchaser's
country of citizenship or residence.



G. ESTATE, GIFT AND GENERATION-SKIPPING TAX AND RELATED TAX CONSIDERATIONS



Any amount payable upon a Contract Owner's death, whether before or after the
Annuity Commencement Date, is generally includable in the Contract Owner's
estate for federal estate tax purposes. Similarly, prior to the Contract Owner's
death, the payment of any amount from the Contract, or the transfer of any
interest in the Contract, to a beneficiary or other person for less than
adequate consideration may have federal gift tax consequences. In addition, any
transfer to, or designation of, a non-spouse beneficiary who either is (1) 37
1/2 or more years younger than a Contract Owner or (2) a grandchild (or more
remote further descendent) of a Contract Owner may have federal
generation-skipping-transfer ("GST") tax consequences under Code Section 2601.
Regulations under Code Section 2662 may require us to deduct any such GST tax
from your Contract, or from any applicable payment, and pay it directly to the
IRS. However, any federal estate, gift or GST tax payment with respect to a
Contract could produce an offsetting income tax deduction for a beneficiary or
transferee under Code Section 691(c) (partially offsetting such federal estate
or GST tax) or a basis increase for a beneficiary or transferee under Code

Section 691(c) or Section 1015(d). In addition, as indicated above in
"Distributions Prior to the Annuity Commencement Date," the transfer of a
Contract for less than adequate consideration during the Contract Owner's
lifetime generally is treated as producing an amount received by such Contract
Owner that is subject to both income tax and the 10% penalty tax. To the extent
that such an amount deemed received causes an amount to be includable currently
in such Contract Owner's gross income, this same income amount could produce a
corresponding increase in such Contract Owner's tax basis for such Contract that
is carried over to the transferee's tax basis for such Contract under Code

Section 72(e)(4)(C)(iii) and Section 1015.

APPENDIX I -- INFORMATION REGARDING TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS



This summary does not attempt to provide more than general information about the
federal income tax rules associated with use of a Contract by a tax-qualified
retirement plan. State income tax rules applicable to tax-qualified retirement
plans often differ from federal income tax rules, and this summary does not
describe any of these differences. Because of the complexity of the tax rules,
owners, participants and beneficiaries are encouraged to consult their own tax
advisors as to specific tax consequences.


The Contracts are available to a variety of tax-qualified retirement plans and
arrangements (a "Qualified Plan" or "Plan"). Tax restrictions and consequences
for Contracts, accounts under each type of Qualified Plan differ from each other
and from those for Non-Qualified Contracts. In addition, individual Qualified
Plans may have terms and conditions that impose additional rules. Therefore, no
attempt is made herein to provide more than general information about the use of
the Contract with the various types of Qualified Plans. Participants under such
Qualified Plans, as well as Contract Owners, annuitants and beneficiaries, are
cautioned that the rights of any person to any benefits under such Qualified
Plans may be subject to terms and conditions of the Plans themselves or limited
by applicable law, regardless of the terms and conditions of the Contract issued
in connection therewith. Qualified Plans generally provide for the tax deferral
of income regardless of whether the Qualified Plan invests in an annuity or
other investment. You should consider whether the Contract is a suitable
investment if you are investing through a Qualified Plan.


THE FOLLOWING IS ONLY A GENERAL DISCUSSION ABOUT TYPES OF QUALIFIED PLANS FOR
WHICH THE CONTRACTS MAY BE AVAILABLE. WE ARE NOT THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR FOR ANY
QUALIFIED PLAN. THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR OR CUSTODIAN, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE,
(BUT NOT US) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PLAN ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, NOTIFICATION OF DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS, DISBURSEMENT OF PLAN
BENEFITS, HANDLING ANY PROCESSING AND ADMINISTRATION OF QUALIFIED PLAN LOANS,
COMPLIANCE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND FEDERAL AND STATE TAX REPORTING OF
INCOME/DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PLAN TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND, IF APPLICABLE,
BENEFICIARIES OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND IRA CONTRIBUTIONS FROM PLAN PARTICIPANTS.
OUR ADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES ARE LIMITED TO ADMINISTRATION OF THE CONTRACT AND ANY
DISBURSEMENTS OF ANY CONTRACT BENEFITS TO THE OWNER, ANNUITANT OR BENEFICIARY OF
THE CONTRACT, AS APPLICABLE. OUR TAX REPORTING RESPONSIBILITY IS LIMITED TO
FEDERAL AND STATE TAX REPORTING OF INCOME/DISTRIBUTIONS TO THE APPLICABLE PAYEE
AND IRA CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE OWNER OF A CONTRACT, AS RECORDED ON OUR BOOKS AND
RECORDS. IF YOU ARE PURCHASING A QUALIFIED CONTRACT, YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH
YOUR PLAN ADMINISTRATOR AND/OR A QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER. YOU ALSO SHOULD CONSULT
WITH A QUALIFIED TAX ADVISER AND/OR PLAN ADMINISTRATOR BEFORE YOU WITHDRAW ANY
PORTION OF YOUR CONTRACT VALUE.


The tax rules applicable to Qualified Contracts and Qualified Plans, including
restrictions on contributions and distributions, taxation of distributions and
tax penalties, vary according to the type of Qualified Plan, as well as the
terms and conditions of the Plan itself. Various tax penalties may apply to
contributions in excess of specified limits, plan distributions (including
loans) that do not comply with specified limits, and certain other transactions
relating to such Plans. Accordingly, this summary provides only general
information about the tax rules associated with use of a Qualified Contract in
such a Qualified Plan. In addition, some Qualified Plans are subject to
distribution and other requirements that are not incorporated into our
administrative procedures. Owners, participants, and beneficiaries are
responsible for determining that contributions, distributions and other
transactions comply with applicable tax (and non-tax) law. Because of the
complexity of these rules, Owners, participants and beneficiaries are advised to
consult with a qualified tax adviser as to specific tax consequences.


We do not currently offer the Contracts in connection with all of the types of
Qualified Plans discussed below, and may not offer the Contracts for all types
of Qualified Plans in the future.


1. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES ("IRAs")


In addition to "traditional" IRAs governed by Code Sections 408(a) and (b)
("Traditional IRAs"), there are Roth IRAs governed by Code Section 408A , SEP
IRAs governed by Code Section 408(k), and SIMPLE IRAs governed by Code Section

408(p). Also, Qualified Plans under Code Section 401, 403(b) or 457(b) that
include after-tax employee contributions may be treated as deemed IRAs subject
to the same rules and limitations as Traditional IRAs. Contributions to each of
these types of IRAs are subject to differing limitations. The following is a
very general description of each type of IRA for which a Contract is available.


TRADITIONAL IRAs  Traditional IRAs are subject to limits on the amounts that may
be contributed each year (which contribution limits are scheduled to increase
over the next several years), the persons who may be eligible, and the time when
minimum distributions must begin. Depending upon the circumstances of the
individual, contributions to a Traditional IRA may be made on a deductible or
non-deductible basis. Failure to make required minimum distributions ("RMDs")
when the Owner reaches age 70 1/2 or dies, as described below, may result in
imposition of a 50% penalty tax on any excess of the RMD amount over the amount
actually distributed. In addition, any amount received before the Owner reaches
age 59 1/2 or dies is subject to a 10% penalty tax on premature distributions,
unless a special exception applies, as described below. Under Code Section

408(e), an IRA may not be used for borrowing (or as security for any loan) or in
certain prohibited transactions, and such a transaction could lead to the
complete tax disqualification of an IRA.


You (or your surviving spouse if you die) may rollover funds tax-free from
certain existing Qualified Plans (such as proceeds from existing insurance
contracts, annuity contracts or






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           49





securities) into your Traditional IRA under certain circumstances, as indicated
below. However, mandatory tax withholding of 20% may apply to any eligible
rollover distribution from certain types of Qualified Plan if the distribution
is not transferred directly to your Traditional IRA.


IRAs generally may not invest in life insurance contracts. However, an annuity
contract that is used as an IRA may provide a death benefit that equals the
greater of the premiums paid or the contract's cash value. The Contract offers
an enhanced death benefit that may exceed the greater of the Contract Value or
total premium payments. The tax rules are unclear as to what extent an IRA can
provide a death benefit that exceeds the greater of the IRA's cash value or the
sum of the premiums paid and other contributions into the IRA. Please note that
the IRA rider for the Contract has provisions that are designed to maintain the
Contract's tax qualification as an IRA, and therefore could limit certain
benefits under the Contract (including endorsement, rider or option benefits) to
maintain the Contract's tax qualification.


SEP IRAs  Code Section 408(k) provides for a Traditional IRA in the form of an
employer-sponsored defined contribution plan known as a Simplified Employee
Pension ("SEP") or a SEP IRA. A SEP IRA can have employer, employee and salary
reduction contributions, as well as higher overall contribution limits than a
Traditional IRA, but a SEP is also subject to special tax-qualification
requirements (e.g., on participation, nondiscrimination and withdrawals) and
sanctions. Otherwise, a SEP IRA is generally subject to the same tax rules as
for a Traditional IRA, which are described above. Please note that the IRA rider
for the Contract has provisions that are designed to maintain the Contract's tax
qualification as an IRA, and therefore could limit certain benefits under the
Contract (including endorsement, rider or option benefits) to maintain the
Contract's tax qualification.


SIMPLE IRAs  The Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers
("SIMPLE Plan") is a form of an employer-sponsored Qualified Plan that provides
IRA benefits for the participating employees ("SIMPLE IRAs"). Depending upon the
SIMPLE Plan, employers may make plan contributions into a SIMPLE IRA established
by each eligible participant. Like a Traditional IRA, a SIMPLE IRA is subject to
the 50% penalty tax for failure to make a full RMD, and to the 10% penalty tax
on premature distributions, as described below. In addition, the 10% penalty tax
is increased to 25% for amounts received during the 2-year period beginning on
the date you first participated in a qualified salary reduction arrangement
pursuant to a SIMPLE Plan maintained by your employer under Code Section

408(p)(2). Contributions to a SIMPLE IRA may be either salary deferral
contributions or employer contributions, and these are subject to different tax
limits from those for a Traditional IRA. Please note that the SIMPLE IRA rider
for the Contract has provisions that are designed to maintain the Contract's tax
qualification as an SIMPLE IRA, and therefore could limit certain benefits under
the Contract (including endorsement, rider or option benefits) to maintain the
Contract's tax qualification.


A SIMPLE Plan may designate a single financial institution (a Designated
Financial Institution) as the initial trustee, custodian or issuer (in the case
of an annuity contract) of the SIMPLE IRA set up for each eligible participant.
However, any such Plan also must allow each eligible participant to have the
balance in his SIMPLE IRA held by the Designated Financial Institution
transferred without cost or penalty to a SIMPLE IRA maintained by a different
financial institution. Absent a Designated Financial Institution, each eligible
participant must select the financial institution to hold his SIMPLE IRA, and
notify his employer of this selection.


If we do not serve as the Designated Financial Institution for your employer's
SIMPLE Plan, for you to use one of our Contracts as a SIMPLE IRA, you need to
provide your employer with appropriate notification of such a selection under
the SIMPLE Plan. If you choose, you may arrange for a qualifying transfer of any
amounts currently held in another SIMPLE IRA for your benefit to your SIMPLE IRA
with us.


ROTH IRAs  Code Section 408A permits eligible individuals to establish a Roth
IRA. Contributions to a Roth IRA are not deductible, but withdrawals of amounts
contributed and the earnings thereon that meet certain requirements are not
subject to federal income tax. In general, Roth IRAs are subject to limitations
on the amounts that may be contributed by the persons who may be eligible to
contribute, certain Traditional IRA restrictions, and certain RMD rules on the
death of the Contract Owner. Unlike a Traditional IRA, Roth IRAs are not subject
to RMD rules during the Contract Owner's lifetime. Generally, however, upon the
Owner's death the amount remaining in a Roth IRA must be distributed by the end
of the fifth year after such death or distributed over the life expectancy of a
designated beneficiary. The Owner of a Traditional IRA may convert a Traditional
IRA into a Roth IRA under certain circumstances. The conversion of a Traditional
IRA to a Roth IRA will subject the fair market value of the converted
Traditional IRA to federal income tax. In addition to the amount held in the
converted Traditional IRA, the fair market value may include the value of
additional benefits provided by the annuity contract on the date of conversion,
based on reasonable actuarial assumptions. Tax-free rollovers from a Roth IRA
can be made only to another Roth IRA and under limited circumstances, as
indicated below. Anyone considering the purchase of a Qualified Contract as a
Roth IRA or a "conversion" Roth IRA should consult with a qualified tax adviser.
Please note that the Roth IRA rider for the Contract has provisions that are
designed to maintain the Contract's tax qualification as a Roth IRA, and
therefore could limit certain benefits under the Contract (including
endorsement, rider or option benefits) to maintain the Contract's tax
qualification.


2.    QUALIFIED PENSION OR PROFIT-SHARING PLAN OR SECTION 401(k) PLAN


Provisions of the Code permit eligible employers to establish a tax-qualified
pension or profit sharing plan (described in Section 401(a), and Section 401(k)
if applicable, and exempt from taxation under Section 501(a)). Such a Plan is
subject to





50                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




limitations on the amounts that may be contributed, the persons who may be
eligible to participate, the amounts of "incidental" death benefits, and the
time when RMDs must commence. In addition, a Plan's provision of incidental
benefits may result in currently taxable income to the participant for some or
all of such benefits. Amounts may be rolled over tax-free from a Qualified Plan
to another Qualified Plan under certain circumstances, as described below.
Anyone considering the use of a Qualified Contract in connection with such a
Qualified Plan should seek competent tax and other legal advice.


In particular, please note that these tax rules provide for limits on death
benefits provided by a Qualified Plan (to keep such death benefits "incidental"
to qualified retirement benefits), and a Qualified Plan (or a Qualified
Contract) often contains provisions that effectively limit such death benefits
to preserve the tax qualification of the Qualified Plan (or Qualified Contract).
In addition, various tax-qualification rules for Qualified Plans specifically
limit increases in benefit once RMDs begin, and Qualified Contracts are subject
to such limits. As a result, the amounts of certain benefits that can be
provided by any option under a Qualified Contract may be limited by the
provisions of the Qualified Contract or governing Qualified Plan that are
designed to preserve its tax qualification.


3. TAX SHELTERED ANNUITY UNDER SECTION 403(b) ("TSA")


Code Section 403(b) permits public school employees and employees of certain
types of charitable, educational and scientific organizations described in Code

Section 501(c)(3) to purchase a "tax-sheltered annuity" contract ("TSA") and,
subject to certain limitations, exclude employer contributions to a TSA from
such an employee's gross income. Generally, such contributions may not exceed
the lesser of an annual dollar limit (e.g., $44,000 in 2006) or 100% of the
employee's "includable compensation" for his most recent full year of service,
subject to other adjustments. Special provisions may allow certain employees to
elect a different overall limitation.


A TSA is subject to a prohibition against distributions from the TSA
attributable to contributions made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement,
unless such distribution is made:


a.   after the employee reaches age 59 1/2;


b.  upon the employee's separation from service;


c.   upon the employee's death or disability; or


d.  in the case of hardship (and in the case of hardship, any income
attributable to such contributions may not be distributed).


Please note that the TSA rider for the Contract has provisions that are designed
to maintain the Contract's tax qualification as an TSA, and therefore could
limit certain benefits under the Contract (including endorsement, rider or
option benefits) to maintain the Contract's tax qualification. In particular,
please note that tax rules provide for limits on death benefits provided by a
Qualified Plan (to keep such death benefits "incidental" to qualified retirement
benefits), and a Qualified Plan (or a Qualified Contract) often contains
provisions that effectively limit such death benefits to preserve the tax
qualification of the Qualified Plan (or Qualified Contract). In addition,
various tax-qualification rules for Qualified Plans specifically limit increases
in benefits once RMDs begin, and Qualified Contracts are subject to such limits.
As a result, the amounts of certain benefits that can be provided by any option
under a Qualified Contract may be limited by the provisions of the Qualified
Contract or governing Qualified Plan that are designed to preserve its tax
qualification.


Amounts may be rolled over tax-free from a TSA to another TSA or Qualified Plan
(or from a Qualified Plan to a TSA) under certain circumstances, as described
below.


4.    DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER SECTION 457 ("SECTION 457 PLANS")


Certain governmental employers, or tax-exempt employers other than a
governmental entity, can establish a Deferred Compensation Plan under Code

Section 457. For these purposes, a "governmental employer" is a State, a
political subdivision of a State, or an agency or an instrumentality of a State
or political subdivision of a State. A Deferred Compensation Plan that meets the
requirements of Code Section 457(b) is called an "Eligible Deferred Compensation
Plan" or "Section 457(b) Plan." Code Section 457(b) limits the amount of
contributions that can be made to an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan on
behalf of a participant. In addition, under Code Section 457(d) a Section 457(b)
Plan may not make amounts available for distribution to participants or
beneficiaries before (1) the calendar year in which the participant attains age
70 1/2, (2) the participant has a severance from employment (including death),
or (3) the participant is faced with an unforeseeable emergency (as determined
in accordance with regulations).


All of the assets and income of an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan for a
governmental employer must be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of
participants and their beneficiaries. This trust requirement does not apply to
amounts under an Eligible Deferred Compensation Plan of a tax-exempt
(non-governmental) employer. In addition, this trust requirement does not apply
to amounts held under a Deferred Compensation Plan of a governmental employer
that is not a Section 457(b) Plan. However, where the trust requirement does not
apply, amounts held under a Section 457 Plan must remain subject to the claims
of the employer's general creditors.


5. TAXATION OF AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM QUALIFIED PLANS


Except under certain circumstances in the case of Roth IRAs, amounts received
from Qualified Contracts or Plans generally are taxed as ordinary income under
Code Section 72, to the extent that they are not treated as a tax-free recovery
of after-tax contributions or other "investment in the contract." For annuity
payments and other amounts received after the Annuity Commencement Date from a
Qualified Contract or Plan, the tax rules for determining what portion of each
amount received






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           51





represents a tax-free recovery of "investment in the contract" are generally the
same as for Non-Qualified Contracts, as described above.


For non-periodic amounts from certain Qualified Contracts or Plans, Code Section
72(e)(8) provides special rules that generally treat a portion of each amount
received as a tax-free recovery of the "investment in the contract," based on
the ratio of the "investment in the contract" over the Contract Value at the
time of distribution. However, in determining such a ratio, certain aggregation
rules may apply and may vary, depending on the type of Qualified Contract or
Plan. For instances, all Traditional IRAs owned by the same individual are
generally aggregated for these purposes, but such an aggregation does not
include any IRA inherited by such individual or any Roth IRA owned by such
individual.


In addition, penalty taxes, mandatory tax withholding or rollover rules may
apply to amounts received from a Qualified Contract or Plan, as indicated below.
Accordingly, you are advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser before
taking or receiving any amount (including a loan) from a Qualified Contract or
Plan.


6. PENALTY TAXES FOR QUALIFIED PLANS


Unlike Non-Qualified Contracts, Qualified Contracts are subject to federal
penalty taxes not just on premature distributions, but also on excess
contributions and failures to make required minimum distributions ("RMDs").
Penalty taxes on excess contributions can vary by type of Qualified Plan and
which person made the excess contribution (e.g., employer or an employee). The
penalty taxes on premature distributions and failures to make timely RMDs are
more uniform, and are described in more detail below.


a. PENALTY TAXES ON PREMATURE DISTRIBUTIONS Code Section 72(t) imposes a penalty
income tax equal to 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution from certain
types of Qualified Plans that is made before the employee reaches age 59 1/2.
However, this 10% penalty tax does not apply to a distribution that is either:


-   made to a beneficiary (or to the employee's estate) on or after the
employee's death;


-   attributable to the employee's becoming disabled under Code Section
72(m)(7);


-   part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually -- "SEPPs") made for the life (or life expectancy)
of the employee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of such
employee and a designated beneficiary ("SEPP Exception"), and for certain
Qualified Plans (other than IRAs) such a series must begin after the
employee separates from service;


-   (except for IRAs) made to an employee after separation from service after
reaching age 55; or


-   not greater than the amount allowable as a deduction to the employee for
eligible medical expenses during the taxable year.


In addition, the 10% penalty tax does not apply to a distribution from an IRA
that is either:


-   made after separation from employment to an unemployed IRA owner for health
insurance premiums, if certain conditions are met;


-   not in excess of the amount of certain qualifying higher education expenses,
as defined by Code Section 72(t)(7); or


-   for a qualified first-time home buyer and meets the requirements of Code

Section 72(t)(8).


If the taxpayer avoids this 10% penalty tax by qualifying for the SEPP Exception
and later such series of payments is modified (other than by death or
disability), the 10% penalty tax will be applied RETROACTIVELY TO ALL THE PRIOR
PERIODIC PAYMENTS (i.e., penalty tax plus interest thereon), unless such
modification is made after both (a) the employee has reached age 59 1/2 and (b)
5 years have elapsed since the first of these periodic payments.


For any premature distribution from a SIMPLE IRA during the first 2 years that
an individual participates in a salary reduction arrangement maintained by that
individual's employer under a SIMPLE Plan, the 10% penalty tax rate is increased
to 25%.


b. RMDS AND 50% PENALTY TAX If the amount distributed from a Qualified Contract
or Plan is less than the amount of the required minimum distribution ("RMD") for
the year, the participant is subject to a 50% penalty tax on the amount that has
not been timely distributed.


An individual's interest in a Qualified Plan generally must be distributed, or
begin to be distributed, not later than the Required Beginning Date. Generally,
the Required Beginning Date is April 1 of the calendar year following the later
of:


-   the calendar year in which the individual attains age 70 1/2, or


-   (except in the case of an IRA or a 5% owner, as defined in the Code) the
calendar year in which a participant retires from service with the employer
sponsoring a Qualified Plan that allows such a later Required Beginning
Date.


The entire interest of the individual must be distributed beginning no later
than the Required Beginning Date over --


(a)  the life of the individual or the lives of the individual and a designated
beneficiary (as specified in the Code), or


(b) over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the individual or
the joint life expectancy of the individual and a designated beneficiary.


If an individual dies before reaching the Required Beginning Date, the
individual's entire interest generally must be distributed within 5 years after
the individual's death. However, this RMD rule will be deemed satisfied if
distributions begin before the close of the calendar year following the
individual's death to a designated beneficiary and distribution is over the life
of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life
expectancy of such beneficiary). If such beneficiary is the





52                                           HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY




individual's surviving spouse, distributions may be delayed until the deceased
individual would have attained age 70 1/2.


If an individual dies after RMDs have begun for such individual, any remainder
of the individual's interest generally must be distributed at least as rapidly
as under the method of distribution in effect at the time of the individual's
death.


The RMD rules that apply while the Contract Owner is alive do not apply with
respect to Roth IRAs. The RMD rules applicable after the death of the Owner
apply to all Qualified Plans, including Roth IRAs. In addition, if the Owner of
a Traditional or Roth IRA dies and the Owner's surviving spouse is the sole
designated beneficiary, this surviving spouse may elect to treat the Traditional
or Roth IRA as his or her own.


The RMD amount for each year is determined generally by dividing the account
balance by the applicable life expectancy. This account balance is generally
based upon the account value as of the close of business on the last day of the
previous calendar year. RMD incidental benefit rules also may require a larger
annual RMD amount. RMDs also can be made in the form of annuity payments that
satisfy the rules set forth in Regulations under the Code relating to RMDs.


In addition, in computing any RMD amount based on a contract's account value,
such account value must include the actuarial value of certain additional
benefits provided by the contract. As a result, electing an optional benefit
under a Qualified Contract may require the RMD amount for such Qualified
Contract to be increased each year, and expose such additional RMD amount to the
50% penalty tax for RMDs if such additional RMD amount is not timely
distributed.


7. TAX WITHHOLDING FOR QUALIFIED PLANS


Distributions from a Qualified Contract or Qualified Plan generally are subject
to federal income tax withholding requirements. These federal income tax
withholding requirements, including any "elections out" and the rate at which
withholding applies, generally are the same as for periodic and non-periodic
distributions from a Non-Qualified Contract, as described above, except where
the distribution is an "eligible rollover distribution" (described below in
"ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS"). In the latter case, tax withholding is mandatory at a
rate of 20% of the taxable portion of the "eligible rollover distribution," to
the extent it is not directly rolled over to an IRA or other Eligible Retirement
Plan (described below in "ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS"). Payees cannot elect out of
this mandatory 20% withholding in the case of such an "eligible rollover
distribution."


Also, special withholding rules apply with respect to distributions from
non-governmental Section 457(b) Plans, and to distributions made to individuals
who are neither citizens or resident aliens of the United States.


Regardless of any "election out" (or any actual amount of tax actually withheld)
on an amount received from a Qualified Contract or Plan, the payee is generally
liable for any failure to pay the full amount of tax due on the includable
portion of such amount received. A payee also may be required to pay penalties
under estimated income tax rules, if the withholding and estimated tax payments
are insufficient to satisfy the payee's total tax liability.


8. ROLLOVER DISTRIBUTIONS


The current tax rules and limits for tax-free rollovers and transfers between
Qualified Plans vary according to (1) the type of transferor Plan and transferee
Plan, (2) whether the amount involved is transferred directly between Plan
fiduciaries (a "direct transfer" or a "direct rollover") or is distributed first
to a participant or beneficiary who then transfers that amount back into another
eligible Plan within 60 days (a "60-day rollover"), and (3) whether the
distribution is made to a participant, spouse or other beneficiary. Accordingly,
we advise you to consult with a qualified tax adviser before receiving any
amount from a Qualified Contract or Plan or attempting some form of rollover or
transfer with a Qualified Contract or Plan.


For instance, generally any amount can be transferred directly from one type of
Qualified Plan (e.g., a TSA) to the same type of Plan for the benefit of the
same individual, without limit (or federal income tax), if the transferee Plan
is subject to the same kinds of restrictions as the transferor Plan (e.g., a TSA
that is subject to the same kinds of salary reduction restrictions). Such a
"direct transfer" between the same kind of Plan is generally not treated as any
form of "distribution" out of such a Plan for federal income tax purposes.


By contrast, an amount distributed from one type of Plan (e.g., a TSA) into a
different type of Plan (e.g., a Traditional IRA) generally is treated as a
"distribution" out of the first Plan for federal income tax purposes, and
therefore to avoid being subject to such tax, such a distribution must qualify
either as a "direct rollover" (made directly to another Plan fiduciary) or as a
"60-day rollover." The tax restrictions and other rules for a "direct rollover"
and a "60-day rollover" are similar in many ways, but if any "eligible rollover
distribution" made from certain types of Qualified Plan is not transferred
directly to another Plan fiduciary by a "direct rollover," then it is subject to
mandatory 20% withholding, even if it is later contributed to that same Plan in
a "60-day rollover" by the recipient.


Under Code Sections 402(f)(2)(A) and 3405(c)(3) an "eligible rollover
distribution" (which is both eligible for rollover treatment and subject to 20%
mandatory withholding absent a "direct rollover") is generally any distribution
to an employee of any portion (or all) of the balance to the employee's credit
in any of the following types of "Eligible Retirement Plan": (1) a Qualified
Plan under Code Section 401(a) ("Qualified 401(a) Plan"), (2) a qualified
annuity plan under Code Section 403(a) ("Qualified Annuity Plan"), (3) a TSA
under Code Section 403(b), or (4) a governmental Section 457(b) Plan. However,
an "eligible rollover distribution" does not include any distribution that is
either:


a.   an RMD amount;


b.  one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less
frequently than annually) made either (i) for the






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           53





life (or life expectancy) of the employee or the joint lives (or joint
life expectancies) of the employee and a designated beneficiary, or (ii)
for a specified period of 10 years or more; or


c.   any distribution made upon hardship of the employee.


Before making an "eligible rollover distribution," a Plan administrator
generally is required under Code Section 402(f) to provide the recipient with
advance written notice of the "direct rollover" and "60-day rollover" rules and
the distribution's exposure to the 20% mandatory withholding if it is not made
by "direct rollover." Generally, under Code Sections 402(c), 403(b)(8) and

457(e)(16), a "direct rollover" or a "60-day rollover" of an "eligible rollover
distribution" can be made to a Traditional IRA or to another Eligible Retirement
Plan that agrees to accept such a rollover. However, the maximum amount of an
"eligible rollover distribution" that can qualify for a tax-free "60-day
rollover" is limited to the amount that otherwise would be includable in gross
income. By contrast, a "direct rollover" of an "eligible rollover distribution"
can include after-tax contributions as well, if the direct rollover is made
either to a Traditional IRA or to another form of Eligible Retirement Plan that
agrees to account separately for such a rollover, including accounting for such
after-tax amounts separately from the otherwise taxable portion of this
rollover. Separate accounting also is required for all amounts (taxable or not)
that are rolled into a governmental Section 457(b) Plan from either a Qualified

Section 401(a) Plan, Qualified Annuity Plan, TSA or IRA. These amounts, when
later distributed from the governmental Section 457(b) Plan, are subject to any
premature distribution penalty tax applicable to distributions from such a
"predecessor" Qualified Plan.


Rollover rules for distributions from IRAs under Code Sections 408(d)(3) and
408A(d)(3) also vary according to the type of transferor IRA and type of
transferee IRA or other Plan. For instance, generally no tax-free "direct
rollover" or "60-day rollover" can be made between a "NonRoth IRA" (Traditional,
SEP or SIMPLE IRA) and a Roth IRA, and a transfer from NonRoth IRA to a Roth
IRA, or a "conversion" of a NonRoth IRA to a Roth IRA, is subject to special
rules. In addition, generally no tax-free "direct rollover" or "60-day rollover"
can be made between an "inherited IRA" (NonRoth or Roth) for a beneficiary and
an IRA set up by that same individual as the original owner. Generally, any
amount other than an RMD distributed from a Traditional or SEP IRA is eligible
for a "direct rollover" or a "60-day rollover" to another Traditional IRA for
the same individual. Similarly, any amount other than an RMD distributed from a
Roth IRA is generally eligible for a "direct rollover" or a "60-day rollover" to
another Roth IRA for the same individual. However, in either case such a
tax-free 60-day rollover is limited to 1 per year (365-day period); whereas no
1-year limit applies to any such "direct rollover." Similar rules apply to a
"direct rollover" or a "60-day rollover" of a distribution from a SIMPLE IRA to
another SIMPLE IRA or a Traditional IRA, except that any distribution of
employer contributions from a SIMPLE IRA during the initial 2-year period in
which the individual participates in the employer's SIMPLE Plan is generally
disqualified (and subject to the 25% penalty tax on premature distributions) if
it is not rolled into another SIMPLE IRA for that individual. Amounts other than
RMDs distributed from a Traditional or SEP IRA (or SIMPLE IRA after the initial
2-year period) also are eligible for a "direct rollover" or a "60-day rollover"
to an Eligible Retirement Plan (e.g., a TSA) that accepts such a rollover, but
any such rollover is limited to the amount of the distribution that otherwise
would be includable in gross income (i.e., after-tax contributions are not
eligible).


Special rules also apply to transfers or rollovers for the benefit of a spouse
(or ex-spouse), Plan distributions of property, and obtaining a waiver of the
60-day limit for a tax-free rollover from the IRS.


9. QUALIFIED HURRICANE RELIEF


The Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 2005 ("KETRA"), signed by the President
on September 23, 2005, contains several provisions regarding distributions from
qualified plans for participants who were affected by Hurricane Katrina.
Generally, KETRA allows eligible persons to take distributions from their
retirement plans without being subject to the 10% penalty on early distributions
and permits the income portion of such distribution to be included in taxable
income ratably over a three-year period. KETRA also allows such distributed
amounts to be recontributed to the retirement plan within three years and such
re-contribution will be treated as a rollover contribution, thus avoiding
taxation of the distributed amounts. The total amount of qualified KETRA
distributions that an eligible person may receive from all qualified plans is
limited to $100,000. KETRA also provides relief for certain qualified plan
withdrawals made in connection with home purchases which were cancelled because
of Hurricane Katrina and modifies the qualified plan loan rules for certain
loans taken by eligible persons. These qualified plan provisions of KETRA were
extended to certain victims of Hurricanes Rita and Wilma through the enactment
of the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act signed by the President on December 21, 2005.
The IRS is preparing further guidance regarding these relief provisions for the
victims of the Hurricanes and is drafting Form 8915 for use by eligible persons
for reporting qualified plan distributions and determining the amount to be
included in taxable income. You should check the IRS's web site to determine if
your residence was in an area of hurricane impact which entitles you to the
relief being sought. KETRA and the Gulf Opportunity Zone Act contain tax relief
provisions in addition to the qualified plan provisions described above and the
IRS has designated areas in the hurricane impacted states for different types of
tax relief.

APPENDIX II -- DEATH BENEFIT -- EXAMPLES

ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE 1








Assume that:


-   You purchased your Contract with the Asset Protection Death Benefit,


-   You made an initial Premium Payment of $100,000,


-   In your fourth Contract Year, you made a withdrawal of $8,000,


-   Your Contract Value in your fourth Contract Year immediately before your
withdrawal was $109,273,


-   On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $117,403,


-   Your Maximum Anniversary Value was $117,403.



CALCULATION OF ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT



To calculate the Asset Protection Death Benefit, we calculate the following
three values:


-   The Contract Value of your Contract on the day we calculate the Death
Benefit [$117,403],


-   The Contract Value of your Contract, plus 25% of the total Premium Payments
you have made to us minus any Premium Payments we receive within 12 months
of death and an adjustment for any partial Surrenders. [$117,403 + 25%
($100,000 - $8,000) = $140,403],


-   The Contract Value of your Contract, plus 25% of your Maximum Anniversary
Value minus an adjustment for any partial Surrenders. [$117,403 + 25%
($117,403 - $8,000) = $144,754].


The Asset Protection Death Benefit is the greatest of these three values but it
cannot exceed the greatest of:


-   The Contract Value of your Contract on the day we calculate the Death
Benefit [$117,403],


-   the total Premium Payments you have made to us minus any Premium Payments we
receive within 12 months of death and an adjustment for any partial
Surrenders [$100,000 - $8,000 = $92,000], or


-   your Maximum Anniversary Value adjusted for any partial Surrenders [$117,403

- $8,000 = $109,403].


Because the Contract Value of your Contract [$117,403] is greater than your
Maximum Anniversary Value adjusted for partial Surrenders [$109,403] and your
adjusted total Premium Payments [$92,000], the amount of the Death Benefit
cannot exceed $117,403.



AMOUNT OF ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT



Because the Asset Protection Death Benefit cannot exceed $117, 403, the amount
of the Death Benefit is equal to your Contract Value of $117,403.






HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                           55






EXAMPLE 2



Assume that:


-   You purchased your Contract with the Asset Protection Death Benefit,


-   You made an initial Premium Payment of $100,000,


-   In your fourth Contract Year, you made a partial Surrender of $60,000,


-   Your Contract Value in the fourth year immediately before your Surrender was
$150,000,


-   On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $120,000,


-   Your Maximum Anniversary Value is $140,000.



CALCULATION OF ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT



To calculate the Asset Protection Death Benefit, we calculate the following
three values:


-   The Contract Value of your Contract on the day we calculate the Death
Benefit [$120,000],


-   The Contract Value of your Contract, plus 25% of the total Premium Payments
you have made to us minus any Premium Payments we receive within 12 months
of death and an adjustment for any partial Surrenders. [$120,000 + 25% of
$57,857 = $134,464 (See below)],


-   The Contract Value of your Contract, plus 25% of your Maximum Anniversary
Value adjusted for any partial Surrenders. [$120,000 + 25% ($83,571) =
$140,893 (See below)].


The Asset Protection Death Benefit is the greatest of these three values but it
cannot exceed the greatest of:


-   The Contract Value of your Contract on the day we calculate the Death
Benefit [$120,000],


-   The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus any Premium Payments we
receive within 12 months of death and the adjustment for any partial
Surrenders [$57,857 (See below)], or


-   Your Maximum Anniversary Value minus an adjustment for any partial
surrenders [$83,571 (See below)].



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDER FOR TOTAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS



The adjustment to your total Premium Payments for partial Surrenders is on a
dollar for dollar basis up to 10% of total Premium Payments. 10% of total
Premium Payments is $10,000. Total Premium Payments adjusted for dollar for
dollar partial Surrenders is $90,000. The remaining partial Surrenders equal
$50,000. This amount will reduce your total Premium Payments by a factor. To
determine this factor, we take your Contract Value immediately before the
Surrender [$150,000] and subtract the $10,000 dollar for dollar adjustment to
get $140,000. The proportional factor is 1 - (50,000/140,000) = .64286. This
factor is multiplied by $90,000. The result is an adjusted total Premium Payment
of $57,857.



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDER FOR MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE



The adjustment to your Maximum Anniversary Value for partial Surrenders is on a
dollar for dollar basis up to 10% of total Premium Payments. 10% of Premium
Payments is $10,000. Your Maximum Anniversary Value adjusted for partial
Surrenders on a dollar for dollar basis up to 10% of Premium Payments is
$130,000. Remaining partial Surrenders are $50,000. We use this amount to reduce
your Maximum Anniversary Value by a factor. To determine this factor, we take
your Contract Value immediately before the Surrender [$150,000] and subtract the
$10,000 dollar for dollar adjustment to get $140,000. The proportional factor is

1 - (50,000/140,000) = .64286. This factor is multiplied by $130,000. The result
is an adjusted Maximum Anniversary Value of $83,571.



AMOUNT OF ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT



Your Asset Protection Death Benefit is $120,000. This is because your Contract
Value at death [$120,000] was the greatest of:


-   The Contract Value of your Contract on the day we calculate the Death
Benefit [$120,000],


-   The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus any Premium Payments we
receive within 12 months of death and the adjustment for any partial
Surrenders [$57,857], or


-   Your Maximum Anniversary Value minus an adjustment for any partial
surrenders [$83,571].


So, your Asset Protection Death Benefit cannot exceed $120,000.

PREMIUM PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE 1








Assume that:


-   You purchased your Contract with the Premium Protection Death Benefit
instead of the Asset Protection Death Benefit,


-   You made an initial Premium Payment of $100,000,


-   In your fourth Contract Year, you made a withdrawal of $8,000,


-   Your Contract Value in your fourth Contract Year immediately before your
withdrawal was $109,273,


-   On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $117,403.



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDER FOR TOTAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS



The adjustment to your total Premium Payments for partial Surrenders is on a
dollar for dollar basis up to 10% of total Premium Payments. The withdrawal of
$8,000 is less than 10% of premiums. Your adjusted total Premium Payments is
$92,000.



DEATH BENEFIT AMOUNT



Because your Contract Value at death was greater than the adjusted total Premium
Payments, your Death Benefit is $117,403.



EXAMPLE 2



Assume that:


-   You purchased your Contract with the Premium Protection Death Benefit
instead of the Asset Protection Death Benefit,


-   You made an initial Premium Payment of $100,000,


-   In your fourth contract year, you made a partial Surrender of $60,000,


-   Your Contract Value in the fourth year immediately before your surrender was
$150,000,


-   On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $120,000.



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDER FOR TOTAL PREMIUM PAYMENTS



The adjustment to your total Premium Payments for partial Surrenders is on a
dollar for dollar basis up to 10% of total Premium Payments. 10% of total
Premium Payments is $10,000. Total Premium Payments adjusted for dollar for
dollar partial Surrenders is $90,000. The remaining partial Surrenders equal
$50,000. This amount will reduce your total Premium Payments by a factor. To
determine this factor, we take your Contract Value immediately before the
Surrender [$150,000] and subtract the $10,000 dollar for dollar adjustment to
get $140,000. The proportional factor is 1 - (50,000/140,000) = .64286. This
factor is multiplied by $90,000. The result is an adjusted total Premium
Payments of $57,857.





DEATH BENEFIT AMOUNT



Because your Contract Value at death was greater than the adjusted total Premium
Payments, your Death Benefit is $120,000.

MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT WITH ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT EXAMPLES

EXAMPLE 1

Assume that:

-   You elected the MAV/EPB Death Benefit when you purchased your Contract with
    the Asset Protection Death Benefit,








-   You made a single Premium Payment of $100,000,


-   In your fourth Contract Year, you made a withdrawal of $8,000,


-   Your Contract Value in your fourth Contract Year immediately before your
withdrawal was $109,273,


-   On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $117,403,


-   Your Maximum Anniversary Value was $117,403,


-   The Contract Value on the date we calculate the Death Benefit plus 40% of
the Contract gain was greater than the Asset Protection Death Benefit, your
adjusted total Premium Payments, and your Maximum Anniversary Value.



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS FOR EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT



To calculate the Earnings Protection Benefit, we make an adjustment for partial
Surrenders if the amount of a Surrender is greater than the Contract gain in the
Contract immediately prior to the Surrender. To determine if the partial
Surrender is greater than the Contract gain:


-   Add the amount of the partial Surrender ($8,000) to


-   The Contract Value on the date the MAV/EPB Death Benefit is added to your
Contract ($100,000),


-   Add Premium Payments made after the MAV/EPB Death Benefit is added to your
Contract before you make the partial Surrender ($0),


-   Subtract the Contract Value on the Valuation Day immediately before you make
the partial Surrender ($109,273),


-   Subtract the sum of any prior adjustments for all prior partial Surrenders
made after the MAV/EPB Death Benefit is added to your Contract ($0),


Which equals -$1,273, which is less than zero, so there is no adjustment for the
partial Surrender in this case.



CALCULATION OF CONTRACT GAIN



Hartford would calculate the Contract gain as follows:


-   Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death ($117,403),


-   Subtract the Contract Value on the date the MAV/EPB Death Benefit was added
to your Contract ($100,000),


-   Add any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($0),


So the Contract gain equals $17,403.



CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT CAP



To determine if the cap applies:


-   Hartford calculates the Contract Value on the date the MAV/EPB Death Benefit
was added to your Contract ($100,000),


-   plus Premium Payments made since that date ($0),


-   minus Premium Payments made in the 12 months prior to death ($0),


-   minus any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($0),


Which equals $100,000. The cap is 200% of $100,000, which is $200,000.



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS FOR MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE



The adjustment to your Maximum Anniversary Value for partial Surrenders is on a
dollar for dollar basis up to 10% of total Premium Payments. The withdrawal of
$8,000 is less than 10% of premiums. YOUR ADJUSTED MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE IS
$109,403.




ASSET PROTECTION DEATH BENEFIT AMOUNT IS $117,403. (See Example 1 under Asset
Protection Death Benefit for details of calculation.)


ADJUSTED TOTAL PREMIUM PAYMENT AMOUNT IS $92,000. (See Example 1 under Asset
Protection Death Benefit for details of calculation.)



MAV/EPB DEATH BENEFIT



In this situation the cap does not apply, so Hartford takes 40% of $17,403 or
$6,961 and adds that to the Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death
and the total Death Benefit with the Earnings Protection Benefit is $124,364.
This is the greatest of the four values compared.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE 2

Assume that:

-   You elected the MAV/EPB Death Benefit when you purchased your Contract with
    the Asset Protection Death Benefit,








-   You made a single Premium Payment of $100,000,


-   In your fourth Contract Year, you made a partial Surrender of $60,000,


-   Your Contract Value in the fourth year immediately before your Surrender was
$150,000,


-   Your Maximum Anniversary Value is $140,000,


-   On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $120,000,


-   The Contract Value on the date we calculate the Death Benefit plus 40% of
the Contract gain was the greatest of the Death Benefit calculations.



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS



To calculate the MAV/EPB Death Benefit, we make an adjustment for partial
Surrenders if the amount of a Surrender is greater than the Contract gain in the
Contract immediately prior to the Surrender. To determine if the partial
Surrender is greater than the Contract gain:


-   Add the amount of the partial Surrender ($60,000) to


-   The Contract Value on the date the MAV/EPB Death Benefit is added to your
Contract ($100,000),


-   Add Premium Payments made after the MAV/EPB Death Benefit is added to your
Contract before you make the partial Surrender ($0),


-   Subtract the Contract Value on the Valuation Day immediately before you make
the partial Surrender ($150,000),


-   Subtract the sum of any prior adjustments for all prior partial Surrenders
made after the MAV/EPB Death Benefit is added to your Contract ($0),


Which equals +$10,000, which is greater than zero, so there is a $10,000
adjustment for the partial Surrender in this case.



CALCULATION OF CONTRACT GAIN



Hartford would calculate the Contract gain as follows:


-   Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death ($120,000),


-   Subtract the Contract Value on the date the MAV/EPB Death Benefit was added
to your Contract ($100,000),


-   Add any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($10,000),


So the Contract gain equals $30,000.



CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT CAP



To determine if the cap applies:


-   Hartford calculates the Contract Value on the date the MAV/EPB Death Benefit
was added to your Contract ($100,000),


-   plus Premium Payments made since that date ($0),


-   minus Premium Payments made in the 12 months prior to death ($0),


-   minus any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($10,000),


Which equals $90,000. The cap is 200% of $90,000, which is $180,000.



ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS FOR MAXIMUM ANNIVERSARY VALUE



The adjustment to your Maximum Anniversary Value for partial Surrenders is on a
dollar for dollar basis up to 10% of total Premium Payments. 10% of Premium
Payments is $10,000. Maximum Anniversary Value adjusted for dollar for dollar
Surrenders is $130,000. Remaining Surrenders equal $50,000. This amount will
reduce the Maximum Anniversary Value proportionally. Contract Value immediately
before Surrender is $150,000 minus $10,000 = $140,000. The proportional factor
is 1 - (50,000/140,000) = .64286. This factor is multiplied by $130,000. The
result is an adjusted Maximum Anniversary Value of $83,571.





DEATH BENEFIT WITH EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT



In this situation the cap does not apply, so Hartford takes 40% of $30,000 or
$12,000 and adds that to the Contract Value on the date we receive proof of
death and the total Death Benefit with the Earnings Protection Benefit is
$132,000.

APPENDIX III -- THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST -- EXAMPLES




EXAMPLE 1: ASSUME YOU SELECT THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST WHEN YOU PURCHASE
YOUR CONTRACT AND YOUR INITIAL PREMIUM PAYMENT IS $100,000.



-   Your Benefit Amount is $100,000, which is your initial Premium Payment.


-   Your Benefit Payment is $7,000, which is 7% of your Benefit Amount.



EXAMPLE 2: IF YOU MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PREMIUM PAYMENT OF $50,000, THEN



-   Your Benefit Amount is $150,000, which is your prior Benefit Amount
($100,000) plus your additional Premium Payment ($50,000).


-   Your Benefit Payment is $10,500, which is your prior Benefit Payment
($7,000) plus 7% of your additional Premium Payment ($3,500).



EXAMPLE 3: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU TAKE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT
PAYMENT BEFORE THE END OF THE FIRST CONTRACT YEAR, THEN



-   Your Benefit Amount becomes $93,000, which is your prior Benefit Amount
($100,000) minus the Benefit Payment ($7,000).


-   Your Benefit Payment for the next year remains $7,000, because you did not
take more than your maximum Benefit Payment ($7,000).



EXAMPLE 4: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU SURRENDER $50,000, AND
YOUR CONTRACT VALUE IS $150,000 AT THE TIME OF THE SURRENDER, THEN



We recalculate your Benefit Amount by comparing the results of two calculations:


-   First we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Contract
Value ($150,000). This equals $100,000 and is your "New Contract Value."


-   Second, we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Benefit
Amount ($100,000). This is $50,000 and is your "New Benefit Amount."


Since the New Contract Value ($100,000) is more than or equal to the New Benefit
Amount ($50,000), and it is more than or equal to your Premium Payments invested
in the Contract before the Surrender ($100,000), the Benefit Payment is
unchanged and remains $7,000.



EXAMPLE 5: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU SURRENDER $60,000, AND
YOUR CONTRACT VALUE IS $150,000 AT THE TIME OF THE SURRENDER, THEN



We recalculate your Benefit Amount by comparing the results of two calculations:


-   First we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($60,000) from your Contract
Value ($150,000). This equals $90,000 and is your "New Contract Value."


-   Second, we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($60,000) from your Benefit
Amount ($100,000). This is $40,000 and is your "New Benefit Amount."


Since the New Contract Value ($90,000) is more than or equal to the New Benefit
Amount ($40,000), but less than the Premium Payments invested in the Contract
before the Surrender ($100,000), the Benefit Payment is reduced. The new Benefit
Payment is 7% of the greater of your New Contract Value and New Benefit Amount,
which is $6,300.



EXAMPLE 6: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU SURRENDER $50,000, AND
YOUR CONTRACT VALUE IS $80,000 AT THE TIME OF THE SURRENDER, THEN



We recalculate your Benefit Amount by comparing the results of two calculations:


-   First we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Contract
Value ($80,000). This equals $30,000 and is your "New Contract Value."


-   Second, we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Benefit
Amount ($100,000). This is $50,000 and is your "New Benefit Amount."


Since the New Contract Value ($30,000) is less than the New Benefit Amount
($50,000), your "New Benefit Amount" becomes the New Contract Value ($30,000),
as we have to recalculate your Benefit Payment.


We recalculate the Benefit Payment by comparing the "old" Benefit Payment
($7,000) to 7% of the New Benefit Amount ($2,100). Your Benefit Payment becomes
the lower of those two values, or $2,100.


EXAMPLE 7: IF YOU ELECT TO "STEP UP" THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST AFTER THE
5TH YEAR, ASSUMING YOU HAVE MADE NO WITHDRAWALS, AND YOUR CONTRACT VALUE AT THE
TIME OF STEP UP IS $200,000, THEN


-   We recalculate your Benefit Amount to equal your Contract Value, which is
$200,000.


-   Your new Benefit Payment is equal to 7% of your new Benefit Amount, or
$14,000.

APPENDIX IV -- THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED -- EXAMPLES




EXAMPLE 1: ASSUME YOU SELECT THE HARTFORD'S PRINCIPAL FIRST PREFERRED WHEN YOU
PURCHASE YOUR CONTRACT AND YOUR INITIAL PREMIUM PAYMENT IS $100,000.



-   Your Benefit Amount is $100,000, which is your initial Premium Payment.


-   Your Benefit Payment is $5,000, which is 5% of your Benefit Amount.



EXAMPLE 2: IF YOU MAKE AN ADDITIONAL PREMIUM PAYMENT OF $50,000, THEN



-   Your Benefit Amount is $150,000, which is your prior Benefit Amount
($100,000) plus your additional Premium Payment ($50,000).


-   Your Benefit Payment is $7,500, which is your prior Benefit Payment ($5,000)
plus 5% of your additional Premium Payment ($2,500).



EXAMPLE 3: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU TAKE THE MAXIMUM BENEFIT
PAYMENT BEFORE THE END OF THE FIRST CONTRACT YEAR, THEN



-   Your Benefit Amount becomes $95,000, which is your prior Benefit Amount
($100,000) minus the Benefit Payment ($5,000).


-   Your Benefit Payment for the next year remains $5,000, because you did not
take more than your maximum Benefit Payment ($5,000).



EXAMPLE 4: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU SURRENDER $50,000, AND
YOUR CONTRACT VALUE IS $150,000 AT THE TIME OF THE SURRENDER, THEN



We recalculate your Benefit Amount by comparing the results of two calculations:


-   First we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Contract
Value ($150,000). This equals $100,000 and is your "New Contract Value."


-   Second, we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Benefit
Amount ($100,000). This is $50,000 and is your "New Benefit Amount."


Since the New Contract Value ($100,000) is more than or equal to the New Benefit
Amount ($50,000), and it is more than or equal to your Premium Payments invested
in the Contract before the Surrender ($100,000), the Benefit Payment is
unchanged and remains $5,000.



EXAMPLE 5: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU SURRENDER $60,000, AND
YOUR CONTRACT VALUE IS $150,000 AT THE TIME OF THE SURRENDER, THEN



We recalculate your Benefit Amount by comparing the results of two calculations:


-   First we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($60,000) from your Contract
Value ($150,000). This equals $90,000 and is your "New Contract Value."


-   Second, we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($60,000) from your Benefit
Amount ($100,000). This is $40,000 and is your "New Benefit Amount."


Since the New Contract Value ($90,000) is more than or equal to the New Benefit
Amount ($40,000), but less than the Premium Payments invested in the Contract
before the Surrender ($100,000), the Benefit Payment is reduced. The new Benefit
Payment is 5% of the greater of your New Contract Value and New Benefit Amount,
which is $4,500.



EXAMPLE 6: ASSUME THE SAME FACTS AS EXAMPLE 1. IF YOU SURRENDER $50,000, AND
YOUR CONTRACT VALUE IS $80,000 AT THE TIME OF THE SURRENDER, THEN



We recalculate your Benefit Amount by comparing the results of two calculations:


-   First we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Contract
Value ($80,000). This equals $30,000 and is your "New Contract Value."


-   Second, we deduct the amount of the Surrender ($50,000) from your Benefit
Amount ($100,000). This is $50,000 and is your "New Benefit Amount."


Since the New Contract Value ($30,000) is less than the New Benefit Amount
($50,000), your "New Benefit Amount" becomes the New Contract Value ($30,000),
as we have to recalculate your Benefit Payment.


We recalculate the Benefit Payment by comparing the "old" Benefit Payment
($5,000) to 5% of the New Benefit Amount ($1,500). Your Benefit Payment becomes
the lower of those two values, or $1,500.

GENERAL INFORMATION




SAFEKEEPING OF ASSETS



Hartford holds title to the assets of the Separate Account. The assets are kept
physically segregated and are held separate and apart from Hartford's general
corporate assets. Records are maintained of all purchases and redemptions of the
underlying fund shares held in each of the Sub-Accounts.



EXPERTS



[to be filed by Amendment]



NON-PARTICIPATING



The Contract is non-participating and we pay no dividends.



MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX



If an Annuitant's age or sex was misstated on the Contract, any Contract
payments or benefits will be determined using the correct age and sex. If we
have overpaid Annuity Payouts, an adjustment, including interest on the amount
of the overpayment, will be made to the next Annuity Payout or Payouts. If we
have underpaid due to a misstatement of age or sex, we will credit the next
Annuity Payout with the amount we underpaid and credit interest.



PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER



The Contracts, which are offered continuously, are distributed by Hartford
Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD"). HSD serves as Principal
Underwriter for the securities issued with respect to the Separate Account. HSD
is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. HSD is an affiliate of ours. Both HSD
and Hartford are ultimately controlled by The Hartford Financial Services Group,
Inc. The principal business address of HSD is the same as ours.


Hartford currently pays HSD underwriting commissions for its role as Principal
Underwriter of all variable annuities associated with this Separate Account. For
the past three years, the aggregate dollar amount of underwriting commissions
paid to HSD in its role as Principal Underwriter has been: 2005: $39,158,097;
2004: $128,334,046; and 2003: $122,827,182.





PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION



The Separate Account may advertise certain performance-related information
concerning the Sub-Accounts. Performance information about a Sub-Account is
based on the Sub-Account's past performance only and is no indication of future
performance.



TOTAL RETURN FOR ALL SUB-ACCOUNTS



When a Sub-Account advertises its standardized total return, it will usually be
calculated from the date of the inception of the Sub-Account for one, five and
ten year periods or some other relevant periods if the Sub-Account has not been
in existence for at least ten years. Total return is measured by comparing the
value of an investment in the Sub-Account at the beginning of the relevant
period to the value of the investment at the end of the period. To calculate
standardized total return, Hartford uses a hypothetical initial premium payment
of $1,000.00 and deducts for the mortality and risk expense charge, the highest
possible contingent deferred charge, any applicable administrative charge and
the Annual Maintenance Fee.


The formula Hartford uses to calculate standardized total return is P(1+T) TO
THE POWER OF n = ERV. In this calculation, "P" represents a hypothetical initial
premium payment of $1,000.00, "T" represents the average annual total return,
"n" represents the number of years and "ERV" represents the redeemable value at
the end of the period.


In addition to the standardized total return, the Sub-Account may advertise a
non-standardized total return. These figures will usually be calculated from the
date of inception of the underlying fund for one, five and ten year periods or
other relevant periods. Non-standardized total return is measured in the same
manner as the standardized total return described above, except that the
contingent deferred sales charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee are not
deducted. Therefore, non-standardized total return for a Sub-Account is higher
than standardized total return for a Sub-Account.

YIELD FOR SUB-ACCOUNTS



If applicable, the Sub-Accounts may advertise yield in addition to total return.
At any time in the future, yields may be higher or lower than past yields and
past performance is no indication of future performance.


The standardized yield will be computed for periods beginning with the inception
of the Sub-Account in the following manner. The net investment income per
Accumulation Unit earned during a one-month period is divided by the
Accumulation Unit Value on the last day of the period.


The formula Hartford uses to calculate yield is: YIELD = 2[(a - b/cd +1) TO THE
POWER OF 6 - 1]. In this calculation, "a" represents the net investment income
earned during the period by the underlying fund, "b" represents the expenses
accrued for the period, "c" represents the average daily number of Accumulation
Units outstanding during the period and "d" represents the maximum offering
price per Accumulation Unit on the last day of the period.



MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNTS



At any time in the future, current and effective yields may be higher or lower
than past yields and past performance is no indication of future performance.


Current yield of a money market fund Sub-Account is calculated for a seven-day
period or the "base period" without taking into consideration any realized or
unrealized gains or losses on shares of the underlying fund. The first step in
determining yield is to compute the base period return. Hartford takes a
hypothetical account with a balance of one Accumulation Unit of the Sub-Account
and calculates the net change in its value from the beginning of the base period
to the end of the base period. Hartford then subtracts an amount equal to the
total deductions for the Contract and then divides that number by the value of
the account at the beginning of the base period. The result is the base period
return or "BPR." Once the base period return is calculated, Hartford then
multiplies it by 365/7 to compute the current yield. Current yield is calculated
to the nearest hundredth of one percent.


The formula for this calculation is YIELD = BPR x (365/7), where BPR = (A -

B)/C. "A" is equal to the net change in value of a hypothetical account with a
balance of one Accumulation Unit of the Sub-Account from the beginning of the
base period to the end of the base period. "B" is equal to the amount that
Hartford deducts for mortality and expense risk charge, any applicable
administrative charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee. "C" represents the value
of the Sub-Account at the beginning of the base period.


Effective yield is also calculated using the base period return. The effective
yield is calculated by adding 1 to the base period return and raising that
result to a power equal to 365 divided by 7 and subtracting 1 from the result.
The calculation Hartford uses is:



EFFECTIVE YIELD = [(BASE PERIOD RETURN + 1) TO THE POWER OF 365/7] - 1.

financial management and tax and retirement planning, and other investment
alternatives, including comparisons between the Contracts and the
characteristics of and market for any alternatives.



PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS



Each Sub-Account may from time to time include in advertisements the ranking of
its performance figures compared with performance figures of other annuity
contract's sub-accounts with the same investment objectives which are created by
Lipper Analytical Services, Morningstar, Inc. or other recognized ranking
services.

ITEM 26.  PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL WITH THE DEPOSITOR OR
REGISTRANT.



Incorporated by reference to Post-Effective Amendment No. 4 to the
Registration Statement File No. 333-119414, filed on April 7, 2006.



ITEM 27.  NUMBER OF CONTRACT OWNERS




As of December 31, 2006, there were 273,963 Contract Owners.




ITEM 28.  INDEMNIFICATION



Sections 33-770 to 33-779, inclusive, of the Connecticut General Statutes
provide the standards under which a corporation may indemnify an individual
for liability, including legal expenses, incurred because such individual
is a party to a proceeding because the individual was a director, officer,
employee, or agent of the corporation. Specifically, Section 33-771(a)(2)
permits a corporation to indemnify a director if the corporation, pursuant
to Section 33-636(b)(5), obligated itself under its certificate of
incorporation to indemnify a director for liability except for certain
liability involving conduct described in Section 33-636(b)(5). Section
33-776 permits a corporation to indemnify an officer, employee, or agent of
the corporation to the same extent as a director as may be provided by the
corporation's bylaws, certificate of incorporation, or resolution of the
board of directors.


Section 33-771(e) provides that a corporation incorporated prior to January
1, 1995, must, except to the extent that the certificate of incorporation
provides otherwise, indemnify a director to the extent that indemnification
is permissible under Sections 33-770 to 33-779, inclusive. Section
33-776(d) sets forth a similar provision with respect to officers,
employees and agents of a corporation.


1.   Based on the statutes referenced above, the Depositor must indemnify
a director if the director:


A.  conducted himself in good faith;


B.  reasonably believed (a) in the case of conduct in his official
capacity, that his conduct was in the best interests of the
corporation or (b) in all other cases, that his conduct was at
least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; and


C.  in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause
to believe his conduct was unlawful; or


2.   engaged in conduct for which broader indemnification had been made
permissible or obligatory under a provision of the Depositor's
certificate of incorporation.


In addition, the Depositor must indemnify officers, employees and agents
for liability if the individual:


A.  conducted himself in good faith;


B.  reasonably believed (a) in the case of conduct in his official
capacity, that his conduct was in the best interests of the
corporation or (b) in all other cases, that his conduct was at
least not opposed to the best interests of the corporation; and


C.  in the case of any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause
to believe his conduct was unlawful.


Section 33-777 permits a corporation to procure insurance on behalf of an
individual who was a director or officer of the corporation.





Consistent with the statute, the directors and officers of the Depositor
and Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") are covered
under a directors and officers liability insurance policy.


Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act
of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of
the Depositor pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the
Depositor has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment
by the Depositor of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the Depositor in the successful defense of any
action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the
Depositor will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against
public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final
adjudication of such issue.

RE: SEPARATE ACCOUNT TWO

HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY

FILE NO. 333-101923



Dear Sir/Madam:


I have acted as Counsel to Hartford Life Insurance Company (the "Company"), a
Connecticut insurance company, and Separate Account Two (the "Account") in
connection with the registration of an indefinite amount of securities in the
form of variable annuity contracts (the "Contracts") with the Securities and
Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. I have
examined such documents (including the Form N-4 registration statement) and
reviewed such questions of law as I considered necessary and appropriate, and on
the basis of such examination and review, it is my opinion that:


1.   The Company is a corporation duly organized and validly existing as a stock
life insurance company under the laws of the State of Connecticut and is
duly authorized by the Insurance Department of the State of Connecticut to
issue the Contracts.


2.   The Account is a duly authorized and existing separate account established
pursuant to the provisions of Section 38a-433 of the Connecticut Statutes.


3.   To the extent so provided under the Contracts, that portion of the assets
of the Account equal to the reserves and other contract liabilities with
respect to the Account will not be chargeable with liabilities arising out
of any other business that the Company may conduct.


4.   The Contracts, when issued as contemplated by the Form N-4 Registration
Statement, will constitute legal, validly issued and binding obligations of
the Company.


I hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form N-4
registration statement for the Contracts and the Account.


Sincerely yours,






/s/ Richard J. Wirth

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
