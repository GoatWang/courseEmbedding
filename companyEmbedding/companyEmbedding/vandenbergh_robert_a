Agnes M. VanDenBergh


Obituary
Condolences




























NEWTON - Agnes M. VanDenBergh transitioned peacefully on March 4, 2014, surrounded by family members to join her husband, Arthur, in Heaven.  Agnes was born in Mogglingen, Germany, on March 31, 1922, the child of Theodore and Frances Mayer. The family returned to the United States to live in New York with a brother, Theodore, where her sister, Dorothy, was born.  She grew up with various interests including speed skating and art and ultimately attended Cooper Union Art Institute. Always resourceful, she carefully managed financially during her educational years and ultimately achieved her goal of graduating from this prestigious art school.  During her career, Agnes completed a number of assignments that included military applications as a draftsperson, as well as other commercial jobs including textile design, product packaging design and other detailed design work.  She and her husband, Arthur, met through a mutual acquaintance while she worked for a greeting card company in New York. The first date at the skating rink blossomed into a romance that was celebrated by their marriage on July 5, 1947. Agnes and Arthur had two children, Margaret (Marge) and Robert (Bob).  The family moved to New Milford in 1955, which was their long-term home.  Agnes was predeceased by her husband, Arthur (1986), and is survived by her daughter, Margaret Carpenter of Gilbert, Ariz.; son, Robert Vandenbergh, of Byram; son-in-law, Frank Carpenter; daughter-in-law, Barbara Vandenbergh; three grandchildren, Kathy Wagoner, James Carpenter and Eric Vandenbergh; and seven great-grandchildren. Agnes took great pride and pleasure in her family.  Marge and Bob wish to acknowledge all the prayers and thoughts of other family members and friends who have been comforting during this time of transition. We also want to thank the caring staff at Bristol Glen, which Agnes called home since February 2008, for their efforts to make our Mother's senior years as pleasant as possible. Lastly, we thank the kind nurses and staff at Newton Medical Center.  A private celebration of Agnes' life for her extended family will take place in the next few days. Acknowledging the comfort and support provided by Karen Ann Quinlan Hospice, we ask that you consider a contribution for the Hospice Residence as we have seen the value firsthand in our loved one transitioning in a place that is home.  Donations may be made to: Karen Ann Quinlan Memorial Foundation, 99 Sparta Ave., Newton, NJ 07860.  Arrangements are under the direction of Smith-McCracken Funeral Home, 63 High St., Newton. Online condolences may be offered at www.smithmccrackenfuneralhome.com.
