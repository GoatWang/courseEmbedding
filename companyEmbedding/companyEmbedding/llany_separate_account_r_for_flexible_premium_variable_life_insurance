This Supplement outlines changes to the investment options under your policy. All other provisions outlined in your prospectus, as supplemented, remain unchanged. This Supplement is for informational purposes and requires no action on your part.


The Lincoln Variable Insurance Products Trust (“LVIP”) has notified us that the LVIP Board of Trustees has approved the reorganization of two LVIP funds, effective as of the close of business December 9, 2016. The reorganizations were approved at a shareholder’s meeting on September 7, 2016.


The LVIP BlackRock Emerging Markets Managed Volatility Fund (an “Acquired Fund”) will be reorganized into the LVIP SSGA International Managed Volatility Fund (an “Acquiring Fund”). These two funds have similar investment objectives and similar investment strategies.


As a result of this reorganization, the LVIP SSGA International Managed Volatility Fund will be added as an investment option effective November 7, 2016 to Policies issued on or before May 2, 2016. The investment objective of the fund is to seek capital appreciation, and the fund operates as a Fund of Funds.  For complete details related to the LVIP SSGA International Managed Volatility Fund, including risks, investment policies and strategies, please refer to the LVIP SSGA International Managed Volatility Fund’s prospectus.


The LVIP BlackRock U.S. Opportunities Managed Volatility Fund (an “Acquired Fund”) will be reorganized into the LVIP Blended Mid Cap Managed Volatility Fund (an “Acquiring Fund”).  These two funds have similar investment objectives and investment strategies.


At the time of these reorganizations, Owners of units of each Acquired Fund Sub-Account will automatically receive a proportionate number of units of its corresponding Acquiring Fund Sub-Account, based on the unit value of each fund at the time of the reorganization. Following the reorganizations, each Acquired Fund will no longer be available as an investment option under your Policy. Beginning December 12, 2016, any future allocations of Premium Payments and/or Policy value that you previously designated to an Acquired Fund Sub-Account will be allocated to the corresponding Acquiring Fund Sub-Account. This investment will become your allocation instruction until you tell us otherwise. All other transactions requested for an Acquired Fund will be rejected and treated as not in good order.


Additionally, LVIP has notified us that the LVIP AQR Enhanced Global Strategies Fund will be liquated on or about December 9, 2016 (subject to shareholder approval), and as a result, will no longer be available as an investment option under your Policy. If the liquidation is approved, we recommend you transfer all money out of the LVIP AQR Enhanced Global Strategies Fund Sub-Account and into another Sub-Account within your Policy prior to the close of business on December 8, 2016.


If you do not make this transfer prior to the liquidation, your money will be automatically transferred to the LVIP Government Money Market Fund Sub-Account. Once this transfer occurs, any future allocations of Premium Payments and/or policy value that you previously designated to the LVIP AQR Enhanced Global Strategies Fund Sub-Account will be allocated to the LVIP Government Money Market Portfolio Sub-Account. This investment will become your allocation instruction until you tell us otherwise. All other transactions requested for an Acquired Fund will be rejected and treated as not in good order.


Please retain this Supplement for future reference.

Item 29. Indemnification






(a)


Brief description of indemnification provisions:


  

In general, Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York provides that Lincoln New York will indemnify certain persons against expenses, judgments and certain other specified costs incurred by any such person if






  


  





  








  

he/she is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to a suit or proceeding because he/she was a director, officer, or employee of Lincoln New York, as long as he/she acted in good faith and in a manner he/she reasonably believed to be in the best interests of, or act opposed to the best interests of, Lincoln New York. Certain additional conditions apply to indemnification in criminal proceedings.


  

In particular, separate conditions govern indemnification of directors, officers, and employees of Lincoln Life in connection with suits by, or in the right of, Lincoln New York.


  

Please refer to Article VII of the By-Laws of Lincoln New York (Exhibit No. 6(b) hereto) for the full text of the indemnification provisions. Indemnification is permitted by, and is subject to the requirements of, New York law.



(b)


Undertaking pursuant to Rule 484 of Regulation C under the Securities Act of 1933:


  

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the provisions described in Item 28(a) above or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer, or controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

Re:           LLANY Separate Account S for Flexible Premium Variable Life Insurance (the “Account”)
Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”)
File No. 333-141769; 811-09257; CIK: 0001081039
Post-Effective Amendment No. 18 Form N-6, Rule 485(b)


Dear Sir or Madam:


As Assistant Vice President and Associate General Counsel of Lincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York (“LLANY”), I am familiar with the actions of the Board of Directors of LLANY, establishing the Account and its method of operation and authorizing the filing of a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, (and amendments thereto) for the securities to be issued by the Account and the Investment Company Act of 1940 for the Account itself.


In the course of preparing this opinion, I have reviewed the Charter and the By-Laws of the Company, the Board actions with respect to the Account, and such other matters as I deemed necessary or appropriate.  Based on such review, I am of the opinion that the variable life insurance policies (and interests therein) which are the subject of the Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the Account will, when issued, be legally issued and will represent binding obligations of the Company, the depositor for the Account.


I further consent to the use of this opinion as an Exhibit to said Post-Effective Amendment No. 18 to the Registration Statement and to the reference to me under the heading “Experts” in said Registration Statement, as amended.


Sincerely,


/s/ John L. Reizian


John L. Reizian

HIGHLIGHTS

                    This section is an overview of key Policy features. Your
                    Policy is a flexible premium variable universal life
                    insurance policy. Your Policy insures two Insureds. If one
                    of the Insureds dies, the Policy pays no death benefit. Your
                    Policy will pay the death benefit only when the second
                    Insured dies. A "second-to-die" policy might be suitable
                    when both of the Insureds have income of their own and only
                    want to provide financial support for their dependents if
                    both of them should die, or to provide liquidity to heirs
                    when the Second Insured dies. If replacement income or
                    immediate cash liquidity is needed upon the death of one
                    Insured, this type of policy may not be suitable.

                    The Policy's value may change on a:

                    1) fixed basis;
                    2) variable basis; or a
                    3) combination of both fixed and variable bases.

                    Review your personal financial objectives and discuss them
                    with a qualified financial counselor before you buy a
                    "second-to-die" variable life insurance policy. As a death
                    benefit is only paid upon the second Insured's death, this
                    Policy may, or may not, be appropriate for your individual
                    financial goals. If you are already entitled to favorable
                    financial tax treatment, you should satisfy yourself that
                    this Policy meets your other financial goals before you buy
                    it. The value of the Policy and, under one option, the death
                    benefit amount, depends on the investment results of the
                    funding options you select. Review this Prospectus and the
                    Funds Prospectus to achieve a clear understanding of any
                    Fund you are considering.

                    At all times, your Policy must qualify as life insurance
                    under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") to
                    receive favorable tax treatment under Federal law. If these
                    requirements are met, you may benefit from such tax
                    treatment. LLANY reserves the right to return your premium
                    payments if they result in your Policy failing to meet Code
                    requirements.

                    We offer other variable life insurance policies and variable
                    annuity contracts with different features, benefits and
                    charges. These policies also provide values that vary in
                    accordance with the investment experience of a separate
                    account of LLANY.

                    INITIAL CHOICES TO BE MADE

                    The Policy Owner (the "Owner" or "you") is the person named
                    in the "Policy Specifications" who has all of the Policy
                    ownership rights. You, as the Owner, have four important
                    choices to make when the Policy is first purchased. You need
                    to choose:

                    1) one of the three Death Benefit Options;
                    2) the amount of premium you want to pay; and
                    3) the amount of your Net Premium Payment to be placed in
                       each of the funding options you select. The Net Premium
                       Payment is the balance of your Premium Payment that
                       remains after certain charges are deducted from it; and
                    4) whether to elect the Age 100 No Lapse Provision.

                    You may also choose from Riders offered for this Policy.
                    These may alter the benefits or charges in the Policy and
