overview/highlights.xsloverview/strategy.xsl      Fund Strategy              The fund seeks long term capital growth. Normally, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of borrowings, if any, for investment purposes) in equity securities of issuers located throughout the world. The fund's principal focus is on companies that exhibit solid fundamental characteristics and are underappreciated by the market. The fund may invest in both developed and emerging markets without limit. Normally, the fund invests at least 40% of its net assets in issuers located outside of the United States.         overview/mngmt.xsl      Portfolio Management     Marco Pirondini, Portfolio Manager         Mr. Pirondini, an executive vice president and Head of Equities U.S., joined Amundi Pioneer in 1991 and has been an investment professional since that time.       David Glazer, Portfolio Manager         Mr. Glazer, a senior vice president, joined Amundi Pioneer in 2012 and has been an investment professional since 1996.            Portfolio Management Perspective              "We examine mid- and large-capitalization stocks in more than 30 countries, including those in emerging markets. From that universe, we aim to build a portfolio combining a value and growth at a reasonable price (GARP) approach."        overview/footnotes.xsl      A WORD ABOUT RISK              Investing in foreign and/or emerging market securities involves risks relating to interest rates, currency exchange rates, economic, and political conditions. The fund is subject to currency risk, meaning that the fund could experience losses based on changes in the exchange rate between non-U.S. currencies and the U.S. dollar. Investing in small and mid-sized companies may offer the potential for higher returns, but are also subject to greater short-term price fluctuations than larger, more established companies. When interest rates rise, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Fund will generally fall. Conversely, when interest rates fall, the prices of fixed-income securities in the Fund will generally rise. The Fund may use derivatives, such as options, futures, inverse floating rate obligations, swaps, and others, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Derivatives may have a leveraging effect on the Fund. At times, the Fund's investments may represent industries or industry sectors that are interrelated or have common risks, making it more susceptible to any economic, political, or regulatory developments or other risks affecting those industries and sectors. These risks may increase share price volatility.         overview/bankbox.xslNot FDIC insuredMay lose valueNo bank guarantee						Before investing, consider the product's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. Contact your advisor or Amundi Pioneer for a prospectus or summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully. To obtain a free prospectus and for information on any Pioneer fund, please download from our web site.											Neither Amundi Pioneer, nor its representatives, are legal or tax advisors. In addition, Amundi Pioneer does not provide advice or recommendations. The investments you choose should correspond to your needs, goals, and risk tolerance. For assistance in determining your financial situation, please consult an investment professional.					 overview/mstarfootnotes.xsl 


perf/risk.xsl      Risk Measures (3-Year)    		                        	As of June 30, 2017      As compared to the MSCI World ND Index            R-squared      0.90        Beta      1.01        Sharpe Ratio      0.14        Standard Deviation (Fund)      11.11        Standard Deviation (Benchmark)      10.48          Risk measures apply to Class A Shares only.                  R-squared represents the percentage of the portfolio's movements that can be explained by the general movements of the market.                  Beta is a measure of the volatility of a fund relative to the overall market.                  Standard Deviation is a statistical measure of the historic volatility of a portfolio.                  Sharpe Ratio - a measure of excess return per unit of risk, as defined by standard deviation. A higher Sharpe ratio suggests better risk-adjusted performance.Source: Lipper.         perf/performance.xslFund Performance                             Chart is for illustrative purposes. These results represent the percentage change in net asset value per share. Returns would have been lower had sales charges been reflected.                   For the most recent month-end performance results click here. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.  The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All results are historical and assume the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.         Performance results reflect any applicable expense waivers in effect during the periods shown.

Class C Return if Redeemed: The performance of Class C shares does not reflect the 1% front-end sales charge in effect prior to February 1, 2004. If you paid a 1% sales charge, your returns would be lower than shown above. Class C Shares held for less than one year are subject to a 1% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).                  The performance of Class K shares for the period prior to the commencement of operations of Class K shares on December 31, 2014 is the net asset value performance of the fund's Class A shares, which has not been restated to reflect any differences in expenses, including 12b-1 fees applicable to Class A shares. Class K shares are not subject to sales charges and are available for limited groups of eligible investors, including institutional investors.                  The performance of Class R shares for the period prior to the commencement of operations of Class R shares on July 1, 2015 is based on the performance of Class A shares, reduced to reflect the higher distribution and service fees of Class R shares. For the period after July 1, 2015, the actual performance of Class R shares is reflected, which performance may be influenced by the smaller asset size of Class R shares compared to Class A shares. The performance of Class R shares does not reflect the 1% CDSC that was in effect prior to July 1, 2004.                  Performance for periods prior to the inception of Class Y shares on 12/31/08 reflects the NAV performance of the Fund's Class A Shares. The performance does not reflect differences in expenses, including the 12b-1 fees applicable to Class A Shares. Since fees for Class A shares are generally higher than those of Class Y, the performance shown for the Class Y shares prior to their inception would have been higher. Class Y shares are not subject to sales charges and are available for limited groups of investors, including institutional investors.                  NAV results represent the percent change in net asset value per share. Returns would have been lower had sales charges been reflected. The Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Index (benchmark) measures the performance of stock markets in the developed world. The Lipper Global Large Cap Core Funds Average represents the average annual returns for all Global Large Cap Core funds for the respective time periods.

Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.






StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.






About the optionsFund share classesA fund may offer multiple share classes. The objectives, strategies, and policies for all share classes of a fund are identical. However, expense ratios vary by share class, reflecting the differing costs of providing services to the holders of each share class.Here are some of the key distinctions:Investor SharesTraditional shares for individual investors that typically feature low minimum initial investments.Admiral™ SharesA lower-cost share class generally available without a minimum initial investment requirement to institutional investors and financial intermediary clients. Vanguard created Admiral Shares to recognize and encourage the cost savings stemming from large, long-standing investment accounts and to pass these savings on to the shareholders who generate them.Institutional SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances of $5 million or more.Institutional Plus SharesShares generally available to institutions or other investors with fund account balances from $100 million to $200 million, depending on the fund.Institutional Select SharesShares generally available to large institutional investors. Fund account minimums range from $3 billion to $5 billion, depending on fund.ETF SharesExchange-traded shares of certain Vanguard index funds, ETF Shares combine the benefits of indexing, such as low costs and broad market diversification, with the trading and pricing flexibility of individual stocks.Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable with the issuing Fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.Notes:All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.

Fees

•

Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities. None

•

Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities. None

Risk and volatility are based on the share class with the earliest inception date.
Risk measures are calculated from trailing 36-month fund returns relative to the associated benchmarks.
An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and periods of falling prices. The fund’s investments in foreign stocks can be riskier than U.S. stock investments. Foreign stocks tend to be more volatile and less liquid than U.S. stocks. The prices of foreign stocks and the prices of U.S. stocks may move in opposite directions.Investment style risk: The chance that returns from small- and mid-capitalization stocks, to the extent that the fund invests in them, will trail returns from the overall stock market. Historically, these stocks have been more volatile in price than the large-cap stocks that dominate the overall market, and they often perform quite differently.Country/regional risk: The chance that world events—such as political upheaval, financial troubles, or natural disasters—will adversely affect the value of securities issued by companies in foreign countries or regions. Because the fund may invest a large portion of its assets in securities of companies located in any one country or region, its performance may be hurt disproportionately by the poor performance of its investments in that area. Country/regional risk is especially high in emerging markets.Currency risk: The chance that the value of a foreign investment, measured in U.S. dollars, will decrease because of unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates.Manager risk: The chance that poor security selection will cause the fund to underperform relevant benchmarks or other funds with a similar investment objective.

Performance Metrics





Main Risks

					Derivatives Risk: A small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on the fund's performance. The use of derivatives involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets. Derivatives can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value.Emerging Market Risk: Emerging markets tend to be more volatile than the markets of more mature economies, and generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. The fund's concentration in securities of companies in emerging markets could cause the fund's performance to be more volatile than that of more geographically diversified funds.Equity Risk: Equity funds are subject generally to market, market sector, market liquidity, issuer and investment style risks, among other factors, to varying degrees, all of which are more fully described in the fund's prospectus.Foreign Investment Risk: To the extent the fund invests in foreign securities, its performance will be influenced by political, social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign companies. These special risks include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political instability, and differing auditing and legal standards.

Lazard Asset Management Pacific Co. Privacy Policy and Disclosure Statement
In this Privacy Policy and Collection Statement the expressions "Lazard Pacific", “Lazard Pacific entity”, "we", "us" and "our" are references to Lazard Asset Management Pacific Co. ABN 13 064 523 619 AFS Licence 238432 and those Australian registered bodies corporate related to it.
We are subject to the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).
This Privacy Policy and Collection Statement explains how we protect the privacy of your personal information under the APPs. It also sets out the matters that we are required to explain to individuals under APP5. The principles set out in this document apply to any personal information we collect about you, whether you provide it to us via our web site or other method or under any agreement or arrangement with us and to information which we might collect about you from other sources.
This Privacy Policy and Collection Statement does not apply to acts and practices of Lazard Pacific which relate directly to the employee records of Lazard Pacific’s current and former employees.
How we collect and hold personal information
We generally collect your personal information directly from you. For example, we may collect personal information about you when you deal with us over the telephone, (including recordings of those telephone conversations of which we have made you aware), send us correspondence (whether by letter, fax or email) or contact us through our web site, subscribe electronically to our web site/publications if available, or when you have contact with us in person. We also collect personal information about you, when you apply for a position with us.
Generally, the type of personal information we collect about you includes your name, date of birth, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address and any other personal information required to identify you for the purposes of Australian anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation. We may also collect your username and password to log in to our website and the organisation for which you work, your position in the organisation and the dealings we have had with you during your employment with that organisation. In certain circumstances, we may also collect sensitive information about you such as information about membership of a professional or trade association, or membership of a trade union or police records of prospective employees. We may also collect your tax file number and other details in relation to your taxation position, when you make an application for one of our products.
There may be occasions when we need to source personal information about you from a third party. For example, we may collect personal information from a company for whom you work, other organisations with whom you have any dealings, a recruitment agency, a credit-reporting agency in relation to employment checks, an information service provider or from a publicly maintained record.
We may also collect web site visitors' contact information (like their e-mail addresses). We utilise "cookies" which enable us to monitor traffic patterns and to serve you more efficiently if you revisit the site. A cookie does not identify you personally but it does identify your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie and this will provide you with an opportunity to either accept or reject it in each instance.
You may choose not to identify yourself, or to use a pseudonym when you deal with us. However we will need to identify you if we are required or authorised by Australian law, (such as anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing legislation), or a court/tribunal order to do so or if it is impracticable for us to deal with you if you are not identified.
Purposes of collection
Lazard Pacific collects personal information for any one or some of the following purposes:

to provide you or your organisation with information about our product offerings;
to service our relationship with you, including managing your investments, responding to complaints or dispute you may have about our services and providing you with information from time to time about your investments;
to consider making offers of employment or for employment purposes;
to receive services from you or the organisation which employs you;
to advise you of new investment developments and to undertake other marketing activities such as informing you about any of our products and services that we think may be of interest to you,
to comply with our legal obligations.

If you do not provide some or all of the information requested, we may not be able either to provide you with an appropriate level of service or to fulfil another applicable purpose of collection.
We may disclose your personal information to our related bodies corporate, your consultant, custodian, asset consultant, broker, or financial adviser on your behalf or to your external professional service providers such as auditors, accountants or lawyers. If we receive personal information about you that we have not solicited, we will determine within a reasonable time if we could have collected it for any of the purposes listed above (which may require us to use or disclose it to do so). If we decide we could not have collected the information and it is not in a Commonwealth record, we will destroy or de-identify the information as soon as possible. Otherwise we will handle the information in accordance with this policy.
How we use or disclose your personal information
We will use and disclose personal information for the primary purpose for which it was collected or for any purpose for which you have consented. We may also use and disclose personal information for related purposes, such as dealing with any complaints or disputes you may have about our services and also to provide to you of information concerning investment developments and other services offered by us. We do not disclose personal information we collect to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to direct market their products and services to you. We engage third party contractors to perform services for us which involves the contractor handling personal information we hold. For example, we engage third party contractors such as Lazard Asset Management LLC, our parent company, to provide investment management services. In these situations, we prohibit the third party contractor from using personal information about you except for the specific purpose for which we supply it.
Direct marketing communications
We may from time to time send you promotional or marketing information about our products and services. You can ask to stop receiving direct marketing communications from us at any time by contacting us using the contact details below and expressing your preference to stop receiving some or all marketing communications or to only receive them in a particular way.
Other people's information which you provide to us
If you provide personal information to us about someone else (such as one of your directors or employees or someone with whom you have dealings) you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that information to us and that, without us taking any further steps required by privacy laws, we may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes described above. For example, you should take reasonable steps to ensure the individual concerned is aware of the various matters detailed in this Privacy Policy and any collection Statement provided to you, as those matters relate to that individual, including our identity, how to contact us, our purposes of collection, our information use and disclosure practices, the individual's right to obtain access to and correct their information and to make a complaint, how we will deal with these and the consequences for the individual if the information is not provided
Sharing information within the Lazard group
Each Lazard Pacific entity may disclose personal information to other Lazard Pacific entities, which will use and disclose the information only for the purpose for which it was originally collected. Contact details for all Lazard Pacific entities are as set out below.
