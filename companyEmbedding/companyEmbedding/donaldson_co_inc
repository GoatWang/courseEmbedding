Donaldson Company, Inc. is a vertically integrated filtration company engaged in the production and marketing of products used as a means to improve performance efficiency and air quality. These products are used in a variety of industry sectors, including commercial/industrial (engines, exhausts, transmissions, vents in private vehicles, hydraulics), aerospace (helicopters, planes), chemical, alternative energy (windmills) and pharmaceuticals.
As a multinational company it operates in Belgium, Mexico, China, UK, Thailand, USA, Russia,[4] Japan, Italy, Germany and France. In fiscal year 2016 20.3% of sales came from business in the Asia-Pacific region (up from 19.9%), 28.5% from Europe (vs 28.3%) and 42.2% from the US (42.5% in 2015).[1] The company also makes aftermarket parts.
There was significant growth in the size of the company in terms of market value in 2009, going from about $2 billion at the start of the year to $3.26 billion in May 2010.[5][6] Although sales were steady between 2007 and 2010 long term debt rose 98.6% over that period; Long term debt increased 44% in 2008 and remained near that level until January 2011 when it fell 17% quarter to quarter (then fell a further 3% by January 2012).

History[edit]
Started as Donaldson Engineering, a small business built around Frank Donaldson's air intake filter invention (engine air cleaner).[9] The business was incorporated in 1915 by Donaldson, his parents and his siblings as Donaldson Company Inc.[10]
In its first decade Donaldson Company made two important moves, it acquired the Wilcox-Bennet air filter license and introduced the Simplex, a filter that also prevents engine damage. Deere & Company was the company's most important client during the first couple decades. The early 1930s brought additional prosperity when William Lowther joined the company and designed the NS Filter, a tractor performance enhancing filter invented by Frank Donaldson. The 1930s were a transitional period, beginning with tough economic conditions in the United States which caused business from farmers to fall and subsequently forcing the company to contract in size. This was later followed by the sale of patents to influential investors provided the company with funds and market exposure needed to survive and grow (part of the agreement was that Donaldson Company produce the filters). World War II provided opportunities for the company to expand into aerospace and military hydraulic equipment and device filters.
The 1950s were bittersweet, the company gained market share, grew in size and went public (1955) but was faced with employee strikes, the exodus of key employees (who started a new company to compete with Donaldson for market share) and IRS charges of hidden back taxes.[9]
In the 1960s subsidiaries were established in Germany, South Africa, Britain, France, Australia and Benelux.

History[edit]
Started as Donaldson Engineering, a small business built around Frank Donaldson's air intake filter invention (engine air cleaner).[9] The business was incorporated in 1915 by Donaldson, his parents and his siblings as Donaldson Company Inc.[10]
In its first decade Donaldson Company made two important moves, it acquired the Wilcox-Bennet air filter license and introduced the Simplex, a filter that also prevents engine damage. Deere & Company was the company's most important client during the first couple decades. The early 1930s brought additional prosperity when William Lowther joined the company and designed the NS Filter, a tractor performance enhancing filter invented by Frank Donaldson. The 1930s were a transitional period, beginning with tough economic conditions in the United States which caused business from farmers to fall and subsequently forcing the company to contract in size. This was later followed by the sale of patents to influential investors provided the company with funds and market exposure needed to survive and grow (part of the agreement was that Donaldson Company produce the filters). World War II provided opportunities for the company to expand into aerospace and military hydraulic equipment and device filters.
The 1950s were bittersweet, the company gained market share, grew in size and went public (1955) but was faced with employee strikes, the exodus of key employees (who started a new company to compete with Donaldson for market share) and IRS charges of hidden back taxes.[9]
In the 1960s subsidiaries were established in Germany, South Africa, Britain, France, Australia and Benelux.
