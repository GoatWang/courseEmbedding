#ilovesouthchina #hkfootball78177告別篇（五）

昨天，我和南華職球員一起共享了長達11小時的Farewell Party．

Party分3 parts，6pm先在Tonno Club自助餐，因為有些外援球員乘晚上11時許的航機離港，所以晚飯要早一點吃，方便大家到機場check in．

第2 part，是在君悅酒店的Poolhouse瘋狂party，我們把支持南華的贊助商，合作伙伴和友好都請來了，球隊職球員都帶同老公／老婆／男女朋友出席，我們說好了：不醉無歸！玩到12點．

第3 part，轉場到Red MR．有部份唔飲得的，如李威廉，第2 part未完，已經被老婆「的」走；陳偉豪這些深閏的亦走先，其他就到Red MR繼續狂歡．最後一批離開Red MR的小隊，離場時間是5am．

昨晚的Farewell Party，有笑有淚，真心感動．
Party中，約有150位賓客，很抱歉未能全數邀請和我合作過的所有教練球員，事實是，我對你們每一位，和我合作過的，都衷心想說聲Thank you and Goodbye．

其實我的人生，都經歷過很多事情了，由2006到2014這8年間，我和南華和香港足球再次結緣，卻是我很重要的人生階段．從何說起呢？過去8年，每球季，南華的班費為$1500萬起， 8年來，這些錢，其實去了哪裡？

錢都去了一些人手上，而他們用甚麼來交換這些資源？教練們和球員們用他們的努力、技術，專業，不斷學習、操練、比賽，流汗流血，和他們最精華的青春光陰去換取生活和理想．

球隊職員們，也是在不斷學習和成長．由8年前我搞波時，香港沒有太多專業的足球從業員，到昨天，來Farewell Party的，有足球專業的物理治療師，有球隊全職按摩師，有8年來飾演波南的演員（Marketing 同事堅持8年以來用同一位演員去演繹波南，以免每次出來都不同高矮肥瘦和動作．多年前波南「阿謙」是演藝學院的學生，現在已經有正職工作，但他一直都幫手做波南，十分專業．）我們亦有幾位由8年前開始做球隊工作的designers，其實設計師都有不同範疇，足球隊的設計師都要很專業，因為需要有豐富的足球common sense．而像Jackal和蘇蘇這些核心的球隊管理職位，這些年來，一邊做一邊學，現在，要他們帶隊去參加比賽，他們的專業知識都游靱有餘．

我不在邀功，過去我在努力的同時，也有很多其他球圈人士在努力，我只是想表達一件事，就是，我的感動，在於當我看見今日參與足球的人，我很有種「開枝散葉」的滿足，並衷心祝福各位日後有更好的發展．

以香港而言，一個地區，若要搞好足球，還有很多週邊的supporting，這些也需要人材．香港足球搞得好，這個行業就會愈來愈多人，他們的經驗，也是香港的資產，亦會成為香港競爭力的萬份之一的小支柱吧！

如果香港根本沒有這個行業，又何來培育出專才？每一個小部份，都是組成香港競爭力的組件．

例如adidas是很專業的團隊，但如果不是因為贊助南華到這個高規格，相信不會發展出一隊小團隊專職照顧本地足球隊的贊助事宜，他們都十分專業，球隊需要甚麼，他們比我們更加清楚，甚麼都自動按時送上適當數量，照顧週到．像2014-15年度的球衣，早半年前已經搞好了，一切都預備周詳．

來賓還有Now TV 634的高層人員，為了港甲頻道，其實Now TV也訓練了很多人才，拍攝一現場直播賽事，與轉播球賽所需的安排很不同，這些人員的工作重要性，也是與本地足球息息相關．

對不起，我說到很遠了，其實我想表達的，做其他生意，如果每年投放$1500萬，可能有一半是給了租金，但搞了8年足球，我眼前看到的，是這些資源是90%交給了努力的教練、球員、職員，和配合的行業，還帶給了香港球迷很多娛樂．

我深感這些年，我沒有白費努力，亦絕不後悔．此時，我衷心希望香港足球能夠有更好發展，有心人要出來做多些事，大家頂住呀！

本來想講昨晚的party的，現在可能要分今明兩晚寫了．

第一部份，我們的晚飯，我個多星期前就約大家，本來我的想法，是一般外援球員，都會在六月初與球會接觸，六月一日多數還留在香港．遺憾是因為南華方面已通知所有外援球員不獲續約，所以有外援球員歸心似箭，訂了較早的航班，亦要帶同大量行李離港，像狄卡奧又帶著bb，所以有幾位球員狄卡奧，迪亞高，謝家強，巴域斯都未能出席．而卡古特、利馬、韋爾都有來吃飯，後者因為今天才離港，所以昨晚都有帶同女友來party．

我一直想搞一個開開心心的farewell party，離任，卻不要帶著傷感．我想跟大家開開心心說再見，所以在party裡，我請了一隊band來表演，那是我上次在新加坡一間酒吧發掘的樂隊，表演非常出色，我想球員們一定會喜歡，所以便把他們請來．結果，他們的表演，沒有讓我失望，令現場氣氛high爆，讓我們過了一個99%都是非常開心的晚上．餘下的1%，少少傷感啦，在所難免．

開心事和趣事，下一篇再分享．

我特別想提的，是昨晚的party，有很多朋友都來了，令我很感動．灣仔體育會的朋友Peggy和Yolanda，Giorgio Armani的高層，Fancl及為南華做website的Designer City的朋友，陳志康和太太、鄭少偉和文彼得、陳曉明都現身來跟我說一句Thank you and Goodbye，這一份心意，我收到，多謝．

另外，Party中有兩位很受歡迎的特別嘉賓，昨天賽馬賽事完畢後，潘頓和貝湯美都來party，和我們一齊玩．兩位除了常為我騎馬外，我和他們都已成為好朋友，他們很好，無論發生甚麼事，都真心為我打氣．昨晚我在致辭中開玩笑，南華除了要多謝贊助商支持外，亦要多謝兩位騎師，因為他們為我贏馬，贏得的獎金，我都投放入去搞足球了，所以他們才是南華過去幾年的最大支持者．

說笑而已，但我真的很感激大家，你們的支持和愛，我深深感受到．

今晚先分享昨晚的喪跳狂歡片段，希望明晚可以分享更多相片！再談．

#ilovesouthchina44155各位，正準備出blog，等我，好快。
今晚迎月，和家人吃飯，之後回家玩左一陣。而家準備blog。
我練左幾日，終於成功做到，睇住片先。25917全部帖子Steven Lo · 6月12日 · 我寫給南華球迷的「香港家書」，我放在我這裡的䀡文，在短短兩日內，已有十四萬多個reached，三千七佰多個like，二佰五十多個shares，及幾百個留言，多謝大家。 「香港家書」文字版和出街的錄音版有些少不同，是由於香港電台在錄音當日，希望我多講一些我對香港足球未來發展的想法，所以，錄音版會詳盡一點，大家有時間不妨重溫一下。发布者：Steven Lo14,692 次播放1.4 万次播放Steven Lo · 6月9日 · 親愛的香港球迷，特別是南華球迷： 首先還是要自我介紹一下，我是羅傑承，香港出生的香港人，曾於1992-94年，及2006-14年，兩度成為南華足主。 幾日前，得知南華退出香港超級聯賽及申請降級甲組，我在Facebook寫了感言，希望大家支持南華的決定，靜待南華在適當時候重返超聯。... 貼文一出，引起很大迴響，感謝12萬人閱讀，幾百個留言，我一一細讀，還看了很多遍。 然後，香港電台聯絡我撰文，在「香港家書」節目中播出，我一口答應。杜甫說「家書抵萬金」，我現在就送上「萬金」給香港球迷，特別是南華球迷，回饋大家的關注。 在很多人心目中，南華多少代表香港足球。畢竟，南華是世上少有的百年球會，曾奪41次本地聯賽冠軍，這殿堂級地位，全球只有7個老牌球會能夠達到。香港有南華，作為足球迷，最少有個起點去談論香港足球吧！ 我帶領了南華共10個球季，對南華的感情，實非一般。兩度成為南華足主，是我的榮幸，這是真心話，大家叫我「羅神」我沒所謂，一個稱呼而已，但我真的不是「神」，南華10年，也許只是憑我團隊的一股傻勁，碰巧用了適合的方法，令大家留下深刻印象。如果問我如何評價那個小陽春，我會說2006-14的南華與港足，是「天時地利人和」多於一切。 我從小熱愛足球，很慚愧，1992年，我33歲，年少氣盛，當時我覺得，做足主就好像馬主一樣，贏波就像拉頭馬，威風嘛！那時候也是一個傻佬，以為搞足球很容易！ 14年後，自己經歷過歲月的磨練，我再遇上出任南華足主的機會。當時要做「白武士」，我磨拳擦掌，這次不再是玩玩下，經營百年老號足球隊，細路仔玩泥沙咩？好認真的，足球是很多人的生計，也背負著很多人的夢想！ 世界發展迅速，千禧年都過了，做人也要與時並進吧！搞甚麼都好，要有方法，要有帶動好多人與你同路的方向！ 我又對自己講，我條命大起大落，搞波會有甚麼過程和結果、風險和困難，我不知道，而這是個重要的決定，結果一是流芳百世，一是遺臭萬年，沒有中間點。 但我鍾意足球嘛！鍾意贏嘛！男人來的，不宜思前想後婆婆媽媽，要做就一股勁去做，上了馬便向前行，不要看回頭！（呀！所以我第一匹在香港的馬，名字就叫「永不回望」。） 2006年，我47歲，開始有些領導心得。我覺得一個人、一個團隊成功與否，關鍵在於紀律。我討厭階級之別，球隊內不應有「大佬」、「𡃁仔」之分，教練遇到「大牌」球員，要一視同仁。對於外援球員，我一樣嚴厲，犯錯必罵，而且更要罵雙倍。 我是一個要求很高的人，在比賽日的更衣室𥚃，贏波我未必讚，輸波我未必罵，我看的是，球員在場上的表現與態度。 不少人說「羅生好惡」，「估佢唔到」，其實我是有用心的。男人之間，陰聲細氣客套相待，是沒有用的，恨鐵不成鋼就會加倍嚴厲。我反應大，職球員才知道我真的著緊，沒有人每年拿8位數字倒了落海，還來跟你「圍威喂」，你以為我真是傻佬嗎？ 在此跟大家分享點解「羅生好惡」。當年我初出茅廬，在銀行打工，第一天上班，跟指示用打字機打了一封信交給上司，簽名我只打錯了一個字，上司當著幾十個同事面前把我臭罵（說葡文，而我不知道他罵甚麼），並把信撕掉。 那一刻閃過劈炮的念頭，但最後我回到角落的座位上，把信再打一遍，交信的一刻，我對自己講，今次我一定要過關！自此之後，上司對我如常嚴厲，但我漸漸明白，上司如果對你沒期望，根本就連罵你都費事。結果我在銀行𥚃步步高陞，未足30歲便自立門戶創業。我很感恩有這位用盡葡語粗口駡我的上司，他如果對我仁慈，就是對我的成長殘忍。 香港足球要成功，首先要大改革。誰叫我們先天不足，後天又不及鄰近地區決斷發展足球？ 要發展、推動香港足球，首先必須要政府全力支持。注意：全力是全力，不是半力，也不是借力！怎樣叫全力支持，不用我來扮專家，抄便可以：例如學日本南韓，邀請大企業公司贊助足球隊，配合稅務優惠，及完善的監管制度。另外，給我們硬件，有了球場和設施，再斟酌軟件。 球會管理方面，勢必要職業化；青訓是球會份內事，不容怠慢；球員要自我增值，體能、技術、視野也要進步。 還有香港裁判水平，談到這個我最憤怒，怎麼多年來都如此束手無策？足總要做大事，別來是但求其，裁判水平搞不好，給你20隊英超也沒用。 教練訓練教練，名師出高徒，不用花口水再加說明吧！香港隊，多用本地華人球員，令球迷更有歸屬感。 球迷，由愛香港球隊開始，找出自己愛隊，由盲撐入場開始。其實，我真的不介意球迷罵戰，或者罵球會管理層，甚至罵我，罵吧！在球場裡，我們誰不是被罵大的？但我要求你們最少要入場，看著罵、罵著看，讓我們一起壯大！ 是老生常談，只要不是「齋用把口講」，大家分頭去做好自己本份，香港人，有甚麼是做不到的？ 最後，回應眾多球迷留言，希望我重掌南華。我撰寫此信之日，正是我的生日，又大一歲，漸漸相信命理。這幾年都不是我順利之年，人生之大起大落，又一次在體驗中。 但我熱愛足球的本性難移，這幾年支持芷珊搞香港飛馬，而飛馬和我昔日的南華相比，用的是另一套方法，我也非常重視培訓年青球員的。 至於「別了依然相信，以後有緣再聚」，我仍然審慎樂觀，沉著靜待東山再起之時： 說的是我的時機； 說的也是球迷的熱情； 說的是南華的意向； 說的也是香港足球的自強不息！ 羅傑承敬上 二零一七年六月八日 展开全部帖子Steven Lo · 6月8日 · 多謝各方朋友的短訊及留言，今天是我的生日，大家的祝福，我全部收到，多謝。 生日，過了幾十個，其實沒甚麼特別，我今日是如常地上班、開會、傾生意，中間只是多了同事canteen切蛋糕、飲茶食cake、吹蠟蠋加許願。 日子每天都過，但要過得有意義，能夠做自己想做的事，說自己想說的話，已經相當幸福。... 今日我做了一件特別的事，寫了一封「香港家書」，給香港球迷，特別是南華球迷，寫的時候，有當年每晚對著電腦寫blog的感覺；南華blog，你們還記得嗎？ 而這篇給球迷的blog，大家要等等我，因為我明天還要錄音，在星期六早上9時香港電台第一台「香港家書」節目中播出，大家請留意，而節目播出之後，早上10時，我就會在這裡貼文。 多謝大家給我上一篇貼文的熱情回應，2000個likes，12萬個reach，105次轉載，是我這幾天的最大鼓舞。香港人還有一種共同語言：香港足球！這一點，原來仍未改變。 等我，星期六談！ 展开Steven Lo · 6月5日 · 剛剛從新聞得知南華來季退出港超聯賽及申請降落甲組比賽，百感交集，一個百多年歷史球會，今天宣布退出聯賽，實在有點傷感。 92年及06年，我曽兩度成為南華足主共達10年，由05-06年度南華申請留班以至隨即當年成為三冠王，09年10月21日，亞協盃四強賽入場人數37,459 ，紅旗高掛，也破了香港大球場（非表演賽事）入埸人數紀錄。  2010年，畢特、基士文加盟南華，同年與英超球會熱刺結盟，當時國際體育新聞的廣泛報導，令世界各地更多人認識香港南華足球隊，上述的事情，在我腦海中一瞬間湧現出來。 ... 早排與南華高層閒談，談及本地足球時，他們指出現時的香港超聯賽的賽事環境，與南華會辦足球的宗旨，有些背道而馳，球隊基於成績的考慮，棄用本地華人球員，令本地球員鮮有上陣機會，從而香港隊教練也只可選時常有上陣的入籍兵入選，令香港球迷對近年香港隊的歸屬感不足。  大家常有也有提及，如果想香港足球進步，就一定要多訓練本地華人年輕球員，及讓他們多上陣機會，吸取經驗。沒想到這件事情終於在今天發生。 我想，大家應該尊重南華會的決定，向前看，深信有一天當南華青訓成熟時，將重返港超聯，我希望可以很快見到這一天。 展开Steven Lo 上传了 4 张新照片。 · 1月31日 · 恭喜發財，恭祝大家雞年行好運，事事如意，身體健康。 今天在我家的團拜，公司四金花為我準備了一份神秘禮物，安排財神到我家拜年和派利是，給我及在場賓客一個驚喜！中國人過年最緊要好意頭，結果財神真的發揮了他的作用，令我今天發了一個小小橫財。                                           今年我訂下了幾個長遠目標，希望可以順利逐一做到。我覺得做人不論甚麼年紀，小孩，年青人，中年人或老年人，在甚麼階段都一定要設定一個或多個不同目標，把它寫下來，每天為定下的目標努力，就算不能即時做到，也希望能做到接近，做到最好，這樣做人才有拼勁、才有意義。                    在這𥚃，希望大家都和我一樣，今天先定下今年的目標，然後一起努力去實現，記住，成功靠行動。Steven Lo

對於我這個最怕行入牙醫診所的人來說，我簡直覺得自己好勇敢！ 我以為自己是超人，唔駛休息，但呢次真係好攰，可能係儲埋2015年的攰，加上牙肉傷口好痛，唔食得嘢，成個假期都喺屋企休息。 休息期間，唯一娛樂，就係喺屋企睇戲，同埋出街睇戲。 睇咗好多套戲，其中有兩套，兩套都係講女人故事的戲，改編自真人真事，好想同大家分享下。... 一套係舊戲，Woman in Gold，女主角係一個幾十歲奧地利女人，為家族的公義和爺爺的遺產，特別是一幅當年納綷黨沒收，但其後在奧地利國家博物館的名畫，她要打官司的對象是奧地利政府。作為一個市民，如果政府奪去你的私人財產，而現存的法律和體制都沒有有利於她爭取的先例，甚至相關的法律根本沒有這方面的保障，試想像要發動這場鬥爭，是多麼的艱巨。 我看這戲的時候，頭十分鐘差點想「換碟」，好像很悶，更是「沒希望」和「無得鬥」的感覺，但看下去，我覺得這戲很好看。 有時，好多野，到你真係要頂硬上為一班人去爭取時，總係要積極面對，無畏無懼，因為懼都無用。 個故事架構OK，但最好睇既，係寫情既部份，寫親情，寫人與人之間的支持，睇完成個人好似有返啲力量，導演Simon Curtis和演員Helen Mirren既功力都好好。 套戲仲有一個好觸動我既地方，就係每個人都有一些回憶，因為係好好既回憶，到失去後，反而想逃避面對。女主角小時候在奧地利長大，因為戰爭，以前充滿親情回憶的大屋，今日已經變成政府辦公室，佢為打官司回去，每一幕回憶戲都拍得很有感情，令人觸動。 戲中有位律師，原籍奧地利，在美國當律師。他幫女主角打這場官司，因為在奧地利「無得打」，嘗試將case搬到美國，成功令美國法庭受理案件，對手是奧地利政府，最後更打贏官司，取回名畫，這單case，成為轟動全世界的重要案例，這一段也拍得很好看。 另一套戲，都係女人故事，Joy「歡姐當自強」。入場是因為女兒喜歡Jennifer Lawrence，而我以前超鍾意Isabella Rosellini，嘩，當年佢真係靚到dum一聲！故事本身我覺得組織得普通，可以更好，但係Joy個角色本身好討好：一個女人，天生有個耳仔軟既老豆，皇后病的阿媽，一個長唔大無大志既前夫，一個成事不足敗事有餘的負皮繼姐，兩個有排都未長大的bb，只有一個年老婆婆永遠信任同支持自己．．．這些看似好平常，但又係纏繞一世的人生不幸泉源，好多人每日都面對，問題係，你會唔會仍然去擔起責任，無論點都包容同照顧佢地。 這兩套戲寫親情都寫得很好：一個人係屋企核心，對內對外都承受無盡壓力，必要時就要出來撐，撐得成功了，以後還是靠你去繼續撐！但這就是很多人不斷努力的動力，或者，這就是上天要你孭的責任！ 講返我好鍾意既Isabella Rosellini，佢一直都好靚，老左都aged gracefully，在戲中飾演羅拔迪尼路的女友，不再是美女角色，亦演得很好。 年月的確是女人最大的敵人，當我告訴女兒，今年63歲的Isabella Rosellini曾經是我眼中最美麗的女人，她無法置信，直至我給她看舊照片．．． 女人要盡keep，我終於明白，所以今後我看見女士們花多些金錢和時間來扮靚，我都會支持！ 2016，希望大家都開開心心，遇強愈強，女士們個個都靚！  （網上圖片） 展开+2Steven Lo 上传了 5 张新照片。 · 2015年11月23日 · 這幾日，去到邊度，都有人同我講恭喜軍事出擊贏馬奪盃。 香港馬迷、球迷真係好多，足球及跑馬始終都係受歡迎的娛樂節目，大家工作咁辛苦，茶餘飯後，有啲共同話題，一講起就好興奮！ 事實上，我和太太芷珊都好興奮，上星期六肯定是我們的幸運日，軍事出擊勝出浪琴馬會盃2000米2級賽；菁英盃香港飛馬勝南華2:0，同日贏馬贏波，並不常發生。... 好多時朋友講起，或者傳媒做訪問時，芷珊都答：好運啫。 好運，當然很重要，有時，用一句「好運」去解釋，但「好運」兩個字代表咩？ 比賽，運氣當然好重要，但運氣呢啲野，基本上都係一個機會率，無人可以行一世運，我覺得，成功背後係付出了好多好多努力。賽馬如是，足球也如是。 團隊精神好重要，軍事出擊明年即將轉8歲，上季表現不太好原因是曾有腳患及有食慾不振現象，但練馬師方嘉柏團隊一直很有耐心地把軍事出擊養得好好，經悉心料理及治療後，今季可以講已經完全康復，復課後表現理想，吃得操得，馬匹基本上要有好的健康及開心先會有好的比賽情緒，才可以發揮牠的水準，今次開心的除了是贏馬外，方嘉栢昨日透露軍事出擊的狀態於這役後會繼續有所提升，希望牠在十二月的國際賽馬日為港增光。 足球也一樣，每一次交出的表現，都顯示出整個團隊的準備。菁英盃原意是讓青年球員有比賽機會，雖然後來在賽制上有了調整，可以盡出6個外援上陣，但飛馬仍堅持多派本地球員出戰，前天比賽的正選名單平均年齡是24.4歲，這種堅持是很艱難，但當效果出現時，一切都會是很值得的。 我聽過有評述員朋友說得很搞笑，他形容飛馬季初的表現：「係好快，但好怪」，其實講得幾準確。 一班年青球員狂練體能和速度，很想做到很多事情，但必須有勇有謀。 勇，我肯定他們有！整個團隊的態度也很好，很勤力，野心、決心也有了，但怎樣做才可以夾得最好？ 早前邀請了前熱刺教練Kevin Bond來香港為飛馬做特訓，我八卦去看他主持的訓練。 當然，Kevin不是魔術師，如他所說：「足球理論及訓練方式，處處都很相近，教的方法也大同小異，分別其實在於教完之後，有沒有要求球員達到目標」 香港足球的訓練方法沒有大問題，問題在於怎樣去設立要求，怎樣令球員達到教練的要求？ 看Kevin主持的訓練，似曾相識，當年在熱刺我看過很多次。Kevin球員出身，他教波，如果球員做不到，他會落場親自捉住球員，站在球員的位置，拉他走前走後走左走右，訓練他們要懂得走位及要有位置感。 平時我們在觀眾席，或者教練坐bench，當然看得清楚，大叫球員走空位、交前、交後．．．但球員在球場上觀察球賽的角度不同，在那個位置，又怎預計來球和參與攻防？眼看到、腦想到、但身體怎樣動？ 另，看到球員學到野當然好，但我更欣賞的是，飛馬的教練團，由總教練李志堅，到助教們，每一位都很認真很正面地學習，也見到他門抄下了很多筆記。 而團隊的努力和決心，球隊的進步，在Kevin Bond主持的一星期特訓後，兩埸的熱身賽先勝香港代表隊B隊2-0，對夢想駿其8-0，及前天菁英盃再勝南華2-0，在這三場比賽中看見飛馬無論在防守及進攻都明顯有很大進歩，這是可喜的，接下來，是仍需繼續努力。 一場痛快清脆的勝利，對團隊來說，是莫大的鼓舞。 足球和賽馬都不是變魔術，要有成果，就需要長期堅持和努力，我覺得，勤力是可以補祝運氣的因素，那才是真正的實力！ 有一天，我希望看到以土生土長的本地球員為主的香港代表隊打入世界盃32強，這個夢想很遠，但我們要一直堅持！ 展开+2Steven Lo 上传了 8 张新照片。 · 2015年11月15日 · 十一月，忙，但開心。 我這份人好像很冷漠很惡，但其實我很好客。唔似呢？！ 這個月內，有幾位來自歐洲及國內足球圈的朋友到訪，關於足球，我又係咩都傾一餐！ 其中Kevin Bond是我幾年前透過前熱剌領隊列納認識的。Kevin是Harry 的左右手。 在英超，領隊是球隊最高策劃人，但基本上不會落場教波。Harry是很有經驗的領隊，而Kevin一直是落手落腳執行教波和調教球員的人。... 我和Kevin一直有聯絡，我在英國時也會約他吃飯及會面，直至今年暑假，我在倫敦，很不客氣地問Kevin：可否來港為香港足球做D嘢？ Kevin毫不猶豫很爽快的回應説：無問題！ 所以促成了Kevin今次來港為足總主持了2個教練班Workshops，及幫飛馬球隊主持了1周特訓。  今天想講講Kevin。在我多個歐洲球圏朋友中，他是我其中一個最深刻印象的，因為：1）由1974-81諾域治長期隊長，82-84曼城隊長，84-88修咸頓隊長，一直是隊長，記律一定非常好及有領導才能 。  2）斯文有禮，說話非常有說服力，似大學講師。  3）經驗豐富，曾帶領球隊踢超過一千場職業球賽。 4）完全知道足球發展硬件基本要求及如何開始發展靑訓。  Kevin指出在這兩星期𥚃，他接觸多位香港本地教練，全部都是nice guys,，而他觀察香港的問題，除硬件太差外，另訓練時間不足夠，強度不足。 至於訓練過程，並沒有大問題，只是沒有要求專業result。 大家看了早幾天我post了一段熱刺U9的片段，就會明白Kevin所指。 Thanks Kevin，希望日後再有機會邀請有經驗的教練來港分享，最好時間長一點。 展开+5Steven Lo · 2015年11月11日 · 同大家分享幾分鐘的比賽: 熱刺對阿仙奴U9.  小朋友人仔細細, 但功架有齊, 再睇球証落到球場好似巨人咁, 就會覺得更驚訝, 咁細個, 咁好技術.   呢段片係Kevin Bond分享比我地教練Workshop睇既, 睇完之後, 我講笑話要約返場友賽同呢班小朋友踢過, Kevin話: 真係有得踢架!   香港既青訓, 有好多可以改善既地方, 遙遙長路, 要大家一齊努力.发布者：Steven Lo25,819 次播放2.5 万次播放Steven Lo 上传了 8 张新照片。 · 2015年11月2日 · 自從國家主席習近平說他有個足球夢，足球發展話題熱哄哄，上週習近平訪問曼城的新聞報導十分吸睛，原來，任何外交畫面裡，只要有個大草地球場，有球衣有足球，更有和亞古路的selfie，就立即親民陽光起來。 我們都有個夢，想香港足球發展得更好，當中有好多可以做的，例如我們常說train the trainers． 我有這個構思好久了，如果有些好友外國領隊／教練，能夠來到香港實地觀察球隊比賽和訓練，和香港的教練團交流，那一定是好事．... 芷珊和我商量，飛馬本週有對南華比賽，之後有兩週可以做training camp，不如請我們的好友Kevin Bond來香港 !之後我們又想到，如果可以和足總的教練訓練部門夾，搞個Workshop邀請港超聯教練來一起分享，那應該效果幾好。 跟陳曉明夾，最初說不如在奧運大樓搞workshop，之後更確定再做好些，在酒店會議廳進行，免費招待９隊超聯球隊教練出席，分享英超球會在比賽前一週，每天的準備． 沒想到大家反應很熱列，很開心9隊都有派教練出席，其中傑志、東方、飛馬、流浪、元朗、黃大仙、駿其的總教練都來到，南華和南區都有派教練來，另外香港隊的教練也有來參與。最後由於會議廳只能容納約30人，我們還要迫不得已cut人數，非常不好意思． 我本身對這些topic都好有興趣，所以放工後亦有去旁聽，有機會做這些workshop，加上９隊港超聯球隊都有人參與，覺得很有意思，最少，平時我們都是較少機會所有頂級聯賽的教練都坐在一起交流。 說回Kevin Bond，在球員生涯中，他曾效力諾域治、曼城、修咸頓及般尼茅夫等英格蘭球會，原來他在８０年代，他踢諾域治的時候，就隨隊來過香港，對香港寶路華！掛靴後，Kevin Bond成為足球教練，曾為修咸頓、樸茨茅夫、紐卡素及熱刺等球隊擔任教練，上季是昆士柏流浪的領隊。 我是在熱刺時代認識Kevin的，他是哈利列納的左右手，每週的訓練都是由他策劃的，今次我邀請他來香港，他一口便答應，今天準備的workshop資料很豐富，當然訓練內容是很有趣，但我最印象深刻的，是在英超世界裡，那些資料搜集的配套十分先進，真的可以幫助教練團很大忙． 這些都是我們「有排學」的，舉例，球隊有自己的分析團隊，「估計」下週對手的出場陣容，然後有分析對手每位球員的優點和缺點，全周作針對式訓練．有人問：你們估計對手陣容，但如果估錯了，會不會令球員措手不及．．．私底下Kevin告訴我，這些估計陣容很少「估錯」，因為是很有隊專業團隊「統計分析」和「收風」，如果「估錯」比率太大，分分鐘炒魷，這些對我們來說，都是很有趣的見聞。 又例如，半場的更衣室裡，領隊會對球員說甚麼？原來，在英超比賽裡，他們有即時的上半場失誤的即場剪片，領隊半場在更衣室裡已經可以「去片」提點球員某一分鐘的犯錯可以如何改善，一般英超球隊都最少有十幾個私伙鏡頭拍攝球賽，領隊只要說第幾分鐘，就即刻有片睇．．．嘩！ 今日美中不足是沒有機會全場教練大合照，會後才覺得錯失了這個機會，因為負責教練培訓的陳曉明說，一般coach training都偏重青訓教練，極少機會是香港隊和港超球隊教練坐在一起交流，所以今天是一個很好的機會． 也多謝足總的同事Alex和Wing負責workshop的安排，籌備時間很倉卒但準備得很好。 Kevin明天會隨飛馬去training camp，主理飛馬的training，實地train the trainers，讓教練團和球員都感受一下英超的訓練方式。 之後，下星期一11/9將會有另一場Kevin Bond主持的講座，晚上6:00到8:00，在奧運大樓舉行，這次可招待最多100名教練，主要講英超球隊的青訓，現在仍可以讓教練們報名。 下次再談． 展开+5Steven Lo · 2015年10月26日 · 因為阿Cow陳志康生日, 我早幾晚約佢同幾個球員成功晉身教練/領隊既球員一齊食餐飯。 係好難得, 難得在於, 呢幾位都係我喺南華時代好悉心…唔好話栽培, 但最少係我好悉心咁同佢地鋪路, 好想睇到佢地成功轉型，一直喺球圈發展既球員. 睇住佢地大, 過去曾經有我成日喺更衣室鬧佢地既日子; 我又迫佢地成長, 佢地每一個, 都係我半迫半哄佢地掛靴, 早過佢地做好心理預備既時候, 就極力游說佢地起步, 為未來鋪路轉型. 但係, 做人就係咁, 要早啲做好準備, 好多野唔可以到時再算, 我出名緊張大師, 先天下之憂而憂, 康仔坦言, 當年佢好嬲我迫佢做助教, 但今日佢非常明白. 當年, 我迫過康仔光仔去學英文考教練牌; 而家既文彼得被我迫得仲緊要, 威廉亦都係我心目中好有潛質既管理人員.... 睇住康仔、光仔今時今日獨當一面, 係香港超聯球隊總教練, 雖然唔再係幫我手, 但我都好開心, 講真, 好proud. 我原來92年就識康仔, 23年, 今年第一次同佢食生日飯慶祝, 第一次同佢「隊酒」, 我地跟住仲去唱歌, 被班衰仔拍晒片, 而我就斷晒片…  呢一晚真係好開心, 大家記住, 一定要繼續進步, 呢個係我地對香港足球既共同心願! Shanghai Lo 上海佬餐館 展开Steven Lo · 2015年10月15日 · 看過最近幾場香港隊比賽的表現，球員們靠鬥志高昂，為港足捱過了一步又一步。 但我看後，仍然對港足近年發展耿耿於懷，想在這𥚃分享一下。 足球，不能每次憑鬥志和運氣作為評審，技術和體能的基本原素才是真正的實力。  香港足球，即使有了鳳凰計劃，在實力上改進仍是騷不到癢處。... 想起七，八十年代的香港足球水平和現時比較，現時的足球比起以前可能是沒有退步，但卻是沒有進步。 鄰近亞洲國家如日本，泰國甚至乎越南，印尼等的足球水平，在這三十多年卻進步了很多，我深信要令一個地區的足球水平進步，需要一個十年至十五年的完善長遠發展計劃，由零再開始。 首先解決訓練場地嚴重不足問題，希望足總認真跟進和說服政府要提供足夠訓練場地作足球發展用途，現在仍然是極不足夠！ 另外需要聘請有國際經驗的技術總監（不能由總教練兼仼）及多名青訓教練及體能導師，技術總監要落實訂下及安排一個由8歲至16歲的長遠青訓計劃。 我不是說現時香港的本地訓練教練的方式不好，但是我總覺得如果香港的年靑教練能夠跟隨一些具有國際經驗豐富的教頭實地學習，視野會更加廣闊，亦能夠令他們知道及學習現代足球訓練方式及制度與現時本土的有什麼分別。 日本在90年代，足球也是由零開始，當年他們聘請了多名巴西及歐洲的著名教練，要求本土的教練跟隨他們學習，經二十多年後日本國家隊教練甚至乎大多數日職球隊的教練已是日本本土人。 現時香港的青訓，每星期只練兩節，每節只有60至90分鐘，而亞洲足球進步的國家，他們每星期練習5課，強度追上職業足球水平，並且有由中學及大學足球隊的高水平訓練接軌，所以每年都能夠訓練出很多表現出色的球員供應職業球會。  如果政府真的想支持香港足球發展，一定要和足總時常溝通，䀻請外國經驗豐富的顧問公司，訂下一個最少七至十年的發展計劃，落實聘請一些具有國際足球發展經驗的人才加盟，香港的足球水平才能有機會進步，而不是好像現時情況，足總的角色是見一歩行一歩，只有架構沒有嚴格監管，重點是：足總仍然沒有一個清晰及政府完全同意和支持的長遠發展規劃。 如果是這樣的話，倒不如取消現時有名無實的職業足球，變為原來的業餘聯賽，政府幾年後不再撥款撥地加建足球場，怎至乎可將原有他們認為多出的球場改變為發展地產項目用地，將香港成為一個只有炒買地産，金融而沒有發展體育及文化的特區 - 還是，事實根本一直都是這樣，只是我們一班人對香港足球未來的癡心妄想？ 展开Steven Lo 分享了梁芷珊Canny Leung 的照片 · 2015年9月30日 · 林匡正寫飛馬的評論文章，寫得深入細緻，值得分享！梁芷珊Canny Leung · 2015年9月30日 · 我們有個香港飛馬工作小組群組，班主、行政人員，和特別顧問都在群組內。 24/7 群組傾公事，現在是，無可避免吧！ 昨晚，P說：「呢條友好有可疑！」然後send了一條link。 各人即刻問：「有咩可疑？發生咩事？」 J 說：「佢評飛馬，評得好中肯，好識波咁喎．．．」... P 說：「J，你唔好扮野，條友咪係你囉！係咪你寫架？」 下刪幾百字無聊廢話．．． 喺呢個時間，我睇左全文，都好長吓，亦覺得好值得分享。 返到去群組，P J 已經起左作者個底，仲搵左好多作者其他關於港足的文章分享。。。 作者係林匡正，多謝你的文章。 喜歡港足和飛馬的朋友，花幾分鐘，看看這篇文章：「港超巡禮－香港飛馬」 http://news.memehk.com/posts/10915 又順帶一提，經過3週比賽，飛馬暫時領先港超榜首嘞 : ) #hkpegasus #hkpfc #hkfootball 展开Steven Lo · 2015年9月11日 · 明天又是新一屆香港超級聯賽的開鑼日，各隊都磨拳擦掌，有些隊伍目標是爭取聯賽冠軍及各項錦標，有些隊伍目標是希望取得聯賽頭三名，及以黑馬姿態奪取盃賽錦標，亦有些隊伍則只希望保留下屆超聯賽地位．．． 最近香港隊嘅出色拼搏表現，各大傳媒的大肆報導，再度燃起了香港人對香港足球的狂熱，我亦希望大家繼續關注及支持本地足球，讓這團火不會熄滅！ 要繼續維持這團火，相信足總，各球會人仕都要同心拹力，排除私心私利，團結起來一起努力，將香港足球再次推上高峰。  今日飛馬拜神儀式，我去了支持。... 職球員眼中那團火，我絶對看得到，祝願飛馬今季踢出自己的風格，要有活力和拼盡，爭取最佳成績！ 展开Steven Lo · 2015年9月8日 · 雖然香港隊從來未贏或和過卡塔爾， 但係，歷史就是過去， 數據就係用來被打破的！ 比賽始終係要打過先知！ 誓不低頭，我們一起為香港隊打氣。更多

Tubing is available from thousands of stock mandrels eliminating costly tooling charges. We offer everything from .049" round ID micro miniature sizes up to 13" plus ID. Square and rectangular offerings start at .020" X .079" ID and go up to 8" square in size.
In addition to tubing we have custom molding facilities as well. Match metal dies and custom steel rule trim dies produce a variety of motor winding end turn insulators and caps.
Stevens Products has developed a custom line of printed circuit board manufacturing aides. Our “gold finger gloves” cover gold contacts can eliminate use of costly Kapton tape. PCB stiffeners clip on board edges and incorporate our proprietary fiberglass epoxy pultruded rod. The rod has 150,000 PSI flexural strength and prevents board twist and warp through wave solder, re-flow and other processes. PCB board “carriers” clip on board edges to facilitate leveling and conveyor belt contact issues. An infinite array of “connector covers” can be fabricated to fit specific needs from our vast open stock tooling.
