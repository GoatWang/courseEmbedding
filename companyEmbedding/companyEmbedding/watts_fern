           What's New - Discover new Products at DBI Office            Skip to content     Search for DBI products    NeoCon 2017NeoCon is the annual commercial design conference held in The Mart in Chicago. This year showcased the most current design solutions that industry professionals will utilize when creating spaces tailored for the end-user. The nearly one-million square feet of showroom space was taken over by all the major furniture manufacturers, including some of our top lines; Haworth, OFS Brands, and HON. In the product displayed, we saw a consistency of innovative design, vibrant palettes, integrated technology, ergonomic solutions, and much more. As people become more cognizant of the functions of a space, traditional drywall walls are coming down, moveable partitions are going up and workstations are providing for a multitude of work styles. Collaboration areas are being created so conversations happen spontaneously throughout the office landscape. The main trend across all the displays was the continuing shift toward residential-style furniture in the workplace, with meeting spaces continuing to be more relaxed and informal. Most importantly, this year’s show was a great reminder that there is no shortage of furniture solutions to accommodate every possible work style, aesthetic preference, and organizational goal.  AMPLIFIED SOUND10 Watts Peak/5 Watts RMS power from the 2.25 inch driver design amplifies your device’s audio in any room. Small speaker; big sound.Contact Us for more information3 Displays, One Simple ConnectionThe M/Connect USB 3.0, dual-video docking station is a unique innovation that merges ergonomics and technology.

Extraordinary transparency in the midrange
Full bass extension
Superior imaging
Attractive reclaimed heart pine timber cabinet

Dimensions:
43"H x 9"W x 11.5"D


Materials:
Heart pine, driver components, cast iron terminal plate


Design Options:
We believe in the use of first order cross-over networks in our speaker design due to their phase accuracy and allowance of maximum efficiency. Impedance correction circuits have been added to both the woofer and tweeter sections of the network that dampen resonant frequencies and impedance anomalies. Careful experimentation has allowed us to find the “sweet spot” in each driver, maximizing midrange accuracy, power handling, and off-axis response curves.
The Scan-Speak 8” driver that we utilize is a small miracle due to its ability to play quite deep in the bass region yet still play very accurate mid-range, allowing for a seamless integration to a 1” tweeter. Boasting a cast-aluminum frame, fiberglass composite core and rubber surround, all at an astonishingly high efficiency for a high-end 8” woofer. 
The Seas aluminum dome tweeter we have chosen is unique in that it does not use ferro-fluid to cool and dampen the tweeter. We feel very strongly that the use of ferro-fluid ruins the micro dynamics of a tweeter. The magnesium/aluminum composite, its Sonomax surround and rear chamber for lower resonance allow for a very accurate driver that is very conducive to a 8”, 2-way design.
The system as a whole has unusually deep bass response for an 8” two-way design. The QB3 vented alignment offers maximum bass extension and efficiency. Driver selection and network design allow us to present a very coherent mid-range, due to the woofer playing accurately in the upper mid-range frequencies and the tweeter playing accurately in the lower frequencies.


Specifications:
Overall Impedance: 4 ohms
Overall Efficiency: 90.5 db 1w/1m
Maximum Power Rating: 200 watts
Nominal Power Rating: 150 watts
Frequency response: 35-20k hz (+/- 3 db).

While no office is complete without competent professionals to run it, those professionals' lives are made much easier with the addition of cutting-edge office technology. Walmart's selection of office technology products includes essentials that small businesses and large enterprises alike can use to make day-to-day tasks easier, improve technology setups and make processes more modern for clients. Whether you're a sole practitioner working out of your home or the manager of a large firm with hundreds of team members, our Every Day Low Prices make your office operations easier to maintain and manage.How to choose the right office technology for your needsThere are several different categories and types of equipment in this section, and some businesses may need some of these products more than others. if you aren't quite sure what office technology items might be best for your needs, consider these factors.Financial transactions and cash securityHow do your customers and clients pay you? If you're in a retail or restaurant setting, chances are that you need some sort of point of sale technology, such as a cash register or mobile card scanner plugin, to make these transactions possible. Our collection of cash registers, safes and lockboxes makes accepting credit cards and cash much easier and safer than it would be without the use of modern technology. We offer popular mobile solutions, such as wireless card readers in addition to traditional cash registers, so you can select the format that's right for how you do business. If you tend to move around to different venues, a mobile card reader may be a better choice for you, while businesses that have static locations may prefer a cash register. If you want to accept cash without a register or keep petty cash on hand in the office without worrying about theft, a safe or lockbox is a helpful solution. You can also keep business credit cards, checkbooks and other valuables in your safe or lockbox for added convenience.Computer-free calculation and typingWhile many professionals rely on laptop or desktop computers to perform their business tasks, graphing calculators and typewriters still have their place in the modern office. Whether it's force of habit or you're trying to minimize distractions, a standalone calculator or typewriter can give you the tech solution you need. Calculators and typewriters are an especially good idea if digital eye strain or distraction is an issue for you or any of your employees. You'll be able to complete work that needs to get done without interfacing with a computer screen.Information securityWhile cybersecurity is a major concern, it's still important to take proper security precautions with printed documents, too. From confidential employee information, such as social security numbers, contact information, salary data and health info, to the details of client cases and contracts, it's important to properly dispose of paper documents that contain sensitive or private information. Walmart's Office Technology department includes a variety of different paper shredders that you can choose from to suit your office's document security needs. If you shred a large volume of documents with great frequency, choose one of our commercial-grade or high-capacity models that can handle 300 sheets or more in one pass. If you shred documents less frequently, you can opt for a smaller-capacity model with a maximum sheet allowance of 5 20.Scanning and printingThe ability to digitize and create physical documents can be essential for businesses that continue to rely on paper contracts and other physical documentation. Our Office Technology offerings include scanners and printers both as standalone and all-in-one tools. Even if you don't tend to have a need for document scanning, it's a good idea to purchase a multifunctional printer that includes both copying and scanning features. It's the sort of equipment you'll be glad to have when you need it, and many all-in-one printers are quite affordable, meaning you won't have to spend a lot more to have these useful features included in your purchase. Choose from inkjet, laser and photo printers based on your needs. If you tend to print large volumes of black-and-white documents, choose a laser printer. If you tend to print documents with color text and graphics, an inkjet model is your best option. If photo-quality printing is a requirement for your business, a commercial-grade photo printer may be a worthwhile investment.Presentation equipmentPresentations are often a major element in business success, particularly for companies that gain clients through visual proposals. Walmart's Office Technology product offerings in this category include a range of different modern presentation solutions for businesses that want to present the right face to prospective clients and industry peers. We have portable and pull-down projection screen equipment that you can choose from based on whether you tend to present at your office or your clients'. Portable projectors are also available if you need to be able to make presentations on the go. If your presentations include complex graphics or charts, you can also find laser pointers in this section that help you emphasize the right parts of your presentation slides. If your presentations tend to be less visual and more vocal, choose a collapsible tripod stand that can give you the foundation you need to present physical posters and other presentation materials.Show moreElectrode, Comp-115863632, DC-prod-dal2, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.15.0, SHA-06ca1a9068b558bd33bd1add57a0b13a52090f9f, CID-
