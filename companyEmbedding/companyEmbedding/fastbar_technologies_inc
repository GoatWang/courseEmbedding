The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Get your drinks quicker. Pay without cash. Never leave your credit card behind.



What is FastBar?

FastBar is a new, cashless payment system for events. It helps eliminate long bar lines by making payment quick, easy and secure.

Sign Up




How does it work?

When you arrive at an event, you get a wristband that's linked to your credit card. At the bar, you pay by tapping your wristband on a reader. At the end of the night we automatically close you out with the credit card on file, and send you an email receipt. It’s kind of like Uber, but for an event bar.

Step 1: Register

You can either register online or at the event. If you register online, it makes the process of picking up your wristband at the event a little quicker, and ensures we can send you an email receipt after the event.

Step 2: Pick up Your Wristband

At the event, collect your wristband. Your wristband will be linked to your credit card.

Step 3: Pay With Your Wristband

At the bar, you’ll pay by tapping your wristband on a reader. Payments take less than a second. It’s super quick and easy.

Step 4: Automatic Closeout
At the end of the night, we automatically close you out with the credit card on file and send you an email receipt detailing your purchases. Depending on your event, gratuity may be automatically added to the bill to make sure your bartender is taken care of. Contact your event organiser for more info on gratuity.
FAQs
What about security?
FastBar is more secure than using cash or credit card.

If you lose cash, it's gone forever. If you lose your credit card, you're now spending hours of your time cancelling your card, getting a new one and re-linking it to all of the websites you use and automatic bills you have linked to it.

Your FastBar wristband won't fall off but if you did lose it, just go back to the registration station at the event, we’ll cancel the old one and give you a new one.
Does my FastBar wristband have my credit card or any personal information on it?
No. Your wristband never contains any personal information.
Can my wristband be used to pay for stuff at other places?
No. Your wristband is locked so that it only works at a specific event location and only works during the event. After the event, it can no longer be used.
Are my credit card details safe?
Yes. Your credit card details are never stored on FastBar's servers. Rather, we use a secure, PCI compliant payment processor trusted by millions of customers around the world. The same SSL encryption technology used by banks is used to protect your information.
How much does it cost?
FastBar is free for you, the attendee.
