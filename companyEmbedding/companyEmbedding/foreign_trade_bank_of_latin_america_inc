	BLADEX’S SECOND QUARTER 2016 NET
	PROFIT TOTALED $22.3 MILLION, OR $0.57 PER SHARE, A 65% INCREASE YoY AND 5% DECREASE QoQ. HALF-YEAR 2016 NET BUSINESS PROFIT REACHED
	$50.2 MILLION (+15% YoY), OR $1.28 PER SHARE, ON HIGHER TOTAL INCOME, CREDIT PROVISIONS AND IMPROVED EFFICIENCY




	 




	PANAMA CITY, REPUBLIC OF PANAMA, July
	26, 2016

	– Banco Latinoamericano de Comercio Exterior, S.A. (NYSE: BLX, “Bladex”, or “the Bank”),
	a Panama-based multinational bank originally established by the central banks of 23 Latin-American and Caribbean countries to promote
	foreign trade and economic integration in the Region, today announced its results for the second quarter (“2Q16”) and
	half-year (“1H16” or “6M16”) ended June 30, 2016.


	 


	The consolidated financial information
	in this document has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued
	by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”). Financial data as of June 30, 2015 (“2Q15” and
	“1H15” or “6M15”) has also been prepared in accordance with IFRS to allow year-on-year comparisons.


	 



	2Q16 and 1H16 Highlights




	 




	Reported results:








	·




	Bladex’s 2Q16 Net Profit totaled
	$22.3 million (+65% YoY, -5% QoQ) on robust net interest income (+10% YoY, -3% QoQ), increased fees and other income (+43% YoY,
	+87% QoQ), and improved efficiency through lower operating expenses (-21% YoY, -19% QoQ), offsetting higher provisions for impairment
	from allowance for credit losses. In the 2Q16, the Bank’s results also benefited from the divestment of its remaining participation
	in the investment funds effective April 1

	st

	, 2016, with a residual gain of $0.2 million recorded for the quarter, compared
	to losses from its participation in the investment funds recorded during the comparison quarters.










	·




	The Bank’s 1H16 Net Profit totaled
	$45.7 million (+5% YoY), as Business Profit of $50.2 million improved (+15% YoY) mainly from higher net interest income (+10% YoY),
	increased fees and other income (+26%), and lower operating expenses (-13% YoY), compensating non-core losses from the participation
	in investments funds of $4.4 million, and higher provisions for impairment from allowance for credit losses of $13.3 million.










	·




	2Q16 and 1H16 net interest income reached
	$38.2 million (+10% YoY, -3% QoQ) and $77.7 million (+10% YoY), respectively, on higher Net Interest Margin (“NIM”)
	of 2.06% for both 2Q16 and 1H16 (+27 bps YoY, unchanged QoQ for 2Q16; +24 bps YoY for 1H16), mainly reflecting higher lending spreads
	and increased market rates, which more than offset the effects of lower average lending balances (-3% YoY, -2% QoQ).










	·




	Fees and other income totaled $5.3 million
	in the 2Q16 (+43% YoY, +87% QoQ), as five transactions in the loan structuring and syndication business were completed during 2Q16.
	Year-to-date 2016, fees and other income reached $8.1 million (+26% YoY).





	 






	 





	 




	 



	Key performance metrics:








	·




	The Bank’s 1H16 Business and Total
	Annualized Return on Average Equity (“ROAE”) reached 10.3% and 9.4%, respectively, compared to Business and Total ROAE
	of 9.4% in 1H15. 2Q16 Business and Total annualized ROAE reached 9.0% and 9.1%, respectively.










	·




	The Bank’s 1H16 Business Efficiency
	Ratio and Total Efficiency Ratio improved to 26% (-7 pts. YoY) and 28% (-5 pts. YoY), respectively, on higher total income (+4%
	YoY) and lower operating expenses (-13% YoY), mainly reflecting decreased performance-related compensation expense. 2Q16 Business
	Efficiency and Total Efficiency Ratios improved to 22% (-11 pts. YoY, -8 pts. QoQ), and 23% (-12 pts. YoY, -10 pts. QoQ), respectively.










	·




	The Bank maintained solid capitalization
	with a 15.6% Tier 1 Basel III ratio as of June 30, 2016, together with high levels of liquidity, in response to heightened market
	volatility.






	Commercial Portfolio & Quality:








	·




	As of June 30, 2016, end-of-period Commercial
	Portfolio balances stood at $6.8 billion (-2% QoQ, -9% YoY), while 2Q16 and 1H16 average balances were $6.7 billion (-3% QoQ; -4%
	YoY), and $6.9 billion (-3% YoY), respectively, while net lending margins remained relatively stable QoQ and trended upward YoY.
	The Bank continues to rebalance its credit exposure profile, emphasizing short-term trade finance exposures, along with reducing
	certain country, industry and client risk concentrations.










	·




	The ratio of total allowance for credit
	losses to total Commercial Portfolio ending balances increased to 1.60% (+20 bps QoQ, +30 bps YoY) mainly to account for expected
	credit losses regarding certain exposures undergoing restructuring efforts, and in one isolated case, undergoing recovery efforts.
	Consequently, non-performing loans (“NPL”) increased to 1.30% of the total Loan Portfolio as of June 30, 2016, compared
	to 0.43% a quarter ago and 0.30% a year ago.

	CEO's Comments



	 


	Mr. Rubens V. Amaral Jr., Bladex’s
	Chief Executive Officer, stated the following regarding the Bank’s 2Q16 results: “Core operating trends were reasonably
	strong during the second quarter in a business environment that continues to be challenging. Average quarterly portfolio balances
	declined on lower off-balance sheet portfolio balances, with strong loan disbursement growth offset by prepayments, but lending
	margins remained at robust levels, reinforcing the Bank’s earnings generation capacity. Top line revenues, aided by solid
	fee income growth were higher both on a quarter-on-quarter and year-to-date basis. Our origination is well diversified across the
	Region, and the short duration of our exposures allows the Bank to proactively adjust the portfolio mix according to the prevailing
	market conditions. This quarter saw us continuing to shrink the exposure profile in Brazil, not just in relative, but also in absolute
	terms as the recessionary trend continues in that country, while partially compensating with growth in other parts of the Region.
	We also increased our efforts to steer origination towards short-term trade exposures, which represent higher quality risk, albeit
	at lower margins. We are convinced this emphasis is conducive to asset growth during the remainder of the year and accelerates
	our focus on ensuring better overall returns, deploying our capital more efficiently.


	 







	3

	 





	 




	 


	As we continue to face disparate growth
	patterns and overall higher levels of volatility in the markets, it is not surprising to see an increase in liability restructuring
	negotiations and work-out arrangements sought by debtors over the last few quarters, and we are working diligently to mitigate
	the impact from these adverse market conditions in certain countries and industry sectors for these clients. While the number and
	amount of these exposures remain relatively small in relation to the overall portfolio, we do take them very seriously nonetheless,
	as the size, nature and relative importance of these debtors in their respective market segments require close coordination with
	multiple creditors. On the backdrop of strong core business performance for the year so far, we have strengthened reserves significantly
	this quarter to reflect the more advanced stages of delinquency in these few cases due to complex, and thus protracted negotiations
	with the debtors. We believe the reserve levels accurately reflect the expected outcomes of ongoing restructuring and recovery
	efforts, but stand ready to adjust these levels should expectations be revised upwards or downwards as efforts progress. Meanwhile,
	the work-out arrangements concluded in prior quarters continue to perform even better as anticipated, as underlying commodity prices
	stabilized in hard-hit sectors such as Oil & Gas and Sugar.


	 


	While commission income from the letters
	of credit business remained stable, albeit below historical levels this quarter, on account of limited demand from importers in
	the Southern Cone and Andean regions, the pick-up of fee income in our structuring and syndication business did materialize as
	previously anticipated, with a number of successfully concluded transactions, to which we have already added another completed
	transaction early in the third quarter. The pipeline of mandated structured transactions continues to look strong, and we maintain
	our positive outlook for the remainder of the year for this line of business.


	 


	Bladex has reached a scale in business
	operations and efficiency that allows the Bank to absorb the effects of a challenging business environment while still maintaining
	profitability and returns. Additionally, the exit from the participation in investment funds early in this quarter has removed
	a significant element of market risk volatility, allowing us to squarely focus on what we know best – credit risk. Our diversified
	portfolio approach not only allows us to mitigate the impacts of current market conditions, but also to take advantage of them,
	and we are determined to keep the course in the coming quarters.” Mr. Amaral concluded.


	 



	RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT



	The Bank’s activities are managed
	and executed in two business segments, Commercial and Treasury. The business segment results are determined based on the Bank’s
	managerial accounting process as defined by IFRS 8 – Operating Segments, which assigns consolidated statement of financial
	positions, revenue and expense items to each business segment on a systemic basis.

	COMMERCIAL BUSINESS SEGMENT



	The Commercial Business Segment encompasses
	the Bank’s core business of financial intermediation and fee generation activities relating to the Commercial Portfolio’s
	activities. These activities include the origination of bilateral and syndicated credits, short-term and medium-term loans, customers’
	liabilities under acceptances, and off-balance sheet instruments. Profits from the Commercial Business Segment include (i) net
	interest income from loans; (ii) fees and other income from the issuance, confirmation and negotiation of letters of credit, guarantees
	and loan commitments, and through loan structuring and syndication activities; (iii) gain on sale of loans generated by other loan
	intermediation activities, such as sales in the secondary market and distribution in the primary market; (iv) impairment loss (gain)
	from expected credit losses on loans at amortized cost and off-balance sheet instruments; and (v) allocated operating expenses.


	 


	The Commercial Portfolio includes gross
	loans at amortized cost, customers’ liabilities under acceptances, off-balance sheet instruments such as confirmed and stand-by
	letters of credit, credit commitments, and guarantees covering commercial risk, and an equity investment.


	 


	As of June 30, 2016, the Commercial Portfolio
	balances stood at $6.8 billion, 2% lower compared to $6.9 billion a quarter ago and 9% lower versus $7.4 billion a year ago, as
	off-balance sheet portfolio balances decreased, and increased loan disbursements were largely offset by prepayments during the
	quarter, while net lending margins remained at robust levels, supporting income generation. The Bank accelerated its emphasis on
	origination of short-term trade finance exposures, together with reducing certain country, industry and client risk concentrations.
	On an average basis, Commercial Portfolio balances reached $6.9 billion in the first 6M16, down 3% compared to the $7.1 billion
	during the same period 2015, while 2Q16 average balance was $6.7 billion, down 3% from the previous quarter and 4% from the 2Q15.

	The Commercial Portfolio continued to be
	short-term and trade-related in nature. As of June 30, 2016, $5.0 billion, or 74%, of the Commercial Portfolio were scheduled to
	mature within one year. Trade finance operations represented 59% of the portfolio, while the remaining balance consisted primarily
	of lending to financial institutions and corporations engaged in foreign trade, generating hard currency.

	2Q16 vs. 1Q16



	The Commercial Business Segment’s
	Profit for the 2Q16 totaled $20.4 million, as the positive effects of (i) a $1.2 million, or 3%, increase in total income driven
	by the $2.1 million, or 76%, increase in net other income mainly from the completion of five transactions in the loan structuring
	and syndication business, and (ii) the $2.3 million, or 24%, decrease in allocated operating expenses as a result of lower performance-based
	compensation expense, were offset by (iii) higher provisions for impairment from expected credit losses in the Commercial Portfolio
	of $11.5 million compared to $1.2 million in the previous quarter, mainly to account for expected lifetime credit losses regarding
	certain credit exposures undergoing restructuring efforts.


	 



	2Q16 vs. 2Q15



	The Segment’s quarterly Profit of
	$20.4 million represented a $4.7 million, or 30%, increase compared to $15.7 million in the 2Q15, as a result of: (i) a $5.5 million,
	or 16%, increase in total income driven by higher net interest income (+$4.1 million, or 14%) mainly from increased net lending
	margins offsetting lower average lending balances (-3%), and increased net other income (+$1.4 million, or 38%) from higher loan
	structuring and syndication fees, (ii) a $2.6 million, or 26%, decrease in operating expenses mainly due to lower performance-based
	compensation expense; partially offset by (iii) a $3.3 million, or 41%, increase in provisions for impairment from expected credit
	losses associated with the Bank’s Commercial Portfolio.

	6M16 totaled $47.6 million, a $8.7 million, or 22%, increase attributable to: (i) a $9.8 million, or 14%, increase in total income
	driven by higher net interest income (+$8.3 million, or 14%) reflecting higher net lending margins, which more than offset the
	effects of lower average lending balances (-3%), and increased net other income (+$1.5 million, or 24%) from higher loan structuring
	and syndication fees, (ii) a $3.4 million, or 17%, decrease in business allocated operating expenses mainly from lower performance-based
	compensation expense and professional services, as the Bank continues to focus on improving efficiencies; partially offset by (iii)
	a $4.5 million, or 54%, increase in provisions for impairment from expected credit losses associated with the Bank’s Commercial
	Portfolio.

	TREASURY BUSINESS SEGMENT



	The Treasury Business Segment is responsible
	for the Bank’s funding and liquidity management, along with the management of its activities in investment securities, as
	well as the management of the Bank’s interest rate, liquidity, price and currency risks. Interest-earning assets managed
	by the Treasury Business Segment include liquidity positions in cash and cash equivalents, and financial instruments related to
	the investment management activities, consisting of financial instruments at fair value through Accumulated Other Comprehensive
	Income (Loss) account (“OCI”) and securities at amortized cost. The Treasury Business Segment also incorporated the
	Bank’s net results from its participation in investment funds, which were shown in the other income line item “gain
	(loss) per financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss – investment funds”. The Bank’s commitment
	to remain as an investor in the investment funds expired on April 1

	st

	, 2016, date on which the Bank proceeded to redeem
	its entire remaining participation in the funds. The Treasury Business Segment also manages the Bank’s interest-bearing liabilities
	which constitute its funding sources, namely: liability deposits, securities sold under repurchase agreement, and short- and long-term
	borrowings and debt.


	 


	Profits from the Treasury Business Segment
	include net interest income derived from the above mentioned treasury assets and liabilities, as well as related net other income,
	including net results from derivative financial instruments and foreign currency exchange, gain (loss) per financial instruments
	at fair value through profit or loss, gain (loss) per financial instruments at fair value through OCI (“FVTOCI”), impairment
	loss from expected credit losses on investment securities, other income and allocated operating expenses.


	 


	The Bank’s liquid assets totaled
	$0.9 billion as of June 30, 2016, compared to $0.7 billion as of March 31, 2016, and $1.0 billion as of June 30, 2015, in response
	to heightened market volatility. As of these dates, the liquid assets to total assets ratio was 11.9%, 9.7%, and 11.6%, respectively,
	while the liquid assets to total deposits ratio was 28.3%, 24.2%, and 29.6%, respectively.


	 


	As of June 30, 2016, the portfolio of securities
	at FVTOCI totaled $75 million, compared to $174 million as of March 31, 2016, and $286 million as of June 30, 2015, as the Bank
	reduced its holdings in that category. The portfolio of securities at amortized cost stood at $104 million as of June 30, 2016,
	compared to $108 million as of March 31, 2016 and $63 million as of June 30, 2015. As of June 30, 2016, both securities portfolios
	consisted of readily-quoted Latin American securities, 76% of which represented multilateral, sovereign, or state-owned risk (refer
	to Exhibit XI for a per-country risk distribution of the Treasury portfolio).


	 


	Deposit balances stood at $3.2 billion
	as of June 30, 2016, representing 48% of total liabilities, compared to $3.1 billion, or 46% of total liabilities as of March 31,
	2016, and $3.2 billion, or 44% of total liabilities a year ago. The strong levels of deposits (+4% quarter-on-quarter, -1% year-on-year)
	allowed selective utilization of short-term bilateral sources of funding, which as of June 30, 2016, decreased 20% quarter-on-quarter
	and 46% year-on-year to reach $1.3 billion in short-term borrowings and debt, including Repos. Long-term borrowings and debt totaled
	$2.0 billion as of June 30, 2016, up 10% quarter-on-quarter and 29% from a year ago, as the Bank increased its stable base of longer-term
	funding through capital markets issuances, loan syndications and bilateral transactions. As a net result of increased market rates
	and stable average funding spreads, year-to-date weighted average funding cost increased 28 bps to reach 1.33% in the 1H16, while
	quarterly weighted average funding cost increased 9 bps quarter-on-quarter and 33 bps year-on-year to reach 1.38% in the 2Q16.

	2Q16 vs. 1Q16



	The Treasury Business Segment reported
	a Profit for the 2Q16 of $1.9 million compared to a Loss for the 1Q16 of $3.8 million, primarily attributable to the Bank’s
	former participation in the investment funds which was terminated on April 1st, 2016, with a residual gain of $0.2 million recorded
	in the 2Q16, compared to a $4.6 million loss from its former participation in the investment funds in the 1Q16, along with improved
	results from foreign currency exchange and financial instruments at FVTOCI.


	 



	2Q16 vs. 2Q15



	The Segment’s $1.9 million Profit
	for the 2Q16, compared to a $2.2 million Loss for the 2Q15, was mainly the result of the swing in trading results from the Bank’s
	former participation in the investment funds, along with lower provisions for impairment from expected credit losses on investment
	securities during the 2Q16.


	 



	6M16 vs. 6M15



	The Segment’s year-to-date 2016 Loss
	for the period of $1.9 million versus the $4.5 million Profit for the 1H15, was primarily driven by the swing in trading results
	from the Bank’s former participation in the investment funds, as well as losses from its derivative hedging positions and
	lower interest income from its investment securities portfolio during the 2Q16, as the Bank reduced its average portfolio balances
	by 34% YoY.

	2Q16 vs. 1Q16



	The Bank’s 2Q16 net interest income
	reached $38.2 million, a 3% decrease quarter-on-quarter, due to the net effect of lower average interest earning assets (-3%),
	mostly from lower average loan and investment securities balances, and decreased interest-bearing liabilities, while NIM remained
	stable at 2.06%.


	 



	2Q16 vs. 2Q15



	Quarterly net interest income of $38.2
	million increased 10% year-on-year, mostly due to higher NIM (+27pbs) reflecting higher net lending spreads and increased market
	rates, more than offsetting the effects of lower average interest-earning asset balances, mostly from lower average lending portfolio
	balances (-3%).


	 



	6M16 vs. 6M15



	The Bank’s year-to-date 2016 net
	interest income reached $77.7 million, a 10% year-on-year increase, mainly driven by higher NIM (+24 bps) reflecting higher net
	lending spreads and increased market rates, which more than offset lower average interest-earning asset balances, mostly from average
	loan portfolio balances (-3%).

	as fee income derived from loan structuring and syndication, as well as loan intermediation and distribution activities.

	Quarterly Variation



	Fees and other income totaled $5.3 million
	in the 2Q16, compared to $2.8 million in the 1Q16, and $3.7 million in the 2Q15. The $2.5 million, or 87% quarter-on-quarter increase
	was mostly driven by higher fee income in the structuring and distribution business from the completion of five transactions in
	the 2Q16, and higher net gains on sale of loans and other income. The $1.6 million, or 43%, year-on-year increase was the result
	of higher fees in the structuring and distribution business, along with higher other income, which more than offset lower commissions
	from the letters of credit and off-balance sheet business.


	 



	6M16 vs. 6M15



	The Banks’ year-to-date 2016 fees
	and other income totaled $8.1 million, a $1.7 million, or 26%, year-on-year increase, as higher fees in the structuring and distribution
	business and other income, more than offset lower commissions from the letters of credit and off-balance sheet business mainly
	due to limited demand from importers in the Southern Cone and Andean regions.

	The allowance for credit losses on loan

	June 30, 2015. The $10.0 million provision for impairment loss from credit losses on loans mainly reflects the adjustments to account
	for expected lifetime credit losses regarding certain exposures undergoing restructuring and recovery efforts. Consequently, NPL
	balances increased to $84.7 million, or 1.30% of total gross loan portfolio, as of June 30, 2016, from NPL of $28.0 million, or
	0.43%, from a quarter ago, and NPL of $20.7 million, or 0.30%, from a year ago.

	The coverage ratio of total allowance for
	credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet items to total Commercial Portfolio ending balances increased to 1.60% (+20 bps quarter-on-quarter,
	+30 bps year-on-year). The ratio of the total allowance for expected credit losses on loans and off-balance sheet items to NPLs
	was 1.3 times, versus 3.4 times, and 4.7 times, respectively.

	Quarterly Variation



	Operating expenses decreased 19% quarter-on-quarter
	and 21% year-on-year to reach $10.1 million in the 2Q16 mainly attributable to lower performance-based variable compensation expense.


	 


	The Bank’s Efficiency Ratio and Business
	Efficiency Ratio, which excludes non-core revenues and expenses, mainly from the former participation in investment funds, both
	improved to 23% and 22%, respectively, compared to 33% and 30% in 1Q16, and compared to 35% and 33% in the 2Q15, respectively,
	on higher total income and lower operating expenses. The ratio of operating expenses to average assets improved to 54 bps in the
	2Q16, compared to 64 bps and 65 bps in the comparative periods.


	 



	6M16 vs. 6M15



	During the first 6M16, operating expenses
	totaled $22.4 million, a 13% decrease year-on-year, mainly due to lower performance-based variable compensation and professional
	service expenses, as the Bank continues to focus on improving efficiencies.


	 


	The Bank’s year-to-date Efficiency
	Ratio and the Business Efficiency Ratio improved to 28% and 26%, respectively, compared to 33% from a year ago, as total income
	increased 4% and operating expenses decreased 13%. The Bank’s operating expenses to average assets ratio improved to 59 bps
	in the first 6M16, compared to 66 bps in the same period of 2015.

	director and an additional amount of $1,500 for each meeting of the Board and
	each stockholders meeting attended, and $1,000 for each Board Committee meeting
	attended. The Chairman of the Board is eligible to receive an additional 50%
	of

	of

	2006
	Stock Option Plan





	 



	On
	December 12, 2006, the Board adopted the 2006 Stock Option Plan. The maximum
	aggregate number of shares, which may be issued under the 2006 Stock Option
	Plan, is two million Class E common shares. On an annual basis, the 2006 Stock
	Option Plan allows directors to receive stock options for an equivalent amount
	of $10,000, and for the Chairman of the Board, an equivalent amount to $15,000.
	The Board, with the recommendation and advice of the Nomination and Compensation
	Committee, may authorize the grant of options to any one or more key employees
	of the Bank, as well as determine or impose conditions upon the grant or
	exercise of stock options under the Plan.



	 



	The
	stock
	options expire seven years after the date of grant and, except as otherwise
	provided in the award agreement, shall be exercisable beginning on the fourth
	anniversary of the date of grant. However, in no event will the exercise price
	of a stock option be less than 100% the fair market value per share subject
	to
	the stock option on the date the stock option was granted.



	 



	At
	December 31, 2006 no grants had been made under this plan. On February 13,
	2007,
	the Board granted 20,131 stock options to non-employee directors and 188,634
	stock options to key employees, representing a compensation cost of $94,976
	and
	$889,956, respectively. This cost will be charged to income over a period of
	four years.

	The

	has decided not to constitute a corporate governance committee. Given the
	importance that corporate governance has for the Bank, the Board decided to
	address all matters related to corporate governance at the Board level. The
	Audit and Compliance Committee is responsible for promoting continued
	improvement in the Bank’s corporate governance and to verify compliance with all
	applicable policies.



	 



	The
	Bank
	has included the information regarding its corporate governance practices
	necessary to comply with Section 303A of the New York Stock Exchange's
	Listed Company Manual/Corporate Governance Rules on its website
	(www.blx.com/Investors Center/ Corporate Governance). Additionally, the Bank’s
	website (under “Corporate Governance”) provides a summary of the significant
	differences between corporate governance practices commonly used by the Bank
	and
	other public companies in Panama and the NYSE Standards for U.S. domestic
	companies.

	The
	Board
	has determined that all members of the Audit and Compliance Committee are
	independent directors, as defined by applicable laws and regulations, including
	rules promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the
	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Section 303A of the rules of the New York Stock
	Exchange, and Agreement No. 04-2001 of the Superintendency of Banks of the
	Republic of Panama. In addition, at least one of the members of the Committee
	is
	a “financial expert,” as defined in the rules enacted by the U.S. Securities and
	Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.



	 



	The
	Audit
	and Compliance Committee meets at least six times a year, as required by the
	Superintendency of Banks of Panama, or more often if the circumstances so
	require. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, the Audit and
	Compliance met ten times. The Audit and Compliance Committee pre-approved all
	audit and non-audit services.



	 



	The
	Audit
	and Compliance Committee reviewed and recommended to the Board that the audited
	consolidated financial statements of the Bank for the year ended
	December 31, 2006 be included in the Bank’s Annual Report.



	 



	The
	purpose of the Audit and Compliance Committee is to provide assistance to the
	Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities regarding the processing
	of
	the Bank’s financial information, the integrity of the Bank’s financial
	statements, the Bank’s system of internal controls over financial reporting, the
	process of internal and external audit, the Bank’s corporate governance,
	compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the Bank’s ethics
	code.



	 



	The
	Audit
	and Compliance Committee, in its capacity as a Committee of the Board, is
	directly responsible to make recommendations to the Board regarding the
	appointment of the Bank’s independent auditors. The Audit and Compliance
	Committee recommended to the Board to replace KPMG as its current external
	independent auditors, and also recommended the appointment of Deloitte as the
	Bank’s new external independent auditors for the fiscal year ending
	December 31, 2007. This committee is also responsible for the compensation
	and oversight of the Bank’s independent auditors, including the resolution of
	disagreements regarding financial reporting between the Bank’s management and
	such independent auditors. The Bank’s independent auditors are required to
	report directly to the Audit and Compliance Committee.



	 



	The
	Charter of the Audit and Compliance Committee requires an annual self-evaluation
	of the Committee’s performance. See Item “Audit and Compliance Committee
	Financial Expert and Principal Accountant Fees and Services”.

	and
