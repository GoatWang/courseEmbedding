Launches & FundraisingMandates











Ultimus Fund Solutions has been selected to launch and service the Peachtree Alternative Strategies Fund, a non-exchange traded closed-end fund.
The fund, which originally started as a private fund of hedge funds, converted to a registered 1940 Act investment company, allowing opportunities for additional investors to achieve hedge fund exposure.
 
Ultimus will provide the fund with the operational capabilities and a full suite of fund services necessary to support the fund’s complex structure, including fund administration and accounting, fund compliance, and transfer agency.
 
“Non-exchange traded, closed-end, tender offer funds require certain operational knowledge plus high-touch servicing,” says Bob Dorsey (pictured), CEO and managing director of Ultimus. “With our experience in this space, we have the service model in place and the administrative expertise for these products. We’re pleased to be working with the professionals at Peachtree and look forward to helping them grow their business.”

      Strategies Fund, a Non-Exchange Traded Closed-End Fund




Fund Leverages Ultimus’ Expertise and Services






March 21, 2017 09:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ultimus 
      Fund Solutions,® LLC (Ultimus®), one of the 
      largest independent providers of mutual fund services to the financial 
      industry, today announced that it has been selected to launch and 
      service the Peachtree Alternative Strategies Fund (Fund), a non-exchange 
      traded closed-end fund. The Fund, which originally started as a private 
      fund of hedge funds, converted to a registered 1940 Act investment 
      company, allowing opportunities for additional investors to achieve 
      hedge fund exposure.
    


      The deal is the latest example of Ultimus’ expertise in the alternative 
      investment space, as the convergence between private hedge funds and the 
      registered investment world continues. Ultimus will provide the Fund 
      with the operational capabilities and a full suite of fund services 
      necessary to support the Fund’s complex structure, including fund 
      administration and accounting, fund compliance, and transfer agency.
    

      The Fund selected Ultimus in an industry where not many fund service 
      providers can service this type of alternative product. Ultimus’ proven 
      fund operations and support for other non-exchange traded closed-end 
      fund (CEF) structures were identified as key factors in the decision.
    

      “Non-exchange traded, closed-end, tender offer funds require certain 
      operational knowledge plus high-touch servicing,” said Bob Dorsey, CEO 
      and Managing Director of Ultimus. “With our experience in this space, we 
      have the service model in place and the administrative expertise for 
      these products. We’re pleased to be working with the professionals at 
      Peachtree and look forward to helping them grow their business.”

Adding Diversification with Liquid Alternatives




For most investors, alternative investments bring to mind complex investment strategies available only to institutions and the ultra wealthy through private, illiquid partnerships that charge high fees. However, with the recent growth of liquid alternatives, many of these strategies are now available through mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs), and investor access to these once exclusive investment strategies is expanding.
Alternative investments comprise a multiplicity of asset classes and strategies. They are basically defined as any investment that falls outside the traditional asset classes of stocks, bonds and cash. The universe includes, but is not limited to: commodities, private real estate, managed futures, precious metals, private equity and numerous hedged strategies.
Liquid alternatives, unlike private offerings, do not require investor prequalification; have relatively low investment minimums; and provide portfolio improved transparency, daily liquidity and net asset value pricing. Performance of a liquid alternative fund, however, may vary from a private offering with a similar objective because of statutory limits on illiquidity, leverage, short sales and derivative securities.
The common thread uniting private and liquid alternatives is they both tend to generate returns that have low or negative correlation with traditional asset classes, and as a result, may be used as a tool to diversify portfolio risk and mitigate a significant decline in any one holding or investment type.1

Refining Asset Allocation


Equities have historically been the driver of long-term investment growth, but they are also the asset class with the greatest risk of loss. Suppose in 1990 you added a 20% allocation of diversified alternative asset classes and strategies to a conventional portfolio of 60% stocks, 35% bonds and 5% cash, resulting in a new portfolio of 45% stocks, 30% bonds, 5% cash and the balance in alternatives.2
By the end of 2014, the portfolio with alternatives would have earned a 7.7% average annual return, compared with 6.9% for the traditional portfolio; annual volatility for the portfolio with alternatives was 8.2% versus 9.5% for the traditional portfolio. The alternatives’ uncorrelated returns serve as a buffer, muting the overall severity of drawdowns and creating outcomes that were still equity-like but with a bit lower volatility.3
As we enter a period in which interest rates are forecast to rise, and equity and bond price are expected to be volatile, liquid alternatives may likely play a similar role in portfolio diversification for smaller investors. Here’s why:
Diversifying an equity portfolio with an allocation to bonds and cash is the conventional risk management tool for most investors. However, the end of a 30-year bull market for bonds in 2013—combined with an impending interest rate increase (interest rate normalization)— has raised questions about the viability of this long-held strategy.
In the view of Morgan Stanley Wealth Management’s Global Investment Committee, the process of interest rate normalization is likely to produce above-average volatility in both stocks and bonds. Against a backdrop of muted, subpar growth, investors will need to look at other methods in an effort to improve returns and reduce volatility. Liquid alternatives are a possible solution. 
Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor to see if your portfolio might benefit from an allocation to this emerging market segment.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
