NEW YORK, Feb. 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Sixpoint Partners, a leading global investment bank serving the middle market, today announced the successful closing of The Huron Fund V L.P. ("Fund" or "Fund V"), with $550 million of total limited partner capital commitments. The Fund, which is the sixth investment vehicle for Huron Capital Partners ("Huron"), closed at its hard cap and in excess of its $500 million target. Receiving commitments from a number of top-tier investors, including endowments, foundations, multi-manager funds, public pensions, corporate pensions and family offices, the Fund closed after just three months of marketing and was oversubscribed with over $1 billion of demand. 








Like its predecessor, The Huron Fund IV L.P., which also closed above its target at $500 million of capital commitments in 2013, Fund V will seek to utilize Huron's operationally-focused, buy-and-build approach to identify and acquire fundamentally-sound companies and build them into leaders. The Fund will seek control transactions in the lower middle market with valuations generally under $200 million and will focus on committing a total of $20 million to $70 million per transaction. The firm is led by its senior partners, Brian Demkowicz, Michael Beauregard, John Higgins and Peter Mogk. 
"We deeply value the tremendous confidence and broad support that our new and existing investors have placed with our experienced investment team and remain focused on delivering strong returns to our LP base," said Brian Demkowicz, Managing Partner at Huron. "We look forward to deploying our buy-and-build strategy in partnership with seasoned executives to improve and grow our businesses through strategic initiatives, operational improvements and add-on acquisitions."
"With over $1 billion of demand for Fund V, we believe Huron's 16-year track record drove robust demand from investors for its disciplined investment process and proven strategy," said Eric Zoller, Partner at Sixpoint Partners. "Huron is an excellent representative of Sixpoint's exceptional relationships in the lower middle market for our LPs." 
Larry Smith, Partner at Sixpoint Partners added, "Given Huron's long track record and focus on attractive opportunities within the lower middle market, we expect Huron's oversubscribed fund to generate strong returns, and we look forward to continuing our partnership."

Dental Services Deal Marks Huron’s Second in Dental Industry in Nine Months
August 5,  2013 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”), one of the nation’s leading middle market private equity firms, today announced the first in a series of planned investments in the dental services industry with an investment in Dynamic Dental Partners (“DDP”).  Based in Sarasota, Fla., DDP is a leading dental services organization (“DSO”) that provides operational support to a network of dental practices located in Florida, Arizona and Virginia.
“We are thrilled to be partnering with Huron Capital,” said Dr. Alex Giannini, DDP’s CEO.  “We see a significant opportunity to continue building DDP and are grateful to have a like-minded partner in Huron who can provide the capital and operational expertise necessary to help us do so. We anticipate making several more acquisitions to continue expanding our footprint and partnering with dentists to provide exceptional quality of care to as many patients as possible.”
Huron aligned with DDP’s management team to provide the investment necessary to bring together the current network of practices with capital reserved to fund future acquisitions. The transaction marks Huron’s second investment in the dental industry, having acquired a majority interest in short-term cosmetic orthodontics provider Six Month Smiles, Inc. in January 2013.  The dental market is a $119 billion industry and growing steadily according to IBISWorld.
“Huron identified the DSO market as an industry of focus nearly two years ago, and we have found an ideal platform on which to build in DDP,” commented Huron Partner Nick Barker.  “DDP has a deep and experienced management team with a long track record of successfully identifying and executing acquisitions in the dental market, and we are excited to be partnering with them to continue growing the business.”

Huron Adds to Team for Rollout of Fund IV
July 17,  2013 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”), one of the nation’s leading middle market private equity firms, today announced the growth of its team to source, close and manage investments. Huron has added four executives who will serve in business development, investment sourcing and execution roles to help deploy its recently-raised $500 million fund, The Huron Fund IV, LP.
Heather Madland, vice president of deal origination, will be responsible for Huron’s business development and investment sourcing activities. Madland brings 15 years of business development, marketing, sponsorship and relationship management experience to Huron. Most recently, she served as a director with SPP Capital Partners, a New York-based investment bank focused on raising debt and equity capital for middle market companies, where she was responsible for all West Coast operations and business development activities.
Mark Miller joins Huron’s transaction team as vice president and will be responsible for sourcing, analyzing, closing and managing investments. Prior to Huron, Miller was a senior associate with Glencoe Capital where he successfully evaluated investment opportunities and companies for the firm.  Miller previously worked for JPMorgan’s Mid-Corporate Investment Banking Group, where he handled M&A and debt and equity analysis.
Huron also announced the addition of two analysts, Tod Pesses and Mike Zukas, who will be responsible for investment evaluation and analysis. Pesses joins Huron after serving in corporate development roles at CareFusion and Cardinal Health. Zukas previously held roles at R. H. Bluestein and Co., Rothschild and North American Management Corp.
“With our new hires, we have significantly bolstered our sourcing and execution capabilities” said Brian Demkowicz, Huron’s Co-Founder and Managing Partner. “Our team is well positioned to continue building on Huron’s long history of making companies bigger and better”.

Investment Marks Culmination of Dental Industry Initiative
February 11,  2013 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”) announced today that it has invested in Six Month Smiles.  Founded in 2006 by Dr. Ryan Swain, Six Month Smiles is a clinically proven and economical approach to adult cosmetic orthodontics used by thousands of general dentists in the US, Canada, the UK, and Ireland.  Huron, in partnership with independent sponsor equity group Exium Partners, made the investment with a plan to continue growing the business through geographic expansion and new product offerings.  The Six Month Smiles transaction builds on Huron’s prior experience and success investing in the business services market and is the culmination of an active effort to identify investments specifically in the dental market.  This latest investment was made through The Huron Fund III L.P., a $350 million private equity fund which closed in 2008.
“We’re excited about this investment,” said Dr. Swain.  “Six Month Smiles has grown rapidly over the past several years and this is the right time for us to reinvest in market expansion. As we continue to lead the market with our Short Term Ortho system, we believe the operational experience from our new investors will help us reach new heights.”
“Six Month Smiles has a proven management team, a scalable business model, a dedicated employee base, and loyal customers,” said Huron Partner, Nick Barker.  “We are excited to be partnering with the Six Month Smiles management team and working with them in growing the business going forward.”

Hughes Bolsters Capabilities With Acquisition of Anoba Consulting Services
Detroit, MI – December 11, 2012 // Huron Capital Partners LLC (“Huron”) announced today that its portfolio company, Hughes Associates, Inc. (“Hughes”), has acquired Anoba Consulting Services LLC (“Anoba”).  Anoba is a niche engineering firm specializing in probabilistic risk assessment (“PRA”) and other highly-technical risk-modeling services.  Mandated by the federal government, PRA utilizes highly analytical software programs and risk models that allow nuclear power plants to assess the underlying operational risks in their business and the potential impact of catastrophic events.
Prior to the acquisition, Anoba had been a key strategic partner for Hughes, often serving as a subcontractor on its nuclear power generation consulting projects.  The transaction brings Anoba and Hughes together and expands Hughes’ capabilities in the rapidly growing PRA industry.
Liz Kleinsorg, Managing Director of Hughes’ Power Division, noted, “We are thrilled to join forces with Rick Anoba and his industry leading team of PRA engineers.  The acquisition extends our presence in another high-growth, niche engineering segment of the industry and provides opportunities to generate new revenue streams from new and existing customers.”
Phil DiNenno, CEO of Hughes, added, “Anoba is a highly-regarded name in the PRA field and we believe it fits well into the strategic acquisition plan that we are currently pursuing in partnership with Huron Capital.”
Huron originally invested in Hughes in May 2011, and was attracted to Hughes’ market leading position in the fire protection engineering market and ability to serve as a platform for growth.  “When we invested in Hughes, our plan was to build the business both through strategic acquisitions and internal growth.  We continue to deliver on that plan with this second add-on and look forward to pursuing additional opportunities with Phil DiNenno and the rest of the Hughes management team,” said Huron Partner Peter Mogk.

(“Ronnoco”) in a transaction marking the 60th investment overall for Huron.  Founded in 1904 and based in St. Louis, MO, Ronnoco manufactures and distributes premium quality coffee, tea and related products sold to convenience stores, foodservice outlets and offices throughout the central United States.  Huron, in partnership with Ronnoco’s management team, made the investment with a plan to continue growing the business through geographic expansion, new product offerings and acquisitions.  The Ronnoco transaction builds on Huron’s prior experience and success investing in consumer product and food businesses.  This latest investment was made through The Huron Fund III, L.P., a $350 million private equity fund raised in 2008.
Dan Moloney, President of Ronnoco, stated, “The Ronnoco name has been synonymous with premium quality coffee and world-class customer service for its one-hundred plus year history.  We are excited about our ability to build on this reputation while continuing to provide our customers with the same great products and service that they have come to expect in Ronnoco’s long history. Huron’s strong track record and experience in similar businesses makes them the perfect partner for us, and we are thrilled to be working together with them.”
“With a solid management team in place, significant excess capacity, and several avenues for continued growth, we believe Ronnoco is a solid platform on which to build,” said Huron Partner John Higgins.  “We are excited to be partnering with the Ronnoco team and working with them in growing the business going forward.”

Sixpoint Partners LLC, a New York-based global investment bank, closed Detroit-based Huron Capital Partners LLC's sixth private equity fund at its hard cap, Sixpoint Partners announced Wednesday.
The Huron Fund V L.P. closed at $550 million, $50 million over its target.
Three months after it opened, the investment vehicle was oversubscribed, with investors including foundations, endowments, public pensions and multimanager funds creating $1 billion in demand.
The lower-middle-market Fund V will aim to commit $20 million to $70 million for each transaction.
Huron Capital Partners' previous fund, The Huron Fund IV L.P., also surpassed its commitment goal.
"We look forward to deploying our buy-and-build strategy in partnership with seasoned executives to improve and grow our businesses through strategic initiatives, operational improvements and add-on acquisitions," Brian Demkowicz, a managing partner at Huron Capital Partners, said in the statement.
Founded in 1999, Huron Capital Partners has invested in 130 companies with revenues of up to $200 million. It has raised more than $1.7 billion in six private equity funds.

About Us


Huron Capital is an operationally-focused private equity firm investing in lower middle-market companies. For more than two decades, the firm’s partners have worked closely with strong operating executives in helping niche companies reach their full potential.  We believe this translates into superior long-term investment returns for our limited partners.
Founded in 1999, Huron has raised over $1.1 billion in committed equity capital dedicated to this market.
Our primary types of transactions include management buyouts, corporate carve-outs, recapitalizations, family successions and industry market-entry strategies with transaction values up to $200 million.  This includes both majority equity investments and less-than-majority investments made under our Flex Equity strategy.
We customize our transactions to meet each owner’s specific objectives and always work quickly and confidentially to avoid disruption to the business.
For us, investing starts and ends with people.  Our strategy is to combine an operational approach, committed capital and transaction experience with proven operating executives who have the vision, expertise and commitment to successfully grow their businesses.
We invest in people. We build LEADERS.

Detroit-based private equity firm Huron Capital Partners closed its sixth fund, at $550m. 
The Huron Fund V L.P. received commitments from a number of top-tier investors, including endowments, foundations, multi-manager funds, public pensions, corporate pensions and family offices.
