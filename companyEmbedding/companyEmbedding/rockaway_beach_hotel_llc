Oregon Hotel Guides

Thornton
 couldn't have chosen a more accurate description of the
grand state of Oregon
when he claimed She flies with her own wings. While Thornton
was referring to the state's independence from Britain,
the quote also suites the culture and attitude that makes Oregon special today. Oregon
rises dramatically from the Pacific ocean to create a scenic mountainous
coastline, dipping low into the Willamette
 Valley, only to rise once
more as the Cascade Mountain Range covers a large portion of the state. This
climactic scenery invites travelers from all over the country and welcomes them
into a host of cozy lodgings that range from co-operative housing to homey Bed
and Breakfasts to super splurge hotels in town. Business travelers will most likely
find success in the 
Portland-metro
area. Here cultural museums and historic streets wind through the city as the
lofty Mount Hood lurks in the background. The
progressive city is compact and user-friendly making it ideal for bicyclists
and walking to work. Accommodations in and around the city consist of mid-range
Brand name hotels to High Class resorts and spas.
A vast majority of Oregon is highly
attractive to leisurely tourists and romantic couples hoping to get away from
the hustle and bustle of big city living. That goal is easily achieved in any
one of the many coastal towns like 
Astoria,

Bend, Pacific City
and 
Newport.
All are small enough to feel remote, yet close enough to home to welcome tired
feet in for the night. Most of these amazing little towns offer fantastic rates
at Bed and Breakfasts sprinkled along the coast. 
Bend
lies along the Deschutes
 River winding it's way
through the mountains and tempting tourists onto its trails, rapids and golf
courses. Ski resorts, business suites and rental condos prevail in 
Bend as
the primary accommodations for travelers in the range of the Cascades.
Oregon
 is filled with cultural attractions such as Crater Lake in
the 
South
and 
Ashland
with its small-town theater and fine arts. Along the eastern border of the state
lies Old Western history, backpack along breathtaking mountain ranges,
horseback along old cowboy trails or sleep under the stars, wherever Oregon takes travelers,
they are guaranteed a fantastic vacation. 
Mount Hood, one of the state's most
popular attractions offers visitors a chance to climb the illustrious mountain
or ski its death-defying slopes. The Mount Hood
region has a slew of riverside towns which offers, among many other accommodations,
the famous WPA-era Timberline Lodge. At the end of a long journey, the Willamette Valley is an attractive alternative due
to its rich wineries and tasty farmers markets. Willamette Valley
hosts Mountain and Farm Resorts, Bed and Breakfasts, and brand name hotels and motels.
Wherever Oregon's
trails may lead, the coast, inland mountains and southern charm entice
travelers to experience what no other state has to offer.

Maybe the council should rethink a few of these as it's affecting their rating. Very poor internet but they say it's being upgraded soon.1  Thank JULIE D

The Southern Oregon coast is home to isolated beaches, rugged cliffs with breathtaking views of the Pacific and quaint seaside towns. If you stay in the Bay Area, go whale watching at Coos Bay or explore the region on a bike or a hike along the coastline. Antique shoppers will want to explore old town Bandon while golfers hit the links at the world-renowned Bandon Dunes golf course. And don’t forget to bring your fishing gear – you’ll want to cast for salmon and other Pacific Northwest fish at Gold Beach, one of the region’s top fishing spots.The Central Oregon Coast is a great place for fishing, clamming, hiking, golfing and other outdoor activities. Take the kids and visit the Sea Lion Caves near Florence, the world’s largest. Head up to Newport for a view of the state’s second-tallest lighthouse and shopping in this seaside town popular with vacationers for the last century. Go fly a kite on the beach in Lincoln City, kite capital of the world.The Northern Oregon Coast offers a relaxing way to enjoy the region. A stay in the scenic town of Astoria on the Washington border will allow you to explore the western edge of the Lewis and Clark trail, with views of the Columbia River and the Pacific. Walk the sandy beaches in Seaside and Cannon Beach and then grab saltwater taffy and other treats while shopping these seaside towns.

Recent guest reviews









Beautiful condo and great location. Our folks are 81 and if we were to go again with them we wouldn't stay here due to all the stairs. They did enjoy themselves and we made it work for them. Very clean and comfortable. Totally recommend it if the stairs aren't a issue for your family.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
