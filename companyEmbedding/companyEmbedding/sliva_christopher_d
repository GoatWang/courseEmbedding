CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AdvancePierre Foods (NYSE:APFH) (“AdvancePierre”), a leading national 
      producer and distributor of sandwiches, sandwich components and other 
      entrées and snacks, today announced that its Board of Directors has 
      approved a succession and transition plan for its Chief Executive 
      Officer position. As a part of the plan, the Board announced that 
      effective November 14, 2016, Christopher D. Sliva will be appointed 
      President and also will join the AdvancePierre Board of Directors. On 
      March 31, 2017, current AdvancePierre Chief Executive Officer John 
      Simons will retire and will be succeeded by Sliva. Simons will remain a 
      member of AdvancePierre’s Board following the transition.
    


      Additionally, AdvancePierre today announced the promotions of George 
      Chappelle and Jim Clough. Chappelle, previously Senior Vice President, 
      Supply Chain & Corporate Development, has been appointed Chief Operating 
      Officer. Chappelle will be responsible for overseeing the company’s 
      manufacturing operations and supply chain as well as all business 
      development activities including acquisitions, divestitures and other 
      strategic projects. Currently President of the Foodservice business 
      unit, Clough will expand his role and become the company’s first Chief 
      Commercial Officer. Clough will continue to lead the Foodservice 
      business unit as President and will have additional leadership 
      responsibilities related to the company’s customer-centric efforts. Both 
      of these promotions reflect the Company’s ongoing commitment to these 
      critical business functions and their contributions to AdvancePierre.
    

      Regarding Simons’ transition, Dean Hollis, Chairman of the Board, said: 
      “John has been instrumental in transforming AdvancePierre’s culture into 
      one focused on collaboration and excellence and in building a 
      world-class management team. Under John’s leadership, AdvancePierre has 
      implemented the APF way, our sustainable improvement program which 
      transformed our business performance and enhanced our margin profile. We 
      look forward to continuing to benefit from John’s experience and 
      guidance as Chief Executive Officer throughout the transition period.”
    

      Simons commented: “AdvancePierre is on a solid and steady path for 
      continued success. I’m extremely proud of our team’s many 
      accomplishments over the past several years, perhaps most notably around 
      our successful NYSE debut and the work that followed to establish 
      AdvancePierre on strong footing as a public company. For all of these 
      reasons, I came to the decision that now is the right time to initiate 
      this change, and the Board agreed that a smooth transition beginning 
      with Chris’ appointment as President was the ideal next step. I am 
      looking forward to working alongside Chris over the coming months, and I 
      am confident that the future is bright for AdvancePierre.”
    

      As President, Sliva will work closely alongside Simons on the oversight 
      and management of the company’s operating activities and to ensure a 
      seamless transition of responsibilities. Sliva is a recognized leader 
      and operator with over a decade’s experience as a public food company 
      executive. Before joining AdvancePierre, Sliva was President and Chief 
      Operating Officer at TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:THS), a leading 
      manufacturer of food and beverage products with more than 50 
      manufacturing facilities across the United States, Canada and Italy. 
      Sliva joined TreeHouse in July 2012 as Senior Vice President and Chief 
      Operating Officer of its Bay Valley Foods operating unit and also served 
      as Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of TreeHouse and 
      President of Bay Valley during his time at the company. Before that, 
      Sliva spent six years as an executive at Dean Foods (NYSE:DF), including 
      as Chief Commercial Officer of Dean’s subsidiary Fresh Dairy 
      Direct-Morningstar, Chief Customer Officer for Dean's White Wave Foods 
      division and President and Chief Operating Officer for the Morningstar 
      division. Previously, Sliva held various leadership roles and sales and 
      marketing positions with Eastman Kodak Company, Fort James Corporation 
      and Procter & Gamble Distributing Company.
    

      Hollis continued: “I am very pleased to welcome Chris to AdvancePierre. 
      Having spent a significant part of his career working in a 
      customer-focused environment, Chris is well-equipped to reinforce and 
      build upon AdvancePierre’s customer-centric approach. Chris also shares 
      our passion for food and his highly relevant experience as a senior 
      executive with publicly-traded food and beverage companies strongly 
      positions him to lead AdvancePierre through its next phase of growth.”
    

      Sliva said: “I have watched AdvancePierre’s amazing progress over the 
      past several years and I admire the spirit of collaboration, innovation 
      and continuous improvement deeply-rooted in every aspect of the 
      business. I am excited to work with John and the rest of the talented 
      team during this transition period as we strive to deliver even greater 
      value for customers and sustained profitable growth and value for 
      shareholders.”

OAK BROOK, Ill., July 23, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE:   THS) announced today a new alignment of its executive leadership with the hiring of Christopher D. Sliva to the newly-created position of Chief Operating Officer of its Bay Valley Foods operating unit and Senior Vice President of TreeHouse Foods. Sliva, 49, joins the company from Dean Foods where was Chief Commercial Officer of Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar.  In his new role at TreeHouse, Sliva will work closely with Bay Valley Food president Harry J. Walsh and report directly to Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Sam K. Reed. He will be based at corporate headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois. 
"The rapid growth and increased complexity of our company requires a new alignment of our executive leadership," Reed said. "Chris Sliva is highly qualified for the COO role. For the past six years, he has been a key member of the Executive Leadership Team of Dean Foods, the parent from which TreeHouse Foods was spun off in 2005." Prior to being named Chief Commercial Officer for Fresh Dairy Direct-Morningstar in 2010, Sliva was Chief Customer Officer for Dean's White Wave Foods division and President and Chief Operating Officer for the Morningstar division. His successful career in consumer packaged goods also includes positions at Eastman Kodak, Fort James Corporation and Procter & Gamble.  Sliva holds a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from Washington University in St. Louis.
