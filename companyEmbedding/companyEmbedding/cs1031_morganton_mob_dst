CS1031 Morganton MOB, DST SEC Filing Form D  4/2016, submited: 2016-10-13<< back to list of filingsForm DA filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.

* This undertaking does not affect any limits Section 102(a) of the National Securities Markets
        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.

RICHMOND, Va., March 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Capital Square 1031 announced today that its Delaware statutory trust offerings, CS1031 Birmingham MOB, DST and CS1031 Kinston MOB, DST, each comprised of a medical office building occupied by affiliates of Fresenius Medical Care in Alabama and North Carolina, respectively, have been fully subscribed by investors. 
Capital Square 1031 has closed 32 DST offerings since its founding in late 2012.








"Each of these offerings include real estate occupied by the world's leading provider of dialysis services and products for people with chronic kidney failure, which has 2,249 dialysis clinics across North America," said Louis Rogers, founder and chief executive officer of Capital Square 1031. "Dialysis is the life-saving process for artificially cleaning blood for patients with chronic kidney disease. The properties are well-located near doctor's offices and hospitals, providing convenient access to patients, their caregivers and healthcare providers. We are pleased to complete these offerings and provide a growing number of investors with ownership of investment-grade, recession resistant real estate."
CS1031 Birmingham MOB, DST acquired a newly-constructed, 8,140-square-foot medical office building that was built-to-suit for Fresenius Medical Care. Located at 3671 Roosevelt Blvd. in Birmingham, Alabama, the property is leased on a net basis for a base term of 15 years, plus extensions. Capital Square leveraged the property for exchange investors who need debt to obtain complete deferral under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code.  
CS1031 Kinston MOB, DST acquired a 10,880-square-foot medical office building located at 604 Airport Road in Kinston, North Carolina, a Certificate of Need state. The clinic, which is one of the company's largest dialysis clinics in North Carolina, is a flagship location for Fresenius.  Capital Square acquired the property in an all-cash (no debt) purchase for exchange investors who do not need debt to obtain deferral under Section 1031.  
"A growing number of exchange investors are seeking an all-cash, no debt, replacement property," said Louis Rogers.  "An 'all-cash' replacement property was almost unheard of five years ago."
Listed on both the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FME) and New York Stock Exchange (FMS), Fresenius is the world's leading provider of products and services for people with chronic kidney failure. The company is primarily engaged in providing kidney dialysis services and clinical laboratory testing; manufacturing and distributing products and equipment for kidney dialysis treatment; and providing other medical ancillary services. During 2015, Fresenius cared for in excess of 294,000 dialysis patients in 3,418 proprietary clinics located in more than 45 countries worldwide. The company also operates more than 40 production sites, making Fresenius the leading provider of dialysis products, including dialysis machines, dialyzers and disposable accessories.
As of February 15, Capital Square 1031 oversees a national portfolio of 58 real estate assets valued at approximately $600 million (based on investment cost).
