by Andrew Jason on Aug 2, 2014




 


 
 
 
 
 
 







For the last 45 years, Swanson Health Products has been the little company that could. Actually, that was once true. It is now the big company that has done and is out to do much more. Swanson has proven that Fargo-Moorhead is an ideal location for large corporations.




Past
Leland Swanson formed the company in 1969, but the genesis of the company began long before then. According to Ken Harris, CEO of Swanson Health Products, Leland began taking vitamins “to make his life better and help his golf game.” What started out as a lifestyle change for Leland quickly grew into something much more. 
Leland and his son Lee Jr., who is now the President of Swanson Health Products, began to operate the business as a small mail order supplement company. It became too big for their small storefront, so they opened up a warehouse in the Fargo Industrial Park. Over the next 20 years Swanson grew to be a pow- erhouse in the vitamin supplement business. 
Present




In 2001, Swanson Health Products opened up its 200,000 square foot headquarters located at 4075 40th Ave. SW, Fargo. They recently underwent a 6,100 square foot expansion. Along with warehouses in Harrisburg, PA, 
and Sparks, NV, the company does north of $300 million in profit every year and is growing steadily at 10 percent a year. All of the num- bers are impressive, but there is one aspect of the company that is more important to Harris. 
“I think the thing that we’re most proud of is the fact that we’re homegrown in this community,” Harris said. “We’re, I think, in the top 20 employers in Fargo … We’re very pleased to be here today.” 
The company shows its support for the com- munity through a number of ways. Swanson Health Products is a major sponsor of the Fargo Marathon. It supports various charities like the United Way, American Red Cross, Hospice, Dakota Medical Foundation and many more. 
Future




The growth isn’t slowing down, either. Harris noted that people are becoming more and more interested in organic and healthy foods, and that is where part of the future of Swanson Health Products lies. 
“Looking forward to the future, we’re very excited,” Harris said. “We continue to see our vitamins and supplements grow, but now we’ve taken a broader view. We’re very enthused to see younger people become much more interested in healthy foods.” 
That interest in health doesn’t end with organic food. Swanson Health Products is seeing a rise in the sports and nutrition field. 
“In the past, you used to think of sports nutri- tion as big bodybuilders and all these guys that were probably on steroids,” Harris said. “The younger people are looking for products to help their workouts work better.” 
Another component Swanson Health Products is hoping to expand upon is international distribution. Swanson Health Products have major distributors in China, Japan, Poland and Bulgaria. However, one of the company’s strategic plans next year is to triple its international business. 
While the company has come from the little business that could, they are still going strong, and Harris has the right mentality to keep it growing. 
“We’re saying, ‘If Amazon is able to do it, we gotta be able to do it and we gotta be able to do it yesterday.’”

How do Provisional Patent Applications Work?
Make sure you understand exactly how they work, keeping in mind they only last for 12 months and are only useful if you eventually convert it into a non-provisional patent app!
LEARN MORE ABOUT PROVISIONAL PATENT APPS









Should I request a patent search?
It's the first step before a patent application! First, you learn how patentable your invention may be. If it's not very patentable, don't waste time and money on a patent app. Second, it may help you increase your patentability. By seeing what is similar, you can improve your invention around other existing invention and increase patentability.
