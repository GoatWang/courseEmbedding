AAGP™ >>
AAGPs™ were invented by Dr. Geraldine-Castelot-Deliencourt and developed and protected by patents in partnership with the Institute for Scientific Application (INSA) of France. For her work in this area Dr. Castelot-Deliencourt was honored in 2006 with France's highest award for scientific accomplishment - the Francinov Award.




PROTOKINETIX
ProtoKinetix is a bio-technology company that provides medical researchers with a platform for enhancing cell survival and health, both in vitro and in vivo.

At the heart of its technology is its patented anti-aging glycopeptide AAGP™. This small molecule (580 Daltons) displays abilities in resolving challenges confronting medical researchers in such areas as regenerative medicine and as a therapy for diseases relating to tissue inflammation and oxidation stress.
Because of its stability, small size and molecular makeup, it maintains its function in vivo without triggering the body's immune system. Further, it can function without toxic side effects common in treatments involving larger and less stable compounds.
These abilities are verified through testing in such areas as:

Extension of stem cell harvesting, purification, expansion, cryopreservation and re-engraftment.  See Test Results & Protocols > BioActivity Assays > "Effect of AAGP™ on Maintaining Stem Cell Number and Function in Mouse Neural Stem Cells During Cryopreservation."  Also, "Effect of AAGP™ on Preserving Cell Survival Number in Human and Mouse Neural Stem Cells During Cryopreservation."
Inflammation. See Test Results & Protocols > BioActivity Assays > "AAGP™ Reduces the Inflammatory Reaction (Cox-2 Induction) in Response to an Inflammatory Stimulus (Interleukin-1B)."
Oxidation stress. See Test Results & Protocols > BioActivity Assays > "AAGP™ Protects Human Adult Fibroblasts Against Oxidation Stress (Hydrogen Peroxide and UVC) Induced Cell Death At 37°C."
Diabetes treatment. See Test Results & Protocols > BioActivity Assays > "Affect of AAGP™   on the Functionality of  Transplanted Islet Cells in a Diabetic Mouse Model."

Additional test results can be found in the Bioactivity section.
ProtoKinetix invites university and private research researchers to examine the properties of AAGP™ to determine how it can accelerate their development of a new generation of treatments, cures, and cell-survival solutions.
It should be noted that currently there is on-going independent research in such areas as uveitis and in monoclonal-antibody production.
AAGP™ is manufactured at facilities in North America, Europe, and Asia for shipment worldwide.
Interested parties please contact us to obtain AAGP™.

AAGPs™ Overview
ProtoKinetix' anti-aging glycopeptide, trademarked AAGP™ is a  small (580.96 Daltons), stable, synthetic replicas of the larger (>2,600 Daltons), less stable AFGP which has been found to have protective properties in nature. The small size of AAGP™ enables it to penetrate cells and allows it to pass through both cell and capillary junctions in vivo.  In addition, its bioactivity at a variety of pHs (5.3-10.3) and temperatures (-196°C to 22°C) and efficiency at concentrations (1mg/ml) is well below its toxic dose (50mg/ml), making it a candidate to enter into the next stages of translational research.
AAGP™ has a chemical formula of C20H35CIF2N4O11, solubility in water of 650g.l-1, and is also soluble in methanol, ethanol and DMSO.  The optimal concentration is 1-10mg/ml, depending on cell line and stress test.  The optimal is pH: 5.3 - 7.3, depending on cell line and stress test.
CELL-PROTECTION ASSAYS
AAGP™ has gone through a series of tests in various outsourced laboratories in Europe and North America. These tests have proven its ability to protect a multitude of cell lines (Hela cells, adult fibroblast, neonatal fibroblasts, human neuronal stem cells, mouse neuronal stem cells, mouse islet cells, blood platelets, CD34+ cells, and keratinocytes) against UVA, UVC, Hydrogen Peroxide, Inflammatory (ILβ), Time, Temperature (-196°C, -80°C, -3°C, 3°C, 4°C, 15°C and 22°C) and Low Serum induced cell death at pHs from 5.3 -10.5.
 The average increase in cell survival credited to AAGP™ in the face of these conditions was over 55%.  This cannot be attributed to AAGP™ increasing cell proliferation as it had been found that AAGP™ has no affect on cell doubling times in either Hela or fibroblast cells.
In addition to protecting cell survival AAGP™ also preserves cell functionality.  This has been tested via stem cell markers, CD34+ functionality tests, and in vivo studies where AAGP™ treated transplanted islet cells were found to reduce blood glucose concentrations in diabetic mice by 40% by day 40 in comparison to islet cells which were transplanted into mice without first being exposed to AAGP™.
MECHANISM OF ACTION
The mechanism of action of AAGP™ is now under study.  However, its ability to protect against inflammation- induced cell death in exposure to hydrogen peroxide, UVA, and UVC suggests a role for AAGP™ in the inflammation pathway.  In addition, when exposed to an inflammatory mediator, interleukin β (ILβ), the presence of AAGP™ reduced COX-2 expression three fold.  Inflammation plays a major role in many pathological conditions suggesting AAGP™ may not just be usable in cell and organ storage but also in pharmacological treatments.
The full results of these extensive tests can be found in the 'Test Results & Protocols' section of the website.
ANTIFREEZE GLYCOPROTEINS (AFGPs) TO ANTI-AGING GLYCOPEPTIDES (AAGPs™)
AFGPs have proven useful in many applications.  However, they are limited by their cost (approximately $10,000/gram), instability, and size (2,600 - 24,000 Daltons). Their large size restricts their use in medicine as they are unable to pass through capillaries into interstitial tissue and are unable to reach target cells.  Molecules must be less than 600 Daltons to diffuse through the capillaries. In addition, molecules must be less than 1000 Daltons to pass through cell junctions into neighbouring cells and less than 600 Daltons to cross the blood-brain barrier.
With these issues in mind Dr. Geraldine-Castelot-Deliencourt invented AAGP™ to be a smaller, more stable synthetic version of AFGP.

Dermatology
The two major causes of dry, wrinkled, less elastic and diseased skin are inflammation and oxidation. The main culprits are the sun (UV rays and free radicals) and other environmental and physiological stresses that also cause inflammation and oxidation.
When AAGP™ is combined with Coenzyme Q10 an anti-oxidant effect is achieved that not only protects but also helps the cells repair previously existing damage.
In vitro laboratory tests have shown the AAGP™ molecules can protect skin cells from damage and death that would otherwise occur from UV rays and free radicals.
To the extent of the laboratory tests conducted, AAGP™ clearly protects in vitro skin cells from cold temperatures, oxidation, UV irradiation and pH variations.

                 Watch News About Dr. Shapiro's Treatment of Type 1 Diabetics  Dr. James Shapiro, M.D., Ph.D., FRCSC, Director of Clinical Islet Transplant Program, University of Alberta.     CORPORATE OFFICE  9176 South Pleasants Highway St. Marys, WV 26170 304-299-5070   CEO: Clarence E. Smith       EMAIL: info@protokinetix.com  OTCBB:PKTX    BUSINESS MODEL ProtoKinetix is building value for investors through licensing and joint ventures with business partners, utilizing our internationally patented technology- which is comprised of a family of glycoprotein compounds - targeting biotechnology applications where existing and developing businesses have requirements that AAGPs™ - anti-aging glycopeptides - will dramatically improve. The biotechnology business is often subject to expensive and time consuming regulatory processes. Our approach is to expedite the development of our technology primarily through business relationships that provide us with leading-edge technical and marketing expertise to expedite the time lines to place products on the shelf. ProtoKinetix is not about building a business with "bricks and mortar." We believe there are so many AAGP™ applications that can best be reached through strategic business relationships. We assess each opportunity with return on investment as the priority. Defining and measuring each agreement based upon corporate investment, time line to market, strength of the organization within a specific market segment and marketing strengths. As we build the value of AAGP™ we are also taking steps to generate revenue through sales of products in markets that do not require regulatory oversight. COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS    ProtoKinetix and Proactive Immune Sciences Announce a Joint Research Collaboration Using AAGP™ in Immune Cell Cryopreservation Testing   June 05, 2017 10:37 AM Eastern Daylight Time  ST. MARYS, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (OTC: PKTX) (the "Company" or "ProtoKinetix") (www.protokinetix.com) and Proactive Immune Sciences (www.proactiveimmunesciences.com) today announce that they have entered into a joint research collaboration. The goal of the research will be to test the effect of the patented anti-aging glycopeptide AAGP™ on the immune cell cryopreservation protocols used by Proactive Immune Sciences.  “We welcome the opportunity to show the effectiveness of our AAGP™ molecule in another rapidly expanding, high-demand, commercial arena, further demonstrating the versatility of this molecule’s ability to protect cells in different clinical situations”  “We are excited about this new joint research collaboration and hope AAGP™ has some of the same positive effects, with respect to cryopreserving immune cells, that it is having on other cell lines,” says Jeff Schulz, CEO, Proactive Immune Sciences. “We are hoping to prove through our research that AAGP will have a positive affect on helping immune cells recover from the cryopreservation process. Any improvement in cell survival rate, or cell function could have significant, positive benefits for future treatments using cryopreserved immune cells. Pending a successful outcome of our research, the intent is for Proactive to enter into a licensing agreement with ProtoKinetix for the cryopreservation of immune cells. This will give Proactive customers the benefit of knowing their stored immune cells will perform at the highest levels possible should they require them for any immune cell based cancer or immune system reconstitution later in their life.” About Immune Cell Banking The initial phase of the research is expected to conclude later in 2017. Partial funding for the project has been provided by The National Research Council’s Industrial Research Assistance Program. About the National Research Council's Industrial Research Assistance Program Immune based interventions represent one of the fastest growing, most promising areas of personalized medicine. This is particularly true for cancer, which is largely a disease of immune failure. Therefore, there is a strong impetus for individuals to bank healthy immune cells at as early an age as possible, before these cells are compromised by infection, malignancy, or simply advanced immunological age. These cells can be used later on for any form of immunotherapy the client might require. “We welcome the opportunity to show the effectiveness of our AAGP™ molecule in another rapidly expanding, high-demand, commercial arena, further demonstrating the versatility of this molecule’s ability to protect cells in different clinical situations,” said Clarence Smith, President, CEO and Chairman of the Board of ProtoKinetix.   ProtoKinetix Announces Start of Phase 1 & Phase 2 Clinical Trials for the use of AAGP™ PKX-001 Treated Islet Cells in the Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes         St. Marys, West Virginia, March 9, 2017  						ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (OTC: PKTX) (the "Company" or "ProtoKinetix") (www.protokinetix.com) today announced the start of a Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of AAGP™ PKX-001 treated islet cells used in conjunction with the Edmonton Protocol for the treatment of Type 1 diabetes. The first patient has been treated under this protocol.  The trial is being led by Dr. James Shapiro, MD, PhD, FRCSC, MSM FCAHS, AHS Director of Clinical Islet and Living Donor Liver Transplant Programs, Canada Research Chair in Transplant Surgery and Regenerative Medicine, Professor of Surgery, Medicine and Surgical Oncology, University of Alberta.   To obtain additional information and updates regarding the trials please use the 						following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03073577?term=pkx-001&rank=1  						PKX-001 is the designation given to the drug product molecule of the AAGP™ family. Islet cell transplants are well recognized as a viable and effective treatment for Type 1 diabetes. The PKX-001 Study will treat islet cells prior to transplantation into human test subjects. The clinical trials will be assessing any side effects or physiological damage to the test subjects. The study will also be looking for indications of protection from tacrolimus toxicity and enhanced engraftment survival of the transplanted cells. The trial follows extensive preclinical evaluation in animal models.  						The Phase 1 first-in-human study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of AAGP™ PKX-001 treated islets while the Phase 2 component will be evaluating the efficacy of adding AAGP™ PKX-001 treated islets to the already established Edmonton Protocol.  “If the findings translate to the clinic in a manner that reflects the preclinical studies, AAGP™ has the potential to substantially improve outcomes in patients receiving islet transplants today, and future stem cell therapies.” said Dr. James Shapiro, MD, PhD, FRCSC, MSM FCAHS, AHS Director of Clinical Islet and Living Donor Liver Transplant Programs, Canada Research Chair in Transplant Surgery and Regenerative Medicine, Professor of Surgery, Medicine and Surgical Oncology, University of Alberta.   Dr. James Shapiro Bio 						  About the Edmonton Protocol  						         ProtoKinetix Updates Testing Progress on Neuronal Retinal Cells in Living Tissue for the Treatment of Macular Degeneration   2017-02-07 13:22 ET - News Release   Company Website: http://www.protokinetix.com  ST. MARYS, W. Va. -- (Business Wire)   ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (OTC: PKTX) (the "Company" or "ProtoKinetix") (www.protokinetix.com) updates its stockholders on the testing of neuronal retinal cells in living tissue at the University of British Columbia (“UBC”) under the guidance of Dr. Gregory-Evans.   As explained by Dr. Gregory-Evans, the research program at UBC will be determining whether AAGP™ can help improve the survival of stem cells that are currently being used in human trials to treat retinal blindness. We are doing this because of the poor outcome in the current state of play using stem cells in the treatment of blindness. Proof of principal work has been done in animal models but these successes are few and far between. What has been seen most recently is that probably as few as 10% of injected cells are surviving more than a week. Although this is adequate for proof of principle work, it is not good enough for developing a clinical medical treatment. We are looking for ways to improve cell survival in actual living eyes.   The researchers at UBC have reached the conclusion that AAGP™ should provide the required level of protection to ensure post-engraftment survival. One reason is theoretical and one is experimental. The theoretical basis is that when tissue is damaged, that tissue breaks down and releases toxins into its environment. We believe that AAGP™ can work to reduce the harmful effects of these toxins. Based on previous tests conducted by the Company, AAGP™ has demonstrated significant anti-inflammatory properties. The experimental basis for our hypothesis is that we have tested the drug in tissue culture in the lab and found that it improves the survival of cells.   The current work that we are doing is taking those results and that theory and looking at it now in living tissue to see if we can reproduce the successes that we achieved before. We have established a new type of model for retinal degeneration in a rabbit and are currently working on injecting neuronal cells plus AAGP™ to see if we can see any improvement long term in how these cells survive and integrate into the retina and hopefully lead to vision restoration in the animals.   “We hope to achieve results in experiments more closely aligned with human disease. If that is the case the molecule could become a major advance in the field of stem cells and blindness.” Dr. Kevin Gregory-Evans, Professor of Ophthalmology in the Faculty of Medicine, University of British Columbia   Dr. Kevin Gregory-Evans Bio   To subscribe to e-mail updates please follow the following link:   Protokinetix.com   ProtoKinetix, Incorporated is a molecular biotechnology company that has developed and patented a family of hyper stable, potent glycopeptides (AAGP™) that enhance both engraftment and protection of transplanted cells used in regenerative medicine. Due to the results achieved over the last four years of testing, the University of Alberta has received an Investigational Testing Authorization from Health Canada to enter into a Phase 1/2 human clinical trial at the University of Alberta. Additional studies will be expanded to include whole organ transplantation and other cell therapies used in regenerative medicine.   Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements   The information discussed in this press release includes “forward looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included herein concerning, among other things, planned capital expenditures, future cash flows and borrowings, pursuit of potential acquisition opportunities, our financial position, business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations, are forward looking statements.

Harvesting, storage and transplanting cells, tissues and organs. Treatments for conditions and disease caused by stress factors, including UV radiation, oxidation and inflammation   Acute medical research study is always progressing, but one of the problems that researchers rely on is the benefit from solutions that can deal with the fundamental factors of inflammation and oxidation. Both are well-known causes of life-threatening conditions and diseases, and accelerated aging. In addition many acute medical problems are benefiting from cell therapies and transplantation of cell, tissues and organs. AAGP™ is now being used or investigated as a possible solution by many healthcare companies that specialize in medical cell therapies, organ transplant, trauma, blood product banking and anti-inflammation.

AAGP™ Improves Results in Stem Cells Transplanted in Retina Tissue by 300%   10:41 AM ET, 05/02/2016 - Business Wire  ST. MARYS, W.Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--May 2, 2016-- ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (OTCQB:PKTX) (the "Company" or "ProtoKinetix") (www.protokinetix.com) is pleased to announce that a paper submitted by Dr. Kevin Gregory-Evans on ProtoKinetix’ AAGP™ has been accepted by the Journal of Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine for publication. The date of publication is unknown at this time but should be available online in advance of the printed version. AAGP™, an antifreeze glycopeptide, has been demonstrated to significantly improve the viable yield of stem cells transplanted in retinal tissue at the University of British Columbia under the guidance of Dr. Kevin Gregory-Evans. Dr. Gregory-Evans concluded that embryonic cells treated with AAGP™ and transplanted into retina tissue, an accepted model for the central nervous system, compared to the control group not treated was 300% more viable. Dr. Gregory-Evans proposes that AAGP™ works by inhibiting toxic signaling from surrounding necrotic tissue. Necrotic tissue is dead tissue, which usually results from an inadequate local blood supply. Necrotic tissue contains dead cells and debris that are a consequence of the fragmentation of dying cells. ”AAGP™ could be a huge benefit to the future of Pre-clinical and Clinical transplantation medicine,”said Dr. Kevin Gregory-Evans. He added,“AAGP™ will revolutionize transplantation medicine across the board.” The significance of these results may have far reaching implications. In addition to cell, tissue and organ transplantations, there are strong implications that AAGP™ may have powerful applications for the treatment of stroke and heart attack treatment.

AAGP Found to Significantly Improve Islet Cell Transplantation in Type 1 Diabetes Patients Ticker Symbol: U:PKTX Dec 17, 2015 ST. MARYS, W. Va. -- (Business Wire) --  ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (OTCQB:PKTX) (the "Company" or "ProtoKinetix") (www.protokinetix.com) is pleased to announce that their molecule, AAGP, an antifreeze glycopeptide that mimics a naturally occurring glycoprotein found in Arctic fish is helping to significantly improve the efficacy of Cell Transplant Treatments for diabetes - a procedure that transplants insulin producing islet to render them insulin independent for periods of time.  Anti-Aging GlycoPeptide (AAGP), is the focus of a new study published in the journal Diabetes. Researchers from the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry found that by soaking islet cells in AAGP for an hour and then washing it off prior to transplantation, the cells were protected from tacrolimus an antirejection drug commonly used during transplants that is toxic to islets cells.    Normally when we expose human islets to tacrolimus in the petri dish, they flat line and don?t release insulin at all, says James Shapiro, senior author of the study and Canada Research Chair in Transplant Surgery and Regenerative Medicine at the U of A. When we add the AAGP and wash it all off, the cells work perfectly normally, and are protected in a remarkably durable manner. We find we need far fewer cells to treat diabetes in our preclinical models than we would normally.   Since his creation of the Edmonton Protocol in 1999, more than 250 patients have been treated by Shapiro through islet cell transplantation. A key challenge of the procedure though is that most patients typically need two islet infusions, each prepared from a separate pancreas organ donor. Shapiro says there aren't enough organ donors to meet demand. Through the use AAGP, a greater number of islet cells will survive the procedure, potentially allowing more patients to be treated.    Just a one hour soak in AAGP is enough to protect the islet cells for up to a month or two afterwards. It has a very potent and profound effect, says Shapiro. As a direct result of these findings, we're now moving forward with plans for a first in human clinical trial?led at the University of Alberta?testing this drug in our human islet cell transplant program.?   This synthetic molecule seems to provide significant protection to cells exposed to multiple deleterious conditions, such as UV radiation, starvation, extreme temperatures andoxidative stress, says Boris Gala-Lopez, lead author of the study and a clinical/research fellow at the U of A's Department of Surgery. We are certainly very excited for the multiple opportunities this finding entails to the field of transplantation research.   Funding for the study was provided by the Diabetes Research Institute Foundation of Canada, while the drug AAGP was provided by ProtoKinetix.    We are very excited to have our AAGP molecule showcased in this prestigious journal. We are also extremely confident in the ongoing success of our collaboration with Dr. James Shapiro and his outstanding team said Clarence Smith, President and Chairman of ProtoKinetix.  If proven successful in human clinical trials, Shapiro believes the inclusion of AAGP could soon become a permanent addition to the Edmonton Protocol representing a significant step forward in the treatment of Type 1 diabetes through islet transplantation. While more research is needed, he also believes the drug shows promise for a wide range of transplantations?potentially working to protect organs as effectively as it protects islets.   ProtoKinetix’ AAGP™ to Be Presented at the Congress of the International Pancreas and Islet Transplant Association 9:00 AM ET, 09/10/2015 - Business Wire   ST. MARYS, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 10, 2015-- ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (OTC: PKTX) (the "Company" or "ProtoKinetix") (www.protokinetix.com) is pleased to announce that AAGP™ will be presented at the 2015 Joint Congress of the IPITA-IXA-CTS onMonday, November 16, 2015.The Joint Congress of the International Pancreas and Islet Transplant Association (IPITA), the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) and the Cell Transplant Society (CTS) to be held in Melbourne, Australia, 15–19 November 2015. Dr. Boris L. Gala-Lopez, Research Fellow of Department of Surgery in the Alberta Diabetes Institute at the University of Alberta will be giving a lecture titled “Anti-aging Glycopeptide Protects Human Islets Against Tacrolimus-related Injury and Facilitates Engraftment” to support his conclusion that, “Supplementation with AAGP™ during the culture period improves islet quality and potency. Upon transplantation, pre-treatment with AAGP™ may facilitate engraftment in mice, improve graft secretory function and may attenuate long-term tacrolimus induced graft dysfunction. These findings may constitute a clear opportunity to develop more efficient strategies against post-transplant diabetes mellitus.” For details see the web site: confman.melbourne2015.org/mobis/lecture/758 About Dr. Boris L.

ProtoKinetix Begins Testing Diabetic Mice with AAGP™ at the University of Alberta.. 10:00 AM ET, 09/18/2015 - Business Wire  ST. MARYS, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sep. 18, 2015-- ProtoKinetix, Incorporated (OTC: PKTX) (the "Company" or "ProtoKinetix") (www.protokinetix.com) is pleased to announce that it has begun testing NOD (Non Obese Diabetic) mice with its AAGP™ molecule at the James Shapiro laboratory at the University of Alberta.  Type 1, diabetic NOD mice with AAGP™ versus a control group of Type 1, diabetic NOD mice without AAGP™ will be monitored for their blood-glucose levels. Using the NOD mice as a model the Edmonton team will be specifically assessing the potentially protective effect of AAGP™ against the antibody attack conducted against the islet cells in the pancreas.  NOD Mice, like the Bio-Breeding rat, are used as an animal model for Type 1 diabetes. Non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice exhibit a susceptibility to spontaneous development of autoimmune insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).The NOD strain and related strains were developed at Shionogi Research Laboratories in Aburahi, Japan by Makino and colleagues and first reported in 1980.The group developed the NOD strain by an outbreeding of the cataract-prone strain from JcI:ICR mice.  At the conclusion of these tests, the internal organs of the NOD mice will be examined for any evidence of toxicity and bioavailability. This data is an extremely valuable step on the critical path towards submissions to Health Canada or the FDA for human clinical trial applications.

The sole intention of the collaboration is to develop a commercial product pipeline of therapeutic applications for the AAGP™ family of molecules.  ...Professor James Shapiro is Professor of Surgery, Medicine and Surgical Oncology, and Director of the Clinical Islet Transplant Program and the Living Donor Liver Transplant Program at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. He has a busy hepatobiliary surgical practice in HPB oncology, and in liver and kidney-pancreas transplant surgery. His center carries out 80 liver transplants per year, and has done around 80 living donor liver transplants. The University of Alberta just celebrated their 1000th liver transplant.  ...Dr. Shapiro directs the largest clinical islet transplant program worldwide with almost 170 patients treated, and led the clinical team that developed the "Edmonton Protocol" - the first trial to achieve consistent 100% insulin independence in a series of islet-alone transplant recipients with Type 1 diabetes (published in the NEJM 2000). Before Dr. Shapiro’s trial, the success rate with islet transplantation was less than 8%. He led an international multicenter trial to replicate these findings in 9 international centers (published in NEJM 2006).  ...Over the last 32 months Dr. Shapiro and his team have been extensively testing the AAGP™ molecule in allogeneic transplants using human islet cells as the model. As regenerative medicine is rapidly becoming adopted in the treatment of degenerative diseases, the protection of the transplanted cells, tissues, and organs is of paramount importance. Transplanted cells and tissues are subjected to extreme stress factors that, unless protected, could cause failure to graft or premature death. The success of the tests conducted in Edmonton have demonstrated that AAGP™ has the potential to be widely adopted in many areas of regenerative medicine.  .."I'm very excited about our ongoing collaborations with PKTX and by the remarkable potency of AAGP. This molecule has great potential, and we are just beginning to scratch beneath the surface," said Dr. James Shapiro.  ...As a result of the tests, Dr. Shapiro and his team are developing further testing based on three primary activities:  ..1. The ongoing testing and refinement of cellular transplantation using human islet cells as the demonstrated model. In particular, AAGP™ may provide powerful protection against hostile agents that severely inhibit engraftment success. Cell therapies are currently being developed around the world for the treatment of spinal cord injury, damaged heart tissue, stroke, diabetes as well as many other conditions.  ..2. Human organ preservation. The program will assess the effect of AAGP™ in extending the transplant viability of donor organs. The Canadian National Transplant Research Program is a major national initiative involving the Federal institutes of health, all Provinces and the private sector. http://www.cntrp.ca/. The first testing will be conducted on livers to determine whether AAGP™ can extend the ex-vivo functionality of the organ.  ..3. Auto immune disease. This class of diseases occur where the body's immune system starts to attack healthy cells. Diseases in this category include, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and Type 1 diabetes. Using the NOD (Non Obese Diabetic) mice as a model the Edmonton team will be specifically assessing the potentially protective effect of AAGP™ against the antibody attack conducted against the islet cells in the pancreas.  ...“This impressive team of transplant surgeons and scientists have made clear to us the dramatic scope of applications that our family of molecules possesses,” said Clarence Smith, President, CEO and Chairman of the Board of ProtoKinetix.  .....About the James Shapiro Laboratory  The James Shapiro Laboratory is active experimental laboratory working on improving long term survival of transplanted islets, and in immunomodulation of transplanted tissues. He is Principal Investigator on several NIH and JDRF-funded clinical trials, including clinical testing of costimulation blockade in islet transplantation.    **PKTX..

MARYS, W. Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Mar. 26, 2015-- ProtoKinetix (OTC: PKTX) (www.protokinetix.com) is pleased to be able to report a comprehensive transplantation testing program being conducted for the last two years in conjunction with the University of Alberta transplant research team. The Company is collaborating with the James Shapiro Laboratory at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta. Dr. Shapiro directs the largest clinical islet transplantation program in the world.  Dr. Shapiro is a professor of surgery, medicine and surgical oncology. He is director of the Clinical Islet Transplant Program and the Living Donor Liver Transplant Programs at the University of Alberta. He is also principal investigator of National Institute of Health and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation clinical trials. In addition to these positions, he is the leader of the Project 1 - Ex-vivo Organ Transplant Protection and Repair Program of the Canadian National Transplant Research Program.  During the last 24-months, Dr. Shapiro’s Ph.D. student, Dr Boris Gala-Lopez, and his team have conducted extensive testing with our AAGP™ molecule using human islet cells in transplantation, investigating its effect on engraftment, insulin production, protective effect against anti-rejection drugs and investigation of the mechanism of action. The results provided consistent encouragement to continue testing to develop protocols that can be applied to transplantation medicine.  Allogeneic transplantation is the transplanting of cells, tissues or organs from the same species, but not with the host DNA. Serious issues that have to be addressed are the engraftment of the transplanted organ or cells and the subsequent protection against the immune response. The protection, in the form of anti-rejection drugs, is toxic and causes damage to the graft. AAGP™ has been shown in these trials to increase engraftment and reduce the toxicity damage.  Dr. Shapiro says “We are all very encouraged by the early results of these studies, and I look forward to working with the Company in moving toward use of AAGP™ in future clinical applications”.                                                                                                                                                       ****Dr. Julia Levy Accepts Position on ProtoKinetix’ Business and Scientific Advisory Board         VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Feb. 26, 2015-- ProtoKinetix (OTCQB:PKTX) (www.protokinetix.com) is pleased to announce that Julia Levy, PhD, co-founder of QLT, Inc., has accepted the position as head of its Business and Scientific Advisory Board.   Discoveries made by her and colleagues at the University of British Columbia in the field of photodynamic therapy were the basis of the first medical treatment of macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness among the elderly, a treatment was developed by QLT, Inc.

On Wednesday April 27, 2011, 7:00 am EDT  VANCOUVER, British Columbia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- ProtoKinetix (OTCBB:PKTX.ob - News) (www.protokinetix.com), is pleased to announce, that it has entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Imaginative Research Associates, Inc. to formulate a topical anti-inflammation product for the skin care market. Over the last 23-years Imaginative Research Associates, Inc. has successfully partnered with several large pharmaceutical dermatology and cosmetic companies and has licensed out patents and know-how to launch many leading products in the skin care arena. Naomi Vishnupad, Ph.D., is the President and COO of this Massachusetts based firm and has over 10-years of experience in the pharmaceutical industry in all areas of drug development. She has held positions in both big pharma, such as Wyeth Pharmaceuticals and Bristol-Myers Squibb, and small biotech companies. Naomi holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in immunology and a B.S. in biology.  Upon completion of this formulation, the Joint Venture will be able to offer a topical preparation to specifically address skin conditions caused by inflammation. Conditions such as dermatitis, psoriasis and eczema are often treated with applications of corticosteroids or immune modulators, both of which carry inherent, long term health risks. ProtoKinetix' AAGP™ has consistently demonstrated powerful anti-inflammatory properties without toxic side effects. The formulation and development of this therapeutic product line will offer hope for an effective prescription and over the counter preparations to combat these chronic inflammation causing diseases, while eliminating potential risks from many of the current front line treatments.    ProtoKinetix Receives Excellent Results from the University of British Columbia Eye Inflammation Study PRESS RELEASE >> September 21 - 2011 ProtoKinetix (OTCBB: PKTX) (www.protokinetix.com), is pleased to announce that it has received excellent results from the eye inflammation study conducted by UBC (University of British Columbia). The tests conducted by Dr. Gregory-Evans MD, PhD, FRCS, FRCOphth, were designed to determine whether the powerful anti-inflammatory AAGP™ molecule could be successfully delivered to inflamed areas throughout the eye. The result demonstrated that AAGP™ penetrates through the extremely protective barriers of the eye without side effects. ProtoKinetix has proven the ability of AAGP™ to protect human cells against inflammation causing agents. There are many forms of eye inflammation that are typically treated with an aggressive course of corticosteroids. Due, in part, to the short effective life of topical steroids, current treatments involve the application on an hourly basis. These powerful drugs can lead to numerous sight threatening complications. Dr. Gregory-Evans, a professor of Ophthalmology and Leadership Chair in Macular Research, concludes that AAGP™ penetrates the eye when topically applied as a twice a day or four times a day regimen. AAGP™ can be detected within the cornea and ciliary body. Drug was also seen to appear in retinal tissue, most convincingly when a four times a day regimen was used. These results represent a major step in the development of a potent, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drug.  Italian Laboratory Expands ProtoKinetix' Market for AAGP™ PRESS RELEASE >> December 07 - 2011   ProtoKinetix (OTCBB: PKTX) (www.protokinetix.com) is pleased to announce results from Areta International laboratory in Italy. These results show dramatic increases in the production of monoclonal antibodies when AAGP™ is incorporated into the production cycle. Monoclonal antibodies are one of the fastest growing sectors of the pharmaceutical industry. This market is presently over $50-billion USD per year and growing rapidly. As a therapeutic, monoclonal antibodies do not cause the same side-effects of chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Since the Company continues to focus on the anti-inflammation applications of AAGP™, they intend to partner the monoclonal antibody development to pharmaceutical laboratories. Monoclonal antibodies have proven themselves to be highly effective therapies and diagnostics, in a growing list of diseases. Access to this class of drug is extremely restricted, due to the prohibitive cost. In order for monoclonal antibodies to be universally available, the cost has to be aggressively reduced. Initial results from these tests demonstrate a 300% to 500% increase in monoclonal antibody production in the presence of AAGP™. This significant increase in yield, will result in major cost reductions for the treatment of cardio vascular disease, auto-immune disorders, leukemia, transplant rejection, cancer as well as numerous diagnostics.
