FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM) N/A     Market Cap $271.28 M     Shares Outstanding 17.67 M     Public Float 17.64 M     Yield SMHI has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.     Latest Dividend N/A     Ex-Dividend Date N/A       ?    Shares Sold Short The total number of shares of a security that have been sold short and not yet repurchased. Change from Last Percentage change in short interest from the previous report to the most recent report. Exchanges report short interest twice a month. Percent of Float Total short positions relative to the number of shares available to trade.      Short Interest (07/14/17)    Shares Sold Short 1.36 M     Change from Last  -1.32%      Percent of Float 7.68%       ?    Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.06      Net Money Flow ($)  25,648    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock. A ratio above one suggests greater buying pressure, below one suggests greater selling.

SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. Begins Trading on NYSE as an Independent Public Company, Symbol “SMHI”




















June 02, 2017 08:04 ET

 | Source: SEACOR HOLDINGS INC.






FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., June  02, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SEACOR Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CKH) (“SEACOR”) and SEACOR Marine Holdings Inc. (“SEACOR Marine”) today announced the successful completion of the spin-off of SEACOR Marine, finalizing the transition to SEACOR Marine’s status as an independent public company. Until this point a subsidiary of SEACOR, SEACOR Marine attained full independent status yesterday, June 1, 2017 at 11:59 p.m., New York City time. SEACOR Marine begins “regular-way” trading on NYSE today under the symbol “SMHI”. No action or payment is required by SEACOR stockholders to receive the shares of SEACOR Marine common stock. Stockholders who held SEACOR common stock on May 22, 2017, the record date for the spin-off, and who did not subsequently trade the entitlement to their SEACOR Marine shares, will receive a book-entry account statement reflecting their ownership of SEACOR Marine common stock or their brokerage account will be credited with the SEACOR Marine shares. Under the terms of the distribution agreement between SEACOR and SEACOR Marine, SEACOR distributed to holders of its common stock approximately 1.005 shares of SEACOR Marine common stock for each share of SEACOR common stock outstanding at the time of the spin-off (the "Final Distribution Ratio"). The Final Distribution Ratio is based on 17,576,227 shares of SEACOR common stock outstanding as of the time of the spin-off. As previously reported, the Final Distribution was calculated as follows: for every share of SEACOR common stock held, SEACOR distributed to holders of its common stock one share of SEACOR Marine common stock multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which was 17,671,356 and the denominator of which was the number of shares of SEACOR common stock outstanding at the time of the spin-off. SEACOR common stockholders will receive cash in lieu of any fractional shares they would otherwise have been entitled to receive in the distribution. The SEACOR Marine spin-off has been structured to qualify as a tax-free dividend to SEACOR stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. SEACOR stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax consequences of the SEACOR Marine spin-off. About SEACORSEACOR is a diversified holding company with interests in domestic and international transportation and logistics, alcohol manufacturing and merchandising, and risk management consultancy.

Generally, words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "believe," "plan," "target," "forecast" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements concern management's expectations, strategic objectives, business prospects, anticipated economic performance and financial condition and other similar matters. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual events or results may differ significantly from these statements. Actual events or results are subject to significant known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, including decreased demand and loss of revenues as a result of a decline in the price of oil and resulting decrease in capital spending by oil and gas companies, an oversupply of newly built offshore support vessels, additional safety and certification requirements for drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and delayed approval of applications for such activities, the possibility of U.S. government implemented moratoriums directing operators to cease certain drilling activities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and any extension of such moratoriums, weakening demand for SEACOR's services as a result of unplanned customer suspensions, cancellations, rate reductions or non-renewals of vessel charters or failures to finalize commitments to charter vessels in response to a decline in the price of oil, an oversupply of newly built offshore support vessels, increased government legislation and regulation of SEACOR's businesses could increase cost of operations, increased competition if the Jones Act is repealed, liability, legal fees and costs in connection with the provision of emergency response services, including SEACOR's involvement in response to the oil spill as a result of the sinking of the Deepwater Horizon in April 2010, decreased demand for SEACOR's services as a result of declines in the global economy, declines in valuations in the global financial markets and a lack of liquidity in the credit sectors, including, interest rate fluctuations, availability of credit, inflation rates, change in laws, trade barriers, commodity prices and currency exchange fluctuations, the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry, activity in foreign countries and changes in foreign political, military and economic conditions, including as a result of the recent vote in the U.K. to leave the European Union, changes in foreign and domestic oil and gas exploration and production activity, safety record requirements related to Offshore Marine Services and Shipping Services, decreased demand for Shipping Services due to construction of additional refined petroleum product, natural gas or crude oil pipelines or due to decreased demand for refined petroleum products, crude oil or chemical products or a change in existing methods of delivery, compliance with U.S. and foreign government laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations and economic sanctions, the dependence of Offshore Marine Services, Inland River Services, Shipping Services and Illinois Corn Processing on several key customers, consolidation of SEACOR's customer base, the ongoing need to replace aging vessels, industry fleet capacity, restrictions imposed by the Shipping Acts on the amount of foreign ownership of SEACOR's Common Stock, operational risks of Offshore Marine Services, Inland River Services and Shipping Services, effects of adverse weather conditions and seasonality, the level of grain export volume, the effect of fuel prices on barge towing costs, variability in freight rates for inland river barges, the effect of international economic and political factors on Inland River Services' operations, the effect of the spread between the input costs of corn and natural gas compared with the price of alcohol and distillers grains on Illinois Corn Processing's operations, adequacy of insurance coverage, the ability to remediate the material weaknesses SEACOR has identified in its internal controls over financial reporting, the attraction and retention of qualified personnel by SEACOR, and various other matters and factors, many of which are beyond SEACOR's and SEACOR Marine's control as well as those discussed in Item 1A (Risk Factors) of SEACOR's Annual report on Form 10-K and SEACOR Marine's registration statement on Form 10, and other reports filed by SEACOR and SEACOR Marine with the SEC. It should be understood that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the preceding should not be considered to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of the document in which they are made. SEACOR and SEACOR Marine disclaim any obligation or undertaking to provide any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in SEACOR's or SEACOR Marine's expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which the forward-looking statement is based, except as required by law. It is advisable, however, to consult any further disclosures SEACOR and SEACOR Marine make on related subjects in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K (if any). These statements constitute SEACOR's and SEACOR Marine's cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
