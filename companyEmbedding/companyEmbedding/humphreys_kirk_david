Education[edit]
Humphreys graduated from the University of Oklahoma in 1972 with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance.[5]
Career[edit]
From 1972 until 1989, Humphreys built a distribution business with his brothers that specialized in the distribution of beauty products and other non-food items to leading retailers across the United States.[5] In 1989 he founded The Humphreys Company, a real estate development and investment firm. Among the company's current projects are Carlton Landing, a 1,800-acre new town development on Lake Eufaula in southeastern Oklahoma, and The Wheeler District, the redevelopment of the 150-acre site of the former Downtown Airpark on the Oklahoma River near downtown Oklahoma City.[5]
Humphreys is chairman and principal of The Humphreys Fund, a real estate investment company with $200 million in assets in 14 southern states.
Humphreys is a director of OGE Energy Corp., vice chairman of The University of Oklahoma Board of Regents, chairman of the board of John W. Rex Charter Elementary School, vice-chairman of the Oklahoma City Airport Trust, vice-chairman of the Oklahoma Industries Authority and serves on the board of the Hough Ear Institute. He is a former trustee of the Urban Land Institute and was founding chairman of the Oklahoma District Council of ULI.
Politics[edit]
Humphreys was elected to the Putnam City School Board in 1987 and served until 1995.[5] In 1998, he was elected mayor of Oklahoma City and served two terms. As mayor, he changed the popular opinion of the downtown revitalization effort, known as Metropolitan Area Projects (or MAPS), to a more favorable view. This resulted in increased economic development and improved quality of living in the downtown Oklahoma City area and a move toward a second project, known as MAPS for Kids, aimed at a revitalization of the area's public schools.[6]
In 2004, Humphreys was a candidate in the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate and was considered a favorite for the party's nomination.[2][3] However, he was defeated by Tom Coburn with a vote of 61% to 25%.[4]
In 2008, Humphreys became co-host of "Flash Point," an award-winning locally-produced Sunday morning political talk show on Oklahoma City NBC affiliate KFOR-TV (channel 4), alongside co-host Mike Turpen and moderator Kevin Ogle.
Personal[edit]
In 1972, Humphreys married the former Danna Kircher of Stroud, Oklahoma. He and Danna have 3 children and 14 grandchildren. Humphreys' son, Grant Humphreys, is town founder of Carlton Landing [1], a new town development established in 2011 on Lake Eufaula in eastern Oklahoma. Humphreys' son, Blair Humphreys, is the director of the Wheeler District development. Humphreys' daughter, Annie Middlebrooks, lives in Oklahoma City and is a wife and mother. He was a childhood friend of Skip Bayless[7]
