Making Pickles - Julie's Kitchenette













































































Julie's KitchenetteGluten-free, vegan recipes, baking mixes, DIY and more!Making Pickles
October 9, 2011 By Julie Hasson 2 Comments 
As you can probably tell by now, I love making food from scratch. It’s so satisfying and fun. It can be customized to your palate and tastes, and is better than anything you could buy at a store.
A couple of months back, my daughter and I were at a local farm, paying for the buckets of fresh berries that we had just picked, when we spied a big basket of fresh, crisp pickling cukes. Sydney decided that she wanted me to show her how to make real Kosher dills, the kind you find table-side in Jewish delis. How could I refuse? First off, I’m a pickle fiend and secondly, she was leaving half the pickles with me.
Here’s the recipe that I make almost every summer. These pickles bare no resemblance to the softer, vinegar-flavored pickles found in grocery stores. These are the real deal, true deli-style salt-brined Kosher dill pickles. It took me a long time to find a recipe that fit this bill. I am happy to say though that it was not in vain.
In the early 1990’s a modern, hip-style deli opened in Santa Monica, California. The concept of the Broadway Deli was Jewish deli meets hip eatery. They had lots of inspired dishes on their menu, artisan breads and great desserts. In 1994, they came out with a cookbook, and right there in it’s pages was the recipe that I had been searching for: true, salt-brined Kosher dills.
I don’t think that the cookbook is any longer in print, so I’m going to post the recipe here. Feel free to add extra garlic and even dried or fresh chili peppers. We even tossed in a few sliced green tomatoes. I hope that you enjoy them as much as we do. They’re really quick and easy to make, and can be stored in your fridge for quite a while.
Broadway Deli’s Quick Dill Pickles
(Makes 10 to 12 pickles)
These pickles taste just like the one’s grandma used to make, only they’re faster and easier to prepare. To transform bumpy little cucumbers into crisp, garlicky dill pickles, place all of the ingredients in a jar, cover, and shake. In four days you’ll have the best dill pickles you’ve ever tasted.
4 quarts boiling water, for cleansing jar
3 tablespoons pickling spices
6 cloves garlic
10 to 12 firm, small pickling cucumbers (about 1 1/2 pounds)
1/4 cup Kosher salt (preferably Morton’s brand, which is saltier than others)
1 bunch fresh dill
1. Pour boiling water into a 1-gallon canning jar and pour out. Drop pickling spices and 3 of the garlic cloves into the bottom of the jar. Arrange cucumbers in the jar to fill just up to the neck. Top with salt, remaining 3 garlic cloves, and dill. Add cold water to cover. Cover securely with the lid. Shake well and let stand for 3 to 4 days in a cool, dark place before serving.
2. Refrigerate after 4 days to stop the pickling process. The pickles will keep for several weeks, covered, in the refrigerator.
Variation: Replace cucumbers with green tomatoes.
Recipe adapted from Judy Zeidler’s International Deli Cookbook; Great Recipes From The Broadway Deli, by Judy Zeidler, Chronicle Books, 1994
P.S. If you’re wondering why there is a plate in my pickle jar (in the photo), it’s because I doubled the recipe and topped the cukes with a plate. This helps to keep the pickles submerged in the brine.

  Testimonials - Beechen & Dill Homes                         Testimonials  Testimonials    programmers    2016-11-22T22:20:08+00:00 Mike & Julie M.“Our family is incredibly happy with our Beechen & Dill home. Everyone told us when we started to build a home how stressful it would be, but it couldn’t have been more enjoyable and stress-free. They walked us through step of the process, and did a great job explaining to us all of our different options in a way that was never overwhelming. The finished product was great, and we were very impressed with the overall quality of construction. We would highly recommend Beechen & Dill.”Jennifer & Bogdan D.“I am writing as a new homeowner of the Beechen & Dill Creekside Estates Community in Lockport. From day one the entire Beechen & Dill team has helped us every step of the way in the decision making process, answering all of our questions (there were many!), collaborating, and making compromises with us to assist in building our dream home. Their attention to detail, quality of work, and customer satisfaction are a priority and it has definitely showed through our experience with them. We spent a lot of time researching other builders in the area, and without a doubt would recommend Beechen & Dill to anyone as an outstanding home builder. We look forward to spending years to come in our beautiful home and couldn’t have done it without Beechen & Dill!”Kelly D.“I had a wonderful and stress-free experience building a home with Beechen & Dill. First of all, this is the first time I’ve purchased a brand new home and built it from the ground up. I have heard horror stories from friends about their experiences with other builders and was a bit nervous, but the Beechen & Dill team assured me that they could build what I wanted and meet the time frame that I requested.From the initial visit to the model home all the way up until the final walk through, I was extremely satisfied with the progress and professionalism of the entire team. Every time I had a question or wanted to inquire about adding an option, I would shoot an email and would receive a reply within 30 minutes. Every response was reassuring and knowledgeable. I was kept up to date on everything that was going on with the progress right down to the sodding of the lawn. And they got me into my home by the time I requested! I am happy with everything in the house. It’s beautiful, well made, and I would gladly recommend the Beechen & Dill team to anyone who is looking to build. I appreciate how well they took care of me.”Chris & Julie P.“We are Chris and Julie, the proud new owners of a soon-to-be-built Beechen & Dill home. We had been looking on the internet for new homes for a while before we came across the Beechen & Dill web site. We discovered that we could afford a beautiful new home that could be accustomed to our tastes. When we went to see the models, we met with the sales person who was a wonderful help. We were able to ask her every question that we could think of and receive her knowledgeable answers. She was willing to help us with everything that we needed. We are now anxiously awaiting our house to be built so that we can then make it our home.”Connie & Larry C.“Now that we are in and settled, I would like to say thank you to the entire staff at Beechen and Dill. Our experience with Beechen and Dill was pleasant and professional throughout the entire building period. We are thrilled with the final product Beechen and Dill delivered, and hope to share many years in our new home.”Mark & Meghan P.“I just wanted to say thank you to you and the entire Beechen & Dill team for building us a beautiful home. I am sure we will enjoy many years of great memories to come in this house. I especially want to let you know what a pleasure it was working with the sales and construction team on this project. They were a key part of making this (our first build) a great experience. Everything they said happened in the time frame that it was supposed to. As you know, I am in this business as well and have a lot of choices when it comes to builders, but we are so glad we selected Beechen & Dill Homes to build our home. You have a great team and a great reputation in this area. We will definitely help promote your future success to other prospective buyers.”Anita & Rich W.“The entire experience with Beechen & Dill was absolutely wonderful from the very beginning to the end. We give them gold stars for everything. We didn’t worry about a thing because we didn’t have to. It was a hassle-free experience.”
