(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Liquidity. The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as clearing commodity broker in separate Futures Interests trading accounts established for each Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade Futures Interests, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in Futures Interests may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single trading day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or option contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  Capital Resources. The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership's only assets are its (i) investments in the Funds, (ii) interest receivable and (iii) cash at bank. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in Futures Interests in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units.  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisors and the ability of each Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forwards and options markets.  Aventis trades its Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy (formerly, the Barbarian Program) on behalf of the Partnership. The Aventis Diversified Commodity Strategy is based on an ensemble of three discretionary subprograms:  PGR trades its PGR Mayfair Investment Program (formerly, the PGR Mayfair Program) on behalf of the Partnership. PGR's futures investment program seeks to profit over the medium term by exploiting inefficiencies in futures and forward markets across a broad range of asset classes and geographic regions. Proprietary models developed by the founding partners are implemented in an in-house trading system which systematically processes real-time data and executes trades automatically on electronic future exchanges and foreign exchange trading platforms.  Prior to its termination on January 31, 2016, Blenheim traded its Global Markets Strategy - Futures/FX on behalf of the Partnership. The objective of the Global Markets Strategy was to capture substantial profits through the establishment of risk controlled, strategic investment positions in markets where Blenheim had identified an unsustainable level of market disequilibrium that had not been reflected in the current market price. The essence of Blenheim's trading approach was its ability to use discretion in formulating the most effective mix of trading methodologies, investment vehicles, and markets to maintain performance objectives. As trading opportunities were identified, Blenheim analyzed potential trading applications in order to achieve maximum capital appreciation with prudent risk management procedures.  The following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the Partnership's net assets allocated to each Trading Advisor for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively, and the change during the applicable period.   Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Change December 31, September 30, December 31, September 30, during the Trading Advisor 2016 (%) 2016 (%) 2016 ($) 2016 ($) period (%) PGR 43.15% 51.69% $ 6,829,324 $ 10,215,492 (33.15)% Aventis 56.85 48.31 8,999,317 9,548,679 (5.75)  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisors or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisors' trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which requires the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on investment in BHM I, LLC, PGR Master Fund and MB Master Fund", respectively, for open contracts, and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on investment in BHM I, LLC, PGR Master Fund and MB Master Fund", respectively, when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The fair value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, General Partner fees, ongoing placement agent fees, incentive fees and brokerage fees, of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net asset value per Unit decreased 5.4% from $11.54 to $10.92. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Unit decreased 15.3% from $13.62 to $11.54. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit decreased 0.1% from $13.64 to $13.62.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $20,293 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Gains were primarily attributable to the Funds' trading of Futures Interests in energy, currencies, U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates and indices, and were partially offset by losses in grains, livestock, metals and softs. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership is disclosed under "Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The most significant losses were incurred in the metals sector during November from short positions in copper futures as prices moved higher amid speculation of increased global demand for industrial metals spurred by government fiscal policy. Additional losses were incurred from short positions in copper during September as prices rose after Chinese reports fueled speculation that demand for copper was increasing, while stockpiles decreased. Within the agricultural sector, losses were incurred during January from long positions in cocoa futures as prices tumbled as funds cut bets on higher prices and signs emerged that the crop in Ghana, the second-biggest cocoa producer, was recovering from a five-year low. Additional losses were incurred during July from long positions in soybean futures as prices were weighed down by mounting anticipation that growers were going to collect a record crop in 2016. The Partnership's trading losses for the year were partially offset by trading gains within global interest rate sector, primarily during June, from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced as uncertainty surrounding the economic and political fallout following the U.K.'s vote in late June to leave the European Union increased demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced during June from long positions in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the yen, which has long been considered a "safe haven" investment in times of market apprehension, rallied after the U.K. decided to leave the European Union. Additional gains were experienced during October from short positions in the British pound versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the pound continued to weaken due to concerns regarding the political and economic implications of the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union. Within the energy sector, gains were recorded during January from short futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices plunged as turmoil in Chinese markets and an expected increase in Iranian crude exports added to concerns that a global supply glut may continue.  The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $3,760,506 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Losses were primarily attributable to the Funds' trading of Futures Interests in U.S. and non-U.S. interest rates, livestock, metals and indices, and were partially offset by gains in currencies, energy, grains and softs.  The most significant losses were incurred in the metals markets during March from long positions in palladium futures as prices fell dramatically on weakening demand from China and a strengthening U.S. dollar. Additional losses during March were experienced from long positions in nickel and tin futures as prices declined amid concern of slowing industrial demand from China. Further losses in this sector were recorded during February from long positions in nickel futures as prices declined as data showed the metal's global oversupply widened, as well as during May and June from long positions in zinc, lead, and tin futures as Greece's debt crisis undermined confidence in the global growth outlook and threatened commodities demand. Within the global stock index sector, losses were incurred throughout most of the second half of the year from long positions in U.S., Pacific Rim, and European equity index futures as prices declined amid continuing concerns that China's slowdown will weigh on the global economy. Within the global interest rate sector, losses were incurred during the second quarter from long positions in European fixed income futures, specifically German bunds, as prices extended a decline as European leaders and the head of the International Monetary Fund agreed to step up the intensity of talks over Greece's financial fate. Additional fixed income losses were incurred during the fourth quarter from long positions in European fixed income futures after prices reversed sharply lower as European Central Bank ("ECB") president Mario Draghi disappointed markets early in December with an underwhelming ECB stimulus announcement. The Partnership's trading losses during the year were partially offset by trading gains within the energy markets, primarily during November and December, from short positions in crude oil futures as prices continued to decline as U.S. crude supplies rose and OPEC production increased, signaling the global supply glut will persist. Within the agricultural sector, gains were experienced primarily during February from long positions in cocoa futures as prices advanced amid speculation of reduced supply following periods of drought and disease in the Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's top cocoa growing regions. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced primarily during March from short positions in the Brazilian real versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the real dropped on concern a stalled Brazilian economy and fiscal weakness could lead to a sovereign debt downgrade. Additional currency gains were recorded from positions in the Canadian dollar and euro throughout the year.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $3,176,271 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains were primarily attributable to the Funds' trading of Futures Interests in currencies, energy, non U.S. interest rates, softs, indices and metals, and were partially offset by losses in U.S. interest rates, grains and metals.  The most significant gains were achieved within the soft commodities sector during January from long positions in cocoa futures as prices advanced to the highest level in more than 28 months after crop threats in Indonesia added to supply concerns. Gains were also recorded in the soft commodities sector during May and September from long positions in cocoa futures as prices rallied after industry reports indicated that the global supply shortfall would continue for the foreseeable future. Within the currency markets, gains were recorded primarily during September from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar advanced against the euro after strong economic indicators were reported in the U.S. Additional gains in the currency sector were experienced during December from short positions in the euro versus the U.S. dollar as the value of dollar surged after the release of stronger-than-expected economic data in the U.S. Within the global stock index sector, gains were experienced during February from long positions in U.S. and European equity index futures as prices advanced amid improving U.S. consumer confidence and speculation the Federal Reserve would continue to support the U.S. economy. Within the energy sector, gains were experienced during November and December from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices moved lower as U.S. oil production advanced to record levels and after OPEC decided not to reduce crude oil production amid a global supply glut. Within the metals sector, gains were experienced during February, March, April, and May from long positions in palladium futures as prices advanced on concern that sanctions against Russia, the world's biggest supplier of the metal, will trim supplies. This supply threat occurred as miners continued to strike in South Africa, the world's second-biggest palladium producer. A large portion of these gains in palladium were given back in September as prices reversed sharply lower. The Partnership's overall trading gains for the year were offset by trading losses within the global interest rate sector during August from short positions in U.S. fixed income futures as prices advanced as resurgent financial stress in Europe spurred demand for the relative "safety" of U.S. government debt. Additional losses in this sector were experienced from short positions in U.S. Treasury note futures during May. Within the grains sector, losses were incurred primarily during February from short positions in soybean futures as prices advanced after adverse weather conditions in the U.S. and Brazil lowered crop estimates.  For an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of 2016 trading results, refer to the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  The Partnership's gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Market Risk  The Partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. The Partnership trades futures contracts, options on futures and forward contracts and forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy and agricultural products. In entering into these contracts, the Partnership is subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the positions held by the Partnership at the same time, and the Trading Advisors were unable to offset positions of the Partnership, the Partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to 100% of their capital accounts.  In addition to the Trading Advisors' internal controls, the Trading Advisors must comply with the Partnership's trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained. The Trading Advisors and Ceres monitor the Partnership's trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and Ceres can require the Trading Advisors to modify positions of the Partnership if Ceres believes they violate the Partnership's trading policies.  Credit Risk  In addition to market risk, in entering into Futures Interests, there is a credit risk to the Partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. The ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the Partnership for futures, forward and options contracts traded in the United States, and most foreign exchanges on which the Partnership trades, is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its members or one of its member's customers, which should significantly reduce this credit risk. There is no assurance that a clearinghouse, exchange, or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the Partnership, and Ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the Partnership against a default by such parties. Further, the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the broker's customers. In cases where the Partnership trades off- exchange forward contracts with a counterparty, the sole recourse of the Partnership will be the forward contract's counterparty.  Ceres deals with these credit risks of the Partnership in several ways. First, Ceres monitors the Partnership's credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis. The commodity brokers inform the Partnership, as with all of their customers, of the Partnership's net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions, and Ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the Partnership's potential net credit exposure, exchange by exchange, by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange, if any, to the Partnership's margin liability thereon.  Second, the Partnership's trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the Partnership's trading, usually over several different products and exchanges. Historically, the Partnership's exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and, on those relatively few occasions where the Partnership's credit exposure climbs above such level, Ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis, carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate. Material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than  50% of Units then outstanding.  Third, with respect to Futures Interests trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which Ceres, together with MS&Co., has determined to be creditworthy. The Partnership presently deals with MS&Co., as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency forward contracts.  For additional information, see Note 5, "Financial Instruments" under "Notes to Financial Statements" in the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  Inflation has not been a major factor in the Partnership's operations.  Critical Accounting Policies.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of the Partnership's significant accounting policies is described in Note 2 to the Partnership's financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The Partnership's most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its investments in Futures Interests and U.S. Treasury bills, as applicable. The fair value of Futures Interests is determined by the various exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges. The fair value of non-exchange-traded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options, using as inputs the spot prices, interest rates, and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. U.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  The Partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of Futures Interests. The market-sensitive instruments held by the Partnership are acquired for speculative trading purposes only and, as a result, all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets are at risk of trading loss. Unlike an operating company, the risk of market-sensitive instruments is inherent to the primary business activity of the Partnership.  The Futures Interests traded by the Partnership involve varying degrees of related market risk. Market risk is often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of interest rates, exchange rates, and prices of financial instruments and commodities, factors that result in frequent changes in the fair value of the Partnership's open positions, and consequently in its earnings, whether realized or unrealized, and cash flow. Gains and losses on open positions of exchange-traded futures and exchange-traded forward contracts are settled daily through variation margin. Gains and losses on off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts and forward currency option contracts are settled upon termination of the contract. Gains and losses on off-exchange-traded forward currency option contracts are settled on an agreed-upon settlement date.  The Partnership's total market risk may increase or decrease as it is influenced by a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the diversification among the Partnership's open positions, the volatility present within the markets, and the liquidity of the markets.  The face value of the market sector instruments held by the Partnership is typically many times the applicable margin requirements. Margin requirements generally range between 2% and 15% of contract face value. Additionally, the use of leverage causes the face value of the market sector instruments held by the Partnership typically to be many times the total capitalization of the Partnership.  The Partnership's past performance is no guarantee of its future results. Any attempt to numerically quantify the Partnership's market risk is limited by the uncertainty of its speculative trading. The Partnership's speculative trading and use of leverage may cause future losses and volatility (i.e., "risk of ruin") that far exceed the Partnership's experience to date as discussed under the "Partnership's Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors" section and significantly exceed the Value at Risk tables disclosed.  Limited partners will not be liable for losses exceeding the current net asset value of their investment.  Quantifying the Partnership's Trading Value at Risk  The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Partnership's market risk exposures contain "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")). All quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for statements of historical fact.  . . .

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Series                                      
Monthly Report                                                                  
January 2001                                                                    

Dear Limited Partner:                                                           

The Net Asset Value per Unit for each of the six Morgan Stanley Dean Witter     
Spectrum Funds as of January 31, 2001 was as follows:                           

Funds               N.A.V.                   % change for month                 
Spectrum Commodity  $  7.52                 -4.14%                              
Spectrum Currency   $11.05                  -1.06%                              
Spectrum Global Balanced                    $16.35     0.57%                    
Spectrum Select     $23.89                   1.34%                              
Spectrum Strategic  $10.51                  -0.96%                              
Spectrum Technical  $15.96                  -0.83%                              

Spectrum Commodity                                                              

Spectrum Commodity decreased in value during January primarily due to           
losses recorded in the energy markets from long positions in natural gas        
futures as prices reversed their sharp upward trend amid bearish inventory      
data and moderate weather.  In the agricultural markets, losses were            
experienced from long corn and soybean meal futures positions as prices         
moved lower due to favorable South American weather.  A portion of these        
losses was offset by gains recorded in the soft commodities markets from        
long positions in cocoa futures as prices increased to a nine-month high        
supported by continuing concerns over falling production from Africa's          
Ivory Coast region.  In the metals markets, profits were recorded from long     
aluminum futures positions as prices moved higher amid technically based        
buying.                                                                         

Spectrum Currency                                                               

Spectrum Currency decreased in value during January primarily due to losses     
recorded early in the month from long positions in the South African rand,      
euro and Swiss franc versus the U.S. dollar as the value of these               
currencies weakened and the dollar gained support as several officials of       
the world's major central banks soothed fears of a hard economic landing in     
the U.S.  A portion of these losses was offset by gains recorded from short     
positions in the Japanese yen as the value of the yen declined to a 17-         
month low versus the U.S. dollar on continuing concerns for the Japanese        
economy.  Additional profits were recorded from short positions in the          
Singapore dollar as its value weakened relative to the U.S. dollar on the       
heels of the declining Japanese yen.                                            

Spectrum Global Balanced                                                        

Spectrum Global Balanced increased in value during January primarily due to     
gains recorded in the global interest rate futures markets from long            
eurodollar futures positions.  The upward move during January was largely       
attributed to a surprise interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve on       
January 3 and the subsequent anticipation of an additional rate cut by the      
Fed later in the month.  Gains were also recorded from long positions in        
Australian, European and Japanese interest rate futures.  In the global         
stock index futures markets, gains were recorded from long positions in DAX     
Index futures as the major stock markets in Europe moved higher after           
stronger-than-expected earnings reported in the U.S. boosted prices.  A         
portion of these gains was offset by losses recorded early in the month in      
the currency markets from long positions in the South African rand as the       
value of the rand weakened versus the U.S. dollar primarily due to the          
weakness in the euro.  In the metals markets, losses were incurred from         
short positions in copper and nickel futures as prices moved higher amid        
technically based factors.  In the energy markets, losses were experienced      
from long positions in natural gas futures as prices reversed their sharp       
upward trend amid bearish inventory data and moderate weather.                  

Spectrum Select                                                                 

Spectrum Select increased in value during January primarily due to gains

subsequent anticipation of an additional rate cut by the Fed later in the       
month.  Gains were also recorded from long positions in Japanese government     
bond futures as prices moved higher on concerns regarding that country's        
economy.  Additional profits were recorded from long positions in               
Australian and European interest rate futures.  A portion of these gains        
was offset by losses recorded in the energy markets from long positions in      
natural gas futures as prices reversed their sharp upward trend amid            
bearish inventory data and moderate weather.  Additional losses were            
recorded from short futures positions in crude oil and its related products     
as prices increased largely because of an announcement by OPEC that it          
would cut production.  In the agricultural markets, losses were experienced     
from long corn futures positions as prices moved lower due to favorable         
South American weather.

Additional losses were recorded from long natural gas futures positions as

incurred early in the month from long NASDAQ and S&P 500 Index futures          
positions as prices moved lower as earnings warnings and lingering economic     
jitters took the luster off the Federal Reserve interest rate-cut rally on      
January 3.  A portion of the Fund's overall losses for the month was offset     
by gains recorded in global interest rate futures markets from long             
positions in U.S. eurodollar futures.  The upward move during January was       
largely attributed to a surprise interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal

as several officials of the world's major central banks soothed fears of a

from short positions in the Japanese yen as the value of the yen declined       
to a 17-month low versus the U.S. dollar.  Gains were recorded in the

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                                 

Organization - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Commodity                   
L.P. ("Spectrum Commodity," formerly Morgan Stanley Tangible                   
Asset Fund L.P.), Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Currency                 
L.P. ("Spectrum Currency"), Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum                
Global Balanced L.P. ("Spectrum Global Balanced"), Morgan                      
Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Select L.P. ("Spectrum Select"),                  
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Strategic L.P. ("Spectrum
Strategic") and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Spectrum Technical                  
L.P. ("Spectrum Technical"), (individually, a "Partnership", or                
collectively, the "Partnerships"), are limited partnerships                    
organized to engage primarily in the speculative trading of                    
futures, forwards, and options contracts on physical                           
commodities and other commodity interests, including, but not                  
limited to foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals,                  
energy and agricultural products (collectively, "futures                       
interests").                                                                   

The general partner for each Partnership is Demeter Management                 
Corporation ("Demeter").  The non-clearing commodity broker for                
the Partnerships is Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. ("DWR").  The                   
clearing commodity brokers for the Partnerships are Morgan                     
Stanley & Co. Incorporated ("MS & Co.") and Morgan Stanley &                   
Co. International ("MSIL") which provide clearing and execution                
services.  Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Commodities Management,                  
Inc. ("MSCM") is the trading advisor to Spectrum Commodity.                    
Demeter, DWR, MS & Co., MSCM and MSIL are wholly-owned                         
subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.                               

Demeter is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the                   
equity of each Partnership and income (losses) are shared by                   
Demeter and the Limited Partners based upon their proportional                 
ownership interests.                                                           

Use of Estimates - The financial statements are prepared in                    
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the                
United States of America, which require management to make                     
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in                  
the financial statements and related disclosures.  Management                  
believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of the                 
financial statements are prudent and reasonable.  Actual                       
results could differ from those estimates.                                     

Revenue Recognition - Futures interests are open commitments                   
until settlement date.  They are valued at market on a daily                   
basis and the resulting net change in unrealized gains and                     
losses is reflected in the changes in unrealized profits                       
(losses) on open contracts from one period to the next in the                  
statements of operations.  Monthly, DWR pays interest income on                
80% of the month's average daily "Net Assets" (as defined in                   
the limited partnership agreements) of                                         
Spectrum Commodity, Spectrum Currency, Spectrum Select,                        
Spectrum Strategic and Spectrum Technical, and 100% in the case                
of Spectrum Global Balanced.  The interest rates used are equal                
to a prevailing rate on U.S. Treasury bills.  For purposes of                  
such interest payments, Net Assets do not include monies due                   
the Partnerships on futures interests, but not actually                        
received.                                                                      

Net Income (Loss) per Unit - Net income (loss) per unit of                     
limited partnership interest ("Unit(s)") is computed using the                 
weighted average number of Units outstanding during the period.                

Brokerage and Related Transaction Fees and Costs - The                         
brokerage fees for Spectrum Commodity, Spectrum Currency, and                  
Spectrum Global Balanced are accrued at a flat monthly rate of                 
1/12 of 4.6% (a 4.6% annual rate) of Net Assets as of the first
