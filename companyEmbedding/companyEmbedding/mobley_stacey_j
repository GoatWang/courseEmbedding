About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings™, please visit our Ratings Page on Martindale.com and our Frequently Asked Questions

About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.

1999 Stacey J. Mobley

Stacey J. Mobley (1946-) was Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and General Counsel at DuPont before retiring in 2008. He graduated from Howard University's School of Pharmacy in 1968, earned his law degree at Howard in 1971, and then joined DuPont Legal in 1972 after completing a fellowship program in community law in his hometown of Chester, Pa.







 
			



In 1983 he was named director of the Washington, D.C., office of DuPont External Affairs and three years later he became Vice President of External Affairs. In 1992 Mobley returned to Wilmington as Senior Vice President of External Affairs, and in 1999 was named DuPont General Counsel. Mobley also served as Senior Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer for the company. He was responsible for DuPont's legal and external affairs, as well as the company's operations in Mexico, and was one of the five senior executives comprising the Office of the Chief Executive.
 
In January 2001, Delaware Governor Ruth Ann Minner appointed Mobley to chair the state's Strategic Economic Council, a 22-member group established to study and promote Delaware's economic growth. Mobley also represented DuPont in a variety of community activities such as directing Delaware's statewide United Way campaign in 1998, and chairing the DuPont RiverFest in 2000 to raise funds for the Boys and Girls Clubs of Delaware. Mobley played a key role in implementing DuPont's highly successful diversity hiring and promotion programs, including programs in law, engineering and finance designed to encourage minority students to pursue careers in those fields.
