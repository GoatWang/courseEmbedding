Vadim Perelman (Russian: Вадим Перельман; born 8 September 1963) is a Ukrainian-born Canadian-American film director. Perelman made his feature film directorial debut in 2003 with House of Sand and Fog, following a successful career as a commercial director.

Early life and work[edit]
Born in Kiev, then part of the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union (now in Ukraine), Perelman was an only child who lived with his extended family in a communal flat. He is from a Jewish background. When Perelman was nine, his father was killed in a car accident. Five years later, he and his mother were granted permission to leave Kiev and lived in Vienna for two months before moving to Rome, where they lived in extreme poverty.[1]
Remembering that period, Perelman likens himself to the kids in Luis Buñuel's Los Olvidados — a street urchin "always searching for a hunk of bread or a scam to pull." He supported himself and his young mother in this fashion for a year. When a Canadian visa finally came, they left for that country where Perelman would ultimately build a new life and start his career.
Following some rather tumultuous teenage years, Perelman finally began to concentrate on his formal education.[2] He attended the University of Alberta, majoring in physics and maths, before a sophomore-year class in film-making completely changed his focus. Moving to Toronto, he studied film at Ryerson University's School of Image Arts for two years, before launching his own Toronto-based production house, called Canned Films. After honing his skills directing and editing music videos, he decided to make the move to Los Angeles to further his career.
Over the next three years, Perelman directed multinational television commercials for Microsoft, General Motors, Panasonic, Nike, Airwalk, AT&T, Sony PlayStation, Coors and MasterCard, and music videos including Kelly Clarkson's "Because Of You."
Film directorial career[edit]
Perelman is known for being very selective about his projects. "I don’t want to spend a year of my life working on a film that does not resonate with me on an emotional level. Since great scripts are a rare commodity, I realized that I have to create my own opportunities and not wait for the right project to come along — for fate to smile upon me."[this quote needs a citation]
With this in mind, Perelman began to option the film rights to literary works. He discovered House of Sand and Fog by Andre Dubus III before it was an acclaimed bestseller and an Oprah selection.[3] "I closed that book after I finished it, and through the tears managed to call my agent to check into the rights." Perelman got Shawn Otto to adapt the novel for the screen, and went on to attach Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly to the project, raised financing, and parked himself at the helm of his first feature film. DreamWorks acquired domestic distribution rights and released the film to great critical acclaim.
Perelman's second feature film, The Life Before Her Eyes, was shot in 2006 in Connecticut. The film, independently financed by 2929 Productions, stars Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood. It is based on the novel of the same name by Laura Kasischke. Emil Stern adapted the book for the screen. Perelman produced the film along with Aimee Peyronnet and Anthony Katagas.
In 2007, he was attached to the film adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.[4]

Vadim Perelman (Russian: Вадим Перельман; born 8 September 1963) is a Ukrainian-born Canadian-American film director. Perelman made his feature film directorial debut in 2003 with House of Sand and Fog, following a successful career as a commercial director. The film, nominated for three Academy Awards, also marks his first screenplay credit. Perelman was drawn to the story, having been shaped by his own immigrant experience.

Early life and work[edit]
Born in Kiev, then part of the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union (now in Ukraine), Perelman was an only child who lived with his extended family in a communal flat. He is from a Jewish background. When Perelman was nine, his father was killed in a car accident. Five years later, he and his mother were granted permission to leave Kiev and lived in Vienna for two months before moving to Rome, where they lived in extreme poverty.[1]
Remembering that period, Perelman likens himself to the kids in Luis Buñuel's Los Olvidados — a street urchin "always searching for a hunk of bread or a scam to pull." He supported himself and his young mother in this fashion for a year. When a Canadian visa finally came, they left for that country where Perelman would ultimately build a new life and start his career.
Following some rather tumultuous teenage years, Perelman finally began to concentrate on his formal education.[2] He attended the University of Alberta, majoring in physics and maths, before a sophomore-year class in film-making completely changed his focus. Moving to Toronto, he studied film at Ryerson University's School of Image Arts for two years, before launching his own Toronto-based production house, called Canned Films. After honing his skills directing and editing music videos, he decided to make the move to Los Angeles to further his career.
Over the next three years, Perelman directed multinational television commercials for Microsoft, General Motors, Panasonic, Nike, Airwalk, AT&T, Sony PlayStation, Coors and MasterCard, and music videos including Kelly Clarkson's "Because Of You."
Film directorial career[edit]
Perelman is known for being very selective about his projects. "I don’t want to spend a year of my life working on a film that does not resonate with me on an emotional level. Since great scripts are a rare commodity, I realized that I have to create my own opportunities and not wait for the right project to come along — for fate to smile upon me."[this quote needs a citation]
With this in mind, Perelman began to option the film rights to literary works. He discovered House of Sand and Fog by Andre Dubus III before it was an acclaimed bestseller and an Oprah selection.[3] "I closed that book after I finished it, and through the tears managed to call my agent to check into the rights." Perelman got Shawn Otto to adapt the novel for the screen, and went on to attach Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly to the project, raised financing, and parked himself at the helm of his first feature film. DreamWorks acquired domestic distribution rights and released the film to great critical acclaim.
Perelman's second feature film, The Life Before Her Eyes, was shot in 2006 in Connecticut. The film, independently financed by 2929 Productions, stars Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood. It is based on the novel of the same name by Laura Kasischke. Emil Stern adapted the book for the screen. Perelman produced the film along with Aimee Peyronnet and Anthony Katagas.
In 2007, he was attached to the film adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.[4]

Occupation
Film director


Vadim Perelman (Russian: Вадим Перельман; born 8 September 1963) is a Ukrainian-born Canadian-American film director. Perelman made his feature film directorial debut in 2003 with House of Sand and Fog, following a successful career as a commercial director. The film, nominated for three Academy Awards, also marks his first screenplay credit. Perelman was drawn to the story, having been shaped by his own immigrant experience.

Early life and work[edit]
Born in Kiev, then part of the Ukrainian SSR of the Soviet Union (now in Ukraine), Perelman was an only child who lived with his extended family in a communal flat. He is from a Jewish background. When Perelman was nine, his father was killed in a car accident. Five years later, he and his mother were granted permission to leave Kiev and lived in Vienna for two months before moving to Rome, where they lived in extreme poverty.[1]
Remembering that period, Perelman likens himself to the kids in Luis Buñuel's Los Olvidados — a street urchin "always searching for a hunk of bread or a scam to pull." He supported himself and his young mother in this fashion for a year. When a Canadian visa finally came, they left for that country where Perelman would ultimately build a new life and start his career.
Following some rather tumultuous teenage years, Perelman finally began to concentrate on his formal education.[2] He attended the University of Alberta, majoring in physics and maths, before a sophomore-year class in film-making completely changed his focus. Moving to Toronto, he studied film at Ryerson University's School of Image Arts for two years, before launching his own Toronto-based production house, called Canned Films. After honing his skills directing and editing music videos, he decided to make the move to Los Angeles to further his career.
Over the next three years, Perelman directed multinational television commercials for Microsoft, General Motors, Panasonic, Nike, Airwalk, AT&T, Sony PlayStation, Coors and MasterCard, and music videos including Kelly Clarkson's "Because Of You."
Film directorial career[edit]
Perelman is known for being very selective about his projects. "I don’t want to spend a year of my life working on a film that does not resonate with me on an emotional level. Since great scripts are a rare commodity, I realized that I have to create my own opportunities and not wait for the right project to come along — for fate to smile upon me."[this quote needs a citation]
With this in mind, Perelman began to option the film rights to literary works. He discovered House of Sand and Fog by Andre Dubus III before it was an acclaimed bestseller and an Oprah selection.[3] "I closed that book after I finished it, and through the tears managed to call my agent to check into the rights." Perelman got Shawn Otto to adapt the novel for the screen, and went on to attach Ben Kingsley and Jennifer Connelly to the project, raised financing, and parked himself at the helm of his first feature film. DreamWorks acquired domestic distribution rights and released the film to great critical acclaim.
Perelman's second feature film, The Life Before Her Eyes, was shot in 2006 in Connecticut. The film, independently financed by 2929 Productions, stars Uma Thurman and Evan Rachel Wood. It is based on the novel of the same name by Laura Kasischke. Emil Stern adapted the book for the screen. Perelman produced the film along with Aimee Peyronnet and Anthony Katagas.
In 2007, he was attached to the film adaptation of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Description:
Vadim Perelman makes his feature film directorial debut on House of Sand and Fog, following a successful career as a commercial director. The film also marks his first screenplay credit. Perelman was drawn to the story, having been shaped by his own immigrant experience.

Vadim Perelman makes his feature film directorial debut on House of Sand and Fog, following a successful career as a commercial director. The film also marks his first screenplay credit. Perelman was drawn to the story, having been shaped by his own immigrant experience.

Born in 1963 in Kiev, which was then part of the former Soviet Union, Perelman was an only child who lived with his immediate and extended family in a communal flat. When he was only nine years old, his father was tragically killed in a car accident. Five years later, Perelman and his mother were granted permission to leave Kiev, and arrived in Europe as refugees. Struggling to find a new home for themselves, they lived in Vienna for two months, followed by a year in Rome. During this time, Perelman survived as a street urchin, scraping up enough food and money to support himself and his mother as they waited for a visa to go to Canada. When it finally came, they left for the country where Perelman would ultimately build a new life and start his career.

Following some rather tumultuous teenage years, Perelman finally began to concentrate on his formal education. He attended the University of Alberta, majoring in physics and math, before a sophomore-year class in filmmaking completely changed his focus. Moving to Toronto, he studied at the Ryerson Film Institute for two years before launching his own Toronto-based production house. After honing his skills directing and editing music videos, he decided to make the move to Los Angeles to further his career. Over the next three years, Perelman established himself as an innovative and much sought-after director of commercials and music videos. His credits include a number of memorable spots for such multi-national clients as Microsoft, General Motors, Panasonic, Nike, Airwalk, AT&T, Sony Playstation, Coors and Mastercard. It was on his way back from a commercial location shoot that he first saw the book House of Sand and Fog in an airport store. After reading it on the plane, he knew immediately that it was the perfect project with which to make his segue to feature films.

Perelman is next set to direct The Talisman, a fantasy adventure to be produced by Steven Spielberg and Kathleen Kennedy.

					Director seeks assault probation
				












Perelman directed the Oscar-nominated House of Sand and Fog





The director of Oscar-nominated film  The House of Sand and Fog, Vadim Perelman, is seeking  probation on assault charges.

The Ukrainian director, 42, is charged with groping two women and punching another at a Connecticut nightclub. The incident allegedly took place in July.

Perelman asked the state's Superior Court on Monday for a type of probation called accelerated rehabilitation.

If granted, he would have no criminal record upon completing the probation.


"Mr Perelman never intended to harm anyone during the evening in question," said his attorney, Paul Callan.

House of Sand and Fog was nominated for three Oscars in 2003, including a best actor for Sir Ben Kingsley.

However the film, which centres around the story of an Iranian immigrant to the US, failed to take home any awards.

The case was adjourned until 16 October.

Ben Kingsley plays Massoud Amir Behrani, an Iranian immigrant living the United States. Even though he was a high-ranking official in Iran, he works several menial jobs in order to provide his wife, Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo), and his son, Esmail (Jonathan Ahdout), with an apartment in California. He buys a California bungalow, thinking he can fix it up, sell it again, and make enough money to send Esmail to college. However, the house is the legal property of former drug addict Kathy (Jennifer Connelly). After losing the house in an unfair legal dispute with the county, she is left with nowhere to go. Wanting her house back, she hires a lawyer (Frances Fisher) and befriends a police officer (Ron Eldard). Neither Kathy nor Behrani have broken the law, so they find themselves involved in a difficult moral dilemma.

Meet Eddie Lampert's biggest fan


Edward Lampert has at least one fan in high finance these days. Vadim Perelman, 31, founder of Los Angeles-based hedge fund Baker Street Capital, first made news in September when he published a bullish report about Sears Holdings Corp.'s real estate portfolio. Yesterday, he increased his stake in the company to 10.8 percent, according to regulatory filings, lifting his holdings to 11.5 million shares and options.His 2 million shares are worth $93.4 million and his total holdings would be valued at almost $540 million assuming the options are priced at the same level as the stock. Baker Street now ranks as the eighth-largest investor in Sears, according to Bloomberg data. Regulatory filings indicate Baker Street owned 1.5 million shares of Sears common as of June 30, purchased in the second quarter and equivalent to a 1.4 percent interest. Mr. Lampert remains Sears' top stockholder, owning 48 percent of the Hoffman Estates-based department store chain.Mr. Perelman's report estimated that Sears' real estate is "conservatively worth" more than $8.6 billion — a 68 percent premium over the entire company's current market cap of $5.1 billion, at $46.86 a share. Some $7.3 billion, the equivalent to $69 a share, was attributed to Sears' top 350 owned stores and best 50 leases. The report garnered media attention, including two mentions in the Wall Street Journal, and Sears' stock climbed to a 52-week high of $67.50 less than two months after the report was published.Since then, one analyst has argued that Mr. Perelman's valuation of at least one property was too high. Chad Brand, founder of St. Louis-based Peridot Capital LLC, wrote that Mr. Perelman and Baker Street pegged Sears' lease at Toronto's Eaton Center as worth $590 million. But less than two months later, Sears decided to sell the lease, along with four others, back to the landlord for a total of $400 million.As Mr. Brand wrote in a blog post: "Even if you assume Eaton Center was by far the most valuable of the five stores (let's say $300 million versus $25 million each for the other four), Baker Street likely overestimated its value by 100 percent."Mr. Perelman, reached by phone last night, fired back, saying that the $590 million number was simply "illustrative" and that Sears Canada property was not figured into his report's formal $8.6 billion valuation. Moreover, he pointed out that the Eaton Center sale was only for about half of the property — Sears handed over the first four floors and kept floors five through eight — meaning that the property's total value was closer to his estimate than Mr. Brand asserted. Mr. Perelman remains adamant that Sears is a great value right now. Most other analysts have valued Sears at $20 to $55 a share; Mr. Perelman said he stands behind his estimate that shares are worth $92 to $169. "We clearly love the investment and we clearly added to it," Mr. Perelman said. "We think people completely misunderstand and underestimate Eddie.""We think the margin of safety here is better than anything we've found in the public markets," he continued. "We feel the extent to which everyone has focused on negative same-store sales is very myopic."In October, Barron's studied Baker Street's stake (see bottom of page) in Sears, noting that it had purchased call options on 7 million Sears shares in January. According to an expert who ran the numbers, Baker Street's position will produce a profit only if Sears stock trades above $60 during the options' two-year contract.Sears stock closed yesterday at $46.86, down nearly 2 percent.
