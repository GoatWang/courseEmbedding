	. BUSINESS.




	﻿




	General




	﻿




	Embassy Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the “Bank”) in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow.




	﻿




	The Bank, which is the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank’s primary market area.




	﻿




	Mission




	﻿




	The Company provides a traditional range of financial products and services to meet the depository and credit needs of individual consumers, small and medium sized businesses and professionals in its market area. As a locally owned and operated community bank, there is a strong focus on service that is highly personalized, efficient and responsive to local needs. It is the intention of the Company to deliver its products and services with the care and professionalism expected of a community bank and with a special dedication to personalized service. To create this environment, the Company employs


	an experienced,


	well-trained, highly motivated staff,


	with


	interest in building quality client relationships using state-of-the-art delivery systems and client service facilities. The Company’s senior management has extensive banking experience


	and establishes


	the


	Company’s goal


	to serve the financial needs of its clients and provide a profitable return to its investors, consistent with safe and sound banking practices.


	   


	The Company focuses on


	obtaining


	and retaining customer relationships by offering a broad range of financial services, competitively-priced and d


	elivered in a responsive manner,


	 


	with emphasis


	 


	to


	understand the financial needs of


	its


	customers.




	﻿




	Correspondent relationships are utilized where it is cost beneficial. The specific objectives of the Company are: 1) to provide individuals, professionals and local businesses with the highest standard of relationship banking in the local market; 2) to attract deposits and loans by offering state of the art products and services with competitive pricing; 3) to provide a reasonable return to shareholders on capital invested; and 4) to attract, train and retain a happy, motivated and team oriented group of banking professionals dedicated to meeting the Company’s objectives.




	﻿




	Market “Niche”




	﻿




	The Company provides the traditional array of commercial banking products and services emphasizing


	a  


	one-on-one


	, sit down approach, for the delivery of products and services


	to consumers and businesses located in Lehigh and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania. In the Company’s primary market area, which is dominated by offices of large statewide, regional and interstate banking institutions, banking services that are furnished in a friendly and courteous manner with a timely response to customer needs fill a “niche” that arises due to the loss of local institutions through merger and acquisitions.


	 




	﻿




	Deposits




	﻿




	The Company offers small business cash management services to help local companies better manage their cash flow, in order for the Company to attract and retain stable deposit relationships. The expertise and experience of the Company’s management coupled with the latest technology accessed through third party providers enables the Company to maximize the growth of business-related deposits.

	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	As for consumers, deposit growth is driven by a variety of factors including, but not limited to, population growth, bank and non-bank competition,


	local bank mergers and consolidations,


	increase in household income, interest rates, accessibility of location and the sales efforts of Company personnel. Time deposits can be attracted and/or increased by paying an interest rate higher than that offered by competitors, but they are the most costly type of deposit. The most profitable type of deposits are non-interest bearing demand (checking) accounts which can be attracted by offering free checking. However, both high interest rates and free checking accounts generate certain expenses for a bank and the desire to increase deposits must be balanced with the need to be profitable. The deposit services of the Company are generally comprised of demand deposits, savings deposits, money market deposits, time deposits and Individual Retirement Accounts.




	﻿




	Loans




	﻿




	The loan portfolio of the Company consists primarily of secured fixed-rate and variable-rate loans, with a significant con


	centration in commercial real estate


	transactions and consumer residential


	real estate


	mortgage and home equity loans. While most credit facilities are appropriately collateralized, major emphasis is placed upon the financial condition of the borrower and evaluating the borrower’s cash flow versus debt service requirements. The Company has an experienced lending


	and private banking


	team. The Company believes that the familiarity of its experienced management team and members of the Company’s Loan Committee with prospective local borrowers enables the Company to better evaluate the character, integrity and creditworthiness of the prospective borrowers.




	﻿




	Loan growth is driven by customer demand, which in turn is influenced by individual and business indebtedness and consumer demand for goods. The Company’s loan


	and private banking


	officers call upon accountants, financial planners, attorneys, local realtors and others to generate loan referrals. Again, a


	balance between growth, credit risk and pricing is required


	to maintain performing loans


	 


	for the Company


	,


	as


	lending


	money will always entail some risk.


	A performing loan is a loan which is being repaid according to its original terms and is the most desirable type of loan that a bank seeks to make.


	Without


	loans


	a bank cannot generate enough earnings to be profitable. The risk involved in each loan must, therefore, be carefully evaluated before the loan is made. The interest rate at which the loan is made should always reflect the risk factors involved, including the term of the loan, the value of collateral, if any, the reliability of the projected source of repayment and the amount of the loan requested. Credit quality will always be the Company’s most important factor.




	﻿




	The Company does not sell its mortgages into the secondary market,


	has not been involved in any “sub-prime” mortgage lending


	,


	and has not purchased or invested in any securities backed by or which include sub-prime loans.


	 




	﻿




	Business Lending




	﻿




	The Company


	 


	generally target


	s


	businesses with annual revenues of less than $10 million


	, including


	business owners, legal


	,


	and medical professionals.


	The Company offers responsiveness, flexibility and local decision making for loan applications of small business owners thereby eliminating delays caused by non-local management. The Company participates in local, state and federal loan programs.




	﻿




	Consumer Lending




	﻿




	The Company offers its retail customer base a product line of consumer loan services including mortgage loans, secured home equity loans, lines of credit, auto loans, and to a much lesser extent, unsecured personal loans.




	﻿




	Residential Mortgage Loans




	﻿




	The Company offers a range of specialty home equity and mortgage products at competitive rates


	, which are retained and serviced by the Company


	. The Company seeks to capitalize on its policy of closing loans in a time frame that will meet the needs of its borrowers.

	Commercial Mortgage/Construction Loans




	﻿




	The Company originates various types of loans secured by real estate, including, to a limited extent, construction loans. Construction loans are generally priced at floating rates tied to current market rates. Upon completion of construction, these loans may be converted into permanent commercial and residential loans. Construction lending is expected to constitute a minor portion of the Company’s loan portfolio.




	﻿




	In some cases, the Company originates loans larger than its lending limit and enters into participation arrangements for those loans with other banks.




	﻿




	As an independent community bank, the Company serves the special needs of legal, medical, accounting, financial service providers and other professionals. Commercial mortgages, lines of credit, term loans and demand loans are tailored to meet the needs of the Company’s customers in the professional community. In addition to the usual criteria for pricing credit-related products, the Company takes into consideration the overall customer relationship to establish credit pricing. Deposit relationships in demand, savings, money market, and certificate accounts are considered in loan pricing along with the credit worthiness of the borrower.




	﻿




	Other Services




	﻿




	To further attract and retain customer relationships, the Company provides or will provide the standard array of financial services expected of a community bank, which include the following:




	﻿








	﻿





	 









	Treasurer Checks






	Remote Deposit Capture








	Certified Checks






	Mobile Banking

	Commercial Credit Cards








	Escrow Management Services




	Safe Deposit Boxes






	ATM and Debit Cards




	Fraud Detection Services









	﻿




	Fee Income




	﻿




	Fee income is non-interest related. The Company earns fee income by charging customers for banking services, credit card and merchant processing, treasurer’s checks, overdrafts, wire transfers, bond coupon redemptions, and check orders, as well as other deposit and loan related fees.


	 


	Unlike many in the industry, t


	he


	C


	ompany does not sell its mortgages on the secondary market, nor does it offer trust or investment/brokerage services to its customers


	to generate fee income


	.




	﻿




	Community Reinvestment Act




	﻿




	The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”) is designed to create a system for bank regulatory agencies to evaluate a depository institution’s record in meeting the credit needs of its community. The Company had its last


	CRA examination in 201


	5


	and received


	a “satisfactory” rating.




	﻿




	The Company’s Directors and Officers are committed to reaching out to the community in which they live and work. The personal, business and community rewards for helping local residents and businesses are numerous. The Board is dedicated to recognizing an ongoing commitment and understanding of the Company’s responsibility under the CRA. The Company is committed to providing access to credit and deposit products for all members of the communities that it serves.

	Market


	Area




	﻿




	The Company is headquartered in Hanover Township, Northampton County


	,


	Pennsylvania and draws its primary deposits and business from areas immediately surrounding its principal office and its branch offices in South Whitehall Township, Lower Macungie Township, the City of Bethlehem, Salisbury Township, Lower Saucon Township, Lower Nazareth Township and Borough of Nazareth, Pennsylvania, as well as the remainder of Lehigh and Northampton Counties in Pennsylvania.




	﻿




	According to FDIC data the Company ranks 6


	th


	in market share in Northampton County, with four


	(4)


	offices, and 7


	th


	in Lehigh County with four


	(4)


	offices


	,


	with


	 a


	combined


	deposit


	market share of 5.94%


	for both


	counties. The Company believes there is significant room for


	organic


	growth in its current market area of Lehigh and Northampton


	C


	ounties.


	 


	The Company


	continually evaluates strategic locations for


	branch offices


	within


	the Lehigh Valley,


	which are


	supplemented by convenient access through electroni

	, for both consumer and commercial customers


	.

	Bank Premises




	﻿




	The Company leases each of its bank operations premises, situated at the following locations:

	Northampton County:

	The Company pays certain additional expenses of occupying these spaces including, but not necessarily limited to, real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and repairs. The Company is obligated under the leases to maintain the premises in good order, condition and repair.

	Employees




	﻿




	As of December 31, 2016, the Company had a


	total of


	83


	full-time equivalent employees.




	﻿




	Competition




	﻿




	The banking business is highly competitive. The Company competes with local banks as well as numerous regionally based commercial banks, most of which have assets, capital and lending limits far larger than those of the Company. The Company also competes with savings banks, savings and loan associations, money market funds, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, regulated small loan companies, credit unions and with the issuers of commercial paper and other securities. The industry competes primarily in the area of interest rates, products offered, customer service and convenience.




	﻿




	Among the advantages many of the Company’s competitors have over the Company are larger asset and capital bases, the ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns and to allocate their investment assets to regions of highest yield and demand. Larger companies have market presence in the form of more branch offices. The Company’s growth in number of offices has improved its ability to compete in the market. The Company believes it is able to compete with the market in terms of interest rate and level of customer service, as reflected in growth in market share. Many competitors offer certain services such as trust services, investment services and international banking that are

	not offered directly by the Company and, by virtue of their greater capital, most competitors will have substantially higher lending limits than those of the Company.

	rtunities for the Company to build new customer relationships.




	﻿




	Segments




	﻿




	The Company acts as an independent community financial services provider and offers traditional banking and related financial services to individual, business and government customers. The Company offers a full array of commercial and retail financial services, including the taking of time, savings and demand deposits; the making of commercial, consumer, residential mortgage and home equity loans; and the providing of other financial services.




	﻿




	Management does not separately allocate expenses, including the cost of funding loan demand, between commercial and retail operations of the Company. As such, discrete financial information is not available and segment reporting would not be meaningful.




	﻿




	Seasonality




	﻿




	Management does not feel that the deposits, loans, or the business of the Company are seasonal in nature. Deposit and loan generation may, however, vary with local and national economic and market conditions


	 


	which


	should not have a material effect on planning and policy making.




	﻿




	Supervision and Regulation




	﻿




	The Company is subject to extensive regulation under federal and Pennsylvania banking laws, regulations and policies, including prescribed standards relating to capital, earnings, dividends, the repurchase or redemption of shares, loans or extensions of credit to affiliates and insiders, internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, asset growth, impaired assets and loan-to-value ratios. The Bank regulatory framework is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking systems as a whole, and not for the protection of security holders.




	﻿




	The following summary sets forth certain of the material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries and provides certain specific information about the Company and the Bank. It does not describe all of the provisions of the statutes, regulations and policies that are identified. To the extent that the following information describes statutory and regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by express reference to each of the particular statutory and regulatory provisions. A change in applicable statutes, regulations or regulatory policy may have a material effect on the business of the Company.




	   




	Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act




	﻿




	As a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which became law on July 21, 2010, there is additional regulatory oversight and supervision of the Company and the Bank.  The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act includes, and the regulations being developed thereunder will include, provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike, including several provisions that affect the regulations of community banks and bank holding companies.




	The Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposed new capital requirements on bank holding companies; changed the base for FDIC insurance assessments to a bank’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, rather than upon its deposit base; permanently raised the current standard deposit insurance limit to $250,000; and expanded the FDIC’s authority to raise insurance premiums.  The legislation also calls for the FDIC to raise its ratio of reserves to deposits from 1.15% to 1.35% for deposit insurance purposes by September 30, 2020 and to “offset the effect” of increased assessments on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion.




	The Dodd-Frank Act also includes provisions that affect corporate governance and executive compensation at all publicly-traded companies and allows financial institutions to pay interest on business checking accounts.  The

	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	legislation also restricts proprietary trading, places restrictions on the owning or sponsoring of hedge and private equity funds, and regulates the derivatives activities of banks and their affiliates.  The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Financial Stability Oversight Council to identify threats to the financial stability of the U.S., promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system.




	Consumer Financial Protection Bureau




	The Dodd-Frank Act also establishes the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) as an independent entity within the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”). The CFPB has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services, including deposit products, residential mortgages, home-equity loans and credit cards. The CFPB’s rules contain provisions on mortgage-related matters such as steering incentives, and determinations as to a borrower’s ability to repay, loan servicing, and prepayment penalties.




	On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final regulation defining a “qualified mortgage” for purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act, and setting standards for mortgage lenders to determine whether a consumer has the ability to repay the mortgage. This regulation, which became effective on January 10, 2014, also affords safe harbor legal protections for lenders making qualified loans that are not “higher priced.” On January 17, 2013, the CFPB issued a final regulation containing new mortgage servicing rules applicable to our bank subsidiary, which took effect on January 10, 2014. The announced goal of the CFPB is to bring greater consumer protection to the mortgage servicing market. These changes affect notices to be given to consumers as to delinquency, foreclosure alternatives, modification applications, interest rate adjustments and options for avoiding “force-placed” insurance. Servicers are prohibited from processing foreclosures when a loan modification is pending, and must wait until a loan is more than 120 days delinquent before initiating a foreclosure action.




	The servicer must provide direct and ongoing access to its personnel, and provide prompt review of any loss mitigation application. Servicers must maintain accurate and accessible mortgage records for the life of a loan and until one year after the loan is paid off or transferred. We expect these new standards to add to the cost of conducting our mortgage servicing business.




	Capital Adequacy




	In July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve approved a new rule substantially amend


	ing


	the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.




	﻿




	The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating these ratios. The new minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%


	;


	(iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.


	In January 2016, t


	he new capital conservation buffer requirement


	started being phased


	in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.




	   




	In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion. All other bank holding companies are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least 4%.

	current


	 


	capital rules are: common equity of 6.5%, Tier 1 leverage of 5%, Tier 1 risk-based capital of 8%, and Total Risk-Based capital of 10%.

	Bank Holding Company Regulation




	﻿




	As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to regulation and examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the “Pennsylvania Department of Banking”) and the Federal Reserve Board.  The Company is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board an annual report and such additional information as the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). The BHC Act requires each bank holding company to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it may acquire substantially all the assets of any bank, or before it may acquire ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if, after such acquisition, it would own or control, directly or indirectly, more than five percent of the voting shares of such bank. Such a transaction may also require approval of the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. Pennsylvania law permits Pennsylvania bank holding companies to control an unlimited number of banks.

	Pursuant to provisions of the BHC Act and regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board thereunder, the Company may only engage in or own companies that engage in activities deemed by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto, and the holding company must obtain permission from the Federal Reserve Board prior to engaging in most new business activities.




	﻿




	A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by the BHC Act on any extensions of credit to the bank or any of its subsidiaries, investments in the stock or securities thereof, and on the taking of such stock or securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. A bank holding company and its subsidiaries are also prevented from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property or furnishing of services.




	﻿




	Under the Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations, a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner.  In addition, in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks, a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks. A bank holding company’s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve Board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve Board regulations or both. This doctrine is commonly known as the “source of strength” doctrine.

	Regulation of Embassy Bank for the Lehigh Valley




	﻿




	Embassy Bank for the Lehigh Valley is a Pennsylvania-chartered banking institution and is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”). Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank’s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, the loans a bank makes and collateral it takes, the maximum interest rates a bank may pay on deposits, the activities of

	a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations, and the establishment of branches, and management practices and other aspects of banking operations.

	Dividend Restrictions




	﻿




	The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank. Declaration and payment of cash dividends depends upon cash dividend payments to the Company by the Bank, which is the Company’s primary source of revenue and cash flow. Accordingly, the right of the Company, and consequently the right of our creditors and shareholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary, except to the extent that claims of the Company in its capacity as a creditor may be recognized.




	﻿




	As a Pennsylvania chartered bank, the Bank is subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under the Pennsylvania Banking Code. Further, the ability of banking subsidiaries to pay dividends is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements. See Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements included at Item 8 of this Report.




	﻿




	The payment of dividends by the Bank and the Company may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a depository institution’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991, a depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide that bank holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Federal banking regulators have the authority to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying a dividend if the regulators deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice.




	﻿




	Capital Adequacy and Operations




	﻿




	Enacted in 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) contains provisions limiting activities and business methods of depository institutions. FDICIA required the primary federal banking regulators to promulgate regulations setting forth standards relating to, among other things, internal controls and audit systems; credit underwriting and loan documentation; interest rate exposure and other off-balance sheet assets and liabilities; and compensation of directors and officers. FDICIA also provided for expanded regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates, including parent holding companies, by such institutions’ primary federal banking regulator. Each primary federal banking regulator is required to specify, by regulation, capital standards for measuring the capital adequacy of the depository institutions it supervises and, depending upon the extent to which a depository institution does not meet such capital adequacy measures, the primary federal banking regulator may prohibit such institution from paying dividends or may require such institution to take other steps to become adequately capitalized.




	﻿




	FDICIA established five capital tiers, ranging from “well capitalized” to “critically under-capitalized”. A depository institution is well capitalized if it significantly exceeds the minimum level required by regulation for each relevant capital measure. Under FDICIA, an institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market; in addition, “pass through” insurance coverage may not be available for certain employee benefit accounts. FDICIA also requires an undercapitalized depository institution to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal bank regulatory agency. One requisite element of such a plan is that the institution’s parent holding company must guarantee compliance by the institution with the plan, subject to certain limitations. In the event of the parent holding company’s bankruptcy, the guarantee, and any other commitments that the parent holding company has made to federal bank regulators to maintain the capital of its depository institution subsidiaries, would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority in payment.




	﻿




	At December 31, 2016, the Bank qualified as “well capitalized” under these regulatory capital standards. See Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included at Item 8 of this Report.

	Community Reinvestment Act




	﻿




	Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the FDIC is required to assess the record of all financial institutions regulated by it to determine if these institutions are meeting the credit needs of the community (including low and moderate income neighborhoods) which they serve. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches. The Bank has a current CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”




	   




	Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders




	﻿




	The Bank also is subject to the restrictions of Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O adopted by the Federal Reserve Board. Section 23A requires that loans or extensions of credit to an affiliate, purchases of securities issued by an affiliate, purchases of assets from an affiliate (except as may be exempted by order or regulation), the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral and the issuance of a guarantee or acceptance of letters of credit on behalf of an affiliate (collectively, “Covered Transactions”) be on terms and conditions consistent with safe and sound banking practices. Section 23A also imposes quantitative restrictions on the amount of and collateralization requirements on such transactions. Section 23B requires that all Covered Transactions and certain other transactions, including the sale of securities or other assets to an affiliate and the payment of money or the furnishing of services to an affiliate, be on terms comparable to those prevailing for similar transactions with non-affiliates.




	﻿




	Section 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act impose similar limitations on loans and extensions of credit from the bank to its executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and any of their related interests. The limitations restrict the terms and aggregate amount of such transactions. Regulation O implements the provisions of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) and requires maintenance of records of such transactions by the bank and regular reporting of such transactions by insiders. The FDIC also requires the bank, upon request, to disclose publicly loans and extensions of credit to insiders in excess of certain amounts.




	 




	Deposit Insurance and Premiums




	﻿




	The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits per insured depositor by the FDIC. In October 2008, the FDIC increased FDIC deposit insurance coverage per separately insured depositor for all account types to $250,000.


	This increase


	was


	 


	extended permanently through the Dodd-Frank Act.




	﻿




	As a FDIC member institution, the Bank’s deposits are insured to


	the


	maximum of $250,000 per depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) that is administered by the FDIC and each institution is required to pay


	quarterly


	deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.




	﻿




	The Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 recapitalized the Savings Association Insurance Fund (“SAIF”) and provided that DIF deposits would be subject to one-fifth of the assessment to which SAIF deposits are subject for FICO bond pay


	ments. Beginning in 2000, DIF deposits and SAIF deposits were subject to the same assessment for FICO


	bonds. The FICO assessment for the Bank for 2016 was


	less than


	$0.01 for each $100 of DIF deposits.




	﻿




	In February 2011, the FDIC adopted final rules to implement changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to the FDIC assessment rules.  In particular, the definition of an institution’s deposit insurance assessment base changed from total deposits to total assets less tangible equity.  In addition, the FDIC decreased deposit insurance assessment rates, effective April 1, 2011.  The


	revised


	initial base assessment rates range from 5 to 9 basis points for Risk Category I banks to 35 basis points for risk category IV banks.  Risk Category II and III banks will have an initial base assessment rate of 14 or 23 basis points, respectively.  The


	revised


	rates and assessment base


	had a positive effect by lowering


	the FDIC insurance assessment rate paid by the Bank.  However, if the risk category of the Bank changes adversely, FDIC insurance premiums paid by the Bank could increase.




	﻿




	On April 26, 2016, the FDIC adopted a rule amending small institution pricing for


	t


	he


	Deposit Insurance Fund Reserve Ratio, (“DIF”),


	which


	would be


	effective the quarter


	following the date on which


	the


	DIF


	reserve ratio

	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	reaches 1.15%.


	On June 30, 2016, the DIF rose to 1.17%. FDIC regulations provide for changes in deposit insurance assessments the quarter after the reserve ratio first reaches or surpasses 1.15%, or the third quarter 2016 which will be reflected in the Company’s December 2016 assessment payable March 30


	th


	, 2017.




	﻿




	Other Federal Laws and Regulations




	﻿




	State usury and credit laws limit the amount of interest and various other charges collected or contracted by a bank on loans. The Bank’s loans are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the following:




	﻿




	﻿












	·










	Federal Truth-In-Lending Act, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
















	·










	Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligations to meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
















	·










	Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibitive factors in extending credit;
















	·










	Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which requires lenders t


	o disclose certain information


	regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements, and prohibits certain lending practices, as well as limits escrow account amounts in real estate transactions;
















	·










	Fair Credit Reporting Act governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; and
















	·










	Various rules and regulations of various federal agencies charged with the implementation of such federal laws.








	﻿




	Additionally, the Company’s operations are subject to additional federal laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions, including, without limitation:




	﻿












	·










	Privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and related regulations, which require the Company to maintain privacy policies intended to safeguard customer financial information, to disclose the policies to the Company’s customers and to allow customers to “opt out” of having their financial service providers disclose their confidential financial information to non-affiliated third parties, subject to certain exceptions;
















	·










	Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
















	·










	Consumer protection rules for the sale of insurance products by depository institutions, adopted pursuant to the requirements of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act; and
















	·










	USA Patriot Act, which requires financial institutions to take certain actions to help prevent, detect and prosecute international money laundering and the financing of terrorism.








	﻿




	Effective July 1, 2010, a federal banking rule under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act prohibited financial institutions from charging consumers fees for paying overdrafts on automated teller machines (“ATM”) and one-time debit card transactions, unless a consumer consents, or opts in, to the overdraft service for those type of transactions. If a consumer does not opt in, any ATM transaction or debit that overdraws the consumer’s account will be denied. Overdrafts on the payment of checks and regular electronic bill payments are not covered by this new rule. Before opting in, the consumer must be provided a notice that explains the financial institution’s overdraft services, including the fees associated with the service, and the consumer’s choices. Financial institutions must provide consumers who do not opt in with the same account terms, conditions and features (including pricing) that they provide to consumers who do opt in.  The Company did not charge customers for these transactions, nor provide these types of services.

	Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002




	﻿




	Enacted in 2002, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act represented a comprehensive revision of laws affecting corporate governance, accounting obligations and corporate reporting.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is applicable to all companies with equity securities registered or that file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including publicly held bank holding companies such as the Company. In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act establishes: (i) requirements for audit committees, including independence, expertise, and responsibilities; (ii) additional responsibilities regarding

	financial statements for the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the reporting company; (iii) standards for a


	uditors and regulation of audits; (iv) increased disclosure and reporting obligations for the reporting company and its directors and executive officers; and (v) new and increased civil and criminal penalties for violations of the securities laws. 




	﻿




	Governmental Policies




	﻿




	The Company’s earnings are significantly affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Board. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open-market operations in U.S. Government securities and federal funds, changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowing


	s and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments of monetary policy are used in varying combinations to influence the overall level of bank loans, investments and deposits, and the interest rates charged on loans and paid for deposits. The Federal Reserve Board frequently uses these instruments of monetary policy, especially its open-market operations and the discount rate, to influence the level of interest rates and to affect the strength of the economy, the level of inflation or the price of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. The monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of banking institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. It is not possible to predict the nature of future changes in monetary and fiscal policies, or the effect which they may have on the Company’s business and earnings.




	   




	Other Legislative Initiatives




	﻿




	Proposals may be introduced in the United States Congress and in the Pennsylvania Legislature and before various bank regulatory authorities which would alter the powers of, and restrictions on, different types of banking organizations and which would restructure part or all of the existing regulatory framework for banks, bank holding companies and other providers of financial services. Moreover, other bills may be introduced in Congress which would further regulate, deregulate or restructure the financial services industry, including proposals to substantially reform the regulatory framework. It is not possible to predict whether these or any other proposals will be enacted into law or, even if enacted, the effect which they may have on the Company’s business and earnings.

	﻿




	The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions. The Company believes that its determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of deferred tax assets involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than the Company’s other significant accounting policies. Further, these estimates can be materially impacted by changes in market conditions or the actual or perceived financial condition of the Company’s borrowers, subjecting the Company to significant volatility of earnings.




	﻿




	Securities classified as available for sale are those securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Any decision to sell a security classified as available for sale would be based on various factors, including significant movement in interest rates, changes in maturity mix of the Company’s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations and other similar factors. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of the specific securities sold, are included in earnings. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.




	﻿




	Other than temporary accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income. The Company recognized


	no


	other-than-temporary impairment charges during the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015


	.




	﻿




	The allowance for loan losses is established through the provision for loan losses, which is a charge against earnings. Provision for loan losses is made to reserve for estimated probable losses on loans. The allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by the Company for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, trends in actual and forecasted credit quality, including delinquency, charge-off and bankruptcy rates, and current economic conditions that may affect a borrower’s ability to pay. The use of different estimates of assumptions could produce different provision for loan losses. For additional discussion concerning the Company’s allowance for loan losses and related matters, see “Provision for Loan Losses” and “Allowance for Loan Losses.”




	   




	Real estate acquired through foreclosure, or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is recorded at fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition or transfer, and subsequently at the lower of its new cost or fair value less estimated selling costs.  Adjustments to the carrying value at the date of acquisition or transfer are charged to the allowance for loan losses.  The carrying value of the individual properties is subsequently adjusted to the extent it exceeds estimated fair value less the estimated selling costs, at which time a provision for loan losses on such real estate is charged to operations.  Appraisals are critical in determining the value of properties.  Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property.  The assumptions supporting such

	appraisals are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable.




	﻿




	Deferred taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuations allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences.








	GENERAL




	﻿




	The Company is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act). The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the “Bank”) in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow.




	﻿




	The Bank, which is the Company’s primary operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank’s primary market area.

	OVERVIEW




	﻿




	The Company’s assets grew $


	120.2


	million from $


	804.0


	million at


	December 31, 2015


	to $


	924.2


	million at


	December 31, 2016


	. The Company’s deposits grew $


	173.1


	million from $


	660.3


	million at


	December 31, 2015


	to $


	833.4


	million at


	December 31, 2016


	.  


	The significant growth in the Company’s deposits resulted primarily from


	market disruption due to


	recent mergers of two regional banks


	 


	in the Company’s market area,


	and customers


	migrating


	to


	local community


	bank


	s. Additional deposit growth was achieved through


	a concentrated effort


	 


	to expand


	business relationships with local municipalities.


	During the same period, loans receivable, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased $


	108.6


	million to $


	792.6


	million at


	December 31, 2016


	from $


	684.0


	million at


	December 31, 2015


	, with a


	significant portion of


	such


	 


	loans originat


	ing


	in the fou


	r


	th quarter.


	The market is very competitive and the Company is committed to maintaining a high quality portfolio that returns a reasonable market rate. The Company expects increased lending activity, as the Company expands its presence in the market and continues to become more widely known.  The past and current economic conditions have created lower demand for loans by credit-worthy customers.  The lending staff has been active in contacting new prospects and promoting the Company’s name in the community. Management believes that this will translate into continued growth of a portfolio of quality loans and core deposit relationships, although there can be no assurance of this. The Company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any future market rate adjustments.




	﻿




	The Company reported net income of $


	7.1


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	as compared to net income of $


	7.4


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	, a decrease of $261 thousand, or 3.5


	%.


	 Diluted earnings per share decreased


	to $


	0.96


	in


	2016


	from $


	1.00


	in


	2015


	.


	 The difference in net income for the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 resulted, in part, from the costs associated with opening a new branch in December 2015, an increase in provision for loan losses of $238 thousand due to loan growth in the year ending December 31, 2016 and a commercial loan recovery of $169 thousand in interest income during the year ended December 31, 2015.


	 


	In addition, the


	Company


	experienced


	a 9.2% increase in


	full-time equivalent employees from seventy-six (76) at December 31, 2015 to eighty-


	three (83) at December 31, 2016,


	due to the strategic


	additions of team members


	to


	various


	rolls within the


	Company.  This


	increase in the number of employees, together with a full year of salaries attributable to the new branch location and the annual increases in salaries, generally, resulted in an increase


	in overall salary and benefits costs of $981 thousand


	.

	Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin




	﻿




	Net interest income is the difference between income on assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets. Earning assets are composed primarily of loans and investments.  Interest-bearing deposits and borrowings make up the cost of funds. Non-interest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources. Changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources, along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid, determine changes in net interest income.


	The timing of deposit and loan growth also impacted net interest income.  Deposit


	and consumer loan


	growth


	occurred


	each quarter throughout the year


	, however


	a significant portion of commercial


	loan


	growth occurred in the fourth quarter


	where interest income will be recognized in these balances moving forward


	.  




	﻿




	201


	6 Compared to


	2015




	﻿




	Total interest income for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	was $


	30.3


	million, compared to $


	28.3


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	. Total interest expense for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	was $


	3.9


	million, compared to $


	3.1


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	.  


	The increase


	in interest income is due to the growth in loan balances, offset by lower yields in this interest rate environment.  The increase in interest expense is primarily due to growth in savings and certificate of deposits due to the opening of the Nazareth branch, expansion of existing deposit relationships


	,


	 


	growth in the


	number of deposit relationships with municipalities,


	and


	significant


	growth


	in the number of accounts


	resulting from


	customer migration due to recent merger activity in the Company’s local marketplace, offset by a decrease in short-term and long-term borrowings.  Net interest income increased 5.2


	% to $


	26.4


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	as compared to $


	25.1


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	.




	﻿




	Generally, changes in net interest income are measured by net interest rate spread and net interest margin. Interest rate spread is the mathematical difference between the average interest earned on earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Interest margin represents the net interest yield on earning assets and is derived by dividing net interest income by average earning assets.


	The


	interest margin gives a reader a better indication of asset earning results when compared to peer groups or industry standards.




	﻿




	The Company’s net interest margin for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	was


	3.25%


	compared t


	o 3.48%


	for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	. The


	decrease


	in the margin is due primarily


	to the decrease in loan and investment rates and increase in certificate of deposit rates associated with the current market conditions, offset by the decrease in short-term and long term borrowings and coupled with the significant growth in the loan, interest bearing deposits, savings and certificate of deposit balances.


	During this difficul


	t market environment, the Company continued to grow and attract deposits and loans at competitive rates.

	Provision for Loan Losses




	﻿




	The provision for loan losses represents the expense recognized to fund the allowance for loan losses. This amount is based on many factors that reflect management’s assessment of the risk in its loan portfolio. Those factors include economic conditions and trends, the value and adequacy of collateral, volume and mix of the portfolio, performance of the portfolio, and internal loan processes of the Company.




	﻿




	For the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	, the provision for loan losses was


	$


	770 thousand, compared to $532 thousand for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	. The increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to the volume of loan growth in


	2016


	over


	2015


	.  Loans


	grew $


	108.6 million in


	2016


	compared to $79.0 million in


	2015


	.  The allowance for loan losses as of


	December 31, 2016


	was $6.5


	million, which represents 0.8


	2


	% of outstanding loans, which is comparable to the $


	6.1


	million as of


	December 31, 2015


	, representing 0.


	88


	% of outstanding loans. Based principally on current economic conditions, perceived asset quality,


	and


	loan-loss experience of comparable institutions in the Company’s market area, the allowance is believed to be adequate.

	Non-interest Income




	﻿




	Non-interest income is derived from the Company’s operations and represents primarily credit card processing fees, service fees on deposit and loan relationships and income from bank owned life insurance. Non-interest income also

	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	may include net gains and losses from the sale of available for sale securities. Total non-interest income was


	$3.2


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	compared to


	$2.8


	million for the year ended


	December 31, 2015


	.  This increase in non-interest income is due to fees from credit card processing services in the amount of $


	104


	thousand, or


	6.2


	%, over 201


	5


	, as well as an increase in


	deposit service fees in the


	amount of $


	70


	thousand, or


	10.4


	%, over 201


	5


	,  


	the


	gain


	on


	sales of securities realized of $


	350


	thousand in 201


	6


	compared to $


	165


	thousand in 201


	5, an increase of $33 thousand in gains on sale of other real estate owned and a decrease of $24 thousand in impairment of other real estate owned,


	offset by a $


	20


	thousand


	, or 4.9%,


	 


	decrease


	in


	bank owned life insurance from 2015


	. As the deposit customer account base


	continues to grow


	and the Company continues to mature and develop additional sources of fee income, non-interest income is expected to become a more significant contributor to the overall profitability of the Company.


	 


	Unlike many in the industry, the


	Company does not sell mortgages in the secondary market


	,


	nor does it offer trust or investment/brokerage services to its customers.

	Non-interest Expense




	﻿




	Non-interest expenses represent the normal operating expenses of the Company. These expenses include salaries, employee benefits, occupancy, equipment, data processing, advertising and other expenses related to the overall operation of the Company.




	﻿




	Non-interest expenses for the year ended


	December 31, 2016


	was $


	18.8


	million, compared to $


	17.0


	million for the


	year ended


	December 31, 2015


	.  


	The increase


	in non-interest expenses


	is


	primarily due to


	an increase of $


	981


	thousand, or


	14.0


	%, over 201


	5


	,


	in salaries and employee benefits due


	to the strategic additions of team members to various rolls within the Company.


	The


	Company


	had


	eighty-three


	 


	(83)


	compared to


	seventy-six


	(76)


	full-time equivalent employees at


	December 31, 201


	6 and December 31, 2015, respectively


	. 


	This increase in the number of employees, together with a full year of salaries attributable to the new branch location and the annual increases in salaries, generally, resulted in an increase in overall salary and benefits costs


	. Additional increases in non-interest expenses are attributable to:


	an increase of $


	224


	thousand, or


	9.1


	%, over 201


	5,


	in


	occupancy and equipment due primarily to the


	expense associated with a full year


	 


	in operation


	of the Nazareth branch;


	an increase of $


	112


	thousand, or


	8.4


	%, over 201


	5 in


	advertising and promotion expenses due


	primarily to new advertising campaigns


	to capitalize on the market merger activity


	 


	and increased deposit


	campaigns


	;  


	an increase of $


	78


	thousand, or


	4.9


	%, over 201


	5


	, in credit card


	/merchant


	processing expense due to


	increased


	volume


	;  


	an increase of $


	79


	thousand, or


	5.1


	%, over 201


	5, in data processing expense;


	an increase of $


	87


	thousand, or


	17.3


	%, over 201


	5


	, in


	professional fees; and an increase of $156 thousand, or 13.3%, over 2015, in other expenses.

	FINANCIAL CONDITION




	﻿




	Securities




	﻿




	The Company’s securities portfolio is classified, in its entirety, as “available for sale.”  Management believes that a portfolio classification of available for sale allows complete flexibility in the investment portfolio. Using this classification, the Company intends to hold these securities for an indefinite amount of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Such securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity. The portfolio is structured to provide maximum return on investments while providing a consistent source of liquidity and meeting strict risk standards. The Company holds no high-risk securities or derivatives as of


	December 31, 2016


	.

	The Company’s securities portfolio was $


	85.6

	million


	increase from securities of $


	77.3


	million at


	December 31, 2015


	. The Company’s securities have increased primarily due to purchases in the amount of $


	29.3

	, offset by


	a combination of investment principal pay-downs, maturities


	 


	and sales totaling $


	19.0 million


	and a $


	1.9 million


	decrease in unrealized gains. The carrying value of the securities portfolio as of


	December 31, 2016


	includes a net unrealized


	loss


	of $


	38 thousand


	, as compared to a net unrealized gain of $


	1.9


	million as of


	December 31, 2015


	, which is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity. This decrease in the unrealized gain is due primarily to the changes in market conditions from


	2015


	to


	2016


	.  No securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired.

	Credit Risk and Loan Quality

	The allowance for loan


	losses increased $


	449


	thousand to $


	6.5


	million at


	December 31, 2016


	from $6.1 million at


	December 31, 2015


	. At


	December 31, 2016


	and


	December 31, 2015


	, the allowance for loan losses


	represented 0.8


	2


	%  


	and 0.


	88


	%, respectively


	, of total loans. Based upon current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, the perceived credit risk in the portfolio and loan-loss experience of comparable institutions in the Bank’s market area, management feels the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably anticipated losses.




	 




	At


	December 31, 2016


	, aggregate balances on non-performing


	loans equaled $


	6.0


	million compared


	to $5.5 million at


	December 31, 2015


	,  


	representing 0.7


	6


	% and


	0.79


	%


	of total loans at


	December 31, 2016


	and


	December 31, 2015


	, respectively. In certain circumstances in which the Company has deemed it prudent for reasons related to a borrower’s financial condition, the Company has agreed to restructure certain loans (referred to as troubled debt restructurings). Troubled debt restructuring loans, which are considered non-performing loans, outstanding at December 31, 2016 totaled $4.8 million. Generally, a loan is classified as nonaccrual when it is determined that the collection of all or a portion of interest or principal is doubtful or when a default of interest or principal has existed for 90 days or more, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.  A non-performing loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had $482 thousand and $529 thousand, respectively, in recorded investment in consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure.

	Allowance for Loan Losses




	﻿




	Based upon current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio and loan loss experience of comparable institutions in the Company’s market areas, an allowance for loan losses has been provided


	at 0.8


	2


	% of


	outstanding loans. Based on its knowledge of the portfolio and current economic conditions, management believes that, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably anticipated losses. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had $


	11.2


	million of impaired loans (defined as a loan that management feels probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or loans considered to be troubled debt restructurings) compared to $6.4 million at


	December 31, 2015


	.  Most of the Company’s impaired loans required no specific reserves due to adequate collateral.  As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company had impaired loans of $


	1.1


	million requiring a specific reserve of $


	296


	thousand.  As of


	December 31, 2015


	, the Company had impaired lo


	ans of $


	1.2


	million requiring a specific reserve of $


	370


	thousand.

	Deposits




	﻿




	As growth continues, the Company expects that the principal sources of its funds will be deposits, consisting of demand deposits, NOW accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, and certificates of deposit from the local market areas surrounding the Company’s offices. These accounts provide the Company with a source of fee income and a relatively stable source of funds.




	﻿




	Total deposits at


	December 31, 2016


	were $


	833.4


	million


	, an


	increase of $


	173.1


	million, or


	26.2


	%, over total


	deposits of $660.3 million as of


	December 31, 2015


	due to


	increases in


	customer


	relationships


	resulting


	from


	merger activity in the market


	place and


	an


	increase in municipal deposit relationships


	.  The following table reflects the Company’s deposits by category for the periods indicated. All deposits are domestic deposits.

	As a FDIC member institution, the Company’s deposits are insured to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) that is administered by the FDIC and each institution is required to pay quarterly deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.




	﻿




	Liquidity






	 




	Liquidity is a measure of the Company’s ability to meet the demands required for the funding of loans and to meet depositors’ requirements for use of their funds. The Company’s sources of liquidity are cash balances, due from banks, federal funds sold and short-term securities. There are other sources of liquidity that are available to the Company.




	﻿




	The Bank has borrowing capacity with the FHLBank Pittsburgh (“FHLB”) of approximately


	$


	445.0


	million


	, which includes a line of credit for $150.0 million. There were no long-term loans outstanding with the FHLB as of December 31, 2016 and $3.8 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015. There were no short-term loans outstanding with FHLB as of December 31, 2016 and $39.3 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015. FHLB deposit letters of credit are standby letters of credit commitments issued by the Bank for the benefit of a third party (the “Beneficiary”), which secure public deposits in the Bank. The Company, through the Bank, had $3.5 million of FHLB deposit letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and none as of December 31, 2015. All FHLB borrowings are secured by


	qualifying assets of the Bank.


	The Bank also has a $10.0 million line of credit with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank, of which none was outstanding at


	December 31, 2016


	. Advances from this line are unsecured.






	﻿




	Because of the composition of the Company’s balance sheet, its strong capital base, deposit growth, and borrowing capacity, the Company believes that it remains well positioned with respect to liquidity. While it is desirable to be liquid, it has the effect of a lower interest margin. The majority of funds are invested in loans; however, a sizeable portion is invested in investment securities that generally carry a lower yield.

	alance Sheet Arrangements




	﻿




	The Company’s consolidated financial statements do not reflect various off-balance sheet arrangements that are made in the normal course of business, which may involve some liquidity risk. These commitments consist of unfunded loans and lines of credit and letters of credit made under the same standards as on-balance sheet instruments. These off-balance sheet arrangements at


	December 31, 2016


	and December 31, 2015 totaled $100.3 million and $97.4 million, respectively. Because these instruments have fixed maturity dates, and because many of them will expire without being drawn upon, they do not generally present any significant liquidity risk to the Company.




	﻿




	Management believes that any amounts actually drawn upon can be funded in the normal course of operations. 




	﻿




	The Company has no investment in or financial relationship with any unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on liquidity or the availability of capital resources.




	﻿




	Capital Resources and Adequacy




	﻿




	The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material


	adverse


	effect on the consolidated financial statements.




	﻿




	The regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk weighted assets (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to average assets (as defined). As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Bank met the minimum requirements. In addition, the Bank’s capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered “well capit


	alized” as defined in the regulations.

	﻿




	In July 2013, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve approved a new rule that substantially amend


	ed


	the regulatory risk based capital rules applicable to the Bank and the Company. The final rule implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.




	﻿




	The final rule includes new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective for the Bank and the Company on January 1, 2015, and refines the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of


	calculating these ratios. The revised


	minimum capital requirements are: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. The final rule also establishes a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, and will result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.


	In January 2016, t


	he new capital conservation buffer requirement


	started being phased


	in at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations will establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.




	   




	In addition to the risk-based capital guidelines, the federal banking regulators established minimum leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to total assets) guidelines for bank holding companies. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for those bank holding companies which have the highest regulatory examination ratings and are not contemplating or experiencing significant growth or expansion.

	Interest Rate Risk Management




	﻿




	A principal objective of the Company’s asset/liability management policy is to minimize the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates by an ongoing review of the maturity and repricing of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO), which meets as part of the Board of Directors meeting, oversees this review, which establishes policies to control interest rate sensitivity. Interest rate sensitivity is the volatility of a company’s earnings resulting from a movement in market interest rates. The Company monitors rate sensitivity in order to reduce vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate capital levels and acceptable levels of liquidity. The Company’s asset/liability management policy, monthly


	and quarterly


	financial reports,


	along with simulation modeling,


	supplies management with guidelines to evaluate and manage rate sensitivity.




	﻿




	GAP, a measure of the difference in volume between interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities, is a means of monitoring the sensitivity of a financial institution to changes in interest rates. The chart below provides an indicator of the rate sensitivity of the Company. NOW and savings accounts are categorized by their respective estimated decay rates. The


	Company is liability sensitive, which


	means that if interest rates fall, interest income will fall slower than interest expense and net interest income will likely increase. If interest rates rise, interest income will rise slower than interest expense and net interest income will likely decrease. The Company continues to monitor interest rate exposure of its interest bearing assets and liabilities and believes that it is well positioned for any future market rate adjustments.

	The majority of assets and liabilities of the Company are monetary in nature, and therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. The precise impact of inflation upon the Company is difficult to measure. Inflation may affect the borrowing needs of consumers, thereby impacting the growth rate of the Company’s assets. Inflation may also affect the general level of interest rates, which can have a direct bearing on the Company.

	Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting




	Firm




	To the Board of Directors and Stockholders



	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.




	﻿




	We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Embassy Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiary, Embassy Bank for the Lehigh Valley (collectively the “Company”), as of


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015


	, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended. The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.




	﻿




	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.




	﻿




	In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015


	, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

	Not




	e 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting




	Policies




	﻿




	Principles of Consolidation and Nature of Operations




	﻿




	Embassy Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Pennsylvania corporation organized in 2008 and registered as a bank holding company pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). The Company was formed for purposes of acquiring Embassy Bank For The Lehigh Valley (the “Bank”) in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a bank holding company structure, which was consummated on November 11, 2008. Accordingly, the Company owns all of the capital stock of the Bank, giving the organization more flexibility in meeting its capital needs as the Company continues to grow.




	﻿




	The Bank, which is the Company’s principal operating subsidiary, was originally incorporated as a Pennsylvania bank on May 11, 2001 and opened its doors on November 6, 2001. It was formed by a group of local business persons and professionals with significant prior experience in community banking in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania, the Bank’s primary market area.




	﻿




	Estimates






	﻿




	The preparation of


	consolidated


	financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the


	consolidated


	financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of other real estate owned, and the valuation of deferred tax assets.




	﻿




	Concentrations of Credit Risk




	﻿




	Most of the Company’s activities are with customers located in the Lehigh Valley area of Pennsylvania. Note 2 discuss


	es


	the types of securities in which the Company invests. The concentrations of credit by type of loan are set forth in Note 3. The Company does not have any significant concentrations to any one specific industry or customer, with the exception of lending activity to a broad range of lessors of residential and non-residential real estate within the Lehigh Valley. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio, its debtors’ ability to honor their contracts is influenced by the region’s economy.

	For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from banks, interest-bearing demand deposits with bank, and federal funds sold. Generally, federal funds are purchased or sold for less than one week periods.




	﻿




	S


	ecurities




	﻿




	Securities classified as available for sale are those securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time, but not necessarily to maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Any decision to sell a security classified as available for sale would be based on various factors, including significant movement in interest rates, changes in maturity mix of the Company’s assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations and other similar factors. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as increases or decreases in other comprehensive income. Realized gains or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of the specific securities sold, are included in earnings. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities.




	﻿




	Other than temporary accounting guidance specifies that (a) if a company does not have the intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and (b) it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the debt security prior to recovery, the security would not be considered other-than-temporarily impaired unless there is a credit loss. When an

	entity does not intend to sell the security, and it is more likely than not the entity will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis, it will recognize the credit component of an other-than-temporary impairment of a debt security in earnings and the remaining portion in other comprehensive income.

	Restricted Investments in Bank Stock




	﻿




	Restricted investments in bank stock consist of


	FHLBank Pittsburgh


	(“F


	HLB”) stock and Atlantic Community


	 


	Bankers Bank


	(“ACBB”) stock.  The restricted stocks


	have no quoted market value and


	are carried at cost.  Federal law requires a member institution of the FHLB to hold stock of its district FHLB according to a predetermined formula.




	﻿




	During 2014 the FHLB conducted limited excess capital stock repurchases based upon positive quarterly net income.


	In October 2014, the FHLB amended its Capital Plan and created two subclasses of stock, one required as a member


	(“membership stock”)  and  additional stock in the FHLB in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings (“activity-based stock”).  Under this new plan the costs of membership decreased.  As a result of this decrease


	,


	the FHLB began repurchasing excess stock on a regular monthly repurchase date and pay dividends, if conditions


	warrant, on a quarterly basis.


	Dividend


	payments of $


	48

	ved


	during the years ended


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015


	, respectively.




	﻿




	Management evaluates the FHLB and ACBB restricted stock for impairment. Management’s determination of whether these investments are impaired is based on their assessment of the ultimate recoverability of their cost rather than by recognizing temporary declines in value. The determination of whether a decline affects the ultimate recoverability of their cost is influenced by criteria such as (1) the significance of the decline in net assets of the issuer as compared to the capital stock amount for the issuer and the length of time this situation has persisted, (2) commitments by the issuer to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance of the issuer, and (3) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on institutions and, accordingly, on the customer base of the issuer.




	﻿




	Management believes no impairment charge is necessary related to the FHLB or ACBB restricted stock as of


	December 31, 2016


	.




	﻿




	Loans Receivable




	﻿




	Loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal balances, net of any deferred fees or costs. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the yield using the effective interest method.  Premiums and discounts on purchased loans are amortized as adjustments to interest income using the effective interest method.  Delinquency fees are recognized in income when chargeable, assuming collectability is reasonably assured.




	﻿




	The loans receivable portfolio is segmented into commercial and consumer loans.  Commercial loans consist of the following classes: commercial real estate, commercial construction and commercial.  Consumer loans consist of the following classes: residential real estate and other consumer loans.




	﻿




	The Company makes commercial loans for real estate development and other business purposes required by the customer base.  The Company’s credit policies determine advance rates against the different forms of collateral that can be pledged against commercial loans.  Typically, the majority of loans will be limited to a percentage of their underlying collateral values such as real estate values, equipment, eligible accounts receivable and inventory.  Individual loan advance rates may be higher or lower depending upon the financial strength of the borrower and/or term of the loan.  The assets financed through commercial loans are used within the business for its ongoing operation.  Repayment of these kinds of loans generally comes from the cash flow of the business or the ongoing conversion of assets.  Commercial real estate loans include long-term loans financing commercial properties.  Repayments of these loans are dependent upon either the ongoing cash flow of the borrowing entity or the resale of or

	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	lease of the subject property.  Commercial real estate loans typically require a loan to value


	ratio


	of not greater than


	80%


	and vary in terms.




	﻿




	Residential mortgages and home equity loans are secured by the borrower’s residential real estate in either a first or second lien position.  Residential mortgages and home equity loans have varying


	interest


	rates


	(fixed or variable)


	depending on the financial condition of the borrower and the loan to value ratio.  Residential mortgages may have amortizations up to


	30


	years and home equity loans may have maturities up to


	25


	years.  Other consumer loans include installment loans, car loans, and


	overdraft lines of credit.  Some of these loans may be


	unsecured.




	﻿




	For all classes of loans receivable, the accrual of interest may be discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing.  A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured.  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income in the current year is reversed.  Interest received on nonaccrual loans, including impaired loans, generally is applied against principal.  Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time (generally six months) and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.  The past due status of all classes of loans receivable is determined based on contractual due dates for loan payments.




	﻿




	Allowance for Loan Losses




	﻿




	The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date and is recorded as a reduction to loans. The reserve for unfunded loan commitments represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in its unfunded loan commitments and is recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet.  The allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans, or portions of loans, determined to be confirmed losses are charged against the allowance account and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the account. A loss is considered confirmed when information available at the


	balance sheet


	date indicates the loan, or a portion thereof, is uncollectible.




	﻿




	Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance.  The allowance is based on the Company’s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower’s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.




	﻿




	Management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level it believes adequate to absorb probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans, as well as probable incurred losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates. The allowance for loan losses account consists of specific and general reserves. The specific component consists of the specific reserve for impaired loans individually evaluated under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 310, “Receivables,” and the general component is utilized for loss contingencies on those loans collectively evaluated under FASB ASC 450, “Contingencies.”




	﻿




	For the specific portion of the allowance for loan losses, a loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All amounts due according to the contractual terms means that both the contractual interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, ability to pay and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Loans considered impaired under FASB ASC 310 are measured for impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. If the present











	44





	 




	 








	 







	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent, is less than the recorded investment in the loan, including accrued interest and net deferred loan fees or costs, the Company will recognize the impairment by adjusting the allowance for loan losses account through charges to earnings as a provision for loan losses.




	﻿




	For loans secured by real estate, estimated fair values are determined primarily through third-party appraisals.  When a real estate secured loan becomes impaired, a decision is made regarding whether an updated certified appraisal of the real estate is necessary.  This decision is based on various considerations, including the age of the most recent appraisal, loan-to-value ratio based on the original appraisal and the condition of the property.  Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value.  The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property.




	﻿




	For commercial and industrial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower’s financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable aging or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets.




	﻿




	The general portion of the allowance for loan losses covers pools of loans by major loan class including commercial loans not considered impaired, as well as smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate and other consumer loans. Loss contingencies for each of the major loan pools are determined by applying a total loss factor to the current balance outstanding for each individual pool. The total loss factor is comprised of a historical loss factor using the loss migration method plus a qualitative factor, which adjusts the historical loss factor for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors that may affect repayment of the loans in these pools as of the evaluation date. Loss migration involves determining the percentage of each pool that is expected to ultimately result in loss based on historical loss experience. Historical loss factors are based on the ratio of net loans charged-off to loans, net, for each of the major groups of loans evaluated and measured for impairment under FASB ASC 450. The historical loss factor for each pool


	, includ


	e


	s


	but


	is


	not limited to,


	an average of the Company’s historical net charge-off ratio for the most recent rolling twenty


	-four


	quarters.




	﻿




	In addition to these historical loss factors, management also uses a qualitative factor that represents a number of environmental risks that may cause estimated credit losses associated with the current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience. These environmental risks include: (i) changes in lending policies and procedures including underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices; (ii) changes in the composition and volume of the portfolio; (iii) changes in national, local and industry conditions, including the effects of such changes on the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans; (iv) changes in the volume and severity of classified loans, including past due, nonaccrual, troubled debt restructures and other loan modifications; (v) changes in the levels of, and trends in, charge-offs and recoveries; (vi) the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and changes in the level of such concentrations; (vii) changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; (viii) changes in the quality of the loan review system and the degree of oversight by the board of directors; and (ix) the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current loan portfolio. Each environmental risk factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management’s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. Adjustments to the factors are supported through documentation of changes in conditions in a narrative accompanying the allowance for loan loss calculation.




	﻿




	The unallocated component of the general allowance is used to cover inherent losses that exist as of the evaluation date, but which have not been identified as part of the allocated allowance using the above impairment evaluation methodology due to limitations in the process. One such limitation is the imprecision of accurately estimating the impact current economic conditions will have on historical loss rates. Variations in the magnitude of impact may cause estimated credit losses associated with the current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience, resulting in an allowance that is higher or lower than the anticipated level.




	﻿




	The allowance calculation methodology includes further segregation of loan classes into risk rating categories.  The borrower’s overall financial condition, repayment sources, guarantors and value of collateral, if appropriate, are evaluated annually for commercial loans or when credit deficiencies arise, such as delinquent loan payment, for











	45





	 




	 








	 







	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	commercial and consumer loans.  Credit quality risk ratings include regulatory classifications of special mention, substandard, doubtful and loss.  Loans criticized as special mention have potential weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention.  If uncorrected, the potential weakness may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects.  Loans classified substandard have a well-defined weakness and borrowers are highly leveraged.  They include loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and the paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans classified doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in loans classified substandard with the added characteristic that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current conditions and facts, is highly improbable.  Loans classified as a loss are considered uncollectible and are charged to the allowance for loan losses.  Loans not classified are rated pass.




	﻿




	Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the Company’s allowance for loan losses and may require the Company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on management’s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.




	﻿




	Other Real Estate Owned




	﻿




	Other real estate owned is comprised of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and loans classified as in-substance foreclosures.  A loan is classified as an in-substance foreclosure when the Company has taken possession of the collateral, regardless of whether formal foreclosure proceedings take place. Other real estate owned is recorded at fair value less cost to sell at the time of acquisition. Any excess of the loan balance over the recorded value is charged to the allowance for loan losses


	at the time of acquisition


	. After foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed and the assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.  Changes in the valuation allowance on foreclosed assets are included in other income.  Costs to maintain the assets are included in other expenses. Any gain or loss realized upon disposal of other real estate owned is included in other income.




	﻿




	Bank Owned Life Insurance




	﻿




	The Company invests in bank owned life insurance (“BOLI”) as a


	tax deferred investment and a


	source of funding for employee benefit expenses.  BOLI involves the purchasing of life insurance by the Company on certain of its employees and directors.  The Company is the owner and beneficiary of the policies.  This life insurance investment is carried at the cash surrender value of the underlying policies.  Income from increases in cash surrender value of the policies is included in non-interest income


	and is not subject to income taxes unless surrendered


	.


	The Company does not intend to surrender these policies, and accordingly, no deferred taxes have been recorded on the earnings from these policies.




	﻿




	Premises and Equipment


	 




	﻿




	Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives of the related assets: furniture, fixtures and equipment for


	five


	to


	ten


	years, leasehold improvements for


	ten


	to


	fifteen


	years, computer equipment and data processing software for


	three


	to


	f


	ive


	years, and automobiles for


	five


	years.




	﻿




	Transfers of Financial Assets




	﻿




	Transfers of financial assets, including sales of loan participations, are accounted for as sales, when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.

	Advertising Costs




	﻿




	The Company follows the policy of charging the costs of advertising to expense as incurred.




	﻿




	Income Taxes




	﻿




	Income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense: current and deferred.  Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to taxable income.  Deferred income taxes are provided on the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carry forwards and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.




	﻿




	Earnings Per Share




	﻿




	Basic earnings per share represents income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, as adjusted for stock dividends and splits. Diluted earnings per share reflect additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustments to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate solely to outstanding stock options and are determined using the treasury stock method.

	Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments




	﻿




	In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into off-balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Such financial instruments are recorded in the balance sheet when they are funded.




	﻿




	Comprehensive Income




	﻿




	Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensiv


	e income. In accordance with


	Financial Accounting Standards Board


	(FASB)


	guidance, the Company has disclosed the components of comprehensive income in the accompanying


	consolidated


	statements of comprehensive income.




	﻿




	Segment Reporting




	﻿




	The Company acts as an independent, community, financial services provider, and offers traditional banking and related financial services to individual, business and government customers. The Company offers a full array of commercial and retail financial services, including the taking of time, savings and demand deposits; the making of commercial, consumer and home equity loans; and the provision of other financial services.




	﻿




	Management does not separately allocate expenses, including the cost of funding loan demand, between the commercial and retail operations of the Company. As such, discrete financial information is not available and segment reporting would not be meaningful.




	﻿




	Stock-Based Compensation




	﻿




	The Company applies the fair value recognition provisions of


	FASB Accounting Standards Codification (


	ASC


	)


	718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. ASC 718 requires compensation costs related to share-based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award based on the fair value of the award.  The Black-Scholes model is used to estimate the fair value of stock options.




	﻿




	Subsequent Events




	﻿




	The Company follows ASC Topic 855 Subsequent Events.  This topic establishes general standards for accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before


	the consolidated


	financial statements are issued.  The Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date of


	December 31, 2016


	through the date these


	consolidated


	financial statements were available for issuance for items that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these


	consolidated


	financial statements.




	﻿




	New Accounting Standards




	﻿




	In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will supersede the current revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. The ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year.  The new guidance will be effective for public companies for periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with private companies provided a one-year deferral until periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The ASU permits application of the new revenue recognition guidance to be applied using one of two retrospective application methods. The Company has not yet determined which

	application method it will use or the potential effects of the new standard on the financial statements, if any.


	 


	This guidance does not apply to revenue associated with financial instruments, including loans, securities, and derivatives that are accounted for under other U.S. GAAP guidance. For that reason, the Company does not expect it to have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations for elements of the statement of income associated with financial instruments, including securities gains, interest income and interest expense. However, the Company does believe the new standard will result in new disclosure requirements. The Company currently in the process of reviewing contracts to assess the impact of the new guidance on our service offerings that are in the scope of the guidance, included in non-interest income such as service charges and payment processing. The Company is continuing to evaluate the effect of the new guidance on revenue sources other than financial instruments on our financial position and consolidated results of operations

	In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which will supersede the current lease requirements in Topic 840. The ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and related lease liability for all leases, with a limited exception for short-term leases. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with the classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the statement of income. Currently, leases are classified as either capital or operating, with only capital leases recognized on the balance sheet. The reporting of lease related expenses in the statements of operations and cash flows will be generally consistent with the current guidance. The new guidance will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2018 for public companies and for years beginning after December 15, 2019 for private companies. Once effective, the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective transition method to the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently assessing the impact this new standard will have on its con


	solidated financial statements.

	In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. ASU 2016-13 requires entities to report “expected” credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit rather than the current “incurred loss” model. These expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date are to be based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU will also require enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an entity’s portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filers, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements and results of operations


	, how


	ever due to the significant differences in the revised guidance from existing U.S. GAAP, the implementation of this guidance may result in material changes to the Company’s accounting for credit losses on financial instruments

As of December 31, 2016, the Company either has the intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity or market price recovery, or believes that it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell such securities. Management believes that the unrealized loss only represents temporary impairment of the securities.  None of the individual losses are significant.

	Troubled Debt Restructurings




	﻿




	The Company may grant a concession or modification for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial condition than it would not otherwise consider, resulting in a modified loan which is then identified as troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”).  The Company may modify loans through rate reductions, extensions to maturity, interest only payments, or payment modifications to better coincide the timing of payments due under the modified terms with the expected timing of cash flows from the borrowers’ operations.  Loan modifications are intended to minimize the economic loss and to avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral.  TDRs are considered impaired loans for purposes of calculating the Company’s allowance for loan losses.




	﻿




	The Company identifies loans for potential restructure primarily through direct communication with the borrower and the evaluation of the borrower’s financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns, and credit reports.  Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions, and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future.

	Stock Incentive Plan:




	At the Company’s annual meeting on June 16, 2010, the shareholders approved the Embassy Bancorp, Inc. 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the “SIP”).  The SIP authorizes


	the Board of Directors, or a committee authorized by the Board of Directors, to award a stock based incentive to (i) designated officers (including officers who are directors) and other designated employees at the Company and its subsidiaries, and (ii) non-employee members of the Board of Directors and advisors and consultants to the Company and its subsidiaries.  The SIP provides for stock based incentives in the form of incentive stock options as provided in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and deferred stock awards.  The term of the option, the amount of time for the option to vest after grant, if any, and other terms and limitations will be determined

	Embassy Bancorp, Inc.                                                                                                                          







	 




	at the time of grant. Options granted under the SIP may not have an exercise period that is more than


	ten


	years from the time the option is granted.


	 


	At inception, the aggregate number of shares available for issuance under the SIP was


	500,000


	.  The SIP provides for appropriate adjustments in the number and kind of shares available for grant or subject to outstanding awards under the SIP to avoid dilution in the event of merger, stock splits, stock dividends or other changes in the capitalization of the Company.  The SIP expires on


	June 15, 2020


	. 


	At December 31, 201


	6


	, there were


	298,778


	shares available


	for issuance under the SIP.




	﻿




	The Company grants shares of restricted stock, under the SIP, to certain members of its Board of Directors as compensation for their services, in accordance with the Company’s Non-employee Directors Compensation program adopted in October 2010. The Company also granted restricted stock to certain officers under individual agreements with these officers.  Some of these restricted stock awards vest immediately, while the remainder vest over


	three


	to


	nine


	service years.  Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Since inception of the plan and through the Company’s restricted stock grants activity for the year ended December 31, 2016, there have been 84,979 awards granted.  During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 there were 25,139 and 32,875 awards granted, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 the Company recognized

	$96

	Note 12 – Other Comprehensive Income


	(Loss)




	Accounting principles generally require that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Although certain changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, are reported as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet, such items, along with net income, are components of comprehensive income (loss).

A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a likelihood of being realized on examination of more than 50 percent.

	“more likely than not” threshold guidelines, the Company believes no significant uncertain tax positions exist, either individually or in the aggregate, that would give rise to the non-recognition of an existing tax benefit.


	As of


	 


	December 31, 2016 and 2015,


	the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits or accrued int


	erest and penalties. The Company’s policy is to account for interest as a component of interest expense and penalties as a component of other expense. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax.

	- Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk




	﻿




	The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets.




	﻿




	The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.




	﻿




	At


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015


	, the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk:

	Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The Company evaluates each customer’s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit, is based on management’s credit evaluation.




	﻿




	Collateral held varies but may include personal or commercial real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment.




	﻿




	Outstanding letters of credit written are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The majority of these standby letters of credit expire within the next twelve months. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending other loan commitments. The Company requires collateral supporting these letters of credit as


	deemed necessary. The maximum undiscounted exposure related to these commitments at


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015


	 


	was


	$


	4.2


	 


	million and


	 


	$3.9


	million, respectively, and the approximate value of underlying collateral upon liquidation that would be expected to cover this maximum potential


	exposure


	was


	$


	3.8


	million


	and $


	3.7


	million, respectively. The current amount of the liability as of


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015


	for guarantees under standby letters of credit issued is not considered material.

	- Regulatory Matters




	﻿




	The Company is required to maintain cash reserve balances in vault cash and with the Federal Reserve Bank. As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Company


	had a


	$8.3


	million minimum reserve


	balance


	.




	﻿




	The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.


	The final rules implementing BASEL Committee on Banking Supervisor’s Capital Guidance for U.S. banks (BASEL III rules) became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule and fully phased in by January 1, 2019.


	Under the BASEL III rules the Company and the Bank must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capita


	l ratios. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.0% for 2015 to 2.50% by 2019. The capital conservation buffer for 2016 is 0.625%.


	The net unrealized gain or losses


	on


	available-for-sale securities


	are


	not included in computing regulatory capital amounts


	.


	 


	Failure to meet the minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk-weightings and other factors.




	﻿




	Quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the Company and the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth below) of total


	, Tier 1 common capital,


	and Tier 1 capital (as defined in the regulations) to risk-weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Management believes, as of


	December 31, 2016


	, that the Company and the Bank meet all capital adequacy requirements to which


	they are


	subject.




	﻿




	As of


	December 31, 2016


	, the most recent notification from the regulatory agencies categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the Bank’s category.




	﻿




	The Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios at


	December 31, 2016


	and


	2015

	Note 17 – Offsetting Assets and Liabilities




	﻿




	The Company enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities.  Under these arrangements, the Company may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase the assets.  As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities.  The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the Company's consolidated statements of condition, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts. In other words, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities. In addition, as the Company does not enter into reverse repurchase agreements, there is no such offsetting to be done with the repurchase agreements.




	﻿




	The right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Company be in default (e.g., fails to make an interest payment to the counterparty). For private institution repurchase agreements, if the private institution counterparty were to default (e.g., declare bankruptcy), the Company could cancel the repurchase agreement (i.e., cease payment of principal and interest), and attempt collection on the amount of collateral value in excess of the repurchase agreement fair value. The collateral is held by a third party financial institution in the counterparty's custodial account. The counterparty has the right to sell or repledge the investment securities. For government entity repurchase agreements, the collateral is held by the Company in a segregated custodial account under a tri-party agreement.

	- Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	﻿




	The Company uses fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures.  The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company’s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques.  Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.




	﻿




	Fair value guidance provides a consistent definition of fair value, which focuses on exit price in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. The fair value is a reasonable point within the range that is most representative of fair value under current market conditions.




	﻿




	ASC Topic 860 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation methods used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 860 are as follows:




	﻿




	Level 1


	: Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.




	﻿




	Level 2


	: Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.




	﻿




	Level 3


	: Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported with little or no market activity).

	An asset’s or liability’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

	Impaired loans are those that are accounted for under existing FASB guidance

	in which the Bank has measured impairment generally based on the fair value of the loan’s collateral. Fair value is generally determined based upon independent third-party appraisals of the properties, or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds. These assets are included as Level 3 fair values, based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements.

	The following information should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only provided for a limited portion of the Company’s assets and liabilities. Due to a wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company’s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of the Company’s financial instruments at


	December 31, 2016


	and


	December 31, 2015


	:




	﻿




	Cash and Cash Equivalents (Carried at Cost)




	The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and short-term instruments approximate those assets’ fair value


	s.




	﻿




	Interest Bearing Time Deposits (Carried at Cost)




	Fair values for fixed-rate time certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected

	monthly maturities on time deposits. The Company generally purchases amounts below the insured limit, limiting the amount of credit


	risk on these time deposits.




	﻿




	Securities Available for Sale (Carried at Fair Value)




	The fair value of securities available for sale are determined by matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service.  The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the security’s terms and conditions, among other things.




	﻿




	Loans Receivable (Carried at Cost)




	The fair values of loans, excluding impaired loans carried at fair value of collateral, are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using market rates at the balance sheet date that reflect the credit and interest rate-risk inherent in the loans. Projected future cash flows are calculated based upon contractual maturity or call dates, and projected repayments and prepayments of principal. Generally, for variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with n


	o significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values.




	﻿




	Restricted Investment in Bank Stock (Carried at Cost)




	The carrying amount of restricted investment in bank stock approximates fair value, and considers the limited mark


	etability of such securities.




	﻿




	Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable (Carried at Cost)




	The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and accrued interest payable approximates its fair value.




	﻿




	Deposit Liabilities (Carried at Cost)




	The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and noninterest checking, passbook savings and money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered in the market on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits.




	﻿




	Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase


	and Short-term Borrowings


	(Carried at Cost)




	These borrowings are short term and the carrying amount approximates the fair value.




	﻿




	Long-Term Borrowings (Carried at Cost)




	Fair values of FHLB and Univest advances are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on quoted prices for new FHLB and Univest advances with similar credit risk characteristics, terms and remaining maturity. Th


	ese prices obtained from this active market represent a market value that is deemed to represent the transfer price if the liability were assumed by a third party.




	﻿




	Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments (Disclosed at Cost)




	﻿




	Fair values for the Company’s off-balance sheet financial instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged in the market to enter into similar agreements, taking into account, the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties’ credit standing.

	. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.




	﻿




	    (a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.




	﻿




	The Company maintains controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Based upon their evaluation of those controls and procedures as of


	December 31, 2016


	, the Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officers of the Company concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were


	effective


	.




	﻿




	    (b) Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.




	﻿




	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining


	effective


	internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our


	internal


	control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control- Integrated Framework


	(updated 2013 framework version)


	issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on our evaluation under the framework, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of


	December 31, 2016


	.

	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company’s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management’s report was not subject to attestation by the Company’s registered public accounting firm pursuant to provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which exempt smaller reporting companies from this requirement, thus permitting the Company to provide only management’s report in this annual report.






	﻿




	    (c)  Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting.




	﻿




	There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the final fiscal quarter of the year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

	SECOND


	LEASE


	EXPANSION


	ADDENDUM


	(this “Addendum”)


	is dated as of


	October 21


	,  


	2011


	(the “Effective Date”), and is by and between EMBASS


	Y  


	BANK FOR THE LEHIGH VALLEY


	(“Embassy”) and RED BI


	RD ASSOCIATES, LLC


	(“Red Bird”).




	﻿






	WHEREAS, by Le


	ase Agreement dated June 11, 200


	1, Embassy leased from Gateway Associates, LLC, approximately 7,827 square feet of office space on the first floor of the office building commonly known as 100 Gateway Drive, Hanover Township, Northampton County, PA; and




	﻿






	WHEREAS, said Lease Agreement was amended by a First Amendment dated August 6, 2001; and




	﻿






	WHEREAS, the said building was acquired from Gateway Associates, LLC by Red Bird on January 10, 2003, together with an assignment to Red Bird of all leases affecting the premises; and




	﻿






	WHEREAS,


	the said Lease Agreement was amended by a Lease Addendum dated January 1, 2005


	(the “First


	Lease


	Expansion Addendum”)


	; and




	﻿






	WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend the Lease Agreement in order to provide for the lease b


	y Embassy of an additional 4,303


	square feet of space on the second floor of the premises.




	﻿






	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants herein contained, the parties agree as follows:




	﻿






	1.






	Lease.


	 Red Bird hereby leases to Embassy and Embassy hereby leases f


	rom Red Bird approximately 4,303


	square feet of office space on the second floor of the premises known as


	100 Gateway Drive


	,  


	Hanover


	Township,


	Northampton County


	,  


	Pennsylvania


	.  The additional space to be occupied by Embassy is shown and more fully described on Exhibit “A”, attached hereto.




	﻿






	2.






	Term.


	 This Addendum and the lease of additional space shall be effective as of


	January 1, 2012


	(the “Commencement Date”), and shall continue for the remaining term of the underlying Lease Agreement, including all renewal options. 




	﻿






	3.






	Increased Rent.


	 As a result of the additional space added to the existing lease, Embassy’s annual base re


	nt shall be increased by $73,151.00 (4,303


	additional square feet at $17.00 per


	square foot per year), or $6,095.92


	per month.




	﻿






	4.






	Rent Escalator.


	 On each anniversary of the Commencement Date, the annual base rent for the additional space provided for herein shall increase by three (3%)








	 




	percent per year, to be calculated in the same manner as set forth in Exhibit “C” of the Lease Agreement.




	﻿






	5.






	Leasehold Improvement Allowance.


	 Red Bird hereby grants to Embassy a tenant improvemen


	t allowance of $88,175.00 (3,527


	 


	square feet of interior rentable or “usable”


	space at $25.00 per square foot), which amount may be used by Embassy as an offset against the rent due hereunder.




	﻿






	6.






	Operating Expenses.


	 As a result of Embassy’s lease of the additional space provided for herein, its share of the Operating Expenses (as defined in the Lease Agreeme


	nt) shall be increased to 62


	%


	(an increase of 14.5% arising from this second expansion)


	.




	﻿






	7.






	Renewal.


	 The parties agree and acknowledge


	Embassy’s current lease term expires February 28, 2012, and


	 


	it is the party’s intent to negotiate and renew Embassy’s lease as to all of its leased space.  Any renewal of such leased space shall include the additional leased space provided for in this second expansion.  Additionally, and notwithstanding the Rent Escalator language set forth above, it is the parties intent to consolidate the annual rent escalations so that upon a certain date, all of Embassy’s rent shall increase by the applicable percentage on an annual basis.




	﻿






	8.






	Right of First Refusal.


	 




	﻿










	A.




	In the event Red Bird receives a written offer for the lease of any portion of the 100 Gateway Drive building (other than renewals of currently existing leases), and there has been no default under the Lease Agreement, Embassy shall have a right of first refusal to lease such space at the rent and on the terms contained in such written offer.  Red Bird shall provide written notice of any such offer to Embassy, whereupon Embassy shall exercise its right of first refusal, if at all, within 30 days of receipt of such notice, by providing written notice to Red Bird


	of the same


	.  The parties shall thereafter


	promptly


	execute a lease amendment for such space, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the notice.


	 If Embassy does not exercise such right within 30 days, Red Bird shall be free to lease such space to such third party upon the terms and conditions contained in the written notice.




	﻿










	B.




	In the event Red Bird receives a written offer to purchase the 100 Gateway Drive building a


	nd related land, improvements and associated condominium rights (i.e. Red Bird’s entire interest in the premises as acquired from Gateway Associates, LLC),


	and there has been no default under the Lease Agreement, Embassy shall have a right of first refusal to


	purchase such property


	on the terms contained in such written offer.  


	Red Bird shall provide written notice of any such offer to Embassy, whereupon Embassy shall exercise its right of first refusal, if at all, within 30 days of receipt of such notice, by providing written notice to Red Bird of the same.  The parties shall thereafter promptly execute an agreement of sale, upon the terms and conditions set forth in the notice.  If Embassy does not exercise such right within 30 days, Red Bird








	 




	shall be free to sell the property to such third party upon the terms and conditions contained in the written notice.

	AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO AMENDED AND RESTATED




	SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN AGREEMENT




	﻿




	THIS AMENDMENT NO. 1 TO AMENDED AND RESTATED SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN AGREEMENT (“Amendment”) is made as of the


	21st


	day of


	November


	, 2011, by and between DAVID M. LOBACH, JR. (“Executive”) and EMBASSY BANK FOR THE LEHIGH VALLEY, a Pennsylvania banking institution having its principal office in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (the “Bank”).




	﻿




	WITNESSETH




	WHEREAS


	, the Bank and the Executive entered into an Amended and Restated Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan Agreement dated November 19, 2010 (the “SERP”), and




	WHEREAS


	, the Bank and the Executive desire to amend the SERP to provide for gross-up payments for any excise tax on payments to be made by the Bank thereunder consistent with the gross-up language contained in Executive’s Employment Agreement with Bank. 




	NOW, THEREFORE


	, in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements set forth herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:








	1.




	The SERP is hereby amended to provide that, should the total of all amounts or benefits payable under the SERP, together with any other payments which Executive has a right to receive from the Bank, any affiliates or subsidiaries of the Bank, or any successors of any of the foregoing, result in the imposition of an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any successor thereto), Executive shall be entitled to an additional “excise tax” adjustment payment in an amount such that, after the payment of all federal and state income and excise taxes, Executive will be in the same after-tax position as if no excise tax had been imposed.  Any payment or benefit which is required to be included under Sections 280G or 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (or any successor provisions thereto) for purposes of determining whether an excise tax is payable shall be deemed a payment “made to Executive” or a payment “which Executive has a right to receive” for purposes of this provision.  The Bank (or its successor) shall be responsible for the costs of calculation of the deductibility of payments and benefits and the excise tax by the Bank’s independent certified accountant and tax counsel and shall notify Executive of the amount of excise tax prior to the time such excise tax is due.  If at any time it is determined that the additional “excise tax” adjustment payment previously made to Executive was insufficient to cover the effect of the excise tax, the gross-up payment pursuant to this provision shall be increased to make Executive whole, including an amount to cover the payment of any penalties resulting from any incorrect or late payment of the excise tax resulting from the prior calculation.  All amounts required to be paid pursuant to this paragraph shall be paid at the time any withholding may be required (or, if earlier, the time Executive shall be required to pay such amounts) under applicable law, and any additional amounts to which Executive may be entitled shall be paid or reimbursed no later than fifteen (15) days following confirmation of such amount by the Bank’s independent certified accountant provided, however, that any payments to be made under this paragraph shall in all events be made no later than the end of Executive’s taxable year next following the taxable year in which the Executive remits such excise tax payments.  The parties recognize that the actual implementation of the provisions of this paragraph are complex and agree to deal with each other in good faith to resolve any questions or disagreements arising hereunder.










	 






	2.




	Capitalized terms used herein, but not defined herein, shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in the SERP.






	3.




	In all other respects, the SERP, as amended above, is hereby ratified and confirmed by the Bank and the Executive.  All other provision of the SERP shall remain in full force and effect as amended hereby.




	IN WITNESS WHEREOF


	, the parties, each intending to be legally bound, have executed this Amendment as of the date, month and year first above written.
