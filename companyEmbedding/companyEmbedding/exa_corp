History[edit]
Exa was founded in November, 1991.[1] Exa raised about $2.4 million in a series of venture capital investments from April 1993 though 1994 from Fidelity Ventures and individuals.[2] More funding was obtained in 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2005, including Boston Capital Ventures as an investor. In 1999, Stephen A. Remondi became chief executive.[1]
The company filed for an initial public offering in June 2012.[1]
For fiscal year 2012, Exa recorded total revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million, $14.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively.[1] Since generating its first commercial revenue in 1994, Exa's annual revenue had increased for 18 consecutive years.[1] The company was profitable in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 after recording net losses in the three preceding fiscal years.[1] Exa's total revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2012 increased 21% and 51%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2011.[1] Exa reported $61.4 million in total revenue for the full year fiscal 2015.[3] The company's total revenue is expected to be in the range of $64.7 million to $67.0 million for the full year fiscal 2016.[3]

History[edit]
Exa was founded in November, 1991.[1] Exa raised about $2.4 million in a series of venture capital investments from April 1993 though 1994 from Fidelity Ventures and individuals.[2] More funding was obtained in 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2005, including Boston Capital Ventures as an investor. In 1999, Stephen A. Remondi became chief executive.[1]
The company filed for an initial public offering in June 2012.[1]
For fiscal year 2012, Exa recorded total revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million, $14.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively.[1] Since generating its first commercial revenue in 1994, Exa's annual revenue had increased for 18 consecutive years.[1] The company was profitable in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 after recording net losses in the three preceding fiscal years.[1] Exa's total revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2012 increased 21% and 51%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2011.[1] Exa reported $61.4 million in total revenue for the full year fiscal 2015.[3] The company's total revenue is expected to be in the range of $64.7 million to $67.0 million for the full year fiscal 2016.[3]
The Exa corporate headquarters are located in Burlington, Massachusetts. The company also has U.S. offices in Livonia, Michigan and Brisbane, California, along with offices in Europe and Asia. Exa's European headquarters are located in Paris, France, and it also has European offices in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Exa's Asia headquarters are located in Japan, and its Asia offices are based out of China, India and South Korea. Exa employs over 260 people worldwide.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Exa was founded in November, 1991.[1] Exa raised about $2.4 million in a series of venture capital investments from April 1993 though 1994 from Fidelity Ventures and individuals.[2] More funding was obtained in 1994, 1996, 1998 and 2005, including Boston Capital Ventures as an investor. In 1999, Stephen A. Remondi became chief executive.[1]
The company filed for an initial public offering in June 2012.[1]
For fiscal year 2012, Exa recorded total revenues, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $45.9 million, $14.5 million and $7.1 million, respectively.[1] Since generating its first commercial revenue in 1994, Exa's annual revenue had increased for 18 consecutive years.[1] The company was profitable in fiscal years 2011 and 2012 after recording net losses in the three preceding fiscal years.[1] Exa's total revenues and Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal year 2012 increased 21% and 51%, respectively, compared with fiscal year 2011.[1] Exa reported $61.4 million in total revenue for the full year fiscal 2015.[3] The company's total revenue is expected to be in the range of $64.7 million to $67.0 million for the full year fiscal 2016.[3]
The Exa corporate headquarters are located in Burlington, Massachusetts. The company also has U.S. offices in Livonia, Michigan and Brisbane, California, along with offices in Europe and Asia. Exa's European headquarters are located in Paris, France, and it also has European offices in Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom. Exa's Asia headquarters are located in Japan, and its Asia offices are based out of China, India and South Korea. Exa employs over 260 people worldwide.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Peterbilt"Using Exa's simulations, we were able to rapidly find and address areas of thermal and aerodynamic efficiency throughout the truck" - it was a critical resorce for our SuperTruck team"
link to press release
 
Exa's Simulation Technology Critical to Achieving 75% Fuel Economy Improvement for Cummins, Peterbilt SuperTruck
BURLINGTON, Mass., March 21, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Exa® Corporation (Nasdaq:EXA), a global innovator of fluids simulation solutions for product engineering, stated that Cummins Inc. and Peterbilt Motors Company, the first companies to announce their SuperTruck for the Department of Energy (DOE) SuperTruck Program, credited Exa's technology and engineering expertise as instrumental in the success of their recently announced vehicle. Exa worked with engineers from both Cummins and Peterbilt to perform aerodynamic and thermal simulations to achieve significant efficiency improvements throughout the tractor, trailer and engine. These simulations, done long before a physical prototype was ever created, helped this SuperTruck exceed the required 50% efficiency improvement, and deliver a 75% more efficient truck — ahead of schedule.
The remarkable improvements were made possible through the collaboration of two world-class companies. They evaluated the entire truck from the underhood cooling requirements and engine housing, to every part of the tractor and trailer. "It was not one aerodynamic or thermal simulation that made the difference," stated David Koeberlein, Cummins' Program Lead for the SuperTruck program. "Using Exa's simulations, we were able to rapidly find and address areas of thermal and aerodynamic efficiency throughout the truck — it was a critical resource for our SuperTruck team."
The project started with Cummins' engineers digitally packaging their new, energy efficient engine, designed with a waste heat recovery system, into the Peterbilt tractor CAD geometry. They then added heat exchangers, and simulated the thermal performance of the complete system. "Exa's technology was able to quickly demonstrate, through simulation alone, optimal cooling package design," remarked Jon Dickson, Cummins Engineering Manager of Advanced Vehicle Integration. "To package the new waste heat recovery condenser, we had to redesign the vehicle heat exchanger system and use a non-traditional layout. We were able to use Exa's PowerCOOL® and PowerTHERM® to identify areas to improve thermal performance while maximizing aerodynamic efficiency — years before any vehicle was built."
At the same time, Landon Sproull, Peterbilt Chief Engineer, and Rick Mihelic, Peterbilt Manager of Vehicle Performance and Engineering Analysis, were evaluating their tractor and trailer combinations for aerodynamic/thermal performance. "Over the course of three years, we ran hundreds of simulations to test and analyze every part of this truck using Exa PowerFLOW®," stated Mihelic. "We designed a complete new SuperTruck aerodynamic package which included visible devices such as trailer skirts and wheel well covers as well as unseen, but critical, underbody shields that optimize airflow and thermal efficiency." Sproull added, "Using visualization of the simulation results, our team analyzed each area looking for opportunities for improvement. Our designers and engineers could easily review and discuss results and optimization options — something simply not possible in a wind tunnel. It was this comprehensive analysis that helped us to achieve our extreme efficiency savings that exceeded even the aggressive goals set by the DOE."
"Each day our customers seek efficiency improvements using our aerodynamic, thermal and acoustic solutions," remarked Stephen Remondi, Exa's President and CEO. "We have been working with Peterbilt for many years and were pleased to see them use Exa's solutions so effectively as part of this important initiative that will benefit us all in the end."

Automotive: Cooling Fan Noise





 
Industry Needs a Quite RevolutionLow-speed rotating axial and radial fans are frequently used to manage engine temperature by ensuring adequate airflow through heat exchangers, especially at low vehicle speeds or idle. An undesirable side effect of these fans is generation of flow-induced noise, which is an annoyance to the operators and passengers, and a source of community noise, especially for commercial vehicles and heavy equipment. In most cases and particularly for high mass flow configurations, the cooling fan is a major contributor to the overall noise, and in some cases dominates relative to other sources such as engine, transmission, tire, mechanical, or exhaust contributions.
For heavy industry, operator and community noise regulations are imposed by governments, and a failure in the acoustic development of a product can lead to delays and expensive countermeasures to meet the requirements. In addition, cooling fan noise is a perceived quality issue that can affect brand image and customer satisfaction. Given the regulations and growing importance of acoustic comfort in these competitive markets, there is high value in addressing cooling fan flow-induced noise problems as early as possible during product development.
TECHNICAL CHALLENGES
Experimental assessment of fan acoustic performance is limited by the difficulties of physical testing, and is typically performed in stand-alone test bench configurations.  The results might not correlate well to the performance when integrated into a real system, as this tends to substantially alter the flow and acoustic environment of the fan.  With physical testing, it is very difficult or impossible to identify the source of the noise. Using simulation has the potential to overcome these difficulties, but must meet the challenges of accurately capturing the key physical mechanisms related to flow-induced noise from cooling fans:

Noise generation is, by definition, a transient phenomenon and traditional CFD codes typically have difficulty accurately predicting transient effects in reasonable timeframes.
The complex interaction of rotating blades with nearby stationary geometry is a primary source of noise and the typical moving reference frame (MRF) technique fails to capture this effect.
Tonal noise, especially associated with the blade passing frequency, can have significant dependence on the quality of the incoming flow, rotor casing interactions, existence of rotating stall conditions, and unsteadiness of the flow field.
Broadband noise, which is usually related to vortex shedding, flow detachments, turbulent boundary layer noise, and tip vortex noise.
Installation effects, which tend to influence the inlet flow conditions and the acoustic response of the system.
Radiation of small amplitude pressure fluctuations (acoustics), outside the convective near field.

EXA SOLUTION
Exa provides a complete computation aeroacoustics solution with PowerFLOW and PowerACOUSTICS:

PowerFLOW’s inherently transient solution accurately predicts the complex time dependent turbulent flow structures and the resulting noise sources induced by the cooling fan.
PowerFLOW’s true rotating geometry capability provides time accurate simulation of rotation and captures all types of interactions more precisely than traditional MRF methods.
PowerFLOW’s inherently compressible solution predicts the radiated noise simultaneously with the flow induced noise sources.
PowerFLOW can handle fully detailed geometry and capture all the interactions between the fan and the surrounding components.
For applications requiring prediction of noise propagation to the far field (community noise), PowerFLOW transient results can be coupled to the PowerACOUSTICS Far Field Noise module, which uses an acoustic analogy method based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings equation.
Easy-to-use analysis and state-of-the-art 3D visualization capabilities with PowerACOUSTICS and PowerVIZ provide insight into sources of noise. Band-filtered pressure analyses can be used to isolate phenomena at specific frequency bands of interest (for example, to perform detailed investigation of the blade passing frequency noise).
