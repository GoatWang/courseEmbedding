Conclusion







	NACCO Industries, Inc. ("NACCO") and its subsidiaries (NACCO together with its 
	subsidiaries collectively referred to as the "Company") are committed to achieving
	the highest standards of legal and ethical conduct for itself and its directors, 
	officers and employees (collectively referred to as "Company personnel"). Adherence 
	to these standards is essential; it is the activities of Company personnel, individually
	and collectively, which affect the Company's reputation in the community, 
	public confidence in the integrity of the Company, and the direct financial interests 
	of the Company, all of which are fundamental to its continued success. 
	Over and above the strictly legal aspects involved, all Company personnel are expected 
	to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the discharge of their 
	responsibilities. It is the personal responsibility of all Company personnel to acquaint
	themselves with the legal and policy standards applicable to their assigned duties 
	and responsibilities, and to conduct themselves accordingly.


	The Company has formalized its historical corporate compliance policies in the Code 
	of Corporate Conduct (the “Code”), which sets forth appropriate legal and ethical 
	principles by which all Company personnel are expected to abide. In addition, the 
	Company has made available to its employees its Corporate Conduct Guidelines 
	(the “Guidelines”) which include more practical examples of the legal and ethical 
	principles.  For personnel in certain countries, the Company may adopt an addendum 
	(each an “Addendum”) which, to the extent specifically provided therein, contains 
	additional rules and/or supersedes certain provisions of the Code and Guidelines 
	in order to comply with the applicable laws of that country.  The Code, the Guidelines
	and all applicable Addendums are designed to provide all Company personnel with guidance
	on how to proceed when legal or business ethics issues arise.  The Code, the Guidelines
	and the Addendums (as in effect from time to time) were adopted under, and are an 
	integral part of, the Company’s Corporate Compliance Program.


I. INTRODUCTION


	The Code is designed to provide an official statement of how the Company will conduct
	its business.  The Code obligates all Company personnel to abide by the Company’s 
	tradition of honest, ethical and lawful behavior, including the ethical handling of 
	actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.
	The Corporate Compliance Program, which is designed to help ensure that the Company 
	and all Company personnel comply with all applicable laws and regulations, places 
	oversight responsibility at the highest levels of the Company and creates a standard 
	approach to the implementation of its requirements.


	The Code applies to all Company personnel. All Company personnel should be thoroughly
	familiar with the Code. Copies of the Code are available on NACCO's website 
	(www.nacco.com), and all new employees are provided
	with copies when they are hired. Additional copies of the Code and the Guidelines are
	available upon request from the Company’s Legal Departments.  All copies of documents 
	requested from the Legal Department related to theCode and Guidelines will be provided
	free of charge.


	All officers and managers of the Company are responsible not only for reporting 
	violations of law or the Code, but also for reviewing the law and the Code with their
	subordinates. All new Company personnel shall read the Code upon commencing 
	employment. All directors and officers and selected other managers and employees 
	will read the Code each year and will certify that they conducted the Company's 
	business in compliance with the Code and applicable law, and have reported any known
	conduct by any director, officer or employee of the Company in violation of the 
	Code or any law.


	The following is a summary of the Company's policies.



		II. STATEMENT OF POLICY CONCERNING CONFLICTS OF INTEREST, BUSINESS 
		GIFTS AND ENTERTAINMENT, POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS, AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS 
		AND OTHER ILLEGAL PAYMENTS
	


Conflicts of Interest. It is the policy of the Company that the business
	affairs of the Company are to be conducted at all times in the best interests of 
	the Company.  All Company personnel therefore should avoid situations where the 
	private interests of Company personnel interfere in any way with the Company’s 
	interests.  All Company personnel need to be especially sensitive to situations 
	that have even the appearance of impropriety and promptly report them to a supervisor, 
	or if appropriate, a more senior manager.  If you believe that a transaction, 
	relationship or other circumstance creates or may create a conflict of interest, 
	you should promptly report that concern in accordance with the reporting provisions of 
	the Code so that a determination can be made whether the situation constitutes an actual 
	conflict of interest.  It is the Company’s policy that circumstances that pose a 
	conflict of interest for Company personnel are prohibited unless a waiver is obtained 
	in accordance with the Code.


Business Gifts and Entertainment. Except as set forth below, Company 
	personnel are prohibited from making any gift, payment or loan, or from granting 
	any favor, to any present or prospective customer, supplier, service provider or 
	any other business partner, particularly where the purpose is to influence his 
	business judgment or to induce him to compromise his duties.  Company personnel 
	also are not permitted to accept from such persons or entities any similar gifts, 
	payments, loans or favors.  These prohibitions do not include (a) the gift or receipt 
	of reasonable favors or gifts of tangible property of nominal value not exceeding 
	normal standards of ethical business conduct or (b) normal entertainment for business 
	purposes consistent with customary industry standards.  Any such gifts and 
	entertainment involving the expenditure of Company funds must be approved in 
	accordance with Company policy and properly recorded on the books and records of 
	the Company.  The subject of business entertainment and expenses is discussed in 
	greater detail in the Standard Practices-Employee Expense Policies or equivalent 
	policy, a copy of which is available upon request without charge from the office 
	of the Company’s Controller.


Political Contributions. Company personnel may not promise or make 
	any contribution, directly or indirectly, on behalf of the Company to any political 
	party or candidate for public office, particularly where the purpose is to influence
	his judgment or to influence a public election.  Company personnel are encouraged to 
	participate in the political process and support the political activities of their 
	community on an individual basis; however, Company personnel must participate on their 
	own personal time and use their own individual funds for such activities.  The Company 
	will not reimburse Company personnel for political contributions of any nature.  
	Company personnel are encouraged to vote and participate fully in the political 
	process; however, Company personnel cannot use Company resources to vote or otherwise 
	be active in political activities.


Government Officials and Illegal Payments. Company personnel are 
	prohibited from making any gift, payment or loan, or from granting any favor, to any 
	present or prospective domestic or foreign government officer or agent, particularly 
	where the purpose is to influence his business judgment or to induce him to compromise 
	his duties.  Company personnel also are not permitted to accept from such persons or
	entities any similar gifts, payments, loans or favors.  This prohibition does not 
	include facilitating or expediting payments made to foreign officials to expedite or 
	secure the performance of routine governmental actions, so long as any such payments 
	are approved in accordance with Company policy and properly recorded on the books and 
	records of the Company.  This prohibition also does not include favors or gifts to a 
	domestic or foreign government officer or agent of tangible property of nominal value 
	not exceeding normal standards of ethical business conduct including the expenditure 
	of Company funds for normal entertainment for business purposes consistent with 
	customary industry standards, so long as such favors, gifts or entertainment are 
	consistent with applicable governmental laws and regulations of all applicable 
	jurisdictions including, without limitation, the United States (e.g., the U.S. Foreign 
	Corrupt Practices Act) and the country represented by the government officer or agent.  
	More detailed guidance concerning gifts, payments, loans or favors to government 
	officials is set forth in the Global Anti-Corruption Policy 
	(last issued November 2011), copies of which are available upon request without 
	charge from the Company’s law departments.


III. CORPORATE OPPORTUNITIES


	Company personnel are not permitted to take for themselves or others opportunities 
	intended for the Company, whether or not discovered through the use of Company 
	property, information or position, without the prior consent of the Board of Directors 
	of the Company.  Company personnel also are prohibited from competing with the Company 
	and using Company property, information or position for personal gain without the 
	prior consent of the Board of Directors of the Company.  Company personnel owe a 
	duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when opportunities to do so 
	arise.


IV. PROHIBITION AGAINST USE OF CONFIDENTIAL “INSIDE” INFORMATION


	Company personnel are not permitted to divulge confidential information pertaining 
	to the Company or any affiliated company (e.g., non-public information relating to 
	acquisitions, dispositions, business plans, earnings, financial or business forecasts 
	or competitive information that might be useful to competitors, or harmful to the 
	Company or its customers, if disclosed) or any of its customers to any individual 
	who does not have a direct Company-related need to know such information.  Nor may 
	Company personnel seek to obtain any confidential information of customers, suppliers 
	or competitors in an illegal or unethical manner.  No information obtained by Company 
	personnel as the result of his or her relationship to the Company may be used for 
	personal profit or as the basis for a “tip” to others, unless the Company has made 
	such information generally available to the public.  This requirement relates not 
	only to transactions with respect to stock and other securities but also to any 
	situation where undisclosed information may be used as the basis for inequitable 
	bargaining with an outsider.  Insider trading is both unethical and illegal.  
	Any Company personnel who are found to have engaged in insider trading face severe 
	penalties, including civil and/or criminal charges, as well as termination or 
	dismissal from the Company.


V. MAINTAINING ACCURATE BOOKS AND RECORDS


	All assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the Company must be properly 
	recorded in appropriate Company books and records.  No false or fictitious entries
	may be made in, and no information that should be recorded shall be omitted from, 
	the books and records of the Company for any reason.  All entries in the books and 
	records of the Company must properly reflect the nature of the transactions in full 
	compliance with accounting rules, including, as required, the relevant tax accounting 
	rules relating to the transfer pricing of intra-Company transactions.


	The reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the 
	United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and all other public communications
	made by the Company, must fully, fairly and accurately disclose the matters required 
	in such communications.  The disclosures must be made in a timely fashion as required 
	by applicable laws and regulations, and drafted in an understandable manner.


VI. COMPETITIVE PRACTICES AND FAIR DEALING


	Collaboration with competitors is illegal, and discussions concerning certain topics 
	must be avoided.  These topics can include pricing, production, marketing, inventories,
	product development, sales territories and goals, market studies and proprietary or 
	confidential information.  For example, it is against Company policy to engage in 
	illegal or improper acts to acquire a competitor’s trade secrets, customer lists, 
	financial data or information about facilities, technical developments or operations.  
	In addition, it is against Company policy to hire competitors’ employees to obtain 
	confidential information or urge competitors’ personnel or customers to disclose 
	confidential information.  It is against Company policy to take unfair advantage of 
	anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, 
	misrepresentation of material facts or any other unfair dealing practice.  
	Company personnel should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s customers, 
	suppliers, competitors and employees.


VII. EXPORT AND IMPORT REGULATIONS, MATERIALS SOURCING


Export and Import Regulations. It is the Company’s policy to comply 
	with the export and import regulations of the countries where it conducts business, 
	which regulate and limit the Company’s ability to import and export goods and 
	materials, and which control and/or restrict the export of certain goods and 
	technology to specific countries.


Materials Sourcing. The Company will comply with all applicable laws 
	and regulations relating to the sourcing of materials for its products, including 
	any reporting or disclosure requirements.  The Company is committed to sourcing 
	materials from parties that share the Company’s values regarding respect for human 
	rights, integrity and environmental responsibility.


VIII. ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, COMPUTER ESPIONAGE, 
	CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND SECURITY


Electronic Communications.  Electronic mail (e-mail), voicemail, 
	the Internet, Intranet, electronic bulletin board providers, cell phones, 
	telephones, modems, fax machines, pagers, remote portable e-mail devices (e.g., 
	Iphones and Blackberries) and other forms of electronic communication are business 
	tools provided by the Company for use in supporting various business activities.  
	All aspects of the Company’s Electronic Communication System are the property of the 
	Company.  While the Electronic Communication System provides opportunities to save 
	time and money, the opposite can occur when it is improperly used.  To address these 
	concerns, the Company has adopted an Electronic Communication System User Policy 
	(last issued in July 2010), which has previously been distributed to all Company 
	personnel.  Additional copies are available upon request without charge from the 
	Company’s law departments.  All Company personnel are charged with reviewing, 
	understanding and complying with all aspects of the Electronic Communication System 
	User Policy.

Intellectual Property. The Company and its personnel must respect the intellectual property and
confidential information of other parties. “Intellectual property” is a term that describes creative
works whose authors and inventors have legal rights to them. Copyrights, patents, trade secrets
and trademarks all belong to this category.

Software Use. The unauthorized copying of computer software is prohibited. Original computer
software is protected by copyright law. The money paid for a software product generally
represents a license fee for the use of one copy. Reproducing software without authorization
except in accordance with the terms of the license (e.g., backup copies) violates copyright law.
Copying of Copyrighted Printed Materials.  The intentional unlicensed duplication of copyrighted material for the purpose of commercial gain or competitive advantage is unlawful
and will, in most circumstances, constitute a violation of criminal law.
Computer Espionage. It is a violation of this Code and the Company's Electronic
Communication System User Policy and, in many cases, local or federal law, to use a computer to
gain unauthorized access to computer systems with the intent either of (1) obtaining trade secrets
or other confidential information, (2) destroying, impairing or otherwise injecting a virus, trojan,
worm or other malicious software into any information system or (3) committing any other type
of computer fraud or theft.
Confidential Information of Other Parties. Company personnel may not employ illegal or
unethical means to acquire confidential information from others, and should immediately report
to their supervisor any attempt to sell or otherwise disclose to the Company anyone else's
confidential information.
IX. PROTECTION AND PROPER USE OF COMPANY ASSETS
Company personnel should protect the Company's assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft,
carelessness and waste of Company assets have a direct impact on our profitability and should be
avoided. All Company assets should be used only for legitimate business purposes of the
Company. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be immediately reported in
accordance with the reporting provisions of the Code.
X. ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY
All Company personnel are to accomplish their tasks in a manner that complies with the laws
protecting the environment, as well as those promoting the safety and health of all persons from
unreasonable risks. The Company is also obligated by law to ensure that the workplace is free
from recognized hazards that might cause physical harm.
XI. EMPLOYMENT-RELATED PRACTICES
Equal Employment Opportunity. The Company will provide equal employment opportunity to
all persons as required by law. In all employment decisions, including those involving
recruitment, hiring, placement, promotion, reassignment, compensation, training, discipline and
dismissal, the Company will afford equal opportunity to all individuals, without regard to race,
color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, veteran status, or any other classification declared to
be impermissible by law. Reasonable accommodations for individuals with handicaps or
disabilities will be made, as required by federal or applicable state law.
Anti-Harassment. The Company is committed to the principle that all of its employees should be able to enjoy a work environment free from all forms of discrimination and harassment, including, but not limited to, sexual harassment, and harassment and discrimination based on race, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, age or disability.
Workplace Violence and Weapons. Except as otherwise provided below or as required under applicable law, no weapons of any kind are permitted on Company property at any time.  Weapons in the possession of on-duty law enforcement officers and Company authorized security personnel are permitted on Company property.  In situations where there are prudent reasons to permit the presence of weapons on Company property, limited adjustments to the foregoing may be approved from time to time by the NACCO Corporate Compliance Counsel.

The Company has a policy of zero-tolerance for workplace violence, verbal and personal non-verbal threats and other actions that reasonably could have the effect of causing concern for the physical safety of Company personnel, vendors, contractors and visitors or for the security of the physical assets of the Company, including verbal and physical threats, fights, bomb threats and false fire alarms.  This includes threats made outside the workplace that have an impact on the workplace.
Immigration Laws. It is the Company's policy to comply fully with the immigration laws and regulations of the countries where it has employees.
XII. COMPLIANCE AND REPORTING 
 All Company personnel are required to report without delay through normal reporting channels (for example, your supervisor or any other manager) any conduct engaged in by themselves or by other Company personnel which they believe to be a violation of the Code or which they believe is unethical, dishonest or illegal. The identity of any Company personnel making such a report will be kept in strict confidence except as required by law. These procedures are designed to maintain confidentiality. Nevertheless, if you are aware of a violation of the Code but do not feel comfortable identifying yourself, the report may be made on an anonymous basis.
If after either (1) exhausting normal reporting procedures, or (2) reasonably concluding that exhausting them would not be feasible, employees should make reports of such activities by calling the Company's Corporate Compliance Helpline or by writing to the Corporate Compliance Counsel, on the following page.
It is a serious violation of the Code, and under certain circumstances a violation of applicable laws, for any manager of the Company to initiate or encourage reprisal against any Company personnel or other person who in good faith reports a known or suspected violation of law or the Code.
How to Report an Ethical Concern or Violation:
All Company personnel are required to report without delay through normal reporting channels (for example,
your supervisor or any other manager) any conduct engaged in by themselves or by other Company personnel
which they believe to be a violation of the Code or which they believe is unethical, dishonest or illegal. The
identity of any Company personnel making such a report will be kept in strict confidence except as required by
law. These procedures are designed to maintain confidentiality. Nevertheless, if you are aware of a violation of
the Code but do not feel comfortable identifying yourself, the report may be made on an anonymous basis.

 It is a serious violation of the Code, and under certain circumstances a violation of applicable laws, for any manager of the Company to initiate or encourage reprisal against any Company personnel or other person who in good faith reports a known or suspected violation of law or the Code.

Violations of the Code.The Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors shall determine whether an action taken by an executive officer or director of the Company that has been brought to its attention constitutes a violation of the Code.  The determination of whether an action taken by any other employee constitutes a violation of the Code shall be made by the Chief Executive Officer of the employee’s company.
Penalties. Any violation of this Code will form the basis for appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal.
It is the policy of the Company that (a) information relating to known acts of theft, defalcation and other crimes against the Company, whether committed by Company employees, representatives or others, shall be reported to appropriate regulatory or law enforcement authorities and (b) the employment of employees involved in any such acts shall be promptly terminated, except as otherwise determined by the Chief Executive Officer of NACCO or, in the case of a NACCO subsidiary, the Chief Executive Officer of the relevant subsidiary following consultation with the Chief Executive Officer of NACCO; provided that the Company shall not have the discretion to waive the requirement to report relevant information to appropriate regulatory or law enforcement authorities in accordance with (a), above, if such reporting is required by applicable federal, state, provincial or non-U.S. laws, statutes, regulations or other rules.
Waivers.  Only the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors may waive a provision of this Code for the Company's executive officers and directors, and any waiver will be promptly disclosed to the public in the manner and to the extent required by applicable law. Waivers of this Code for any other employee may be made only by the Chief Executive Officer of the employee's company.
CONCLUSION
The Company recognizes that it is sometimes difficult to delineate proper standards of ethical conduct. In such instances, Company personnel should not rely upon their own personal judgment, but should fully and openly discuss the matter with their supervisor. Company management may bring any further questions concerning the ethics or legality of a particular situation to the attention of the Chief Executive Officer of the Company or the Corporate Compliance Counsel who, if necessary, will consult with outside legal counsel for final determination.

Revenues decreased in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the first quarter of 2016 mainly due to reduced sales volumes, primarily in the U.S. consumer retail market in part driven by a decline in retail demand in the first quarter as retailers re-balanced inventory after the holiday-selling season. An increase in revenues from the favorable effect of sales of new and higher-priced products partly offset the effect of the reduced volumes.

The company provided earnings guidance for the year 2017. Net income in 2017 is expected to increase modestly compared with 2016 as benefits of the increased revenues are expected to be mostly offset by the costs to implement these initiatives, as well as increased advertising and distribution costs.  In 2017, cash flow before financing activities is expected to be substantial but lower than 2016. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $8 million in 2017, of which $1.0 million was expended in the first quarter of 2017.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

History[edit]
NACCO Industries originated in 1913 with the incorporation of the Cleveland and Western Coal Company. The name was changed to The North American Coal Corporation (NACCO) in 1925, and the company operated exclusively in the coal industry until the acquisition of Yale Materials Handling Corporation in 1985. This was followed in 1986 by creation of the holding company under the name NACCO Industries, Inc. NACCO Industries expanded into housewares with the purchase of Proctor Silex in 1988[1] and Hamilton Beach in 1990,[2] and expanded its presence in the materials handling industry by adding the Hyster Company in 1989.[3] Yale Materials Handling Corporation and the Hyster Company were combined to form NACCO Materials Handling Group, which was spun off in 2012.[4]

History[edit]
NACCO Industries originated in 1913 with the incorporation of the Cleveland and Western Coal Company. The name was changed to The North American Coal Corporation (NACCO) in 1925, and the company operated exclusively in the coal industry until the acquisition of Yale Materials Handling Corporation in 1985. This was followed in 1986 by creation of the holding company under the name NACCO Industries, Inc. NACCO Industries expanded into housewares with the purchase of Proctor Silex in 1988[1] and Hamilton Beach in 1990,[2] and expanded its presence in the materials handling industry by adding the Hyster Company in 1989.[3] Yale Materials Handling Corporation and the Hyster Company were combined to form NACCO Materials Handling Group, which was spun off in 2012.[4]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
