Early life[edit]
The daughter of a U.S. Foreign Service Officer, McHale was born in New York City and grew up in Britain and apartheid-era South Africa. During these formative years, McHale’s family home was said to be constantly under police surveillance and was wire-tapped; family friends were detained and mistreated; and she became close with key anti-apartheid activists, including Felicia Kentridge, who founded South Africa’s Legal Resource Centre, and her husband Sydney Kentridge, the noted civil rights lawyer who went on to represent slain anti-apartheid activist Steven Biko.
She is married to Michael O'Halloran and has two sons, Brian and Mark.
Her uncle was the journalist William McHale, Rome Bureau Chief for Time Magazine in the 1960s. He died along with Enrico Mattei, a leader of Italian oil company ENI, in a plane crash on October 27, 1962, later classified as a sabotage.[1]
Education[edit]
McHale graduated from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom and Fordham University School of Law in New York. She has received honorary degrees from the University of Maryland, American University, the University of Miami and Colby College.
Career[edit]

In the 1980s, McHale served as General Counsel for MTV Networks, overseeing legal affairs for MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1.
In 1987, McHale became General Counsel at Discovery Communications, then a small company with a single U.S. cable channel. She went on to serve as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and President, helping to grow Discovery into a large media company, with more than 100 channels available in 35 languages and distributed to more 1 billion subscribers in over 170 countries. During her tenure as president, Discovery’s revenues increased tenfold, with annual revenues topping $3 billion.
McHale and others at Discovery understood something important about communicating with people around the world: It makes more sense to engage people internationally on their own terms, in ways that respect their languages and customs, than it does just to bring them warmed-over versions of American programming. Discovery, nearly alone among American media companies that expanded internationally, put respect for cultural context and local voices at the heart of its business and creative strategies. It modified programming to respect viewers’ regional customs and translated – rather than simply subtitled—into 35 different languages.
McHale helped forge strategic partnerships, including an alliance in 1998 with the BBC that enabled a marriage of high-quality content and global distribution strength. Under her leadership the Discovery/BBC joint venture produced numerous documentaries including "Blue Planet", "Walking with Dinosaurs" and the award winning "Planet Earth. She also spearheaded numerous corporate acquisitions, including The Learning Channel in 1991 and the Travel Channel in 1997.
As a manager of a rapidly growing company with thousands of employees and offices in 22 countries, McHale made it a priority to create a workplace in which employees thrived professionally and personally. Discovery was consistently named one of the best places to work in various rankings, and, in 2004, McHale was honored by Working Mother magazine as a “National Family Champion” for her leadership.
At Discovery, McHale launched education and development initiatives in the United States and around the world, including the Discovery Channel Global Education Partnership, which provides free educational programming and technological support to more than a half million students at 200 schools and community centers throughout rural Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
In 2006, after nearly 20 years at Discovery, McHale moved to Global Environment Fund, a private equity firm based in Chevy Chase, MD. McHale worked to launch the GEF/Africa Growth Fund, an investment vehicle intending to focus on supplying expansion capital to small and medium-sized enterprises that provide consumer goods and services in emerging African markets.
Prior to joining the Department of State, McHale served on the Boards of Directors Polo/Ralph Lauren, Host Hotels and Resorts and DigitalGlobe, Inc. Ms. McHale currently serves on the board of directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Ralph Lauren Corporation Hilton Worldwide, Inc. and Yellow Media Limited.
Public service[edit]
In 1998, McHale was appointed by Governor Parris Glendening to a four-year term as a member of the Maryland State Board of Education. In September, 2013 McHale was appointed by Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, as Chair of the President's Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking.
McHale has also provided leadership to a range of organizations engaged in global affairs and development. She served on the boards of the Africa Society of the National Summit on Africa, Africare, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the National Democratic Institute, and Vital Voices. In 2008, she was the co-chair of the Platform Committee of the Democratic National Convention.

Early life[edit]
The daughter of a U.S. Foreign Service Officer, McHale was born in New York City and grew up in Britain and apartheid-era South Africa. During these formative years, McHale’s family home was said to be constantly under police surveillance and was wire-tapped; family friends were detained and mistreated; and she became close with key anti-apartheid activists, including Felicia Kentridge, who founded South Africa’s Legal Resource Centre, and her husband Sydney Kentridge, the noted civil rights lawyer who went on to represent slain anti-apartheid activist Steven Biko.
She is married to Michael O'Halloran and has two sons, Brian and Mark.
Her uncle was the journalist William McHale, Rome Bureau Chief for Time Magazine in the 1960s. He died along with Enrico Mattei, a leader of Italian oil company ENI, in a plane crash on October 27, 1962, later classified as a sabotage.[1]
Education[edit]
McHale graduated from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom and Fordham University School of Law in New York. She has received honorary degrees from the University of Maryland, American University, the University of Miami and Colby College.
Career[edit]

In the 1980s, McHale served as General Counsel for MTV Networks, overseeing legal affairs for MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1.
In 1987, McHale became General Counsel at Discovery Communications, then a small company with a single U.S. cable channel. She went on to serve as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and President, helping to grow Discovery into a large media company, with more than 100 channels available in 35 languages and distributed to more 1 billion subscribers in over 170 countries. During her tenure as president, Discovery’s revenues increased tenfold, with annual revenues topping $3 billion.
McHale and others at Discovery understood something important about communicating with people around the world: It makes more sense to engage people internationally on their own terms, in ways that respect their languages and customs, than it does just to bring them warmed-over versions of American programming. Discovery, nearly alone among American media companies that expanded internationally, put respect for cultural context and local voices at the heart of its business and creative strategies. It modified programming to respect viewers’ regional customs and translated – rather than simply subtitled—into 35 different languages.
McHale helped forge strategic partnerships, including an alliance in 1998 with the BBC that enabled a marriage of high-quality content and global distribution strength. Under her leadership the Discovery/BBC joint venture produced numerous documentaries including "Blue Planet", "Walking with Dinosaurs" and the award winning "Planet Earth. She also spearheaded numerous corporate acquisitions, including The Learning Channel in 1991 and the Travel Channel in 1997.
As a manager of a rapidly growing company with thousands of employees and offices in 22 countries, McHale made it a priority to create a workplace in which employees thrived professionally and personally. Discovery was consistently named one of the best places to work in various rankings, and, in 2004, McHale was honored by Working Mother magazine as a “National Family Champion” for her leadership.
At Discovery, McHale launched education and development initiatives in the United States and around the world, including the Discovery Channel Global Education Partnership, which provides free educational programming and technological support to more than a half million students at 200 schools and community centers throughout rural Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
In 2006, after nearly 20 years at Discovery, McHale moved to Global Environment Fund, a private equity firm based in Chevy Chase, MD. McHale worked to launch the GEF/Africa Growth Fund, an investment vehicle intending to focus on supplying expansion capital to small and medium-sized enterprises that provide consumer goods and services in emerging African markets.
Prior to joining the Department of State, McHale served on the Boards of Directors Polo/Ralph Lauren, Host Hotels and Resorts and DigitalGlobe, Inc. Ms. McHale currently serves on the board of directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Ralph Lauren Corporation Hilton Worldwide, Inc. and Yellow Media Limited.
Public service[edit]
In 1998, McHale was appointed by Governor Parris Glendening to a four-year term as a member of the Maryland State Board of Education. In September, 2013 McHale was appointed by Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, as Chair of the President's Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking.
McHale has also provided leadership to a range of organizations engaged in global affairs and development. She served on the boards of the Africa Society of the National Summit on Africa, Africare, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the National Democratic Institute, and Vital Voices. In 2008, she was the co-chair of the Platform Committee of the Democratic National Convention.

"Across almost 1,300 pages, seven parts and twenty-two articles, the book offers detailed analysis and commentary on a formidably broad range of other issues, from the organisation and regulation of health care, to actions arising from birth, to consent to treatment, to the regulation of medicinal products and medical devices - and of course, much more. Here is a field fraught with uncertainties and these too are dealt with in a measured, frank and analytical manner." - Phillip Taylor MBE, The Barrister

            The relationship between therapist and client is unique. Time spent together is purposefully structured to support that uniqueness and establish a framework and rhythm for working. Our work together will be centered in a spirit of safety, dignity, and respect at all times for your goals and needs.
        

            My areas of expertise include marriage, couples, relationship issues, grief, divorce/separation, family of origin dysfunction, incest, women's support issues.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect non-disciplinary board actions?Healthgrades collects non-disciplinary board actions from all 50 U.S. states.Conditions TreatedJudith McHale does not have any conditions listed.

Judith McHale


Honorary Degree Citation



Globalist. Image maker. Feminist. Diplomat. Your childhood in apartheid-era South Africa, where your family held close ties to anti-apartheid activists, imbued in you a commitment to social justice and a deep appreciation for the importance of citizenship, public service, and working for the public good. As a feminist CEO, your leadership ethic placed your company, Discovery Communications, among the best places to work in the United States. As the head of one of the world’s most successful media companies, you showcased the power of media to educate and connect people in culturally relevant ways across borders. You ensured that your educational programming was available across countries, ages, and income levels, and your commitment to corporate social responsibility was imprinted on Discovery Communications. Your global vision similarly defined your work with the Africa Growth Fund, which connected investors to the delivery of needed services and products in African countries. Your emphasis on cultural humility, global connections, and respect informs your current work as chief U.S. image maker, a job that you understand to be about listening and engaging at the grassroots level. As you told an audience in Bangladesh, “The process of opening minds and engendering mutual understanding does not and cannot be sparked only through high-level diplomatic meetings or negotiations between great corporations. The foundations for mutual understanding begin at the people-to-people level and require years, even decades, to be built. And the work is never done.” Your life offers a model of how that work should and can be done.
By the authority of the Board of Trustees of Colby College, I confer upon you, Judith McHale, the degree of Doctor of Laws, honoris causa. The hood with which you have been invested and this diploma which I place in your hand are visible symbols of your membership in this society of scholars, to all the rights and privileges of which I declare you entitled.
Conferred May 23, 2010

Early life[edit]
The daughter of a U.S. Foreign Service Officer, McHale was born in New York City and grew up in Britain and apartheid-era South Africa. During these formative years, McHale’s family home was said to be constantly under police surveillance and was wire-tapped; family friends were detained and mistreated; and she became close with key anti-apartheid activists, including Felicia Kentridge, who founded South Africa’s Legal Resource Centre, and her husband Sydney Kentridge, the noted civil rights lawyer who went on to represent slain anti-apartheid activist Steven Biko.
She is married to Michael O'Halloran and has two sons, Brian and Mark.
Her uncle was the journalist William McHale, Rome Bureau Chief for Time Magazine in the 1960s. He died along with Enrico Mattei, a leader of Italian oil company ENI, in a plane crash on October 27, 1962, later classified as a sabotage.[1]
Education[edit]
McHale graduated from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom and Fordham University School of Law in New York. She has received honorary degrees from the University of Maryland, American University, the University of Miami and Colby College.
Career[edit]

In the 1980s, McHale served as General Counsel for MTV Networks, overseeing legal affairs for MTV, Nickelodeon and VH-1.
In 1987, McHale became General Counsel at Discovery Communications, then a small company with a single U.S. cable channel. She went on to serve as Chief Operating Officer, Chief Executive Officer, and President, helping to grow Discovery into a large media company, with more than 100 channels available in 35 languages and distributed to more 1 billion subscribers in over 170 countries. During her tenure as president, Discovery’s revenues increased tenfold, with annual revenues topping $3 billion.
McHale and others at Discovery understood something important about communicating with people around the world: It makes more sense to engage people internationally on their own terms, in ways that respect their languages and customs, than it does just to bring them warmed-over versions of American programming. Discovery, nearly alone among American media companies that expanded internationally, put respect for cultural context and local voices at the heart of its business and creative strategies. It modified programming to respect viewers’ regional customs and translated – rather than simply subtitled—into 35 different languages.
McHale helped forge strategic partnerships, including an alliance in 1998 with the BBC that enabled a marriage of high-quality content and global distribution strength. Under her leadership the Discovery/BBC joint venture produced numerous documentaries including "Blue Planet", "Walking with Dinosaurs" and the award winning "Planet Earth. She also spearheaded numerous corporate acquisitions, including The Learning Channel in 1991 and the Travel Channel in 1997.
As a manager of a rapidly growing company with thousands of employees and offices in 22 countries, McHale made it a priority to create a workplace in which employees thrived professionally and personally. Discovery was consistently named one of the best places to work in various rankings, and, in 2004, McHale was honored by Working Mother magazine as a “National Family Champion” for her leadership.
At Discovery, McHale launched education and development initiatives in the United States and around the world, including the Discovery Channel Global Education Partnership, which provides free educational programming and technological support to more than a half million students at 200 schools and community centers throughout rural Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe.
In 2006, after nearly 20 years at Discovery, McHale moved to Global Environment Fund, a private equity firm based in Chevy Chase, MD. McHale worked to launch the GEF/Africa Growth Fund, an investment vehicle intending to focus on supplying expansion capital to small and medium-sized enterprises that provide consumer goods and services in emerging African markets.
Prior to joining the Department of State, McHale served on the Boards of Directors Polo/Ralph Lauren, Host Hotels and Resorts and DigitalGlobe, Inc. Ms. McHale currently serves on the board of directors of SeaWorld Entertainment, Ralph Lauren Corporation Hilton Worldwide, Inc. and Yellow Media Limited.
Public service[edit]
In 1998, McHale was appointed by Governor Parris Glendening to a four-year term as a member of the Maryland State Board of Education. In September, 2013 McHale was appointed by Secretary of the Interior, Sally Jewell, as Chair of the President's Advisory Council on Wildlife Trafficking.
McHale has also provided leadership to a range of organizations engaged in global affairs and development. She served on the boards of the Africa Society of the National Summit on Africa, Africare, the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, the National Democratic Institute, and Vital Voices. In 2008, she was the co-chair of the Platform Committee of the Democratic National Convention.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
