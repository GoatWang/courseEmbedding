ITEM 2.01
Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

 
On September 8, 2015,
Fuda Group (USA) Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), entered into stock-for-stock acquisition agreements
with each of Fuda Gold (UK) Limited, a private company organized under the laws of England and Wales (“Fuda UK”), and
Marvel Investment Corporation Limited, a private company organized under the laws of Hong Kong (“Marvel”), in separate
acquisitions (collectively, and together, the “Acquisitions”), that will be completed on the same date on which the
relevant financial statements of the Company has been provided to the satisfaction of the Company. The purpose of the Acquisitions
was to facilitate and prepare the Company for expanded business and operations as well as a registration statement and/or public
offering of securities. Based on separate agreement of the applicable parties, the Acquisitions were consummated on September 24,
2015.
 
Fuda UK was incorporated
in May 2015 in the United Kingdom. Since its inception, Fuda UK has conducted minimal business operations but has started to purchase
gold stones and powder and wholesale trading of gold bars.
 
Marvel was incorporated
in October 2009 in Hong Kong. Since its inception, Marvel conducted minimal business operations until it acquired Liaoning Fuda
Mining Co. Ltd. (“Liaoning Fuda”) pursuant to an equity transfer agreement executed on February 28, 2015 and later
consummated on June 30, 2015.
 
Liaoning Fuda was
incorporated in China in August 2012. Liaoning Fuda is a granite and marble trading company.
 
As a result of the
Acquisitions, each of Fuda UK and Marvel has been acquired by the Company, and now each has become a wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company (furthermore, Liaoning Fuda is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marvel). The Company, as the surviving entity from the
Acquisitions, has taken over the respective operations and business plans of each of both Fuda UK and Marvel (and also of Liaoning
Fuda by virtue of Marvel’s ownership of Liaoning Fuda).
 
Business
 
Prior to the Acquisitions,
the Company had no significant business, operations or plan. Accordingly, the business of the Company below is that of Fuda UK
and Marvel (and of Liaoning Fuda by virtue of Marvel’s ownership of Liaoning Fuda), each of which was acquired by the Company
in the Acquisitions.
 
The Company is engaged
in the business of gold and precious metals trading and investment, and additionally through vendor and supplier relationships
trades in granite and marble. The Company is engaged in the business of shipping in 2013 and the brokering of sales in 2014. Besides
trading of construction materials such as granite and marble, Liaoning Fuda also purchased titles to land use right surrounding
the mines for investment purposes.
 
The Company is engaged
in mining and processing of gold since July of 2015. The Company plans to look for mergers and acquisitions opportunities with
other companies and also to purchase gold mining assets and facilities.
 
For gold, trading
refers to the purchase of gold powder and then extracting and refining them into gold bars. Mining refers to the actual mining
of the gold mines, which the Company plans to pursue in the future.
 
For granite mining,
the Company plans to make acquisitions in an open granite mine that employ's saw cutting methods to remove large raw blocks from
the quarry. In addition, the Company also plans to process the raw blocks into slabs, pavers, wall claddings as well as carvings.
These products can be sold to government agencies for infrastructure projects, corporations, granite processing plants, civil engineering
companies as well renovation companies.
 

- 3 -
 
 
For gold and precious
metals operations, the Company currently purchases gold bars for trading. It also buys gold powder and stones for both processing
and trading. The processing would encompass the extraction of precious minerals out of the sand/rock, refining them into gold bars.
These gold powder and the stones are sourced from gold mines around China and Africa.
 
From July 2015, the
Company engaged in gold trading as a start to its vision to expand into the gold trade. The company has also started to purchase
gold powder and stones from various suppliers with the intention to either trade on these or appoint a subcontractor to extract
and process this gold powder into gold bars and other precious metal.
 
The Company’s
management believes that the market demand for natural resources (such as gold, granite and marble) will continue. Gold and other
precious metals are commodities and will have times of high and low price, but the demand for it as a commodity would be present.
The same to be said for granite and marble that would be affected by the economy in particular the performance in construction
trade.
 
Products and Services
 
The main activities
of the Company include: sales and marketing of both granite and marble raw blocks and finished products; and sales of gold and
other precious metal both raw powder/stones and finished products to domestic as well as international buyers. Though the company
is currently focused on selling domestically, it does not intend to abandon international buyers. We do not actively promote to
international buyers, however, if there is a request, we will still sell. We expect interest from international buyers to flow
in with the appointment of our new marketing director.
 
The finished products
for granite include granite slabs, pavers, carvings and wall claddings. Since one of the particular features of the stone that
the Company engages in is that they can be used for both for internal as well as external construction application, the Company
has a large target market to reach out to for sales of products.
 
The Company also buys
gold powder and raw stones from suppliers and processes them into gold bars via an appointed subcontractor since July of 2015.
The Company purchases gold powder and stones for refining and processing of these materials into its own brand name products. The
current product line that the company produces are wholesale bars in the weight of 5kg, 10kg and 25kg. Future product lines of
the Company would be to manufacture consumer gold items for consumer retail.
 
Seasonality of Business
 
The Company’s
business can encounter seasonal demand fluctuations in the granite and marble trade. Though processing activities can be conducted
all year around, mining activities are limited during winter. During seasonal periods, construction demand slows as well. Hence
to ensure that there are enough inventories to cater for winter sales a temporary build up in inventory is required.
 
Strategic Relationship with Suppliers
 
The Company believes
that the relationship with our major suppliers – such as Junda Mining, Heng Xu Mining, and Xiang An Mining will be a major
component of the Company’s operating strategy and path to success. The Company hopes to work with our major suppliers in
important areas of its business and operations. The Company’s management believes that adding more value to existing suppliers
is the most efficient and useful route to building the Company’s business in a competitive industry.
 
The Company does work
with several important suppliers/vendors that are important for its operations and success, including the three most significant
suppliers – Junda Mining, Heng Xu Mining and Xiang An Mining.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
The Company does not
presently need or require any approval of a material nature from government authorities or agencies in order to operate its regular
business and operations.

Customers
 
The Company has many
other customers, and plans to continue to grow its customer base. Customers are typically industrial wholesalers, government agencies
with infrastructure or upgrading projects, civil engineering firms, corporations, renovators, construction companies and stone
processing factories.
 
Some of construction projects
and clients that the Company has worked with for granite/marble include the following:

As the Company has
just begun its operations for gold bars and gold powder/stones, they are still growing their customer base. The Company is a member
of Singapore Assay Office an independent body that tests and certifies precious metal articles as well as assay and hallmarking.
Currently, the clients include Gold Jewellers, Gold Traders and refineries.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company has conducted
limited advertising and marketing to date to reach new customers. The Company has, however, given substantial attention to constructing
the marketing strategy and plans that it will use in order to grow its business and expand its customers. The Company eventually
anticipates the need for a significant budget for marketing activities. The primary focus of marketing campaigns will be designed
to help the Company find new customers and to increase awareness of the Company’s products, services and competitive solutions.
A variety of marketing approaches, emphasizing the competitive advantages, i.e. low cost labour and large domestic market in China,
and internal and external application as the key differentiators of the Company’s products and services, are expected to
be used in order to attract new customers and entice existing customers to do larger volumes of business with the Company.
 
The Company expects
that its sales team will work closely with the marketing team to win and retain new customers. The sales team will be structured
to align with target markets based on territory and customer patterns.
 
The Company also plans
to employ sales persons, distributors and other such agents in China and other countries. Relationships are key to success in the
Company’s business. Most institutional and government projects have all been established and maintained through personal
contact. Personal selling will remain the Company’s most important means of promotion in the corporate and government sectors.
 
In and through 2013
to 2014, the Company changed the focus of the business to more regional customers and distributions from international customers
and distribution channels. This is in large part due to larger costs associated with international delivery. Focusing on regional
customers was easier for collections, customers were familiar with products and logistics costs were significantly lower.
 

- 5 -
 
 
At the present time,
the Company generally sells direct to its customers, and wholesalers. Customers organize their own shipping and handling. The materials
are stored in their own warehouse. Hence, there is no cost associated with distribution.
 
The marketing strategy
is multi-faceted:
 

-Penetrate the applicable stone market.
 

-Emphasize personal service and support.
 

-Foster a long-term relationship business.
 

-Focus on the public-sector, major contractor and high-end homeowner as key target markets.
 

-Induce more companies to utilize the Company’s products.
 
The Company positions
itself with one core objective: satisfied customers are the best marketing tool. When a customer leaves the Company’s business
satisfied, knowing that they have dealt with an honest company, knowing that they have a reliable, trustworthy and quality product
at an attractive price, the Company expects that its name and services will stand on its own and build the Company’s brand
name and reputation.
 
Pricing
 
For raw blocks of
granite/marble, the pricing varied based on the applicable grades of the blocks. A raw block is a block cut from the mine with
the standard dimension of 3m x 2m x 1.5m with no processing, polish or trim. The raw block is then either put directly into inventory,
processed further to various stages and put into inventory to meet projected demand needs or immediately processed to customer
specification to fulfil an order. Volume discounts are offered by the Company to major clients. The Company considers its pricing
strategy to be competitive within its marketplace. For granite/marble, the Company prices finished products using prevailing market
rates. The market price is between 1200-1400 Chinese Yuan (USD$193.50 – USD$225.80) per ton.

The cost of Gold extraction is approximately $23 per gram. That includes the cost of purchasing raw gold
ore and sand as well as refining costs.
 
The purchase and sales
price of gold bars are determined by the exchange in which the trade is conducted or mutually agreed by both buyers and sellers.
The exchanges that current buyers and sellers refer to are LBMA, COMEX and SGEX.
 
Operations
 
The Company is mainly
engaged in trading of gold and granite/marble. At present, for granite and marble, the Company is supplying raw blocks to wholesalers
and other stone processing plants. Hence, to expand the business as an end-to-end supplier, the Company plans to build its own
processing plants and acquire mines to secure the best price supply and ensure a stable supply of materials. The company anticipates
this activity will increase profit margin by getting further down the supply chain, and thus increase the value we can provide
to our customers by reduce double handling costs in terms of transportation, supply costs and also sub-contractor margins. For
gold operations, the Company has only just started to purchase gold powder and stones with the intention to sell directly to refineries
or subcontract it out to refineries to extract out the gold and precious metal to form into blocks. Hence, to ensure a stable supply
and reduce on the reliance on subcontractors, the intention is for the Company to have its own processing facilities and acquires
mines to ensure supply and improve profit margins.
 
The Company’s
operating procedures are compliant as per ISO9001.
 
THE COMPANY
 
Employees and Organization
 
The Company presently
has approximately 50-60 employees.
 
Property
 
The Company currently
has the following physical locations and respective lease arrangements:
 
The Company’s Beijing Head office is located at Room
1010, 1011,Financial Street Center South Tower, No.9A, Financial Street, Xicheng District, Beijing 100033, P.R.
China.  The Company’s Beijing office consists of approximately 900 square feet of office space leased on a month-to-month
basis at $3,500 per month.
 
The Company’s China Regional office is located at 12th Floor, 100 Jin Jiang Street, Dandong City,
Liaoning Province, China.  The Company’s China office consists of approximately 5000 square feet of office space
leased on a 3 years basis at $5,250 per month.
 
If the Company were
forced to relocate, it believes it could obtain an equally satisfactory location at a comparable price.
 
The Company currently
owns land use rights to 8 parcels of lands surrounding the mines for investment purposes, containing a total of approximately 21.56
million square feet of land.
 
Subsidiaries
 
The Company has two
wholly owned subsidiaries: Fuda UK and Marvel. Liaoning Fuda is a wholly owned subsidiary of Marvel and in turn indirectly a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
Relationship with Tiber Creek Corporation
 
In 2015, the Company
entered into an engagement agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Tiber Creek”), whereby
Tiber Creek would provide assistance to the Company in effecting transactions for the Company to combine with a public reporting
company. Tiber Creek will specifically be providing assistance in transferring control of reporting to the Company, preparing the
business combination agreement, effecting the merger; the preparation and filing of forms which include a registration statement,
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They will also assist in listing the Companies securities on a trading exchange; and
establishing and maintaining relationships with market makers and broker-dealers.
 

- 7 -
 
 
Tiber Creek received
cash fees from the Company in exchange for their consulting services. In addition, the Company’s then-current shareholders,
Tiber Creek and MB Americus, LLC, a California limited liability company (“MB Americus”), were permitted to retain
the aggregate total of 500,000 shares. The engagement agreement also provides that the shares held by Tiber Creek and MB Americus
shall be included in the registration statement filed by the Company.
 
In general, Tiber Creek
holds interests in inactive Delaware corporations which may be used by issuers (such as the Company) to reincorporate their business
in the State of Delaware and capitalize the issuer at a level and in a manner (i.e. the number of authorized shares and rights
and preferences of shareholders) that is appropriate for a public company. Otherwise, these corporations, such as Spruce Valley
Acquisition, are inactive, and Tiber Creek does not conduct any business in such corporations.
 
James Cassidy and James
McKillop (who is the sole owner of MB Americus, an affiliate of Tiber Creek) serve only as interim officers and directors of these
corporations (such as Spruce Valley Acquisition) until such time as the changes of control in such corporations are effectuated
to the ultimate registering issuers. As the role of Tiber Creek is essentially limited to preparing the corporate structure and
organizing the Company for becoming a public company, the roles of Mr. Cassidy and Mr. McKillop are generally limited to facilitating
such change of control and securities registration transactions.
 
Summary Financial Information
 
The Company had no
operations or specific business plan until the Acquisitions.

of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the condensed balance sheet data as of December 31, 2014

Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
 
Overview
 
References to the financial
condition and performance of the Company below in this section “Management’s Discussions and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation” are to Liaoning Fuda Mining Co. Ltd, Fuda UK and Marvel respectively.
 
The Company’s
independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. Unless the
Company is able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and/or obtain additional financing, there is a substantial doubt
as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.
 
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
The Company has no
off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Equipment Financing
 
The Company has no
existing equipment financing arrangements.
 
Potential Revenue
 
The Company expects
to earn potential revenue from existing customers and product sales and refining and trading activities. The Company prospects
for new clients on an ongoing basis and also seeks additional revenue enhancement opportunities from existing clients. The company
will be also expanding its portfolio of products.
 
Alternative Financial Planning
 
The Company has no
alternative financial plans at the moment. If the Company is not able to successfully raise monies as needed through a private
placement or other securities offering (including, but not limited to, a primary public offering of securities), the Company’s
ability to expand its business plan or strategy over the next two years will be jeopardized.
 
Critical Accounting Policies
 
The financial statements
of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation
of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis
of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
 
Capital Resources
 
As of December 31,
2014, Liaoning Fuda had cash available of $466, Marvel had cash available of $0 and Fuda UK had cash available of $0.
 
As of June 30, 2015,
Marvel and its subsidiary Liaoning Fuda has cash available of $5,420,679 and Fuda UK had cash available of $0.
 
The Company’s
proposed expansion plans and business process improvements described above will necessitate additional capital and financing. Accordingly,
the Company plans to raise outside funding in order to achieve its expanded growth and profit objectives in its business over the
next two years. The monies raised will be utilized for general operations, working capital, acquisition of mines, acquisition of
gold sorting and refining facilities and acquisition of granite and marble processing facilities.
 

- 9 -
 
 
There can be no assurance
that the Company’s activities will generate sufficient revenues to sustain its operations without additional capital, or
if additional capital is needed, that such funds, if available, will be obtainable on terms satisfactory to the Company. Accordingly,
given the Company’s limited cash and cash equivalents on hand, the Company will be unable to implement its contemplated business
plans and operations unless it obtains additional financing or otherwise is able to generate sufficient revenues and profits. The
Company may raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity, obtain loan financing or develop and consummate other alternative
financial plans.
 
Discussion of Year ended December 31,
2014 and 2013 of Liaoning Fuda Mining Co. Ltd
 
Liaoning Fuda generated
revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014 of $42,518,470, as compared to revenues of $58,584,590 for the year ended December
31, 2013, a decrease of approximately 27% on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $28,248,139
or approximately 66% of revenues as compared to $25,169,638 or approximately 43% of revenues. The increase in gross margin from
2013 to 2014 resulted from decreased in expenses related to exporting and delivery of goods to customers.
 
During the year ended
December 31, 2014, Liaoning Fuda posted operating income of $27,018,801 and net income of $27,016,168 as compared to operating
income of 13,338,468 and net income of $7,961,161 for the year ending December 31, 2013. Operating fees from insurance decreased
92% from $4,575,337 in the year ended December 31, 2013 to $345,461 in the same period of 2014. The decrease in these costs was
primarily attributable to a decrease in employee wages and salaries, rental of equipment expenses, bad debt expenses, and agency
fees charged for overseas sales by $5,889,036 or approximately 356% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease in costs resulted from
Liaoning Fuda change of its business model focusing on local domestic market instead of international market. The significant impact
due to the change in business model was a result of less exports and more domestic sales which resulted in less gross sales but
higher sales margins. The change in business model also reduced the amount of inventory Liaoning Fuda had on hand to $3,843 at
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 from $5,679,351 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013. It also reduced the amounts
of sales made on credit as well which reduced the collection times and the cost of trade financing. The details are as follows:

$12,037,522 or approximately 60% of revenues as compared to $11,840,269 or approximately 55% of revenues. The increase in gross
margin from 2014 to 2015 resulted from decreased in expenses related to exporting and delivery of goods to customers.

expenses, and bad debt expenses. The decrease in costs resulted from Marvel and its subsidiary Liaoning Fuda change of its business
model focusing on local domestic market instead of international market. The significant impact due to the change in business model
was a result of less exports and more domestic sales. The details are as follows:

Risks and Uncertainties facing the Company
 
The Company has a
limited operating history and may experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to maintain a steady operating structure,
ensuring that expenses are contained such that profits are consistently achieved. In order to expand the Company’s business,
the Company would likely require additional financing.
 
One of the biggest
challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to continue to expand its business and build a larger scale
and more efficient set of operations. Secondarily, an ongoing challenge remains the maintenance of an efficient operating structure
and business model. The Company must keep its expenses and the costs of employees at a minimum in order to generate a profit from
the revenues that it receives from its clients. Third, in order to expand, the Company will need to continue implementing effective
sales, marketing and distribution strategies to reach the intended end customer clients. The Company has devised its initial sales,
marketing and advertising strategies, however, the Company will need to continue refinement of these strategies and also skillfully
implement these plans in order to achieve ongoing and long-term success in its business.
 

- 13 -
 
 
Due to financial constraints
and the early stage of the Company’s life, the Company has to date conducted limited advertising and marketing to reach customers.
In addition, the Company has not yet located the sources of funding to develop the Company on a broader scale through acquisitions
or other major partnerships. If the Company were unable to locate such financing and/or later develop strong and reliable sources
of potential customers and a means to efficiently reach buyers and customers, it is unlikely that the Company could develop its
operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan. Moreover, the above assumes that the Company’s
services are consistently met with client satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady success amongst the potential customer
base, neither of which is reasonably predictable or guaranteed.
 
The Company will likely
be significantly affected by any unforeseen changes in the businesses and operations of its clients. For example, and without limitation,
any change in the individual at a client making purchase decisions of the Company’s services or any change of the client
department that authorizes such purchases could potentially be very damaging for the Company.
 
Due to these and other
factors, the Company’s need for additional capital, the Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising
substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Risk Factors
 
No assurance of continued market acceptance.
 
There is no assurance
that the Company’s services or solutions will continued to meet with market acceptance. Moreover, there is no assurance that
these services and solutions will continue to have any competitive advantages. Also, there is no assurance that the market reception
will be positive. The Company’s industry is characterized by a large and fragmented group of competitors, and as such, there
can be no guarantee that the Company will not lose business to its existing or potential new competitors.
 
The Company’s independent auditors
have issued a report raising a substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company’s
independent auditors have issued a comment that unless the Company is able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations and/or
obtain additional financing, there is a substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The Company is an early-stage company
with a limited operating history, and as such, any prospective investor may have difficulty in assessing the Company’s profitability
or performance.
 
Because the Company
(except Fuda Mining Co.) is an early-stage company with a limited operating history, it could be difficult for any investor to
assess the performance of the Company or to determine whether the Company will meet its projected business plan. The Company has
limited financial results upon which an investor may judge its potential. As a company still in the early stages of its life, the
Company may in the future experience under-capitalization, shortages, setbacks and many of the problems, delays and expenses encountered
by any early-stage business. An investor will be required to make an investment decision based solely on the Company management’s
history, its projected operations in light of the risks, the limited operations and financial results of the Company to date, and
any expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by one engaging in the Company’s industry.
 
The Company is an early-stage company
and has little experience in being a public company.
 
The Company is an
early-stage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company. Such lack of experience may result in the Company
experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business. Further, the Company may be hampered by lack of experience
in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies. If the Company’s operating or management
abilities consistently perform below expectations, the Company’s business is unlikely to thrive.
 
The Company may not successfully consummate
or initiate acquisitions.
 
The ability of the
Company to grow through acquisitions (as planned) will depend on a number of factors, including competition for acquisitions, the
availability of capital and other resources to consummate acquisitions, and the ability to successfully integrate and train additional
staff, including the staff of an acquired company. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to establish
and expand its market presence or to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions on favorable
terms.
 

- 14 -
 
 
In addition to facing
competition in identifying and consummating successful acquisitions, such acquisitions could involve significant risks, including:
 

-difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, services, and
corporate culture of acquired companies, and higher-than-anticipated costs associated with such assimilation;
 

-over-valuation of acquired companies or delays in realizing or a
failure to realize the benefits, revenues, cost savings, and synergies that were anticipated;
 

-difficulties in integrating the acquired business into information
systems, controls, policies, and procedures;
 

-failure to retain key personnel, business relationships, reputation,
or clients of an acquired business;
 

-the potential impairment of acquired assets;
 

-diversion of management’s attention from other business activities;
 
insufficient indemnification
from the selling parties for legal liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to acquisition;
 

-the assumption of unknown liabilities and additional risks of the
acquired business; and
 

-unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial
and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations.
 
In addition, future
acquisitions could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, and
liquidity. Possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets, or restructuring charges could occur. These risks could
have a material adverse effect on the business because they may result in substantial costs to the Company and disrupt its business.
 
Reliance on third party agreements and
relationships is necessary for development of the Company's business.
 
The Company will need
strong third party relationships and partnerships in order to develop and grow its business. The Company will be substantially
dependent on these strategic partners and third party relationships.
 
The Company expects to incur additional
expenses and may ultimately never be profitable.
 
The Company is an
early-stage company and has a limited history of its operations. The Company will need to continue generating revenue in order
to maintain sustained profitability. Ultimately, in spite of the Company’s best or reasonable efforts, the Company may have
difficulty in generating revenues or remaining profitable.
 
The Company’s officers and directors
beneficially own a majority of the Company’s common stock and, as a result, can exercise control over stockholder and corporate
actions.
 
The officers and directors
of the Company currently beneficially own approximately 50% of the Company’s outstanding common stock. As such, they will
be able to control most matters requiring approval by stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant
corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control,
which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the Company’s common stock or prevent stockholders
from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares.
 

- 15 -
 
 
The Company does not have any independent
directors.
 
All of the directors
of the Company are executive officers and/or employees of the Company. As such, the Company does not have any independent oversight
or administration of its management and operations. The Company’s decision-making may suffer from the lack of an independent
set of directors, since only officers and employees of the Company will make all important decisions regarding the Company.
 
The Company depends on its management
team to manage its business effectively.
 
The Company's future
success is dependent in large part upon its ability to understand and develop the business plan and to attract and retain highly
skilled management, operational and executive personnel. In particular, due to the relatively early stage of the Company's business,
its future success is highly dependent on its officers, to provide the necessary experience and background to execute the Company's
business plan. The loss of any officer’s services could impede, particularly initially as the Company builds a record and
reputation, its ability to develop its objectives, and as such would negatively impact the Company's possible overall development.
 
The Company may face significant competition
from companies that serve its industries.
 
The Company may face
competition from other companies that offer similar solutions. Some of these potential competitors may have longer operating histories,
greater brand recognition, larger client bases and significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than the
Company possesses. These advantages may enable such competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging trends and changes in
customer preferences. These advantages may also allow them to engage in more extensive market research and development, undertake
extensive far-reaching marketing campaigns, adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential
customers, employees and strategic partners. The Company believes that its current and anticipated solutions are, and will be,
sufficiently different from existing competition, and that there is limited to no competition in its local area. However, it is
nevertheless possible that potential competitors may have or may rapidly acquire significant market share. Increased competition
may result in price reductions, reduced gross margin and loss of market share. The Company may not be able to compete successfully,
and competitive pressures may adversely affect its business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
No formal market survey has been conducted.
 
No independent marketing
survey has been performed to determine the potential demand for the Company’s products or services over the longer term.
The Company has conducted no marketing studies regarding whether its business would continue to be marketable. No assurances can
be given that upon marketing, sufficient customer markets and business segments can be developed to sustain the Company's operations
on a continued basis.
 
The Company has authorized the issuance
of preferred stock with certain preferences.
 
The board of directors
of the Company is authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of $0.0001 par value preferred stock. The board of directors has
the power to establish the dividend rates, liquidation preferences, and voting rights of any series of preferred stock, and these
rights may be superior to the rights of holders of shares of common stock. The board of directors may also establish redemption
and conversion terms and privileges with respect to any shares of preferred stock. Any such preferences may operate to the detriment
of the rights of the holders of the Shares, and further, could be used by the board of directors as a device to prevent a change
in control of the Company. Currently, no such preferred shares or preferences have been issued to date, but such shares or preferences
may be issued at a later time, subject to the sole discretion of the board of directors.
 

- 16 -
 
 
The Company does not maintain certain
insurance, including errors and omissions and indemnification insurance.
 
The Company has limited
capital and, therefore, does not currently have a policy of insurance against liabilities arising out of the negligence of its
officers and directors and/or deficiencies in any of its business operations. Even assuming that the Company obtained insurance,
there is no assurance that such insurance coverage would be adequate to satisfy any potential claims made against the Company,
its officers and directors, or its business operations. Any such liability which might arise could be substantial and may exceed
the assets of the Company. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Company provide for indemnification of officers
and directors to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons, it is the opinion of the Securities and Exchange
Commission that such indemnification is against public policy, as expressed in the Act, and is therefore, unenforceable.
 
Intellectual property and/or trade secret
protection may be inadequate.
 
The Company has not
applied for any intellectual property or trade secret protection on any aspects of its business. The Company has no current plans
on attempting to obtain patents, copyright, trademarks and/or service marks on any of its solutions and services. There can be
no assurance that the Company can obtain effective protection against unauthorized duplication or the introduction of substantially
similar solutions and services.
 
The Company is subject to the potential
factors of market and customer changes.
 
The business of the
Company is susceptible to rapidly changing preferences of the marketplace and its customers. The needs of customers are subject
to constant change, as staffing needs are as quick to change as are the businesses of customers. Although the Company intends to
continue to develop and improve its products and services to meet changing customer needs of the marketplace, there can be no assurance
that funds for such expenditures will be available or that the Company's competition will not develop similar or superior capabilities
or that the Company will be successful in its internal efforts. The future success of the Company will depend in part on its ability
to respond effectively to rapidly changing trends, industry standards and customer requirements by adapting and improving the features
and functions of its services. In the Company’s industry, failure by a business to adapt to the changing needs and demands
of customers is likely to render the business obsolete.
 
Shares of common stock in the Company
are subject to resale restrictions imposed by Rule 144 of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
The shares of common
stock held by current shareholders are “restricted securities” subject to the limitations of Rule 144 under the Securities
Act. In general, securities can be sold pursuant to Rule 144 after being fully-paid and held for more than 12 months. Shares of
the Company’s common stock are subject to Rule 144 resale restrictions, and accordingly, investors are subject to such resale
limitations.
 
Shareholders of the Company cannot rely
upon Rule 144 to resell securities of the Company.
 
Due to the Company’s
previous status as a shell company, shareholders cannot rely upon Rule 144 for resales of the Company’s securities (pursuant
to Rule 144(i)). As such, certain shares of common stock have no ability for resale or transfer until the Company meets the requirements
of Rule 144(i)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Commission
 
Rule 144 establishes
specific criteria for determining whether a person is not engaged in a distribution of securities. Among other things, Rule 144
creates a safe harbor whereby a person satisfying the applicable conditions of the Rule 144 safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged
in a distribution of the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the securities. If a purchaser of securities is unable
to rely upon Rule 144 to sell securities (due to Rule 144(i)), then the securities must be registered or another exemption from
registration must be found in order for the distribution of securities to be made. In the event that the securities are not registered
or another exemption is not found, a purchaser of securities cannot sell or transfer the shares of common stock in the Company
since the Company does not meet the requirements of Rule 144(i)(2).
 
Pursuant to Rule 144(i),
reliance upon Rule 144 is typically available for the resale of restricted or unrestricted securities that were initially issued
by a reporting or non-reporting shell company (or an issuer that has been at any time previously a reporting or non-reporting shell
company) only if the following conditions are met:
 

- 17 -
 
 
The issuer of the securities that was formerly
a reporting or non-reporting shell company has ceased to be a shell company;
 
The issuer of the securities is subject
to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
 
The issuer of the securities has filed
all reports and material required to be filed under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as applicable, during the preceding
12 months (or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports;
and
 
At least one year has elapsed from the
time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the Commission reflecting its status as an entity that is not
a shell company.
 
Government regulation could negatively
impact the business.
 
The Company’s
business segments may be subject to various government regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. Due to the potential
wide scope of the Company’s operations, the Company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities,
including various local and municipal agencies and government sub-divisions. The Company may incur increased costs necessary to
comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply. The Company’s operations
could be adversely affected, directly or indirectly, by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry.
 
The Company is susceptible to changes
economic conditions.
 
Demand for natural
resources may decline with changing economic conditions. For example, decline in private construction projects may reduce demand
for granite products that the Company operates in. International economic conditions or a slowdown of growth in China or around
the globe could harm the Company’s business and operations.
 
Changes in prices for metals or products
will affect the Company’s profitability and operations.
 
Commodities, such
as gold, fluctuate and change in price on a daily basis. Changes in these prices could negatively affect the Company’s operations
and profitability.
 
The Company is dependent on its suppliers,
and business difficulty for a supplier could harm the Company’s own business.
 
The Company relies
on its key suppliers. Difficulties that the suppliers experience will burden the Company’s ability to operate. The Company
needs to diversify among suppliers, but until such time, the Company is dependent and exposed to the risk of its current key suppliers.
 
The Company is exposed to seasonal risks
in its business and operations.
 
The Company’s
business can encounter seasonal issues from time to time in granite and marble mining as the mining and processing activities can
typically be done at year round and during the seasonal periods that construction demand slowed, the mines and processing continued
operations and built up inventories to prepare for the periods of higher demand.
 
ITEM 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities
 
Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities
 
The Company has issued
the following securities in the last three (3) years. All such securities were issued pursuant to an exemption from registration

I was having trouble with my Windows based laptop, which I have owned for about 4 years, and was reluctant to bring it into a retail computer shop (Staples, Best Buy, Office Max, etc.) knowing it would cost more to repair than to replace. I was referred to Churchill Tech Support through an acquaintance in the Murray Hill area, and made an appointment with Ryan around my busy schedule. I met with him at his office, but he was willing to travel to my home to troubleshoot the issues (which is incredibly helpful if you have a desktop versus a laptop). I explained the issues I was having in very laymen terms: computer slow to start up, incessant pop-ups, constant freezing, unreliable internet access, etc. He listened intently and assured me that he would be able to repair the issues and have my computer running like new in less than 24 hours. Not only did Ryan hold true to this promise, he explained, in terms even I could understand, the issues that were plaguing my computer and walked me through the additional features he installed (free of charge!) to prevent these same issues in the future. All in all, he completely surpassed my expectations and my laptop is running even better than it did 4 years ago! I highly recommend Churchill Tech Support and Ryan for all of your computer and tech related issues; he is reliable, professional, knowledgeable, patient, has references available upon request, and works with both Windows and Mac operating systems.Churchill Tech SupportBryan L. ratedIn our search for an experienced IT Professional to help out with computer, cloud, and connectivity issues, we could not of had a better find than the guys at Churchill Tech Support. Not only were they extremely professional and candid in their approach and ethic, but they came off as very personable, easy-going, and full of advice for inquiries and issues unrelated to our initial consultation. Within 2 hours flat of them showing up at our office, all issues were fixed and the work environment was not inhibited in anyway.  They were even able to help with a hardwired installation to ensure effective and efficient connectivity. I would highly recommend Churchill Tech Support for any IT based issue you or your office may encounter. Price is hard to beat as well!Churchill Tech SupportAnne H. ratedThey had me at "We stand behind our work." I don't know any other company that does not charge for coming back and fixing something that went wrong after they worked on my computer.  Suffice it to say that I am blown away...and I'm not easily impressed.  I have tried them all with varying degrees of satisfaction, and, although I've only needed CTS's services once, they top my list.  Professional, courteous, easy to work with.  Knowledgeable. Didn't waste time. Could not resolve every issue, but found a workaround.  Planning a second session ASAP for other issues, and, believe it or not, I am actually looking forward to it!Mac PC NYchandlerc ratedMy laptop died on me  when I was visiting New York City. I found this place to be very close to my hotel and went there hoping to get it fixed in the same day. Unfortunatelly for me the laptop needed a new mainbord, part that they did not have  stock. They offered to transfer my files to an external device, but I needed an working laptop. So I went to J& R,bought a new laptop and took it to Mac PC NY. In 2 hours all  files were transferred and most importantly my Outlook was set-up, so I was able to send and recive emails. Thank you so much guys!Willpower Infotech LimitedIt R. ratedOur sales and marketing team jointly selected my selections as our Web Design Company after a long 40 days of research and discussions.

  FUDA
GROUP (USA) CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 

Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

 

1.
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

 

Fuda Group
(USA) Corporation (“Fuda USA”) was incorporated on
September 25, 2014 under the laws of the state of Delaware to
engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not
limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.

 

On
September 28, 2015, Fuda USA entered into stock-for-stock
acquisition agreements with each of Fuda Gold (UK) Limited
(“Fuda UK”) and Marvel Investment Corporation Limited
(“Marvel”). As a result of the Acquisitions, each of
Fuda UK and Marvel has been acquired by Fuda USA, and now each has
become a wholly owned subsidiary of Fuda USA. Fuda USA, as the
surviving entity from the Acquisitions, has taken over the
respective operations and business plans of each of both Fuda UK
and Marvel (and also of Liaoning Fuda by virtue of Marvel’s
ownership of Liaoning Fuda). Refer to “Principal of
Consolidation” under Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies

 

Fuda UK a
private company organized under the laws of England and Wales was
incorporated in May 20, 2015. Since its inception, Fuda UK has
conducted minimal business operations but has started to purchase
gold stones and powder and wholesale trading of gold bars. Fuda UK
has executed a cooperative operation agreement to filter and sort
gold sands or gold dust from the gold mine tailings and to sell the
goods under a profit-sharing ratio.

 

Marvel
Investment Corporation Limited was incorporated on October 28, 2009
under the laws of Hong Kong, PRC. The Company was established to
engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not
limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.

Marvel has
conducted limited business operations in trading graphite and
fluorite.

 

On
February 28, 2015, Marvel entered into an Equity Interest Transfer
Agreement with Liaoning Fuda Mining Co., Ltd (“Liaoning
Fuda”) whereas Marvel agreed to acquire 100% equity interest
in Liaoning effective June 30, 2015. Both Marvel and Liaoning Fuda
are under common control of the same shareholder and no
consideration was given in exchange for the equity interest in
Liaoning Fuda. The acquisition was done to position Liaoning Fuda
in a more favorable tax position under the laws of Hong Kong, PRC.
Refer to “Principal of Consolidation” under Note 2
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Liaoning
Fuda was established in August 2012 in Dandong City, Liaoning
Province, China (“PRC”) with authorized capital of 60
million Chinese Yuan. Liaoning Fuda is a natural resource trading
company that consists of raw blocks, stone carvings, slabs, pavers
and wall claddings.

 

Fuda USA
and its subsidiaries Marvel, Fuda UK, and Liaoning Fuda shall be
collectively known as the “Company”.

 

2. SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements and related notes have
been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States of America (“US
GAAP”).

 

This basis
of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting and
consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and
expenses and losses are recognized when incurred.

 

The
Company’s financial statements are expressed in U.S.
dollars.

 

Interim
Financial Information

 

The
accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015,
which has been derived from the Company's audited financial
statements as of that date, and the unaudited condensed financial
information of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, has been prepared
in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article8-03 of
Regulation S-X for interim financial information.

 

In the
opinion of management, such financial information includes all
adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
Company's financial position at such date and the operating results
and cash flows for such periods. Operating results for the interim
period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of
the results that may be expected for the entire year. Certain
information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles have been omitted pursuant to the rules of the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

 

 




 



6



 




  

 

These
unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with
our audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended
December 31, 2015 filed on April 22, 2016.

 

Reclassification

 

Certain
amounts in the prior period financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on reported net income or
losses.

 

Principal
of Consolidation

 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.

 

Acquisition
of Fuda UK and Marvel by Fuda USA

 

The
acquisition was accounted under US GAAP as a business combination
under common control with Fuda USA being the acquirer and Fuda UK
and Marvel being the acquirees because all entities were controlled
directly or indirectly by the same majority shareholder. The
consolidated financial statements have been presented at historical
costs and on a retroactive basis to reflect the capital structure
of Fuda UK and Marvel as a recapitalization. The share exchange
transaction was completed and effective on September 28, 2015 and
Fuda UK and Marvel became subsidiaries of Fuda USA.

 

Acquisition
of Liaoning Fuda by Marvel

 

The
acquisition was accounted under US GAAP as a business combination
under common control with Marvel being the acquirer as both
entities were owned by the same shareholder. The consolidated
financial statements have been presented at historical costs and on
a retroactive basis. No purchase price or reverse merger accounting
methods were used. The business combination transaction was
completed and effective on June 30, 2015 and Liaoning became a
subsidiary of Marvel.

 

Use of
Estimates

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during
the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from
those results.

 

Comprehensive
Income (Loss)

 

The
Company follows the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 220 “Reporting Comprehensive
Income”, and establishes standards for the reporting and
display of comprehensive income, its components and accumulated
balances in a full set of general purpose financial statements. The
Company’s comprehensive income (loss) consist of net income
(loss) and foreign currency translation adjustments.

 

Fair Value
Measurements

 

The
Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, “Fair
Value Measurements”, for fair value measurements of financial
assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of
nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value
in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes a framework
for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements.

 

Fair value
is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. When determining the
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or
permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the
principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact
and it considers assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability.

 

ASC 820
establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value. The
hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1
measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three
levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

-                    Level
1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices
(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active
markets.

-                    Level
2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that
are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or
indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial
instruments.

-                    Level
3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and
significant to the fair value.

There were
no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring
basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of the
balance sheet date.

three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash
equivalents.

 

Accounts
Receivable

 

Accounts

from outstanding balances. The Company provides for probable
uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to
an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the
current status of individual accounts. Balances that are still
outstanding after the Company has used reasonable collection
efforts are written off through a charge to the allowance for
doubtful accounts and a credit to accounts receivable.

 

Bad debt
expenses were $nil and $215,209 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories,
which are primarily comprised of goods for sale, are stated at the
lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first- in
first-out (FIFO) method. The Company evaluates the need for
reserves associated with obsolete, slow-moving and non-salable
inventory by reviewing net realizable values on a periodic
basis.

 


Property
and Equipment

 

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the
straight-line method, at original cost, over the estimated useful
lives of the assets as follows:

 




Machinery

years





Office
equipment



 



5
years





Motor
Vehicle

Expenditures
for repairs and maintenance, which do not improve or extend the
expected useful lives of the assets, are expensed as incurred while
major replacements and improvements are capitalized.

Valuation
of Long-Lived assets

 

Long-lived
assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a
comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash
flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are
considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is
measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets
exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are
reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell.

Nonmonetary
Transactions

Company recognizes nonmonetary transactions in accordance to ASC
845-10-30 which in general, that nonmonetary transactions should be
based on the fair values of the assets (or services) involved,
which is the same basis as that used in monetary transactions.

another nonmonetary asset is the fair value of the asset
surrendered to obtain it, and a gain or loss shall be recognized on
the exchange. The fair value of the asset received shall be used to
measure the cost if it is more clearly evident than the fair value
of the asset surrendered. Similarly, a nonmonetary asset received
in a nonreciprocal transfer shall be recorded at the fair value of
the asset received. A transfer of a nonmonetary asset to a
stockholder or to another entity in a nonreciprocal transfer shall

Stock
Based Com p
ensation

 

The
Company recognizes stock based compensation in accordance to ASC718
which requires companies to measure the compensation costs of
share-based compensation arrangements based on the grant-date fair
value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the
period during which employees are required to provide services.
Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options,
restricted share plans, performance-based awards, share
appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such,
compensation cost is measured on the date of grant at their fair
value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the
respective vesting periods of the option grant.

 

Equity
instruments (“instruments”) issued to other than
employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the
instruments, as required by ASC No. 718. FASB ASC No. 505, Equity
Based Payments to Non-Employees, defines the measurement date and
recognition period for such instruments. In general, the
measurement date is when either (a) a performance commitment, as
defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee
performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The
measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a
period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular
grant as defined in the FASB ASC.

 

Income
Taxes

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability
approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of
deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax
benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach,
deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income
tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax
assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire
before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that
future deductibility is uncertain.

Under ASC
740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is
“more likely than not” that the tax position would be
sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being
presumed to occur. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step
process. The first step is to determine whether it is
more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon
examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or
litigations based on the technical merits of that position. The
second step is to measure a tax position that meets the
more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit
to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is
measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50
percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax
positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent
period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax
positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria
should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting
period in which the threshold is no longer met. Penalties and
interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are
classified as income tax expense in the year incurred.

 

Se
g ment
Information

 

The
standard, “Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and
Related Information,” codified with ASC-280, requires certain
financial and supplementary information to be disclosed on an
annual and interim basis for each reportable segment of an
enterprise. The Company believes that it operates in one business
segment (marketing and sales) and in one geographical segment
(China), as all of the Company’s current operations are
carried in China.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic
842)”. The standard requires lessees to recognize lease
assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires
expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. We will adopt the
standard no later than July 1, 2019. The Company is currently
assessing the impact that the new standard will have on the
Company’s consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

 

In March
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, “Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment
Accounting”. The standard amends several aspects of the
accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including
the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax
withholding requirements, as well as classification in the
statement of cash flows. We will adopt the standard no later than
July 1, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the
new standard, and do not expect the new guidance to have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations
and financial condition.

 

In August
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.
The standard provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and
payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash
flows, including beneficial interests in securitization, which
would impact the presentation of the deferred purchase price from
sales of receivables. The standard is intended to reduce current
diversity in practice. Early adoption is permitted, including
adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures and the timing of
adoption.

 

In
September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments
– Credit Losses (Topic 326). The amendments in ASU 2016-13
replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP
with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and
requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and
supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU
2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2019, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and
early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU No. 2016-13 on
its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

 

The
Company believes that there were no other accounting standards
recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact
on our financial position or results of operations.

11. BARTER
TRADE EXCHANGE

 

In 2013,
the Company acquired lands from Beijing Huanda Renewal Resources
Recycling Co. Ltd. (“Beijing Huanda”) (non- related
party) for RMB 55,944,000. In addition, Beijing Huanda is also a
customer of the Company who has executed sales agreements to
purchase granite stones from the Company. The purchase price of the
land (its corresponding outstanding payables) were partially paid
off in cash as well as in a barter trade exchange which the fair
market sales price of the stones (its corresponding accounts
receivables) were used to offset the outstanding
payables.

 

In 2014,
the Company acquired lands from Fuda Investment (affiliated entity)
for RMB 127,424,700, and from Winner International (affiliated) for
RMB 65,965,000. In addition, Fuda Investment and Winner
International has executed sales agreements to purchase granite
stones from the Company. The purchase price of the land (its
corresponding outstanding payables) was to be paid off by fair
market sales price of the stones (its corresponding accounts
receivables) as a barter trade exchange.

 

In
accordance to ASC 845-10-05-6, the transactions above are
considered nonmonetary transaction because the transactions involve
exchange of products held for sale in the ordinary course of
business (inventory) for other productive assets (lands) as a means
of selling the product (inventory) to a customer.

 

In
accordance to ASC 845-10-30, the lands purchased were recorded at
the purchase price of the lands (assets received) as indicated on
the agreement because the costs to acquire the stones from the
suppliers, and the types, the sales price, and the quantity of
stones to be delivered was not determinable at the time of the
exchange. As a result, the earning process was not completed at the
time of the exchange and therefore gain or loss cannot be computed
at the time of the exchange.

 

The
Company could not record the exchange of land for stones at
historical costs of the stones because the stones to be delivered
to the land sellers are based on fair market sales price in the
future, and is not based on the costs of the stones paid by the
Company. The sales to relieve the accounts payable were not needed
immediately as the exchange wasn’t instant and the stones in
inventory at the time weren’t all going to relieve this debt.
The agreement was to provide stones in barter when the land sellers
needed the stones. The transaction would have been completed when
the lands were transferred if all of the stones were immediately
delivered from inventory and extinguished but instead the stones
were delivered as required and “sold” or bartered at
fair market value of the stones in the future which changed
considerably over the period of the barter where there was no fixed
or historical price that could be utilized.

 

The
“Sales Agreement” and the “Land Purchase and Sale
Agreements” executed by the parties above consisted of two
separate agreements.

 

The Sales
Agreement includes a total sales amount equal to the purchase price
of the granite and provides that payment may be made by cash or
land. The Sales Agreement also includes the name, type and grade of
granite and a unit sales price for each granite product based on
the fair market value on the day of execution of the Sales
Agreement. However, the actual sales price to be paid is the fair
market value of that product on the date of the purchase order.
Such price fluctuation is usually no greater than 10% (higher or
lower) and is typically acceptable to both the purchaser and
seller. In addition, the Sales Agreements also indicate the
acceptable quality of the granite block, the delivery terms, and
penalty clauses for breach of contract.

The Land
Purchase and Sale agreements indicate the sales price of the land,
the size of the land, and the unit sales price per mu/acre but do
not contain payment terms or maturity date. Each of the Land
Purchase and Sale Agreements also states that the Company is
required to manage, nurture, harvest and develop the woodlands in
accordance to the guidelines of the Forestry Department as long as
the Company owns the lands. The guidelines of the Forestry
Department does not require the company to provide any maintenance
as long as the land is not being developed and naturally growing.
The Company does not intend to develop the property at this time.
The contractual period of the land is approximately 55 years for
each contract. The Company estimated that the cost to manage,
nurture, harvest and develop the woodlands is minimal because the
trees would grow and develop naturally without much care or
intervention. The only cost would be laborers to manage and harvest
the woodlands, if required, but the Company does not anticipate
doing any such harvesting or managing. If used, any laborers would
be unskilled workers at a very low wage. Therefore, the effect to
the Company's financial and operational obligation is
minimal.

 

In 2013,
the Company and Beijing Huanda (the land seller) executed a
“Land Purchase and Sales Agreement” for approximately
621.6mu (102.4 acre) at a price of RMB90,000 (approximately
$14,645) per mu. Initial payment was due on transfer of the land
title which the Company paid in cash to Beijing Huanda.
Subsequently, Beijing Huanda experienced a need for granite and
entered into a sales agreement with the Company to purchase granite
from the Company. The parties also agreed to use granite to reduce
the remaining amount due on the Land Purchase and Sales
Agreement.

 

In 2014,
Fuda Investment and Winner International (the “Land
Sellers”) executed a series of “Sales Agreement”
and “Land Purchase and Sale Agreement” with the Company
for an aggregate of approximately 1,415.83mu (233.24 acre) for an
average price of RMB90,000 (approximately $14,645) per mu, and
approximately 607.1mu (100.0 acre) for an average price of
RMB108,656 (approximately $17,680) per mu, respectively. As the
Company desired to acquire land from the Land Sellers, and the Land
Sellers desired to purchase granite from the Company, the parties
agreed to trade the land for granite. Thereafter, each executed a
Sales Agreement and a Land Purchase and Sales Agreement with the
Company. The transaction is considered an arm- length transaction
as the purchase price of the land is determined based on appraised
value and the price of granite is based on normal sales price
without any special consideration or discount or conditions. The
appraisal was a current appraisal and performed by an independent
third-party.

 

The land
debts above were treated as Accounts Payable and Accrued expenses
classified as a current liability on the balance sheet as there
were no payment terms or maturity date.

 

The
Company initially recognized land assets and its corresponding
payables to the sellers at purchase price of the lands as indicated
on the agreement. When stones were delivered to the sellers as
ordered, the fair market sales price of the stones delivered were
recognized against the outstanding amount owed to the sellers. The
differences between the fair market sales price of the stones
delivered and the cost of the stones purchased by the Company in
inventory were recognized as gain or loss from barter trade.
Accordingly, the Company netted the barter trade sales and cost of
sales and recorded as gain or loss on barter trade, no revenue or
cost of sales are recorded related to these barter
trades.

 

For
Beijing Huanda, the Company delivered stones with fair market sales
price of $3,240 that cost the Company $245 to purchase the stones
in inventory from the suppliers, as a result the Company recognized
gain on barter trade of $2,995 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Outstanding payable to Beijing Huanda was reduced by
$3,240 through barter exchange.

 

For Fuda
Investment, the Company delivered stones with fair market sales
price of $6,192,648 that cost the Company $469,140 to purchase the
stones in inventory from the suppliers, as a result the Company
recognized gain on barter trade of $5,723,508 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Outstanding payable to Fuda Investment
was reduced by $6,192,648 through barter exchange.

 

For Winner
International, the Company delivered stones with fair market sales
price of $2,137,199 that cost the Company$161,910 to purchase the
stones in inventory from the suppliers, as a result the Company
recognized gain on barter trade of $1,975,289 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Outstanding payable to Winner
International was reduced by $2,137,199 through barter
exchange.

 

The
Company reviewed ASC 845-10-30-4 and determined that the barter
trade exchange transactions above are in the normal course of
business and have commercial substance because the Company’s
future cash flows are expected to significantly change as a result
of the exchange. The Company’s future cash flows are expected
to significantly change because the configuration (risk, timing,
and amount) of the future cash flows of the asset(s) received
differs significantly from the configuration of the future cash
flows of the asset(s) transferred. In the normal course of
business, the Company purchase granite, sell to customers for
profit and receive cash payment from the customers which has
commercial substance. In the barter trade exchange, the Company
purchased granites stones and sold to the land sellers as customers
and received land as payment. The future cash flows of the lands
received differs significantly from the configuration of the future
cash flows of the granite transferred. If the Company did not
acquire lands from these customers, the Company would receive cash
from these customers as payment. In contrary, if the Company did
not sell granite to these land sellers as customers, the Company
would pay cash to these land sellers for the lands as
payment.
