BOOKS
A limited number of autographed copies are available. Books not currently being sold by the publishers might also be available directly from Dr. Epstein. 
 

Teen 2.0: Saving Our Children and Families from the Torment of Adolescence (Quill Driver Books, April 2010)
An updated and expanded version of Dr. Epstein's award-winning book, The Case Against Adolescence. It includes a new introduction, the Young Person's Bill of Rights, and a practical guide for parents called, "Finding the Adult in Your Teen." Facts and figures have been updated throughout the book to reflect the latest developments in law, public policy, and psychological research.
From The Library Journal, February 2010:"Epstein, former editor in chief of Psychology Today, has revised his respected 2007 title, The Case Against Adolescence. He claims that adolescent psychology is a myth created by a culture that overextends childhood and infantilizes teens; that this myth makes young people feel angry and hopeless; and that our current concept of adolescence is an unnecessary historical anomaly brought about by modern industrialization. Epstein recommends judging teens as individuals, not as a group; and for making decisions based on competencies, not age. Each chapter leads with a concise 'Overview,' which might provide enough information for busy readers, and one of two new appendixes contains parenting tips for 'Finding the Inner Adult in Your Teen.' Among the many good titles on the invention theory of adolescence, Epstein’s is the most comprehensive and authoritative."
 
The Case Against Adolescence: Rediscovering the Adult in Every Teen(Quill Driver Books, April 2007)
From the Publisher:
A revolutionary proposal for raising responsible and happy teenagers, this groundbreaking book argues that adolescence is an unnecessary period of life that we’re better off without. Epstein shows that teen turmoil is caused by outmoded systems put in place a century ago which destroyed the continuum between childhood and adulthood. Where this continuum still exists in other countries, there is no adolescence. Isolated from adults, American teens learn everything they know from their media-dominated peers—“the last people on earth they should be learning from,” says Epstein. He shows that our teens are highly capable—in some ways more capable than adults—and argues strongly against “infantilizing” young people. We must rediscover “the adult in every teen,” he says, by giving young people adult authority and responsibility as soon as they can demonstrate readiness. This landmark book will change our thinking about teens for decades to come.
Praise for THE CASE AGAINST ADOLESCENCE:
NEWT GINGRICH: “If you are concerned about America's young—and about America's future—this is a must-read.” 
ALBERT ELLIS: “...one of the most revolutionary books I have ever read.” (from the Foreword) 
M. SCOTT PECK: “...has vast consequence for our society.” 
JOYCE BROTHERS: “…a profoundly important book.” 
ALVIN TOFFLER: “If you care about the future of our young people, The Case Against Adolescence is an essential read.” 
DEEPAK CHOPRA: “We need to reexamine our basic assumptions about young people, and Epstein shows us how.” 
ROBERT COLES: “Here are America’s youth, regarded keenly, knowingly....” 
LEON BOTSTEIN: “...a vital book for parents and policy makers on the state and federal levels” 
BUZZ ALDRIN: “This book will bring our ideas about teens down to earth.” 
MARIEL HEMINGWAY: “This book has opened my eyes….” 
MIHALY CSIKSZENTMIHALYI: “...a very original approach, sure to ignite discussion and controversy.” 
DREW PINSKY: “a landmark book” 
SUZANNE SOMERS: “Dr. Epstein makes a good case for adolescents to be treated not as a group with a formula, but as individual unique people.” 
JEAN LIEDLOFF: “...a powerful case” 
ELLEN LANGER: “His arguments deserve serious consideration and open debate.” 
JOHN TAYLOR GATTO: “Whether you’re a parent, a teacher, a policy maker, or a recovering victim of enforced childishness, you need to read this book.” 
CURTIS SLIWA: “…an amazing book, long overdue.” 
 
Parsing the Turing Test: Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer(Springer, January 2008, co-edited with Gary Roberts and Grace Beber)
Parsing the Turing Test is a landmark exploration of both the philosophical and methodological issues surrounding the search for true artificial intelligence. Will computers and robots ever think and communicate the way humans do? When a computer crosses the threshold into self-consciousness, will it immediately jump into the Internet and create a World Mind? Will intelligent computers someday recognize the rather doubtful intelligence of human beings? Distinguished psychologists, computer scientists, philosophers, and programmers from around the world debate these weighty issues – and, in effect, the future of the human race – in this important volume.

Irrelativity(Astrion, 1997)Editorial Reviews: The Book Reader, Summer 1997, p.42The equivalent of Spike Jones to music, this dose of irreverence is a hoot. Epstein is legit, with a Ph.D. from Harvard, widely published in quality journals. But he just had to shake the jowls of that other -stein, Ein-, and give equal time to another scientist. A fictitious one called U.T. Zalna. His theory? Irrelativity. 'This is probably for the best, since the universe actually parts its hair somewhat differently than Einstein led us to believe.' ....Just throw caution to the relative wind and read on, as Epstein tickles. He jabs at modern physics and the extent to which it defies common sense. He wonders whether there really could be extra-dimensional burgers. Then he 'gets serious' with discourses on The Big Bore, Missing Bodies, the Mind-Body Problem, Religion and Black Holes. 'The black hole, the greatest of all swallowers of everything, spits up radiation.' He concludes with a salute to his own Zalna and ponders Bathroom Graffiti on the Foundations of Science. His concoction makes life somewhat more easy to understand. None of that curved space and relative time stuff. Although...how can he zap his theories back in time to read as a kid, to pre-date Einstein? Like the movies? Then he remembers. His theory is not only irrelative, it's irrelevant. The book is not. One physicist reader winced, got angry - then broke down laughing. From the PublisherAmong many letters received were three from outstanding writers of science fiction. "Einstein meets Seinfeld! An oddly satisfying romp through some really weird neighborhoods of both substance and theory. Douglas Adams, take a glance over your shoulder and say hello to Robert Epstein!" (Mike Sirota, author of Bicycling Through Space and Time) "A rich mix of fact and fantasy, told in a style somewhere between Martin Gardner and Henny Youngman. Epstein spoofs Big Science while simultaneously conveying real data about the universe. A fun book." (Charles Platt, author of The Silicon Man) "An infuriating book! I can't count the times I winced, got angry...then broke down laughing." (David Brin, physicist, winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards, author of Earth and The Postman) From the Back Cover"The ideal book for people who don't already know everything about the universe. It synthesizes unequal parts of modern physics and the philosophy of science with perfectly necessary doses of wit and humor."
 
Creativity Games for Trainers: A Handbook of Group Activities for Jumpstarting Workplace Creativity(McGraw Hill, 1995)One of McGraw-Hill Business Division's best sellers, Creativity Games for Trainers is a step-by-step guide that allows professional trainers (or managers or teachers) to boost the creativity of any group or organization. Based on extensive scientific research by creativity expert Dr. Robert Epstein, Creativity Games uses a competencies approach to boosting creativity. According to Dr. Epstein, the ability to express creativity is based on a number of measurable, trainable skills. This book includes an abridged version of one of Epstein's creativity competencies tests that allows trainers to quickly assess where participant's strengths and weaknesses lie. Then, through fun and upbeat games, trainers can work with any group to boost competencies where they're weak. The games boost creativity, improve basic skills needed to express creativity, and increase people's understanding of how creativity works. It thus gives people a foundation for being able to express more creativity throughout their lives. The book includes recommended programs for half-day, full-day, or two-day training sessions. Available in trade paperback or trainers-notebook editions. 

 

Cognition, Creativity and Behavior: Selected Essays(Praeger, 1996)This is a collection of more than 30 of Dr. Epstein's scientific, scholarly, and popular papers on creativity, resurgence, imitation, parenting, peace, and more. From the back cover:
"Robert Epstein's immense influence on the field of psychology started early and has never abated. He established an international reputation while still a graduate student working under the guidance of B. F. Skinner at Harvard University. His scholarly contributions and achievements since that time, many of which are summarized in this book, have been nothing short of extraordinary. Professor Epstein thinks profound thoughts nonstop, generate novel and creative ideas at the drop of a hat, and is famous for his propensity to translate these ideas into bold deeds. As I see it, the book's title is a reflection of th areas in which he excels. This collection of some of Epstein's most celebrated essays will surely fascinate anyone who has ever contemplated the mysteries of cognition, creativity, and behavior." —John Wixted, Professor and Chair, Department of Psychology, University of California San Diego
"Epstein shows how far one can go without positing internal representations and processes. He provides an unusual perspective on such central topics in cognitive science as creativity, and shows the value of regarding complex cognitive phenomena from multiple perspectives. Even those who disagree with his basic assumptions will find it worthwhile to consider Epstein's approach." —Stephen M. Kosslyn, Professor of Psychology, Harvard University
"Cognition, Creativity, and Behavior" is a wonderfully informative and entertaining volume with particularly impressive breadth and coverage. Granted such coverage is only useful if the author can back up his ideas and suggestions, but Professor Epstein can and does. He describes unambiguously valid methods and research findings, but is equally careful to describe bridges between the laboratory and the natural environment. He relies on sound methods (both experimental and logical), but at the same time stretches the boundaries of application by tackling such topics as self-control, spontaneous behavior, creativity, and world peace. This truly is a book for everyone...." —Mark A. Runco, Editor, Creativity Research Journal 

 

Pure Fitness: Body Meets Mind(Masters Press, 1996; co-authored with Lori "Ice" Fetrick of the American Gladiators)Editorial Review: IngramWhen a beautiful female athlete meets a Harvard-trained psychologist, the result is a book that redefines fitness for the '90s and beyond. Lori Fetrick, who's also known as "Ice" on the popular TV show American Gladiators, teams up with Dr. Robert Epstein to present readers with 12 keys to achieving mental, physical, and spiritual balance. Photos. 
 
Self Help Without the Hype(Performance Management Associates, 1997)
Editorial Review from Amazon.com: The essence of practicality!




 
Reviewer: Adam Khan, Bellevue, WA USA 




In the tradition of The One Minute Manager, this book is delivered as a short story of a younger man learning from an older man. The content is simple. And it is extremely practical. I wrote the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, and I have to say I was a little jealous at what Epstein had done. It is clear, simple, and one hundred percent practical. Epstein says his real-life model for the older man in the book is none other than B. F. Skinner, whom Epstein knew personally.
