History[edit]
The first operations began in 1998 with the founding of the e-commerce website Cdiscount, a single website focused on offering CDs and DVDs.[4]
Cdiscount then expanded its business to encompass product categories such as consumer electronics, computers, home appliances and wine.
In 2008, the companies Pontofrio.com and eHub were launched in Brazil, providing e-commerce services to third-party retailers.[5]
The Brazilian expansion continued in 2010 by adding the Extra.com.br and CasasBahia.com.br websites to the portfolio, and the creation of business unit focused on business-to-business wholesale called Pontofrio Atacado. In 2011, Cdiscount implemented its first marketplace and launched ComptoirSante.com, an e-commerce website dedicated to beauty products.[6]
During the year 2012, two new websites were launched in Brazil. An online marketplace was also created on the Extra.com.br website in Brazil.
2014, Cnova, a global e-commerce company with a total gross merchandise volume of $4.9 billion, was created through a joint venture between Casino, GPA, Via Varejo and Exito. Cnova will be directly owned 46.5% by Casino (including its subsidiary Exito) and 53.5% indirectly by GPA, Via Varejo and certain founding shareholders of Nova Pontocom.[7][8]
2014 saw the merger of both French and Brazilian e-commerce activities under the Cnova umbrella, as well as the Cdiscount expansion in Colombia, Ivory Coast, Belgium and Senegal.[9]
Presentation[edit]
The current geographies represent over 500 million people with Cnova sites in France, Brazil, Colombia, Ivory Coast, Belgium and Senegal, and operations in Brazil under the sites Extra.com.br, Pontofrio.com and Casasbahia.com.br.[10] It operates B2B solutions, such as the eCommerce solution eHub, and niche sites both in France and Brazil, with Comptoirsante.com, Moncornerdeco.com, or Barateiro.com.
Cnova has established itself as an eCommerce market leader in France and Brazil. Through the direct sales websites and its marketplaces, Cnova offers an extensive product assortment (including home appliances, consumer electronics, computers, home furnishings, leisure and personal goods) and differentiated delivery and payment options.[11][12][13]

CNOVA N.V.  Second Quarter 2017 Activity



CNOVA N.V.  Second Quarter 2017 Activity Amsterdam - July 11, 2017, 07:45 CEST - Cnova N.V. (Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) ("Cnova" or the "Company") today announced unaudited 2nd quarter 2017 operating data as well as details of its strategic realignment plan.   GMV: €685 million (+11% like-for-like[*])   Mobile share:                  37.2% (+   776 bp)   Marketplace share:         35.0% (+   314 bp)   CDAV share:                   32.0% (+1,547 bp)     Net sales: €410 million (+9% like-for-like*)   Traffic: 208 million visits (+12%)   Mobile share of traffic:     59% (+    767 bp)      Active customers: 8.4 million (+10%)   CDAV subscribers:      +103%      Orders: 5.7 million (+9%)   CDAV share:                    29.6% (+1,415 bp)     Launch of volume-centric strategic realignment   Cdiscount renews market share gains (Gfk)   Emmanuel Grenier, Cnova CEO, commented:  "During the 2nd quarter of 2017, our traffic and GMV grew at a double-digit rates, our customer loyalty program doubled in size and our marketplace accounted for more than one-third of our GMV. It is clear to us that, thanks to our technological expertise, we have one of the best traffic growth dynamics in France, and our mission going forward is to leverage this into higher GMV and net sales growth rates on a sustainable basis. To do this, we have embarked on a new strategic realignment plan designed to one, expand massively our direct sales product range; two, reinforce our multichannel offer; and three, accelerate the introduction of new B2B revenue streams. Cdiscount is entering into a new growth phase which will see, compared to the end of 2016, its direct sales product range nearly quadruple in size, a 50% increase of its marketplace product catalogue and an 80% expansion of its distribution center floor space by the end of the 1st quarter of 2018. The new revenue streams we are introducing or accelerating will include increased marketplace fulfillment, new B2B services for our marketplace vendors such as foreign exchange and merchant financing, new data-based revenues, consumer credit and insurance solutions. And on top of all of this, we are improving customer satisfaction before and after purchase. For example, we are launching a new multichannel strategy that includes a new delivery option, and we are making more progress in terms of light product delivery speed. We have completely revamped our mobile site/application and customer area to make it more reactive and to make ordering products easier and faster.  The implementation of these growth initiatives, which temporarily weigh on margins and free cash flow this year, will allow Cdiscount to reinforce its top player status while strengthening its underlying profitability profile on a sustainable basis. These strategic moves are already stimulating top-line growth. They also allow us to enter into new markets where we are making market share advances." 2nd Quarter 2017 Highlights GMV (gross merchandise volume) totaled €685 million, an increase of 11.5% compared to the same period in 2016 on a like-for-like (l-f-l) basis. On a reported basis, GMV rose 7.4% compared to 2016. The mobile share of GMV was 37.2% representing a growth of 776 basis points. The marketplace share of total GMV continue to expand, reaching 35.0% for an increase of +314 basis points. The number of products available increased by 28%. The share of marketplace GMV fulfilled by Cdiscount rose from 5% at the end of June 2016 to 13% one year later while the number of vendors using Cdiscount's fulfillment services doubled y-o-y. The quality of our marketplace vendors showed continuous improvement with customer satisfaction, up by 14 points on average since the beginning of 2017 compared to last year.     Net sales totaled €410 million in the 2nd quarter 2017, up 8.6% on a l-f-l basis compared to the same period in 2016 (+4.5% on a reported basis). Home furnishings and household appliances accounted for 50% of direct sales, while hi-tech items (AV and smartphones) and IT goods represented 34% of direct sales.  According to Gfk (May 2017), Cdiscount's Technical Goods (Hi-tech, Computers and Home Appliances) value and volume market share grew y-o-y by +151 and +229 basis points, respectively. Traffic at Cdiscount.com during the 2nd quarter of 2017 grew by 11.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 208 million visits. Traffic has grown on average by double-digits on a y-o-y basis every quarter since the beginning of 2016. According to Médiamétrie, Cdiscount posted the highest progression among the five main e-retailers in France during the first five months of 2017 in terms of the number of desktop unique monthly visitors.  The mobile share of traffic increased +767 basis points to 59.5% during the same period and has been growing by an average of 600 basis points per quarter since the beginning of 2016.       Traffic   1Q16   2Q16   3Q16   4Q16   1Q17   2Q17     Growth (y-o-y)   +12.1%   +10.7%   +6.5%   +13.2%   +11.4%   +11.6%     Mobile Share   50.6%   51.8%   54.2%   55.1%   56.9%   59.5%      The number of active customers also continued to rise, reaching 8.4 million at June 30, 2017 (a y-o-y increase of 9.5%).   Membership of Cdiscount à volonté (CDAV), Cdiscount's customer loyalty program doubled y-o-y. Orders totaled 5.7 million during the 2nd quarter of 2017, for a y-o-y increase of 8.9%. CDAV customers accounted for 29.6% of the 2nd quarter 2017 orders compared to 15.4% during the same period in 2016. The number of items sold increased to 11.1 million from 10.4 million during the same period in 2016 (up 6.4%).  2017 Strategic Realignment Plan The Group is embarking on a wide ranging growth plan in order to return to a sustainable double-digit GMV growth rate while strengthening sources of profitability. Strategic initiatives launched during the 2nd quarter 2017 were primarily of three types: product catalogue expansion, multichannel offer reinforcement and the launch of new revenue streams.  Product catalogue expansion:   Cdiscount is currently in the middle of a massive product range extension program designed to almost quadruple the number of CDAV-eligible direct sale references and increase marketplace references by one-half. In addition to reinforcing its market leading position in the Home product category, Cdiscount is boosting its diversity and availability of items in Leisure, Family markets (Sport, Games, Baby.), Technical Goods (notably accessories) and plans to launch a Fashion segment by the end of 2017. Cdiscount also strives to anticipate demands on innovative and "trendy" products (connected objects, hand spinners, fidget cube, etc.). At June 30, 2017, Cdiscount had already doubled the number of SKUs that were available at the beginning of the year. Newly available SKUs represented close to 7% of total volumes sold and 5% of total net sales in the second half of June 2017.   In order to accommodate the increasing size of the product range, Cdiscount has initiated a warehouse capacity expansion program that should increase by close to 80% total distribution center (DC) floor space between the end of 2016 and the end of the 1st quarter 2018. At the end of June 2017, total floor space had grown to 380 thousand m² (up from 295 thousand m², or +28%, compared to the end of June 2016), including a 30,000 m² extension of the Orléans DC. By the end of March 2018, Cdiscount plans to have over 10 major and several smaller DCs throughout France with a total floor space trending toward 600 thousand m². This will include a newly built 60,000 m² DC in the southern part of Paris opening in July 2017.   Multichannel offer reinforcement:   In conjunction with the expansion of Cnova's product catalogue as well as to achieve more synergies with Groupe Casino in France (Casino), Cnova is implementing with Casino a reinforced multichannel strategy which allows Géant hypermarkets and Casino supermarkets (DCF) as well as Cdiscount to carry the same home furnishing high-tech and household appliance items, offer a wider variety of delivery options to DCF and Cdiscount customers (Cdiscount home delivery, Click-&-Collect pick-up, online purchase with immediate DCF in-store pickup and the usual in-store purchases) and achieve operational cost savings. It also addresses the increasing trend whereby consumers are buying more of these product categories online while preserving the inclination of many customers to discover and inspect products in-store. As a consequence, Cnova is now managing both DCF's and Cdiscount's home furnishing and household appliance inventory (Cnova bought Casino hypermarkets and supermarkets existing inventories on June 18, 2017, for a total consideration of about €78 million including VAT).   Launch of new revenue streams:   Roll-out of Fulfilment-by-Cdiscount (FBC) and premium pack (higher visibility and statistics report) for marketplace sellers.    Monetizing the flow of vendors on our marketplace interface with new advertising revenues.   Launch of new services for vendors, including foreign exchange and merchant financing.   Plan to offer a wider range of insurance options, initially to include school, pet and credit card services with an extension to home and loan insurance.    Technology and Logistics  Cdiscount continues to maintain its technological and logistics edges in the French market:   According to Yooda, Cdiscount posted the strongest SEO progression in the French e-commerce sector in 2017 thus far.   Cdiscount is optimizing the performance of its platforms through the implementation of React Native, the deployment of Progressive Web App (PWA) and the testing of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).    Cdiscount's mobile site has been completely revamped such that there is a higher visibility of promotions, optimized ergonomics and new functionalities. As a result, the mobile share of total GMV reached its highest level ever in June 2017 (39%) and the page load speed should continue to improve throughout the 3rd quarter 2017.    The reinforced multichannel offer dovetails nicely with Cdiscount's Click-and-Collect pick-up point network (C-&-C), many of which are part of Casino's bricks and mortar footprint in France. During the 2nd quarter 2017, more than half (53%) of our orders were delivered through our C-&-C network.   Cdiscount began in July 2017 to offer same-day delivery of a selection of its light product (<30 kg) catalogue to its customers in Paris. The entire light product catalogue will be available for Paris same-day delivery beginning October 2017.

                CNOVA N.V.  Second Quarter 2017 Activity



CNOVA N.V.  Second Quarter 2017 Activity Amsterdam - July 11, 2017, 07:45 CEST - Cnova N.V. (Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) ("Cnova" or the "Company") today announced unaudited 2nd quarter 2017 operating data as well as details of its strategic realignment plan.   GMV: €685 million (+11% like-for-like[*])   Mobile share:                  37.2% (+   776 bp)   Marketplace share:         35.0% (+   314 bp)   CDAV share:                   32.0% (+1,547 bp)     Net sales: €410 million (+9% like-for-like*)   Traffic: 208 million visits (+12%)   Mobile share of traffic:     59% (+    767 bp)      Active customers: 8.4 million (+10%)   CDAV subscribers:      +103%      Orders: 5.7 million (+9%)   CDAV share:                    29.6% (+1,415 bp)     Launch of volume-centric strategic realignment   Cdiscount renews market share gains (Gfk)   Emmanuel Grenier, Cnova CEO, commented:  "During the 2nd quarter of 2017, our traffic and GMV grew at a double-digit rates, our customer loyalty program doubled in size and our marketplace accounted for more than one-third of our GMV. It is clear to us that, thanks to our technological expertise, we have one of the best traffic growth dynamics in France, and our mission going forward is to leverage this into higher GMV and net sales growth rates on a sustainable basis. To do this, we have embarked on a new strategic realignment plan designed to one, expand massively our direct sales product range; two, reinforce our multichannel offer; and three, accelerate the introduction of new B2B revenue streams. Cdiscount is entering into a new growth phase which will see, compared to the end of 2016, its direct sales product range nearly quadruple in size, a 50% increase of its marketplace product catalogue and an 80% expansion of its distribution center floor space by the end of the 1st quarter of 2018. The new revenue streams we are introducing or accelerating will include increased marketplace fulfillment, new B2B services for our marketplace vendors such as foreign exchange and merchant financing, new data-based revenues, consumer credit and insurance solutions. And on top of all of this, we are improving customer satisfaction before and after purchase. For example, we are launching a new multichannel strategy that includes a new delivery option, and we are making more progress in terms of light product delivery speed. We have completely revamped our mobile site/application and customer area to make it more reactive and to make ordering products easier and faster.  The implementation of these growth initiatives, which temporarily weigh on margins and free cash flow this year, will allow Cdiscount to reinforce its top player status while strengthening its underlying profitability profile on a sustainable basis. These strategic moves are already stimulating top-line growth. They also allow us to enter into new markets where we are making market share advances." 2nd Quarter 2017 Highlights GMV (gross merchandise volume) totaled €685 million, an increase of 11.5% compared to the same period in 2016 on a like-for-like (l-f-l) basis. On a reported basis, GMV rose 7.4% compared to 2016. The mobile share of GMV was 37.2% representing a growth of 776 basis points. The marketplace share of total GMV continue to expand, reaching 35.0% for an increase of +314 basis points. The number of products available increased by 28%. The share of marketplace GMV fulfilled by Cdiscount rose from 5% at the end of June 2016 to 13% one year later while the number of vendors using Cdiscount's fulfillment services doubled y-o-y. The quality of our marketplace vendors showed continuous improvement with customer satisfaction, up by 14 points on average since the beginning of 2017 compared to last year.     Net sales totaled €410 million in the 2nd quarter 2017, up 8.6% on a l-f-l basis compared to the same period in 2016 (+4.5% on a reported basis). Home furnishings and household appliances accounted for 50% of direct sales, while hi-tech items (AV and smartphones) and IT goods represented 34% of direct sales.  According to Gfk (May 2017), Cdiscount's Technical Goods (Hi-tech, Computers and Home Appliances) value and volume market share grew y-o-y by +151 and +229 basis points, respectively. Traffic at Cdiscount.com during the 2nd quarter of 2017 grew by 11.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 208 million visits. Traffic has grown on average by double-digits on a y-o-y basis every quarter since the beginning of 2016. According to Médiamétrie, Cdiscount posted the highest progression among the five main e-retailers in France during the first five months of 2017 in terms of the number of desktop unique monthly visitors.  The mobile share of traffic increased +767 basis points to 59.5% during the same period and has been growing by an average of 600 basis points per quarter since the beginning of 2016.       Traffic   1Q16   2Q16   3Q16   4Q16   1Q17   2Q17     Growth (y-o-y)   +12.1%   +10.7%   +6.5%   +13.2%   +11.4%   +11.6%     Mobile Share   50.6%   51.8%   54.2%   55.1%   56.9%   59.5%      The number of active customers also continued to rise, reaching 8.4 million at June 30, 2017 (a y-o-y increase of 9.5%).   Membership of Cdiscount à volonté (CDAV), Cdiscount's customer loyalty program doubled y-o-y. Orders totaled 5.7 million during the 2nd quarter of 2017, for a y-o-y increase of 8.9%. CDAV customers accounted for 29.6% of the 2nd quarter 2017 orders compared to 15.4% during the same period in 2016. The number of items sold increased to 11.1 million from 10.4 million during the same period in 2016 (up 6.4%).  2017 Strategic Realignment Plan The Group is embarking on a wide ranging growth plan in order to return to a sustainable double-digit GMV growth rate while strengthening sources of profitability. Strategic initiatives launched during the 2nd quarter 2017 were primarily of three types: product catalogue expansion, multichannel offer reinforcement and the launch of new revenue streams.  Product catalogue expansion:   Cdiscount is currently in the middle of a massive product range extension program designed to almost quadruple the number of CDAV-eligible direct sale references and increase marketplace references by one-half. In addition to reinforcing its market leading position in the Home product category, Cdiscount is boosting its diversity and availability of items in Leisure, Family markets (Sport, Games, Baby.), Technical Goods (notably accessories) and plans to launch a Fashion segment by the end of 2017. Cdiscount also strives to anticipate demands on innovative and "trendy" products (connected objects, hand spinners, fidget cube, etc.). At June 30, 2017, Cdiscount had already doubled the number of SKUs that were available at the beginning of the year. Newly available SKUs represented close to 7% of total volumes sold and 5% of total net sales in the second half of June 2017.   In order to accommodate the increasing size of the product range, Cdiscount has initiated a warehouse capacity expansion program that should increase by close to 80% total distribution center (DC) floor space between the end of 2016 and the end of the 1st quarter 2018. At the end of June 2017, total floor space had grown to 380 thousand m² (up from 295 thousand m², or +28%, compared to the end of June 2016), including a 30,000 m² extension of the Orléans DC. By the end of March 2018, Cdiscount plans to have over 10 major and several smaller DCs throughout France with a total floor space trending toward 600 thousand m². This will include a newly built 60,000 m² DC in the southern part of Paris opening in July 2017.   Multichannel offer reinforcement:   In conjunction with the expansion of Cnova's product catalogue as well as to achieve more synergies with Groupe Casino in France (Casino), Cnova is implementing with Casino a reinforced multichannel strategy which allows Géant hypermarkets and Casino supermarkets (DCF) as well as Cdiscount to carry the same home furnishing high-tech and household appliance items, offer a wider variety of delivery options to DCF and Cdiscount customers (Cdiscount home delivery, Click-&-Collect pick-up, online purchase with immediate DCF in-store pickup and the usual in-store purchases) and achieve operational cost savings. It also addresses the increasing trend whereby consumers are buying more of these product categories online while preserving the inclination of many customers to discover and inspect products in-store. As a consequence, Cnova is now managing both DCF's and Cdiscount's home furnishing and household appliance inventory (Cnova bought Casino hypermarkets and supermarkets existing inventories on June 18, 2017, for a total consideration of about €78 million including VAT).   Launch of new revenue streams:   Roll-out of Fulfilment-by-Cdiscount (FBC) and premium pack (higher visibility and statistics report) for marketplace sellers.    Monetizing the flow of vendors on our marketplace interface with new advertising revenues.   Launch of new services for vendors, including foreign exchange and merchant financing.   Plan to offer a wider range of insurance options, initially to include school, pet and credit card services with an extension to home and loan insurance.    Technology and Logistics  Cdiscount continues to maintain its technological and logistics edges in the French market:   According to Yooda, Cdiscount posted the strongest SEO progression in the French e-commerce sector in 2017 thus far.   Cdiscount is optimizing the performance of its platforms through the implementation of React Native, the deployment of Progressive Web App (PWA) and the testing of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).    Cdiscount's mobile site has been completely revamped such that there is a higher visibility of promotions, optimized ergonomics and new functionalities. As a result, the mobile share of total GMV reached its highest level ever in June 2017 (39%) and the page load speed should continue to improve throughout the 3rd quarter 2017.    The reinforced multichannel offer dovetails nicely with Cdiscount's Click-and-Collect pick-up point network (C-&-C), many of which are part of Casino's bricks and mortar footprint in France. During the 2nd quarter 2017, more than half (53%) of our orders were delivered through our C-&-C network.   Cdiscount began in July 2017 to offer same-day delivery of a selection of its light product (<30 kg) catalogue to its customers in Paris. The entire light product catalogue will be available for Paris same-day delivery beginning October 2017.   Planning for delivery by drone, first tested in December 2016, is moving forward in conjunction with Thales.   Warehouse modernization proceeds apace with the planned installation of additional 3D automated packaging machines.    Second Quarter Activity     Cnova N.V.

Cnova N.V.

Robbins Arroyo LLP: Cnova N.V. (CNV) Misled Shareholders According to a Recently Filed Class Action
Robbins Arroyo LLP announces that a class action complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. The complaint alleges that officers and directors of Cnova N.V. (NASDAQGS: CNV) violated the Securities Act of 1933 by filing a misleading Registration Statement and Prospectus (collectively, “Registration Statement”) in connection with the company’s initial public stock offering (“IPO”) on November 20, 2014. Cnova operates as an eCommerce company in Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa.
Cnova Accused of Filing Misleading Registration Statement
According to the complaint, Cnova’s Registration Statement failed to disclose that the company’s operations were in the midst of a serious slowdown and that the company’s Brazil operations lacked sufficient controls, specifically, the handling of product returns and damaged product inventory at Cnova’s Brazilian distribution centers. On November 20, 2014, using the false and misleading Registration Statement, Cnova successfully raised approximately $188 million in its IPO, collectively selling 26.8 million shares at $7.00 per share. The Registration Statement stressed the company’s particular strength in Brazil, and emphasized the company’s increased market share and profitability in the Brazilian market.
On January 29, 2015, Cnova revealed for the first time that its Brazilian operations were in the midst of a marked slowdown. The company missed the consensus estimate for the fourth quarter 2014 adjusted EBITDA and announced first quarter 2015 sales guidance that was much lower than analysts were expecting. Cnova claimed that macroeconomic conditions were responsible for the slowdown, but analysts were unconvinced, noting that the company’s Q4 results were not in line with its statement. On January 30, 2015, a Deutsche Bank analyst stated that Cnova’s fourth quarter gross profit and EBITDA missed its estimates by 5% and 33%. On this news, Cnova stock fell from $7.37 to $5.50 per share, or over 25%, over the course of two days. Then, on December 18, 2015, Cnova announced that the company’s Board of Directors engaged legal advisors and external forensic accountants to perform a review of issues in connection with employee misconduct related to inventory management predominantly in Brazil. On this news, Cnova’s stock fell $0.53, or nearly 18%, to close at $2.42 per share on December 21, 2015.

 CNOVA N.V.  2017 First Half Activity and Financial Results AMSTERDAM, July 25, 2017, 07:45 CEST Cnova N.V. (Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) ("Cnova" or the "Company") today announced its first half 2017 activity and unaudited financial results.                                   ·         Traffic: 442 million visits (+11%)                                        -    Best first five month traffic growth (Médiamétrie)                                        -    Mobile share of traffic:     58% (+ 696 bp)                                   ·         Active customers: 8.4 million (+10%)                                        -     CDAV subscribers:        +103% y-o-y                                   ·         GMV: €1,456 million (+10% like-for-like1)                                        -    Mobile share:                   36.7% (+   874 bp)                                        -    Marketplace share:          33.4% (+   288 bp)                                        -    CDAV share:                    30.1% (+1,423 bp)                                  ·         Net sales: €882 million (+8% like-for-like)                                  ·         Renewed and accelerated market share gains (Gfk): +1.5 points in May and +2.0 points in June                                  ·         Cdiscount operating EBIT reflects €8 million higher IT costs                                   ·         Strategic realignment plan to stimulate GMV & net sales growth rates                                        -    Increase conversion rate                                        -    Promote repeat business                                                            Key figures€ in millions  First Half(2)  Change  2017  2016  Reported  L-F-L(1)   GMV  1,455.6  1,370.3  +6.2%  +10.5%   Net sales  882.3  857.8  +2.9%  +7.6%   Gross profit  123.2  121.5  +1.3%      Gross margin  14.0%  14.2%  -21 bp      SG&A  (140.2)  (124.8)  +12.3%      Operating EBIT  (17.0)  (3.2)          Cdiscount  (13.7)  (1.4)         Net profit/(loss) (from continuing activities)  (43.5)  (35.1)         Adjusted EPS (from continuing activities)  (0.10)  (0.06)         Like-for-like: includes adjustments related to i) the sale or closure in 2016 of the specialty sites Comptoir des Parfums, Comptoir Santé and MonCornerDéco, ii) the voluntary pullback of B2B sales initiated in the 3rd quarter of 2016, iii) the exclusion of TV products, which benefited from the mandatory shift to Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT), and the Euro football championship in the 1st half 2016 (1.7pt and 2.3pt on GMV and net sales growth, respectively), iv) the impact of 2017 summer sales starting one week later than in 2016 (1.0pt and 0.9pt on GMV and net sales growth, respectively), v) Cdiscount sales realized with Casino clients in France resulting from the multichannel agreement with Casino effective June 19, 2017, and vi) the leap year impact of 2016.   All 2016 figures are unaudited and have been adjusted for all periods to reflect i) the merger of Cnova Brazil into Via Varejo on October 31, 2016, ii) the sale or closure of Cdiscount international sites, and iii) the sale of the specialty site MonShowroom. These are reported as discontinued activities in accordance with IFRS 5 as of January 1, 2016.  1st Half 2017 Activity Highlights Traffic at Cdiscount.com during the 1st half of 2017 grew by 11.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 442 million visits. Cdiscount posted the highest progression during the first five months of 2017 among the five main e-retailers in France, in the number of desktop unique monthly visitors, according to Médiamétrie.  The mobile share of traffic increased 696 basis points to 58.1% during the same period. Mobile conversion increased by 15 basis points on a yearly basis.  The number of active customers also continued to climb, reaching 8.4 million at 30 June 2017 (a y-o-y increase of 9.5%).   Membership of Cdiscount à volonté (CDAV), Cdiscount's customer loyalty program doubled y-o-y at the end of June. Orders totaled 12.2 million during the 1st half of 2017, for a y-o-y increase of 11.4%. CDAV customers accounted for 29% of the 1st half 2017 orders compared to 12% during the same period in 2016. The number of items sold increased to 23.6 million from 21.6 million during the same period in 2016 (up 9.2%). GMV (gross merchandise volume) totaled €1,456 million, an increase of 10.5% compared to the same period in 2016 on a like-for-like (l-f-l) basis (1Q17: +7.7%; 2Q17: +11.5%). On a reported basis, GMV rose 6.2% compared to 2016 (1Q17: +5.2%; 2Q17: +7.4%). The mobile share of GMV was up 874 basis points to 36.7%. The marketplace share of total GMV continued to expand, reaching 33.4% for an increase of 288 basis points. The number of products available increased by 28%. The share of marketplace GMV fulfilled by Cdiscount rose from 5% in June 2016 to 13% in June 2017 while the number of vendors using Cdiscount's fulfillment services doubled y-o-y as at end of June. The quality of our marketplace vendors showed continuous improvement with customer satisfaction up by 14 points on average since the beginning of the 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.  1st Half 2017 Financial Performance Net sales totaled €882 million in the 1st half 2017, up 7.6% on a l-f-l basis compared to the same period in 2016 (+2.9% on a reported basis). Home furnishings and household appliances accounted for 50% of direct sales, while hi-tech items (AV and smartphones) and IT goods represented 35% of direct sales. According to Gfk, Cdiscount's Technical Goods (Hi-tech, PCs and Home Appliances) value market share grew by 1.5 and 2.0 points y-o-y, respectively, in May and June 2017. Gross profit was €123 million with a corresponding margin of 14.0%. The 100 basis point improvement in the 2nd quarter 2017 only partially compensated the 126 basis point decline of the previous quarter. SG&A costs amounted to €(140) million and were 15.9% of net sales (compared to -€125 million, 14.5% of net sales, during the same period of 2016). The cost of the company's launch of its strategic realignment plan and an increase in promotional advertising during the 2nd quarter of 2017 primarily explain the 50% increase in marketing costs and the 28% rise in T&C expenses. Fulfillment costs reflect the investment made in customer relationship management tools and the initial impact of the expansion in warehouse capacity. As a result, operating EBIT totaled €(17) million and includes the impact of a €(8) million increase in IT costs at Cdiscount. 1st half 2016 operating EBIT was €(3) million and benefitted from the reversal of a €5 million provision at the holding level that had been booked in conjunction with former operations in Brazil. The operating loss reported for the 1st half 2017 amounted to €(25) million (compared to an operating loss of -€13 million in 2016).  Net financial expense declined to €(18) million, down from €(19) million during the 1st half of 2016. Net loss from continuing operations amounted to €(43) million with an adjusted EPS of €(0.10). Net loss from discontinued operations amounted to €(4) million, and presented an adjusted EPS of €(0.03).   Cash Management: Free cash flow (last twelve months, or LTM) was €(217) million of which €(212) million from Cdiscount mainly related to the €78 million purchase of Géant and Casino inventories (see below) and the expansion of the product assortment.  Net cash used in continuing operating activities amounted to €(166) million and included a change in operating working capital of €(157) million, of which €(146) million was for inventory expansion. The latter was directly related to the expansion of direct sales product offering and the reinforcement of our multichannel strategy with Groupe Casino regarding high-tech items and household appliances (Cnova purchased €78 million of Géant supercenter and Casino supermarket high-tech items and household appliance inventory).  Capex (purchase of property, equipment and intangible assets, net) was €(51) million, or 2.7% of LTM net sales. Primary projects include the complete overhaul of the mobile site, the investment in our marketplace platform and upgraded logistics systems.  Net financial debt position at June 30, 2017 was €(214) million. 2017 Strategic Realignment Plan Update The strategic realignment plan launched during the 2nd quarter 2017 (SKU expansion, multichannel and delivery enhancements, technological advantages and new marketplace revenue sources) has advanced on several fronts.  SKU expansion:  Cdiscount's product range extension program (designed to almost quadruple the number of CDAV-eligible direct sale references and increase marketplace references by 50%) is ahead of schedule and has already reached the mid-point of its objectives: at June 30, 2017, Cdiscount had doubled the number of SKUs that were available at the beginning of the year.  Cdiscount's associated warehouse capacity expansion program (increase by 80% total distribution center, or DC, floor space between the end of 2016 and the end of the 1st quarter 2018) saw total DC floor space grow 36%, from 295 thousand m² at the end of June 2016 to 400 thousand m² as of July 25, 2017. This included a new 40,000 m2 DC at Saran (near Orléans).  Multichannel and delivery enhancements:  Cnova is now managing Géant supercenters' and Casino supermarkets' (DCF) as well as Cdiscount's home furnishing high-tech and household appliance inventories (DCF transferred its inventories at end June 2017, for a total consideration of about €78 million including VAT). The advantages of this arrangement are twofold:    increased synergies with Groupe Casino in France,   DCF and Cdiscount customers now enjoy a wider variety of delivery options (Cdiscount home delivery, Click-&-Collect pick-up), including online purchase with immediate DCF in-store pickup and the usual in-store purchases.    Minimum basket for free next-day delivery for CDAV members lowered from 25€ to 10€.  Acceleration of product shipment by 1 full day for non-CDAV members.  Cdiscount now offers same-day delivery of a selection of its light product (<30 kg) catalogue to its customers in Paris. The entire light product catalogue is expected to be available for same-day delivery in Paris beginning October 2017. As such, Cdiscount, currently the only player in France offering same-day delivery for 4,000 heavy SKUs (>30 kg), will be the only player in France to offer same-day delivery on its full range of SKUs (0-3 kg, 3-15 kg, 15-30 kg and >30 kg).  Technological advantages:  Revamped app interface, React Native, has resulted in a 30% conversion rate improvement.  Mobile website interface converted to React.JS at the end of June.  Progressive Web App will enable broader usage of App features and adaptive interface website (for smartphone, tablet, desktop) with faster download speed.  Chatbots will manage the full spectrum of the before-and-after-purchase customer relationship on instant messaging (Facebook Messenger, Twitter).  New marketplace revenue sources:  Fulfillment-by-Cdiscount (FBC) and premium pack (higher visibility and statistics report) for marketplace sellers has been rolled out.   Currently generating new marketplace vendor advertising revenues.  Launch new foreign exchange and merchant financing vendor services.  Please refer to the investor presentation at cnova.com for additional details about the strategic realignment plan.  Outlook Cdiscount's current strategic realignment plan is expected to yield the following results by the end of the 1st quarter of 2018:  Nearly quadruple the size of the direct sales product catalogue (equivalent to an approximate €130 million increase in inventory value by YE 2017),  Increase the marketplace product catalogue by 50%,  Expand by 80% total distribution center floor space to 580 thousand m²,  Improve overall customer satisfaction both before and after purchase,  Extend same-day delivery in Paris from heavy products so that it is also available for light products for customers.   Significant increase in B2B revenues, particularly arising from our marketplace ecosystem.  *** Cnova will publish on its website today its 2017 semi-annual report. *** About Cnova N.V.

 CNOVA N.V.  Second Quarter 2017 Activity Amsterdam - July 11, 2017, 07:45 CEST - Cnova N.V. (Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) ("Cnova" or the "Company") today announced unaudited 2nd quarter 2017 operating data as well as details of its strategic realignment plan.  GMV: €685 million (+11% like-for-like[*])  Mobile share:                  37.2% (+   776 bp)  Marketplace share:         35.0% (+   314 bp)  CDAV share:                   32.0% (+1,547 bp)   Net sales: €410 million (+9% like-for-like*)  Traffic: 208 million visits (+12%)  Mobile share of traffic:     59% (+    767 bp)    Active customers: 8.4 million (+10%)  CDAV subscribers:      +103%    Orders: 5.7 million (+9%)  CDAV share:                    29.6% (+1,415 bp)   Launch of volume-centric strategic realignment  Cdiscount renews market share gains (Gfk)  Emmanuel Grenier, Cnova CEO, commented:  "During the 2nd quarter of 2017, our traffic and GMV grew at a double-digit rates, our customer loyalty program doubled in size and our marketplace accounted for more than one-third of our GMV. It is clear to us that, thanks to our technological expertise, we have one of the best traffic growth dynamics in France, and our mission going forward is to leverage this into higher GMV and net sales growth rates on a sustainable basis. To do this, we have embarked on a new strategic realignment plan designed to one, expand massively our direct sales product range; two, reinforce our multichannel offer; and three, accelerate the introduction of new B2B revenue streams. Cdiscount is entering into a new growth phase which will see, compared to the end of 2016, its direct sales product range nearly quadruple in size, a 50% increase of its marketplace product catalogue and an 80% expansion of its distribution center floor space by the end of the 1st quarter of 2018. The new revenue streams we are introducing or accelerating will include increased marketplace fulfillment, new B2B services for our marketplace vendors such as foreign exchange and merchant financing, new data-based revenues, consumer credit and insurance solutions. And on top of all of this, we are improving customer satisfaction before and after purchase. For example, we are launching a new multichannel strategy that includes a new delivery option, and we are making more progress in terms of light product delivery speed. We have completely revamped our mobile site/application and customer area to make it more reactive and to make ordering products easier and faster.  The implementation of these growth initiatives, which temporarily weigh on margins and free cash flow this year, will allow Cdiscount to reinforce its top player status while strengthening its underlying profitability profile on a sustainable basis. These strategic moves are already stimulating top-line growth. They also allow us to enter into new markets where we are making market share advances." 2nd Quarter 2017 Highlights GMV (gross merchandise volume) totaled €685 million, an increase of 11.5% compared to the same period in 2016 on a like-for-like (l-f-l) basis. On a reported basis, GMV rose 7.4% compared to 2016. The mobile share of GMV was 37.2% representing a growth of 776 basis points. The marketplace share of total GMV continue to expand, reaching 35.0% for an increase of +314 basis points. The number of products available increased by 28%. The share of marketplace GMV fulfilled by Cdiscount rose from 5% at the end of June 2016 to 13% one year later while the number of vendors using Cdiscount's fulfillment services doubled y-o-y. The quality of our marketplace vendors showed continuous improvement with customer satisfaction, up by 14 points on average since the beginning of 2017 compared to last year.     Net sales totaled €410 million in the 2nd quarter 2017, up 8.6% on a l-f-l basis compared to the same period in 2016 (+4.5% on a reported basis). Home furnishings and household appliances accounted for 50% of direct sales, while hi-tech items (AV and smartphones) and IT goods represented 34% of direct sales.  According to Gfk (May 2017), Cdiscount's Technical Goods (Hi-tech, Computers and Home Appliances) value and volume market share grew y-o-y by +151 and +229 basis points, respectively. Traffic at Cdiscount.com during the 2nd quarter of 2017 grew by 11.6% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 208 million visits. Traffic has grown on average by double-digits on a y-o-y basis every quarter since the beginning of 2016. According to Médiamétrie, Cdiscount posted the highest progression among the five main e-retailers in France during the first five months of 2017 in terms of the number of desktop unique monthly visitors.  The mobile share of traffic increased +767 basis points to 59.5% during the same period and has been growing by an average of 600 basis points per quarter since the beginning of 2016.   Traffic  1Q16  2Q16  3Q16  4Q16  1Q17  2Q17  Growth (y-o-y)  +12.1%  +10.7%  +6.5%  +13.2%  +11.4%  +11.6%  Mobile Share  50.6%  51.8%  54.2%  55.1%  56.9%  59.5%  The number of active customers also continued to rise, reaching 8.4 million at June 30, 2017 (a y-o-y increase of 9.5%).   Membership of Cdiscount à volonté (CDAV), Cdiscount's customer loyalty program doubled y-o-y. Orders totaled 5.7 million during the 2nd quarter of 2017, for a y-o-y increase of 8.9%. CDAV customers accounted for 29.6% of the 2nd quarter 2017 orders compared to 15.4% during the same period in 2016. The number of items sold increased to 11.1 million from 10.4 million during the same period in 2016 (up 6.4%).  2017 Strategic Realignment Plan The Group is embarking on a wide ranging growth plan in order to return to a sustainable double-digit GMV growth rate while strengthening sources of profitability. Strategic initiatives launched during the 2nd quarter 2017 were primarily of three types: product catalogue expansion, multichannel offer reinforcement and the launch of new revenue streams.  Product catalogue expansion:  Cdiscount is currently in the middle of a massive product range extension program designed to almost quadruple the number of CDAV-eligible direct sale references and increase marketplace references by one-half. In addition to reinforcing its market leading position in the Home product category, Cdiscount is boosting its diversity and availability of items in Leisure, Family markets (Sport, Games, Baby.), Technical Goods (notably accessories) and plans to launch a Fashion segment by the end of 2017. Cdiscount also strives to anticipate demands on innovative and "trendy" products (connected objects, hand spinners, fidget cube, etc.). At June 30, 2017, Cdiscount had already doubled the number of SKUs that were available at the beginning of the year. Newly available SKUs represented close to 7% of total volumes sold and 5% of total net sales in the second half of June 2017.  In order to accommodate the increasing size of the product range, Cdiscount has initiated a warehouse capacity expansion program that should increase by close to 80% total distribution center (DC) floor space between the end of 2016 and the end of the 1st quarter 2018. At the end of June 2017, total floor space had grown to 380 thousand m² (up from 295 thousand m², or +28%, compared to the end of June 2016), including a 30,000 m² extension of the Orléans DC. By the end of March 2018, Cdiscount plans to have over 10 major and several smaller DCs throughout France with a total floor space trending toward 600 thousand m². This will include a newly built 60,000 m² DC in the southern part of Paris opening in July 2017.  Multichannel offer reinforcement:  In conjunction with the expansion of Cnova's product catalogue as well as to achieve more synergies with Groupe Casino in France (Casino), Cnova is implementing with Casino a reinforced multichannel strategy which allows Géant hypermarkets and Casino supermarkets (DCF) as well as Cdiscount to carry the same home furnishing high-tech and household appliance items, offer a wider variety of delivery options to DCF and Cdiscount customers (Cdiscount home delivery, Click-&-Collect pick-up, online purchase with immediate DCF in-store pickup and the usual in-store purchases) and achieve operational cost savings. It also addresses the increasing trend whereby consumers are buying more of these product categories online while preserving the inclination of many customers to discover and inspect products in-store. As a consequence, Cnova is now managing both DCF's and Cdiscount's home furnishing and household appliance inventory (Cnova bought Casino hypermarkets and supermarkets existing inventories on June 18, 2017, for a total consideration of about €78 million including VAT).  Launch of new revenue streams:  Roll-out of Fulfilment-by-Cdiscount (FBC) and premium pack (higher visibility and statistics report) for marketplace sellers.   Monetizing the flow of vendors on our marketplace interface with new advertising revenues.  Launch of new services for vendors, including foreign exchange and merchant financing.  Plan to offer a wider range of insurance options, initially to include school, pet and credit card services with an extension to home and loan insurance.   Technology and Logistics  Cdiscount continues to maintain its technological and logistics edges in the French market:  According to Yooda, Cdiscount posted the strongest SEO progression in the French e-commerce sector in 2017 thus far.  Cdiscount is optimizing the performance of its platforms through the implementation of React Native, the deployment of Progressive Web App (PWA) and the testing of Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP).   Cdiscount's mobile site has been completely revamped such that there is a higher visibility of promotions, optimized ergonomics and new functionalities. As a result, the mobile share of total GMV reached its highest level ever in June 2017 (39%) and the page load speed should continue to improve throughout the 3rd quarter 2017.   The reinforced multichannel offer dovetails nicely with Cdiscount's Click-and-Collect pick-up point network (C-&-C), many of which are part of Casino's bricks and mortar footprint in France. During the 2nd quarter 2017, more than half (53%) of our orders were delivered through our C-&-C network.  Cdiscount began in July 2017 to offer same-day delivery of a selection of its light product (<30 kg) catalogue to its customers in Paris. The entire light product catalogue will be available for Paris same-day delivery beginning October 2017.  Planning for delivery by drone, first tested in December 2016, is moving forward in conjunction with Thales.  Warehouse modernization proceeds apace with the planned installation of additional 3D automated packaging machines.   Second Quarter Activity  Cnova N.V.

These are reported as discontinued activities in accordance with IFRS 5 as of January 1, 2016. 1st Half 2017 Activity HighlightsTraffic at Cdiscount.com during the 1st half of 2017 grew by 11.5% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 442 million visits. Cdiscount posted the highest progression during the first five months of 2017 among the five main e-retailers in France, in the number of desktop unique monthly visitors, according to Médiamétrie.The mobile share of traffic increased 696 basis points to 58.1% during the same period. Mobile conversion increased by 15 basis points on a yearly basis.The number of active customers also continued to climb, reaching 8.4 million at 30 June 2017 (a y-o-y increase of 9.5%). Membership of Cdiscount à volonté (CDAV), Cdiscount`s customer loyalty program doubled y-o-y at the end of June.Orders totaled 12.2 million during the 1st half of 2017, for a y-o-y increase of 11.4%. CDAV customers accounted for 29% of the 1st half 2017 orders compared to 12% during the same period in 2016.The number of items sold increased to 23.6 million from 21.6 million during the same period in 2016 (up 9.2%).GMV (gross merchandise volume) totaled €1,456 million, an increase of 10.5% compared to the same period in 2016 on a like-for-like (l-f-l) basis (1Q17: +7.7%; 2Q17: +11.5%). On a reported basis, GMV rose 6.2% compared to 2016 (1Q17: +5.2%; 2Q17: +7.4%). The mobile share of GMV was up 874 basis points to 36.7%.The marketplace share of total GMV continued to expand, reaching 33.4% for an increase of 288 basis points. The number of products available increased by 28%. The share of marketplace GMV fulfilled by Cdiscount rose from 5% in June 2016 to 13% in June 2017 while the number of vendors using Cdiscount`s fulfillment services doubled y-o-y as at end of June. The quality of our marketplace vendors showed continuous improvement with customer satisfaction up by 14 points on average since the beginning of the 2017 compared to the same period in 2016.1st Half 2017 Financial PerformanceNet sales totaled €882 million in the 1st half 2017, up 7.6% on a l-f-l basis compared to the same period in 2016 (+2.9% on a reported basis). Home furnishings and household appliances accounted for 50% of direct sales, while hi-tech items (AV and smartphones) and IT goods represented 35% of direct sales.According to Gfk, Cdiscount`s Technical Goods (Hi-tech, PCs and Home Appliances) value market share grew by 1.5 and 2.0 points y-o-y, respectively, in May and June 2017.Gross profit was €123 million with a corresponding margin of 14.0%. The 100 basis point improvement in the 2nd quarter 2017 only partially compensated the 126 basis point decline of the previous quarter.SG&A costs amounted to €(140) million and were 15.9% of net sales (compared to -€125 million, 14.5% of net sales, during the same period of 2016). The cost of the company`s launch of its strategic realignment plan and an increase in promotional advertising during the 2nd quarter of 2017 primarily explain the 50% increase in marketing costs and the 28% rise in T&C expenses. Fulfillment costs reflect the investment made in customer relationship management tools and the initial impact of the expansion in warehouse capacity.As a result, operating EBIT totaled €(17) million and includes the impact of a €(8) million increase in IT costs at Cdiscount. 1st half 2016 operating EBIT was €(3) million and benefitted from the reversal of a €5 million provision at the holding level that had been booked in conjunction with former operations in Brazil.The operating loss reported for the 1st half 2017 amounted to €(25) million (compared to an operating loss of -€13 million in 2016).Net financial expense declined to €(18) million, down from €(19) million during the 1st half of 2016.Net loss from continuing operations amounted to €(43) million with an adjusted EPS of €(0.10).Net loss from discontinued operations amounted to €(4) million, and presented an adjusted EPS of €(0.03). Cash Management:Free cash flow (last twelve months, or LTM) was €(217) million of which €(212) million from Cdiscount mainly related to the €78 million purchase of Géant and Casino inventories (see below) and the expansion of the product assortment. Net cash used in continuing operating activities amounted to €(166) million and included a change in operating working capital of €(157) million, of which €(146) million was for inventory expansion. The latter was directly related to the expansion of direct sales product offering and the reinforcement of our multichannel strategy with Groupe Casino regarding high-tech items and household appliances (Cnova purchased €78 million of Géant supercenter and Casino supermarket high-tech items and household appliance inventory).  Capex (purchase of property, equipment and intangible assets, net) was €(51) million, or 2.7% of LTM net sales. Primary projects include the complete overhaul of the mobile site, the investment in our marketplace platform and upgraded logistics systems. Net financial debt position at June 30, 2017 was €(214) million.2017 Strategic Realignment Plan UpdateThe strategic realignment plan launched during the 2nd quarter 2017 (SKU expansion, multichannel and delivery enhancements, technological advantages and new marketplace revenue sources) has advanced on several fronts.SKU expansion: Cdiscount`s product range extension program (designed to almost quadruple the number of CDAV-eligible direct sale references and increase marketplace references by 50%) is ahead of schedule and has already reached the mid-point of its objectives: at June 30, 2017, Cdiscount had doubled the number of SKUs that were available at the beginning of the year.  Cdiscount`s associated warehouse capacity expansion program (increase by 80% total distribution center, or DC, floor space between the end of 2016 and the end of the 1st quarter 2018) saw total DC floor space grow 36%, from 295 thousand m² at the end of June 2016 to 400 thousand m² as of July 25, 2017. This included a new 40,000 m2 DC at Saran (near Orléans). Multichannel and delivery enhancements: Cnova is now managing Géant supercenters` and Casino supermarkets` (DCF) as well as Cdiscount`s home furnishing high-tech and household appliance inventories (DCF transferred its inventories at end June 2017, for a total consideration of about €78 million including VAT). The advantages of this arrangement are twofold:   increased synergies with Groupe Casino in France,   DCF and Cdiscount customers now enjoy a wider variety of delivery options (Cdiscount home delivery, Click-&-Collect pick-up), including online purchase with immediate DCF in-store pickup and the usual in-store purchases.    Minimum basket for free next-day delivery for CDAV members lowered from 25€ to 10€.  Acceleration of product shipment by 1 full day for non-CDAV members.  Cdiscount now offers same-day delivery of a selection of its light product (<30 kg) catalogue to its customers in Paris. The entire light product catalogue is expected to be available for same-day delivery in Paris beginning October 2017. As such, Cdiscount, currently the only player in France offering same-day delivery for 4,000 heavy SKUs (>30 kg), will be the only player in France to offer same-day delivery on its full range of SKUs (0-3 kg, 3-15 kg, 15-30 kg and >30 kg). Technological advantages: Revamped app interface, React Native, has resulted in a 30% conversion rate improvement.  Mobile website interface converted to React.JS at the end of June.  Progressive Web App will enable broader usage of App features and adaptive interface website (for smartphone, tablet, desktop) with faster download speed.  Chatbots will manage the full spectrum of the before-and-after-purchase customer relationship on instant messaging (Facebook Messenger, Twitter). New marketplace revenue sources: Fulfillment-by-Cdiscount (FBC) and premium pack (higher visibility and statistics report) for marketplace sellers has been rolled out.  Currently generating new marketplace vendor advertising revenues.  Launch new foreign exchange and merchant financing vendor services. Please refer to the investor presentation at cnova.com for additional details about the strategic realignment plan.OutlookCdiscount`s current strategic realignment plan is expected to yield the following results by the end of the 1st quarter of 2018: Nearly quadruple the size of the direct sales product catalogue (equivalent to an approximate €130 million increase in inventory value by YE 2017),  Increase the marketplace product catalogue by 50%,  Expand by 80% total distribution center floor space to 580 thousand m²,  Improve overall customer satisfaction both before and after purchase,  Extend same-day delivery in Paris from heavy products so that it is also available for light products for customers.  Significant increase in B2B revenues, particularly arising from our marketplace ecosystem. ***Cnova will publish on its website today its 2017 semi-annual report.***About Cnova N.V.Cnova N.V., one of the leading e-Commerce companies in France, serves 8.4 million active customers via its state-of-the-art website, Cdiscount.
