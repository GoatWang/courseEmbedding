Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking 
      Statements


      This press release may include forward-looking statements, both with 
      respect to us and our industry, that reflect our current views with 
      respect to future events and financial performance. Statements that 
      include the words “expect,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “project,” 
      “anticipate,” “will,” “may,” “could” and similar statements of a future 
      or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements. All 
      forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and 
      uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that 
      could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in 
      such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on 
      any such statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not 
      limited to, the following: 1) unpredictability and severity of 
      catastrophic events; 2) rating agency actions; 3) adequacy of Validus’ 
      risk management and loss limitation methods; 4) cyclicality of demand 
      and pricing in the insurance and reinsurance markets; 5) statutory or 
      regulatory developments including tax policy, reinsurance and other 
      regulatory matters; 6) Validus’ ability to implement its business 
      strategy during “soft” as well as “hard” markets; 7) adequacy of 
      Validus’ loss reserves; 8) continued availability of capital and 
      financing; 9) retention of key personnel; 10) competition; 11) potential 
      loss of business from one or more major insurance or reinsurance 
      brokers; 12) Validus’ ability to implement, successfully and on a timely 
      basis, complex infrastructure, distribution capabilities, systems, 
      procedures and internal controls, and to develop accurate actuarial data 
      to support the business and regulatory and reporting requirements; 13) 
      general economic and market conditions (including inflation, volatility 
      in the credit and capital markets, interest rates and foreign currency 
      exchange rates); 14) the integration of businesses Validus may acquire 
      or new business ventures Validus may start; 15) the effect on Validus’ 
      investment portfolios of changing financial market conditions including 
      inflation, interest rates, liquidity and other factors; 16) acts of 
      terrorism or outbreak of war; and 17) availability of reinsurance and 
      retrocessional coverage, as well as management’s response to any of the 
      aforementioned factors.
    

      The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as 
      exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary 
      statements that are included herein and elsewhere, including the risk 
      factors included in Validus’ most recent reports on Form 10-K and Form 
      10-Q and other documents on file with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission. Any forward-looking statements made in this press release 
      are qualified by these cautionary statements, and there can be no 
      assurance that the actual results or developments anticipated by Validus 
      will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that they will have 
      the expected consequences to, or effects on, Validus or its business or 
      operations. Validus undertakes no obligation to update publicly or 
      revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new 
      information, future developments or otherwise.
