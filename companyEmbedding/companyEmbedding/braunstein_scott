Pacira Pharmaceuticals Appoints Scott Braunstein, MD, to Oversee Strategy and Corporate Development | Business Wire
























































Pacira Pharmaceuticals Appoints Scott Braunstein, MD, to Oversee 
      Strategy and Corporate Development






July 14, 2015 07:30 AM Eastern Daylight Time



PARSIPPANY, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pacira 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: PCRX) today announced the appointment 
      of Scott Braunstein, MD, to the newly created position of senior vice 
      president, strategy and corporate development. Dr. Braunstein brings 
      over 20 years of knowledge and experience from his time both as a 
      practicing physician and investor, as well as expertise from numerous 
      commercial, consulting and operational roles advising on strategy and 
      organizational objectives for biotechnology and pharmaceutical 
      companies. He will be responsible for evaluating, integrating and 
      optimizing the company’s strategic opportunities for the lead commercial 
      product EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension); the 
      company’s hospital-based sales franchise; the DepoFoam®-based internal 
      pipeline product candidates; and external in-licensing and acquisition 
      product candidates.
    


      “We believe Scott will be a valuable addition to the management team as 
      Pacira continues to grow and mature,” said Dave Stack, president, chief 
      executive officer and chairman of Pacira. “Scott brings a distinguished 
      track record of success and a background uniquely tailored to guide, 
      innovate and follow-through on strategies maximizing both the internal 
      and external opportunities that best complement our sales organization 
      and Company goals.”
    

      “It’s an exciting time to join Pacira,” said Dr. Braunstein. “Pacira is 
      doing important work in the hospital space with EXPAREL to proactively 
      curb the opioid abuse epidemic where it begins, and its other ongoing 
      and future initiatives have the potential to not only improve patient 
      care and support our customers in a dynamic hospital environment, but 
      also create long-term value for shareholders.”
    

      Dr. Braunstein spent 12 years as a healthcare analyst and portfolio 
      manager at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, where he invested in and 
      conducted diligence on a wide variety of pharmaceutical products and 
      product candidates, pharmaceutical company strategies, business models 
      and management teams, providing stock recommendations for the entire 
      J.P. Morgan Asset Equity Group. He also served in a similar role at 
      Everpoint Asset Management immediately prior to joining Pacira. Earlier 
      in his career, Dr. Braunstein was an active lecturer and consultant for 
      several global pharmaceutical companies and provided academic 
      instruction as assistant clinical professor for Columbia University and 
      the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He currently serves on the 
      Board of Esperion Therapeutics, Inc., STAT Medical and the Cornell 
      Alumni Association for the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Dr. 
      Braunstein earned his medical degree from the Albert Einstein College of 
      Medicine, completed his internal medical residency at Cornell 
      University-New York Hospital and conducted additional research in 
      immunology and wound healing from 1993 to 1994 at Rockefeller University.
    

About Pacira


      Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: PCRX) is a specialty 
      pharmaceutical company focused on the clinical and commercial 
      development of new products that meet the needs of acute care 
      practitioners and their patients. The company’s flagship product, 
      EXPAREL® (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension), indicated for 
      single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical 
      analgesia, was commercially launched in the United States in April 2012. 
      EXPAREL and two other products have successfully utilized DepoFoam®, a 
      unique and proprietary product delivery technology that encapsulates 
      drugs without altering their molecular structure, and releases them over 
      a desired period of time. Additional information about Pacira is 
      available at www.pacira.com.
    

About EXPAREL®


      EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is currently 
      indicated for single-dose infiltration into the surgical site to produce 
      postsurgical analgesia. The product combines bupivacaine with DepoFoam®, 
      a proven product delivery technology that delivers medication over a 
      desired time period. EXPAREL represents the first and only 
      multivesicular liposome local anesthetic that can be utilized in the 
      peri- or postsurgical setting. By utilizing the DepoFoam platform, a 
      single dose of EXPAREL delivers bupivacaine over time, providing 
      significant reductions in cumulative pain score with up to a 45 percent 
      decrease in opioid consumption; the clinical benefit of the opioid 
      reduction was not demonstrated. Additional information is available at www.EXPAREL.com.

      New Drug Application; the adverse effects and impacts of FDA warning 
      letters; the outcome of the U.S. Department of Justice inquiry; our

      dedicated EXPAREL manufacturing suites; and other factors discussed in

      fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
