Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines? - Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines?Jul.21.17 | About: Nuveen AMT-Free (NEA) Maks Financial Services Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMaks Financial ServicesSummaryA general update of Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Muni Income Fund since our initial article.Detailed discussion of portfolio changes over the last 11 months.Detailed look of the various performance metrics, including price, total return and net asset value returns.Over the last few articles we have looked at and updated a number of closed end fixed income funds articles. One of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (MUI) is the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA). Unlike MUI and the other CEFs which we recently looked at and updated, I have not done an in-depth initial look at NEA. I have however talked about it at some length in my article "Ho Ho Ho Mary Brexit, CEFs on Sale." In this article, I wanted to do both an update since June 2016 and a more in-depth look on this fund. What's New? Over the last 12 months the Federal Reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along. In the search for yield, many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums. The one area of Closed End Fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds. While some funds have managed to hang on, others have been greatly impacted. Where has the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Income Fund ended up? Did "quality" help? Or merely preaching to the choir? Let's take a look. Fund Updates At the time of our initial article (6/27/2016), NEA yielded an income only distribution of 5.07% and was trading at a discount of 7.62% to its Net Asset Value. Today NEA yields 5.39% and is trading at a discount of 8.17%. 

 Source: CEF Connect Looking at the asset allocation that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested, with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents.
 

Source: CEF Connect Looking at the Top 10 we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website As more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states' credits, we can see that IL represents 13.2% of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Fortunately, we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about 26% of the portfolio is general obligation funds, and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the US Government. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund, we can see that more than 50% of the fund's bond mature more than 20 years from today. There is about 13% of the fund that matures in 4 years or less.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website The other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio. Even though more than 50% of the portfolio is 20 years out, more than 36% of the portfolio's bonds may be called in the next 5 years or sooner. While not likely, if interest rates fall, municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than 69% of the portfolio is rated A or better. Only 1.9% of the portfolio is unrated. Even still, unrated does not mean poor credit, merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over 1,000 holdings and true to the name, none of the holdings are subject to AMT tax. (high income earners will appreciate this). Further as per Nuveen data, we can see the average maturity is at 20.11 years. More important to note I believe is the average effective duration of 8.17 years. Applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of 12.47 years. What this means is that if we have another 1% rise in interest rates, the underlying portfolio's NAV should decline about 8.17%, or 12.47% adjusted for the portfolio's leverage.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Performance Update Since our last article on June 27th, 2016, the fund's share price has fallen 6.87%, right in line with the duration numbers. The total return however is only a loss of 1.17%, once you account for the distribution. The interesting note here is the underlying NAV is only down 6.71%. 

NEA data by YCharts Next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income ETFs and some muni closed end funds. Below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments. First is the iShares National Muni ETF (MUB). We further include the iShares Core US Agg Bond Index ETF (AGG). To look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the VanEck Vectors CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT) and two of the larger muni funds, the Blackrock Municipal Quality CEF (MYI) and the Eaton Vance Municipal Bond CEF (EIM). 

NEA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can clearly see, the two broad unlevered ETFs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down .26% and .50%. The Nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the "quality" name and ended the examined time period down 1.17%. This is compared to a loss of 1.87% for the VanEck Muni CEF ETF, a loss of 2.37% for the Blackrock fund and an outsized 4.16% loss for the Eaton Vance Muni Bond CEF.
 Bottom Line Overall, even though municipal closed end funds were hurt, NEA has held up quite well. More importantly looking ahead, I would be comfortable holding this fund, particularly against funds such as the Blackrock Municipal Bond CEF (MUI) which we discussed in our last article as NEA has far less General Obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as IL and NJ. Going forward, NEA is going to be on my short list for CEF investments to replace other funds that are sold due to today's lack of discounts or those trading at premiums. I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. For more information on the fund, please take a look at my previous article, "Ho Ho Ho, Merry Brexit, CEFs On Sale." If you are interested in municipal bonds, please take a look at my last article, "MUI: Investment Opportunity For Investors On The Sidelines?"

Glossary




Objective
The fund's investment objectives are to provide current income exempt from regular federal income tax and the alternative minimum tax applicable to individuals and to enhance portfolio value relative to the municipal bond market by investing in tax-exempt municipal bonds that the fund's investment adviser believes are underrated or undervalued or that represent municipal market sectors that are undervalued.


Highlights
Seeks to provide:
Attractive monthly    tax-free income
Portfolio diversification
Attractive after tax total returns




Investment Strategy
The fund invests in municipal securities that are exempt from federal income taxes.  The Fund uses leverage.  By investment policy, the Fund may invest up to 35% of its managed assets in municipal securities rated at the time of investment BBB and below or judged by the manager to be of comparable quality.

Original Investment & Cumulative Distributions is the original investment value added to the cash flow received from distributions. The total returns are not adjusted to reflect the effects of taxation and assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains.
		

			Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

RISKSInvestment, Market, and Price Risk: Closed-end fund shares are subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.  Common shares frequently trade at a discount to their NAV.  At any point in time, your common shares may be worth less than you paid, even after considering the reinvestment of fund distributions.Interest Rate Risk: Fixed-income securities such as bonds, preferred, convertible and other debt securities will decline in value if market interest rates rise.Credit Risk: Debt or preferred securities held by the fund may fail to make dividend or interest payments when due.  Investments in securities below investment grade credit quality are predominantly speculative and subject to greater volatility and risk of default.  Unrated securities are evaluated by fund managers using industry data and their own analysis processes that may be similar to that of a nationally recognized rating agency; however, such internal ratings are not equivalent to a national agency credit rating. Counterparty credit risk may arise if counterparties fail to meet their obligations, should the fund hold any derivative instruments for either investment exposure or hedging purposes.Leverage Risk: The fund’s use of leverage may cause higher volatility for the fund’s per share NAV, market price, and distributions.  Leverage typically magnifies the total return of the fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative. Leverage is intended to increase common share net income, but there is no assurance that the fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.  Different forms of leverage, including swaps, may introduce additional credit or interest rate risk. Leverage may also increase a fund’s liquidity risk, as the fund may need to sell securities at inopportune times to stay within fund or regulatory limits.Inverse Floater Risk: The fund invests in inverse floaters. Due to their leveraged nature, these derivative investments can greatly increase a fund’s exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk, including counter-party credit risk. In addition, investments in inverse floaters involve the risk that the fund could lose more than its original principal investment.Tax Risk: The tax treatment of fund distributions may be affected by future changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretation by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities.Call Risk or Prepayment Risk: Issuers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled, forcing the fund to reinvest in lower-yielding securities.Low-Quality Bond Risk: The fund concentrates a large portion of its investments in low-quality bonds (sometimes called “junk bonds”), which have greater credit risk and generally are less liquid and have more volatile prices than higher quality securities.Hedging Risk: The fund may use derivative instruments for hedging purposes, but there is no assurance that the fund’s hedging strategy will be successful.  Derivatives may involve a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that the loss on a derivative may be greater than the principal amount invested.Municipal Bond Market Liquidity Risk: Inventories of municipal bonds held by brokers and dealers have decreased in recent years, either due to broker-dealer choices or to federal banking regulations, reducing their ability to make a market in these securities. This may decrease the fund’s ability to buy or sell bonds, and may increase bond price volatility and trading costs, particularly during periods of economic or market stress. As a result, the fund may be forced to sell a security at a lower price than desired, to sell other securities to raise cash, or to give up an investment opportunity, any of which could have a negative effect on performance. Large block sales could further reduce bond prices and hurt fund performance.
NOTES


					** The premium/discount is calculated as (most recent price/most recent NAV) -1.






				Income may be subject to state and local income taxes. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

†† INCOME ONLY DISTRIBUTIONS

				Distributions are sourced entirely from net investment income, unless noted otherwise.
				
						
							Distribution rates represent the latest declared regular distribution, annualized, relative to the most recent market price and NAV. Special distributions, including special capital gains distributions, are not included in the calculation.
						
					
			
1 Taxable Equivalent Yield

				Taxable equivalent yield is the yield or distribution rate needed from a taxable investment to be economically equal to receiving the stated tax-free yield from a municipal bond investment. Please note that the income levels shown in the calculator do not reflect (i) any federal or state limitations on the amounts of allowable itemized deductions, phaseouts of personal or dependent exemption credits or other allowable credits, (ii) any local taxes imposed, or (iii) any alternative minimum taxes or any taxes other than personal income taxes. The user is responsible for selecting the applicable federal and, as applicable, state tax rates. The stated federal tax rates for joint incomes over $250,000 include the 3.8% medicare tax imposed on the net investment income of certain taxpayers with higher incomes. This calculator is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to represent actual performance, or to predict future performance, of any Nuveen Investments product. Certain taxpayers may find their effective marginal tax rates to be greater than those shown in the calculator. In that case, the taxable equivalent yield may be even higher.
			

				Income may be subject to state and local taxes, as well as the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no assurance that tax rates will remain unchanged; the rates used are believed to be correct for tax year 2016.

Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines? - Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NYSE:NEA) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Nuveen Quality Muni Inc. Fund: Quality Still Shines?Jul.21.17 | About: Nuveen AMT-Free (NEA) Maks Financial Services Registered investment advisor, portfolio strategy, REITs, mutual fundsMaks Financial ServicesSummaryA general update of Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Muni Income Fund since our initial article.Detailed discussion of portfolio changes over the last 11 months.Detailed look of the various performance metrics, including price, total return and net asset value returns.Over the last few articles we have looked at and updated a number of closed end fixed income funds articles. One of the funds that we mentioned as a comparison for the Blackrock Municipal Income Fund (MUI) is the Nuveen AMT-Free Quality Municipal Income Fund (NEA). Unlike MUI and the other CEFs which we recently looked at and updated, I have not done an in-depth initial look at NEA. I have however talked about it at some length in my article "Ho Ho Ho Mary Brexit, CEFs on Sale." In this article, I wanted to do both an update since June 2016 and a more in-depth look on this fund. What's New? Over the last 12 months the Federal Reserve has raised interested rates and the economy has kept on sputtering along. In the search for yield, many closed end funds have had their discounts eliminated or even turned into premiums. The one area of Closed End Fund investing that has not fared well however is municipal bond funds. While some funds have managed to hang on, others have been greatly impacted. Where has the Nuveen AMT Free Quality Income Fund ended up? Did "quality" help? Or merely preaching to the choir? Let's take a look. Fund Updates At the time of our initial article (6/27/2016), NEA yielded an income only distribution of 5.07% and was trading at a discount of 7.62% to its Net Asset Value. Today NEA yields 5.39% and is trading at a discount of 8.17%. 

 Source: CEF Connect Looking at the asset allocation that we can see the majority of the funds are fully invested, with a small percentage in cash and cash equivalents.
 

Source: CEF Connect Looking at the Top 10 we can see a variety of funds representing the country with a large number of bonds seemingly being revenue backed bonds. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website As more and more investors are getting concerned with the underling states' credits, we can see that IL represents 13.2% of the portfolio and should be taken under advisement. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Fortunately, we can look at the top sectors of the fund and see that only about 26% of the portfolio is general obligation funds, and the majority of the bonds are backed by revenues or guaranteed by the US Government. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Taking a deeper look at the maturities in the fund, we can see that more than 50% of the fund's bond mature more than 20 years from today. There is about 13% of the fund that matures in 4 years or less.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website The other aspect we can look at is the call exposure of the underlying portfolio. Even though more than 50% of the portfolio is 20 years out, more than 36% of the portfolio's bonds may be called in the next 5 years or sooner. While not likely, if interest rates fall, municipalities may be in a position to refinance their debts. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the underlying quality we can see that more than 69% of the portfolio is rated A or better. Only 1.9% of the portfolio is unrated. Even still, unrated does not mean poor credit, merely that the bond issue may be too small to rate economically. 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Looking at the portfolio broadly we can see that it is well diversified with over 1,000 holdings and true to the name, none of the holdings are subject to AMT tax. (high income earners will appreciate this). Further as per Nuveen data, we can see the average maturity is at 20.11 years. More important to note I believe is the average effective duration of 8.17 years. Applying and adjusting for leverage we get an average duration of 12.47 years. What this means is that if we have another 1% rise in interest rates, the underlying portfolio's NAV should decline about 8.17%, or 12.47% adjusted for the portfolio's leverage.
 

 Source: Nuveen CEF Website Performance Update Since our last article on June 27th, 2016, the fund's share price has fallen 6.87%, right in line with the duration numbers. The total return however is only a loss of 1.17%, once you account for the distribution. The interesting note here is the underlying NAV is only down 6.71%. 

NEA data by YCharts Next we can take a look at the fund compared to the broader fixed income ETFs and some muni closed end funds. Below is a chart looking at the total returns for the same time frame for a number of such investments. First is the iShares National Muni ETF (MUB). We further include the iShares Core US Agg Bond Index ETF (AGG). To look at the fund in relation to other municipal closed end funds we look at the VanEck Vectors CEF Muni Income ETF (XMPT) and two of the larger muni funds, the Blackrock Municipal Quality CEF (MYI) and the Eaton Vance Municipal Bond CEF (EIM). 

NEA Total Return Price data by YCharts As we can clearly see, the two broad unlevered ETFs have been the least volatile and ending the time period down .26% and .50%. The Nuveen fund does seem to hold up to the "quality" name and ended the examined time period down 1.17%. This is compared to a loss of 1.87% for the VanEck Muni CEF ETF, a loss of 2.37% for the Blackrock fund and an outsized 4.16% loss for the Eaton Vance Muni Bond CEF.
 Bottom Line Overall, even though municipal closed end funds were hurt, NEA has held up quite well. More importantly looking ahead, I would be comfortable holding this fund, particularly against funds such as the Blackrock Municipal Bond CEF (MUI) which we discussed in our last article as NEA has far less General Obligation risk and less exposed to questionable credits such as IL and NJ. Going forward, NEA is going to be on my short list for CEF investments to replace other funds that are sold due to today's lack of discounts or those trading at premiums. I hope this update is helpful. Until the next update, keep doing your due diligence. For more information on the fund, please take a look at my previous article, "Ho Ho Ho, Merry Brexit, CEFs On Sale." If you are interested in municipal bonds, please take a look at my last article, "MUI: Investment Opportunity For Investors On The Sidelines?"

All Fixed Income News












In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.

         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.

         A CD ladder, depending on the types and amount of securities within it, may not ensure adequate diversification of your investment portfolio. While diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss, a lack of diversification may result in heightened volatility of your portfolio value. You must perform your own evaluation as to whether a CD ladder and the securities held within it are consistent with your investment objectives, risk tolerance, and financial circumstances. To learn more about diversification and its effects on your portfolio, contact a representative.
	
      



         The CD ladder strategies displayed are provided for educational purposes and are not intended to serve as the primary basis for your investment, financial or tax planning decisions.
	
      



         Displayed rates of return, including Annual Percentage Yield (APY), represent stated APY for either individual Certificates of Deposit (CDs), or multiple CDs within model CD ladders, were identified from Fidelity inventory as of the time stated. For current inventory, including available CDs, please view the CDs & Ladders tab.
	
      



         The CDs in the CD Search Results screen are displayed on the basis of them offering the highest yields available given certain selected criteria. The criteria entered are at the sole discretion of the user, including the maturities of the strategy selected and yield-based inventory filtering, and any information obtained should not be considered an offer to buy or sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any securities.
	
      



         You acknowledge that your requests for information are unsolicited and shall neither constitute, nor be considered as investment advice by Fidelity Brokerage Services, LLC, Fidelity Distributors Corporation, or their affiliates (collectively, "Fidelity").
	
      



         Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are debt instruments offered by commercial banks, thrifts and brokerages to raise funds for their business activities. Minimum investment amount is typically one CD or multiple CDs for a ladder strategy. All brokered CDs displayed are FDIC-insured as indicated by the Attribute: FDIC. The FDIC insurance covers up to $250,000 per institution per category of account, or up to $250,000 in qualifying retirement accounts. Note that FDIC insurance only covers the principal amount of the CD and any accrued interest. In some instances, CD's may be purchased on the secondary market at a price which reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance.

         1. The secondary market may be limited. The pre-maturity sale price of CDs may be less than its original purchase price, particularly if interest rates are higher at the time of sale. There may be certain features or provisions of the CD that may also influence its market price. If you want to buy or sell a CD, Fidelity Brokered Services LLC ("FBS") may charge you a fee. This concession will be applied to your order, and you will be provided the opportunity to review it prior to submission for execution. CDs are made available through our affiliate National Financial Services LLC ("NFS") and from various third-party providers, including participants on the BondDesk platform, with FBS normally acting as riskless principal or agent. These offering brokers, including NFS, may separately mark up or mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.
	
      



         2. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Your ability to sell a CD on the secondary market is subject to market conditions. If your CD has a step rate, the interest rate of your CD may be higher or lower than prevailing market rates. The initial rate on a step rate CD is not the yield to maturity. If your CD has a call provision, which many step rate CDs do, please be aware the decision to call the CD is at the issuer’s sole discretion. Also, if the issuer calls the CD, you may be confronted with a less favorable interest rate at which to reinvest your funds. Fidelity makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution.
	
      



         3. For the purposes of FDIC insurance coverage limits, all depository assets of the account holder at the institution that issued the CD will generally be counted toward the aggregate limit (usually $250,000) for each applicable category of account. FDIC insurance does not cover market losses. All of the new issue brokered CDs Fidelity offers are FDIC insured. In some cases, CDs may be purchased on the secondary market at a price that reflects a premium to their principal value. This premium is ineligible for FDIC insurance. For details on FDIC insurance limits, see www.fdic.gov.
	
      



         4. Fidelity makes new issue CDs available without a separate transaction fee. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC and National Financial Services LLC receive compensation for participating in the offering as a selling group member or underwriter.
	
      



         5. Other concessions apply if traded with a Fidelity representative. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.

         The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Please see the ratings tab for more information about methodology. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of the funds in an investment category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)

         ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
      



Before investing in any exchange traded product, you should consider its investment objective, risks, charges and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus, offering circular or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Minimum concessions of $19.95 if traded with a Fidelity representative. For U.S Treasury purchases traded with a Fidelity representative, a flat charge of $19.95 per trade applies. A $250 maximum applies to all trades and is reduced to a $50 maximum for bonds maturing in one year or less. Fixed income trading requires a Fidelity brokerage account with a minimum opening balance of $2,500. Rates are for U.S. Dollar denominated bonds, additional fees and minimums apply for non-Dollar bond trades. Other conditions may apply. See Fidelity.com/commissions for details.. Please note that concessions may impact the total cost of the transaction and the total, or "effective," yield of your investment. The offering broker, which may be our affiliate National Financial Services LLC, may separately mark up on mark down the price of the security and may realize a trading profit or loss on the transaction.




         Outside normal market hours our complete inventory is not reflected and trade requests may not be fulfilled.
	
      



         The yield table and associated search results categorize bonds by Moody's and/or Standard & Poor's (S&P) rating. Bonds which are not rated by one or both of Moody's and S&P will be excluded.
	
      



         * Taxable Municipal ratings cover a rating range from Aaa to A3 from Moody's or AAA to A- from S&P.
	
      



         (--) Not available
	
      



         For purposes of determining a municipal bond’s rating, the yield table uses the greater of the third party guarantor's or insurer's financial strength rating and underlying rating, where applicable. Consider the financial strength ratings of the third party guarantor or insurer as well as any published underlying rating of the issuer for a more complete assessment of the bond's credit risk profile.
	
      



         The bond yields displayed represent Yield to Worst and are subject to change and availability.
	
      



         Ratings are opinions and not recommendations to purchase, hold or sell securities, and they do not address the market value of securities or their suitability for investment purposes. Ratings should not be relied on as investment advice. Please read important disclaimer information.
	
      



Content and data provided by various third parties and Fidelity - Terms of Use




         In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.
	
      



         Lower-quality debt securities generally offer higher yields, but also involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to loss.
	
      



Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
