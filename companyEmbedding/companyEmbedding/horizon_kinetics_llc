About Us

Horizon Kinetics LLC, founded in 1994, is an independently owned and operated investment adviser. We adhere to a long-term, contrarian, fundamental value investment philosophy that the founders established in 1985 at Bankers Trust Company. Horizon Kinetics has over 70 employees, with primary offices in New York City and White Plains, New York.
Philosophy
Horizon Kinetics was founded on the belief that a short-term investment approach, widely adopted with the modernization of financial markets, ultimately produces sub-optimal returns. We believe that investors are better served not by taking more risk, but by extending their investment time horizon, which affords far wider ranges of opportunity and valuation than are available to time-constrained institutional investors.  The startling degree of return possibility ignored by a short-term focus is most easily seen in the Equity Yield Curve, a chart you will not find elsewhere.
And while all acknowledge the tremendous power of compounding, practically speaking (and by definition) this benefit simply cannot be harnessed in a short time frame. Our investment strategies – supported entirely by our independent, fundamental research – typically reflect contrarian views that seek to take advantage of the short-term focus of the marketplace.

Investment Research
Publishing research has been the cornerstone of our investment process. We believe that requiring research analysts to frame their investment ideas in writing helps avoid the common behavioral finance error of adjusting one’s investment thesis in response to short-term market price fluctuations. Our research team produces a variety of research publications for the institutional investment community covering undervalued and often systematically mispriced classes of securities, ranging from global spin-offs to distressed debt.
Find Out More
Investment Strategies
With a long-term absolute return mindset, and based on first-hand research, our portfolios tend to be concentrated and avoid tracking or mimicking any benchmark or index. An investment and research process that is de-linked from the standard short-term relative-return benchmarking that leads to crowd-investing behavior should be expected to produce returns that are generally less correlated with other managers and funds. Accordingly, our strategies might be considered diversifying elements within broader asset allocations. Horizon Kinetics offers separately managed accounts, mutual funds and alternative investment products suitable for individual and institutional investors, through its wholly owned registered investment advisers. These include the Kinetics Mutual Funds, Inc. series of open-end registered investment funds.

Horizon Kinetics Announces the Licensing of the Global Spin-Off Index to Van Eck Global | Business Wire
























































Horizon Kinetics Announces the Licensing of the Global Spin-Off Index 
      to Van Eck Global




Index Serves as the Benchmark for the Market Vectors Global Spin-Off 
      ETF






June 10, 2015 09:50 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Horizon Kinetics LLC today announced that Van Eck Global, one of the 
      largest providers of exchange traded products, will license the Horizon 
      Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index (Bloomberg Ticker: GSPIN) to serve as the 
      benchmark for the Market Vectors Global Spin Off ETF (Ticker: SPUN). The 
      new ETF provides investors the ability to access pure-play spin-offs on 
      a global basis.
    

      The Horizon Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index (Ticker: GSPIN, http://www.indxx.com/globalspinoff.php) 
      is a unique, rules-based index that tracks the performance of publicly 
      listed spin-offs domiciled in the United States, Europe, and Asia. The 
      Index tracks the performance of shares passively distributed by a parent 
      company to its shareholders of record as of the spin-off date. The 
      pure-play index tracks the performance of the spun off company for its 
      first five years as an independent, separately traded company. The 
      design of the Index was based on 20+ years of Horizon Kinetics’ 
      proprietary research, various academic publications, and Wall Street 
      research reports that have shown that a portfolio of spin-off securities 
      has historically outperformed the broader equity markets over a 
      multi-year time period.
    

      Doug Kramer, Chief Executive Officer of Horizon Kinetics, said, “We are 
      pleased to license our Global Spin-Off Index to Van Eck Global, one of 
      the largest providers of exchange-traded products in the United States. 
      Our Global Spin-Off Index was developed based upon Horizon Kinetics’ 20+ 
      year experience studying special situation investing and spin-offs. We 
      believe this smart beta ETF will allow investors to access the long-term 
      benefits of spin-offs on a global basis.“
    

      The Global Spin-Off Index is one of 8 indexes created and published by 
      Horizon Kinetics LLC.

Latest Commentary:



2nd Quarter 2017 Commentary

July 20, 2017







        Conference Call Replay
      
It’s always nice to pay a lower fee for the same product.  Who wouldn’t?  But what if it’s not the same?  The Nasdaq 100 ETF (QQQ) fact sheet says it is filled with growth companies and only trades at 22x earnings, the same as the S&P 500.  They don’t tell you that they exclude any companies with losses. They don’t describe how they effectively eliminate the impact of companies with very P/E ratios, through a rather abstruse formula known as the Weighted Average Harmonic Mean.  In the absence of having an MBA or statistical degree, if you calculated the P/E ratio of the Nasdaq 100  the way you know how, by simply averaging the P/E ratios of the 91 profitable companies, then the P/E  is over 40x.  It’s One Thing to Not Know, It’s Another to Be Told What Isn’t So.
As with every quarterly commentary, we’ll review just how indexed products that purport to be low volatility or low risk or provide exposure to a given country or industry actually are not or do not. You don’t get something for nothing, particularly on Wall Street.

1st Quarter 2017 Commentary

April 20, 2017







        Conference Call Replay
      
In past reviews, we’ve titillated you with some of the more startling and story-worthy examples of the distortions caused by the indexation vortex. We have chosen far flung examples in order to direct one’s attention, through all the noise of conflicting information from the financial news media, toward the bubble conditions that ETFs have wrought. But, because those examples have been drawn from more marginal sectors on the market, many of you might have wondered whether they are relevant to their portfolios.  So, in this quarter’s letter, we go mainstream, to see what’s going on in the most basic portfolio building blocks, the bread and butter asset classes:  first, the S&P 500 itself, and then a typical mainstream growth fund and a mainstream value fund that an everyman or everywoman would use. The kind of fund that is relevant.

4th Quarter 2016 Commentary

January 27, 2017







        Conference Call Replay
      
This past year was interesting on so many more fronts than 2015. And this coming year could be more interesting still. In 2016, the financial markets saw all sorts of records and precedents – and not in a good way. We have been taking some time to prepare our client portfolios for advantage. Advantage hinges on the ability to make opportunistic investments, to take what the market gives, not what it doesn’t. Opportunism has a field of play when prices have declined. Sometimes they decline suddenly, other times slowly, sometimes the whole market together, other times just pieces of it. But entry to that field of opportunity itself hinges on having sufficient liquidity; without liquidity, the opportunities are just an idea of what might have been.
Money flows into ETFs and similar funds have not only pushed up the prices of the major index-centric companies, but also created an artificial downdraft among the thousands of non-indexation securities. That is where the companies with less systemic risk will be found. There will be more in the way of idiosyncratic investments with the opportunity for true optionality. Perhaps our portfolios will have to have fewer, but more selective securities with perhaps larger weightings in those companies with truly discounted valuations and a truly superior business position.
So, the watch words are preparedness, and sobriety. Dr. Louis Pasteur said, “fortune favors the well-prepared mind.”
