FAQadmin2017-03-20T21:04:05+00:00 

General 

 What does the ZipSit app do?

ZipSit is a mobile app that makes the entire sitting process so much more efficient for both parents and sitters. For parents: connecting, booking and paying with existing and new sitters has never been easier. For sitters: they can connect with parents they sit for and expand their network of parents they sit via referrals from existing relationships or from parents looking to add sitters. Ultimately this will increase the amount of sits they receive and therefore earn more money. 




 I just received a text invitation from someone asking me to download ZipSit, what is this?

ZipSit utilizes connections between people (parents to parents, and parents to sitters) to ensure you can build your SitterCircle with trusted sitters. If you are a parent, either a) one of your friends invited you to connect so each of you could share your trusted sitters with each other, or b) a sitter that you know would like you to start using the app to book sits with them. If you are a sitter, either one of the families you know would like to use the app to schedule sits, or maybe one of your friends is using it and would like you to enjoy it as well. 




 How does the app connect me with my friends so we can share sitters amongst ourselves?

Parents can connect with their friends via the app and then will have the option of connecting with the sitters your friends use. The sitter must “accept” the connection for the two parties (parent and sitter) to be connected.  




 Does it cost me anything to sign up?

ZipSit is completely free to use.




 Is there a cost to use ZipSit?

ZipSit is free to download and use. There are no setup or monthly subscription fees.




 If I use ZipSit, can people see my personal information?

Your personal information (phone, email, address, etc.) is not made public. If you are a sitter, and make your profile public, your name, photo, age, bio & distance from family are visible. Once a sit has been scheduled, parents and sitters can communicate through the app as well as phone & text messages.




 If I use Facebook to sign up, what info about my profile will be shared and visible?

The only information that is passed to ZipSit from a Facebook signup is your name and email. When you go through the signup process, you can edit your name or email that was imported from Facebook at any time. 




 I know people who would like ZipSit – how do I refer them?

You can refer people to ZipSit via the app – there are areas to invite sitters, or invite parents to join.




 Do the sitters on the app work for ZipSit?

The sitters on ZipSit do not work for ZipSit. They utilize ZipSit’s platform to connect with parents. 




 Are the sitters on ZipSit background checked?

Sitters on ZipSit are all ID Verified through a 3rd-Party Identity Verification service. They are also checked by our merchant service partner once they have completed a sit. Check the sitters profile for their ZipSit Certified Badge to make sure they are verified!




 How does the app connect people with sitters?

You can connect with sitters three different ways: 1. Connect with your existing sitters, 2. Connect with sitters that were shared with you by your friends, and 3. Connect with sitters that are in your area. 




 How is my data kept safe and private?

Our platform is designed to protect your personal information by applying security controls at every layer from physical to application. We are consistently deploying security updates to ensure your data is always safe and secure.




 How can I get in touch with ZipSit?

Feel free to email us at info@zipsit.com

Parents

 How do I connect with a friend through ZipSit so we can share our sitters with each other?

On your dashboard screen, scroll down to the area that says “Connect With Friends”, you will be able to send your friends an invite via text or email.

 Can I request specific sitters when I submit a sit request?

Absolutely! You can submit sit requests to a single sitter, multiple sitters, or your entire SitterCircle. Obviously, the more sitters you sent the request to, the better your chances are to have your sit accepted quickly.




 Do I need to tip my sitter?

This is completely up to you. ZipSit does not facilitate tipping through the automated payment feature. But if you feel the need to make a cash tip to your sitter, feel free to do so!




 Can I reimburse my sitter for expenses (e.g. dinner, ice cream, etc.)?

This has to be done outside of the app – you can leave cash for additional expenses outside of the sitters hourly sitting rate.




 Can I control the hourly rate I pay sitters?

Absolutely. You can change the hourly rate in the Payment Info section of your Profile. You can also change this rate when you create a sit request.




 Can I keep the sitters that I add to my app private?

Yes, as long as you don’t connect with any friends. If you connect with friends, they will be able to see your sitters and request a connection with them. 




 When my sitter joins ZipSit, will their information be visible to others?

This is up to the sitter. They have the ability to keep their profile private, and will only be visible by parents that they are connected to.




 Does my sitter need to have the ZipSit app for me to send them a sit request?

Yes. They will need to have a profile set up on the app, and be connected with you to receive sit requests from you.




 How do I find new sitters on the ZipSit app?

You can search sitters that are in your area – on your dashboard, look for the area to “Discover Sitters”. This is where you can search through sitters in your area and invite sitters to join your SitterCircle.




 I just signed up, but I don’t see any sitters on my app?

It is possible that you are in an area which ZipSit doesn’t have any sitters signed up yet. The app will still work if you would like to invite your sitters to join, or if you connect with your friends to share sitters!

Unfortunately, our website doesn’t allow for booking sits.




 Does ZipSit cost anything to use?

ZipSit is free to download and use. There are no setup or monthly subscription fees.




 Will I be able to filter my search to only include sitters with certain experience or qualifications?

Yes, you can filter sitters by: age, experience, ratings and key skills!




 How do I submit a sit request?

In your dashboard, click “Book a Sitter” and you will be taken through the booking process, where you can choose sitters from your SitterCircle, choose the date, time, duration, children, location, hourly rate, etc.




 Can I send a sit request to my favorite sitter, or multiple sitters at once?

Yes – you can submit to any of the sitters in your SitterCircle, one, multiple or all!




 Can I edit sit details if I need to cancel a sit or need to change times, duration,  location, children, hourly rate, etc.?

Absolutely – just go to your sit schedule, find the sit in question, and you will be able to edit the details of the sit. Once you submit the edits, it will be resent to the sitter who accepted to make sure they can accommodate the change. You will be notified if they were able to accept the changes, or if they can’t accommodate, which you would then need to resubmit the sit request.




 What if we are going to be out longer than the original sit was scheduled for?

Not a problem at all! We always suggest contacting your sitter if you are going to be later than planned – this can be done from the Live Sit screen in your app. The app will automatically calculate the start time and end time of your sit!




 What if we come home before our sit was scheduled to end?

Not a problem! You will be charged the time for your booked sit to accommodate the sitter.




 How do I pay the sitter?

Payment to your sitter is 100% automated. When you sign up, you will provide a payment method (you may have multiple debit or credit cards). When your sit is completed, the app will calculate the time and your hourly rate and will automatically charge your credit or debit card and transfer the funds to the sitter.




 This app is great! There has to be a hidden cost, right?

Nope – no hidden costs or strings attached. You are only responsible for the hourly rate that you commit to pay the sitter.




 What is my “SitterCircle”?

Your SitterCircle is your personal network of trusted sitters. These are made up of sitters you have personally invited as well as sitters that you have connected with through friends or that are in your area.




 What if I don’t have any sitters to add, or don’t know anyone in the area, how do I get connected with sitters?

ZipSit allows you to find sitters located in your area. You can choose “Discover Sitters” to find local sitters that you can connect with. ZipSit is currently adding sitters every day all over the US, but it is possible that there are no sitters that have signed up in your area.




 Can I rate and review the sitter afterwards?

Yes you can, this is actually very important so other parents can find trusted and quality sitters.

Sitters on ZipSit are all ID Verified through a 3rd-Party Identity Verification service. They are also checked by our merchant service partner once they have completed a sit. Check the sitters profile for their ZipSit Certified Badge to make sure they are verified!






Sitters 

 I clicked on a new sit request, and it took me to the app and there is nothing there?

However, access to certain Content and Services requires that You establish a User Account on the Platform. Approval of Your request to establish a User Account will be at the sole discretion of ZipSit. Each User Account and the user identification and password for each User Account (the “User Account ID“) is personal in nature. Each User Account is for Your personal use and each User Account ID may be used only by You alone (or by Your child over 16 but under 18 through Your User Account under Your direct supervision). You may not distribute or transfer Your User Account or User Account ID or provide a third party with the right to access Your User Account or User Account ID. You are solely responsible for all use of the Platform, Content, and Services through Your User Account. You will ensure the security and confidentiality of Your User Account ID and will notify ZipSit immediately if Your User Account ID is lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised. You are fully responsible for all liabilities and damages incurred through the use of Your User Account or under Your User Account ID (whether lawful or unlawful) and any transactions completed through Your User Account or under Your User Account ID will be deemed to have been lawfully completed by You.
Account Registration. In connection with establishing a User Account, You will be asked to submit certain information about Yourself (“Registration Information“). You agree that: (a) all Registration Information You provide will be accurate, complete, and current; and (b) You will maintain and promptly update Your Registration Information to keep it accurate, complete, and current. You may not: (i) use or input Registration Information of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; and (ii) use or input Registration Information that ZipSit, in its sole discretion, deems offensive.

ZipSit reserves the right (but has no obligation) to review any User Content, investigate, or take appropriate action against You in its sole discretion if You violate the Acceptable Use Policy or otherwise create liability for ZipSit or any other person. Such acts may include removing or modifying Your User Content, terminating Your Account in accordance with Section 12, or reporting You to law enforcement authorities.

Your interactions and transactions with other ZipSit Users are solely between You and such User.

MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION/CLASS-ARBITRATION WAIVER. BY ENTERING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND ZIPSIT AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, CONTROVERSIES OR DISPUTES OF ANY KIND AGAINST EACH OTHER. YOU AND ZIPSIT WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY AND ALSO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. ACCORDINGLY, YOU AND ZIPSIT AGREE THAT NEITHER ZIPSIT NOR YOU WILL JOIN ANY CLAIM WITH THE CLAIM(S) OF ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY WHETHER IN A LAWSUIT, ARBITRATION, OR ANY OTHER PROCEEDING. YOU AND ZIPSIT AGREE THAT NO CLAIMS WILL BE ASSERTED IN ANY REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF ANYONE ELSE, THAT NO CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED ON A CLASS-WIDE OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, THAT NO ARBITRATOR OR ARBITRATION FORUM WILL HAVE JURISDICTION TO ADJUDICATE ANY CLAIMS ON A CLASS-WIDE OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THAT NO RULES FOR CLASS-WIDE OR COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION WILL APPLY. THUS YOU AND ZIPSIT MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NOT AS A NAMED PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted and applies to all claims regardless of whether they are based on conduct that occurred prior to, during or after the term of the Agreement and regardless of whether the claims are based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. References to the terms “ZipSit” “You,” “Your,” “Party,” or “Parties” include all respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors and assigns. This arbitration provision survives termination of this Agreement.   The sole exception to this arbitration agreement is that either You or ZipSit may, in the alternative, bring claims in a small claims court having competent jurisdiction.

Arbitration Procedure. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other party, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to ZipSit should be addressed to: ZipSit Management Team. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought. If ZipSit and You do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or ZipSit may commence an arbitration proceeding pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Agreement. A single neutral arbitrator will be selected by agreement of the parties. If an agreement cannot be reached, a single neutral arbitrator will be selected according to the AAA’s procedures and the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (“FAA”), and the claims will be resolved pursuant to this Mandatory Dispute Resolution/Class-Arbitration Waiver provision and the AAA Rules in effect when the claim is filed. The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration and can also be obtained by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. AAA will administer the arbitration, and you may file a demand for arbitration at www.adr.org. Unless ZipSit and You agree otherwise, any in-person arbitration hearings will occur within 100 miles of your address, with the preference that it occur in the county/parish of your address. If a claim is for $10,000 or less, the party submitting the claim may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator (“desk arbitration”), through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. The arbitrator conducting a desk arbitration or telephonic hearing may be located anywhere in the United States. If a claim exceeds $10,000, the AAA Rules govern where a hearing occurs. The arbitration will be confidential, but either party may notify any governmental authority of the claim.
Arbitrator’s Authority. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitrator’s authority is limited to claims between You and ZipSit. The arbitrator has no authority to join or consolidate claims unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. The arbitrator, not any court or agency, has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitrator may award all relief or remedies available in court, including declaratory and injunctive relief, but only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that individual’s claim.
Costs of Arbitration. Except as otherwise provided for herein, ZipSit will: (a) pay all AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with this arbitration provision and (b) will not seek an award of its attorney’s fees. If the arbitrator finds that the substance of the claim or the relief sought is frivolous, however, then the AAA Rules will govern the payment of all fees, and ZipSit may seek an award of its reasonable attorney’s fees. Furthermore, if you initiate an arbitration seeking more than $75,000 in damages, the AAA Rules govern the payment of all fees. You are responsible for all additional costs that you incur in the arbitration, including but not limited to, fees for attorneys or expert witnesses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this provision, ZipSit will pay all fees and costs that it is required to pay under the law.
Changes. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, You agree that if ZipSit makes any future change to this Dispute Resolution Provision (other than a change to the Notice address listed above) during the term of this Agreement, You may reject any such change by sending ZipSit written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision. Changes made to this provision after either party has submitted a Notice will not affect the pending dispute.
Governing Law, Enforcement, and Waivers. The Federal Arbitration Act, and not state law, applies to this Mandatory Dispute Resolution/Class-Arbitration Waiver provision and governs all questions of whether a claim is subject to arbitration. If any portion of the Mandatory Dispute Resolution/Class-Arbitration Waiver provision is determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the provision remains in full force and effect.


NOTICES. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement, any notices required or allowed under this Agreement will be provided to ZipSit by postal mail to the address for ZipSit listed on the Platform. ZipSit may provide You with any notices required or allowed under this Agreement by sending You an email to any email address You provide to ZipSit in connection with Your Account, provided that in the case of any notice applicable both to You and other Users of the Platform, ZipSit may instead provide such notice by posting on the Platform. Notices provided to ZipSit will be deemed given when actually received by ZipSit. Notice provided to You will be deemed given 24 hours after posting to the Platform or sending via e-mail, unless (as to e-mail) the sending party is notified that the e-mail address is invalid.
LINKED SITES. The Platform, Content, or Services may contain links to third-party sites or content that are not under the control of ZipSit. If You access a third-party site or content from the Platform or Services, then You do so at Your own risk and ZipSit is not responsible for any content on any linked site. You may establish a link to the Site, provided that the link does not state or imply any sponsorship or endorsement of Your site by ZipSit or any group or individual affiliated with ZipSit. You may not use on Your site any Content or marks appearing on the Site or Platform in establishing the link. You may not frame or otherwise incorporate into another site the content or other materials on the Platform without prior written consent.
ADDITIONAL TERMS. Unless otherwise amended as provided herein, this Agreement will exclusively govern Your access to and use of the Platform, Content, and Services, and is the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement between the parties, and supersedes any oral or written proposal, agreement or other communication between the parties, regarding Your access to and use of the Platform, Content, and Services. Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement may be amended or modified only by a writing signed by both parties. All waivers by ZipSit under this Agreement must be in writing or later acknowledged by ZipSit in writing. Any waiver or failure by ZipSit to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver by ZipSit of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, that provision will be removed to the extent necessary to comply with the law, replaced by a provision that most closely approximates the original intent and economic effect of the original to the extent consistent with the law, and the remaining provisions will remain in full force.
