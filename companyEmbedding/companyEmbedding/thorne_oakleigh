Under E-learning (electronic learning engl. = "electronically supported learning", literally "electronic learning"), also known as e-learning (e-Education) designated to be - understood to include all forms of learning - a definition from Michael Kerres in which electronic or digital media for the presentation and distribution of learning materials and / or to support the use of interpersonal communication.
          For e-learning can be found as synonyms, terms such as: on-line learning (online learning), tele-learning, multimedia based learning, computer-aided learning, computer-based training, including open and distance-learning

The machine was probably the first study in 1588 by Italian engineer Agostino Ramelli developed when he for the King of France invented a Leserad. Through this Leserad, recourse was made possible in various literature sources without running back and forth.
Halcyon Skinner, 1866 filed the first patent on his machine learning. Until 1936 700 additional patent applications for similar "exercise equipment" have been confirmed.
1938 BF Skinner developed and James G. Holland linear learning programs according to the law of operant conditioning (Skinner Holland'sches tutorial). Thus were the learners, the teaching material in small steps (frames) presented, each followed by questions.
1959 Norman Crowder invented the branched learning programs, in which an error-dependent presentation of the teaching content was made possible. This enabled the learning process to be customized.
In 1971 started the NSF (National Science Foundation) to prove in the United States, two major projects with the aim of the efficiency of computer-assisted instruction for teaching. For one, these were the project TICCIT (English: Time-shared, Interactive, Computer Controlled Information Television) and the second to the PLATO Project (English: Programmed Logic for Automated Teaching Operations). In conclusion, these two studies could the NSF confirm the computer-aided instruction as an effective tool.
Were developed in Germany since 1964, teaching machines, but not by ideas of Skinner / Holland even after those of Crowder. The learning programs that were developed in Germany were used, the training group. Examples of such machines are teaching the Geromat III, had to specify in which three students the correct answer to the subject matter to come forward, and the tutorial "Bachelor". Were able to learn in this program to 64 people at a time, it was possible ramifications, and three different difficulty levels adjustable.
In the early 1970s there were a number of research and development projects for computer-assisted instruction. In addition to use in schools has developed another focus: the work-based training. For example, interactive videos have been used to conduct training for sales staff. 1978, the agency developed M.I.T. together with their customers Hertie one of the first computer-based training (CBT) and the appropriate hardware "Videomit 2000". Since the early 1990s, the simulations with significant research aspects.
Since the late 1990s, the e-learning experienced by the spread of the Internet, a strong upswing. The term "e-learning" has been established since the mid-1990s. The Federal Ministry for Education and Research has since launched several initiatives. This includes initiatives such as the "Schools Online", "New Media in Education" and "Notebook University".

Under E-learning refers to the teaching and learning through various electronic media. In addition to the expression of E-learning, there are various other expressions, such as the computer-based learning, online learning, multimedia learning, etc., has, since the definition of e-learning yet yielded no universally accepted definition, they tried to e-learning to be described by different facets: multimediality , Multicodalität, multimodality and interactivity. [1].
Multimediality
          Multimedia nature, the various possibilities of media, can be acquired through knowledge, dar. Different media can be, for example books, video player, audio player, computer, audio books, ebooks (electronic books), e-lectures (online held lectures) [1].
Multicodalität
          The term is meant Multicodalität that the information can be encoded differently in the various media, which is also dependent on the nature of the medium. Thus, in books, of course, show animated images. Other types of codes would be images, texts, and in case of computer hypertext (cross-references, cross-linked text), animations and simulations [1].
          The difference between animations and simulations is that in a simulation the user has greater control over the event. When an animation is basically to create animated images, while it is possible for a simulation, such as conducting various virtual "experiments" in the digital environment.
Multimodality
          Under Multimodality refers to the different ways to absorb information about the sensory modalities. In general, these are auditory or visual sensations. Other modalities such as smell, taste and touch play in eLearning not have a role [1].
Interactivity
          When something is called interactively, if the user is permitted to exercise various control and intervention options.
          Grissom et al (2003, cit. After [1]) have proposed a six-step interaction hierarchy. This is from "no interaction" to "presentation including feedback and discussion" as the highest form of interaction.

E-learning and related technology
E-learning can be based on very different technologies and are implemented in different teaching scenarios. Are frequently discussed the following options:
          Web and computer based training applications
The term CBT (Computer Based Training) is the work with educational software (educational software) which the learner can be used flexibly in time and space and where learners are not in direct contact with the teachers and other learners. These programs, multimedia learning content (such as: animation or video documents) include and are usually distributed on CD-ROM or DVD. When CBT is one nichttutorielle primary form of e-learning, in which the self-study is important and the communication, if ever, occurs in an asynchronous manner. CBT has been around since the 80s. For older computer assisted learning systems, there are also a variety of other names. For example. are CAT (English: Computer Aided Teaching), CAI (Computer Aided Instruction and Computer Assisted Instruction), CBI (Computer Based Instruction), CAL, CUL ("Computer Assisted Learning") (Computer Aided Learning Computer Assisted Learning rsp.) , CUU ("Computer Assisted Education" or "computer-assisted instruction"), CBL (Computer Based Learning / "Computer-based learning"), CBE (Computer Based Education), CGU ("computer-aided instruction"), RGU ("computer-assisted instruction") or Cuív ("computer-assisted interactive video"). Other common names in German, the terms courseware or courseware.

The basic building block of network-based learning opportunities is the so-called WBT (Web Based Training) - a further development of CBT. These learning units are not distributed on a disk, but accessed by a web server online via the Internet or an intranet. The embedding into the net offers many more possibilities for communication and interaction of the learner with the teacher / tutor or his classmates. Thus, mail, news, chats and discussion forums associated with the WBT and audio and video signals are streamed live [2]. A further development of the WBT towards a more communicative use the learning platform. This supports various types of communication, such as Chat and forums, in order to encourage the users of the learning platform for direct exchange and apply the learned (zBBabbel (software)).
          Authoring systems
Authoring systems are development tools for creating digital learning opportunities. Its purpose is to create content for a learning opportunity and prepare. They offer teachers the opportunity for example, content documents for the web or a CD-ROM developed. It is easy to use authoring tools, authors so that no more knowledge of HTML, XML and Internet need to possess. These simple systems are useful when one wants to produce learning materials for a particular purpose, that does not intend to reuse the content for other courses later. If you use once again produced educational content for different courses, would like to recommend more powerful authoring tools. (This can work with XML technologies and be connected to a document management system).
Can be roughly divided into authoring systems:
 Editors for media (HTML pages, graphics, animations, simulations, audio and video clips, exercises),
          Editors for learning material sites and
          Editors for course navigation ("script" or compilation of the TOC).
Some authoring systems integrate all these functions. This means these authoring systems allow the creator of online courses, a variety of media to integrate into a teaching unit to create professional, dynamic and interactive learning content.

          -> Created for Oakleigh Thorne IV        
The course navigation and control is offered in some authoring systems by more or less exposed programming or scripting language (to the "script" can be defined).
A large portion of the available authoring systems is designed to establish prices for fixed computers and laptops. Some programs allow it but also learning programs specifically for other systems - prepare - such as PDAs and cell phones. There are a variety of media and file types such as text, graphics, video and audio support. Special authoring systems are tuned to so-called learning environments and allow it to create exclusive content for these learning systems. There are also authoring tools, the specific standards such as SCORM, AICC and IMS Content Packaging support. This content authoring tools can generate for all learning environments that support these standards.
The easier to use an authoring system is, the more limited one usually in shaping the content. Systems that can be a creator of great creative freedoms are often very complex and require a longer training period.
          Simulations
Simulations are models, which reflect significant characteristics of the real world trying to get students through free or deliberate experimentation or observation of knowledge about structural or functional properties of the original to convey. Complicated issues and processes of reality can be so simplified and reduced to the essentials are presented, especially when real experiments are too expensive or too dangerous.
          Videoconferencing / distance education
The video conference creates virtual classrooms by geographically distributed students and lecturers can communicate with each other. To be known as the variant of distance education e-learning is primarily characterized by the transmission of picture and sound. It allows a classroom teaching style communication between teachers and learners who can rely on verbal statements as well as to gestures and facial expressions. Is limited by the tele-teaching, the relatively high technical requirements. With increasing bandwidth of Internet connections develop from this new technology eVideo formats.

          Learning Management Systems
See main article learning platform
As a learning platform (English Learning Management System, LMS) systems are known that can support the on-line and / or classroom courses to complete (or parts of) the work flow of the event management of accounting processes, teaching and learning processes to the Resource Administration.
The duties of an LMS may include in particular:
Planning
          these include the design and assembly of (online) courses / seminars, the creation of personalized curricula based on placement tests or have already completed training units, and creating learning profiles for work groups or the whole workforce.
          Registration
          The online registration for all courses offered, often with an integrated interface to an e-commerce system, for example, to order documents
          Provision of course materials
          the stored contents are held in different delivery forms (eg for classroom training and WBT)
          Certification
          the recording of training events, courses and qualifications "skill profiles" (e-skills)
          Measuring success
          measuring the use and management of results.
In some LMS one of teachers and administrative space is included, which can subsequently exchange events and persons and report any scheduling conflicts. These functions can be quite extensive, such as integrated Arbeitszeit-/Urlaubsverwaltung the teacher, storage of spatial data (number of places available resources such as projectors or overhead projectors), comprehensive reports can later be created, for example, etc. From the existing data room occupancy data, lesson plans or learning progress of individuals.

          Learning Content Management Systems
The task of an LCMS (Learning Content Management System) is creating, reusing, retrieving, reworking and delivery of learning content (content). The content is often held in a central repository in the form of 'reusable' learning objects (RLOs). Objects can be referenced by several different courses, so that in case of an Adaptation only a single change necessary to bring all the incarnations of the current state. The LCMS has (as opposed to authoring tools) via a user administration, which allows different people and groups to assign certain rights, so that, for example, for subject-specific experts, media designers, project administrators each have different access functions defined / can be realized.
A multi-user functionality allows you to manage concurrent access, so that it can not happen that two users can simultaneously make (contradictory) changes to the same object. LCMS continues to have a rule about a version control that allows to track changes made.
One of the most important tasks of an LCMS is to support reusable learning objects (RLOs). The aim is to prevent unwanted redundancies and conflicting information widely.

          Content Catalogues
Content-catalogs support the exchange of learning objects - from full courses to raw materials. Provider can specify supply conditions. Requests are documented and, if charged. These catalogs are often very specific to a particular school level (universities here) oriented. See also content-sharing as a form of e-learning.

          Forms of e-learning
          Virtual Education
Virtual Education designated teaching that is conducted primarily over the Internet and does not involve significant amounts of classroom teaching. The spectrum of presentation forms of virtual teaching include Web-assisted courses textbook, hypertext courses (eg text books, multimedia, animations and exercises), video-based courses (eg lectures, including slides) or audio-based courses, or podcasts. Because virtual teaching as opposed to classroom teaching and "blended learning" is little opportunity for direct interaction, teachers and students use electronic media to communicate frequently, such as chat rooms, discussion forums, voice mail or e-mail. Virtual Education plays a growing role in the context of the introduction of further fine-line master's degree programs at many universities.
          Blended Learning
If the benefits of classroom events are associated with e-learning, it is called blended learning (blended learning dt). Blended learning combines both forms of learning in a common syllabus (curriculum). Blended learning is especially used when addition of pure knowledge and the practical implementation is to be trained (eg in health and safety).
          Content Sharing
There are now websites that allow units to share learning. Such initiatives exist as a commercial or free offers. An example of a commercial initiative is UNIDOG.DE - there are monetary incentives for the preparation of learning content set. This should increase the quality of the published notes, flashcards or summaries. As a typical example of a non-commercial forum for example may the Student Council Forum for Business Engineering at the University of Duisburg-Essen used (WiiNGS-DU). Even with such local initiatives often shows a high demand, such as the documented numbers of access-point WiiNGS you an example.
          Learning Communities
Groups have the same goals and / or professional interests can be built on an information and communication system, a common knowledge base. Each member of this learning community can bring their own knowledge and thus expands the knowledge base on common learning processes and adapted.

          Computer-Supported Cooperative Learning
Computer-Supported Cooperative Learning (CSCL) describes approaches to learning, which is supported collaborative learning through the use of computerized information and communication systems.
          Web Based Collaboration
The term Web-Based Collaboration describes the collaboration in a learning task of a group of people over the Internet.
          Virtual Classroom (Virtual Classroom)
The Virtual Classroom is the Internet as a communication medium to connect geographically separated students and teachers together. The Virtual Classroom enables therefore a synchronous form of learning. As an extreme form of the tele-teaching is considered.
          White Board
A whiteboard is like a blackboard or a flipchart. Users have the ability to create a network to share and view sketches. These are both Zeichen-/Mal- and text tools available.
          Business TV
Business TV is a precisely tailored to the television audience. Business TV is a very effective way to stimulate a group (employees, suppliers and customers) to learn.

Microlearning
At the micro-learning is about learning in many small units of learning and in short steps, often via web or phone.
          Modular visualization process content as part of e-learning
This is a visual representation of teaching units with the aim of a cognitive process - which can lead to new knowledge - prepare step by step into film, image, text and sound.
          3-D infrastructure platforms
Increasingly, 3D infrastructure platforms such as Second Life and Twinity gain in importance for e-learning applications. Due to the nature of these virtual worlds experience a very high degree of immersion is achieved. This is intended to a correspondingly higher learning efficiency, because games are growing together and learning. Through simulated worlds of experience you can now immerse themselves in these situations and experience. A high level of immersion (virtual reality) is achieved, inter alia, when the user enters a strong identification with his avatar and the user feels as part of the world. Thus, the term is extended by the concept of action learning e-learning action. Another considerable advantage by networking team in virtual worlds is to see where teams have to play perfectly together, for example, in actions by the police, fire, ambulance, etc. The parties may now log in from anywhere in the world and scenarios on a regular basis in a virtual world through play. Particular orientation trainings can be done here in more frequent and regular intervals, which can increase the effectiveness and efficiency of such operations. Foreign language learning, according to an employee of Linden Lab, the most common form of education in Second Life [3].
          Advantages and disadvantages of e-learning
A few years ago e-learning was seen as the form of education for the 21st Century. Meanwhile, it is believed that e-learning can not replace the traditional forms of education. It can be seen only as a useful aid in the learning process. By combining different forms of media placement ("hybrid learning arrangements") learning can be optimized. In particular, people who prefer to use the PC and the Internet can read books, take a lot of e-learning learning content to better prepare or already known and additional interactive content. Other advantages of e-learning are no doubt the economic aspects. Learners are spatially and temporally independent. The procurement of learning materials can also be done independently from their physical presence. Thanks to PC and Internet distribution of larger aspects of information is feasible. Especially these economic benefits are not to be underestimated. Because "life-long learning" often means part-time learning, and there is flexibility in terms of place and time especially important.
Media are crucial to only a small part of the learning success and therefore can not be spoken of by per se efficient learning e-learning. Come together only when a number of factors that can be successful e-learning (note some are insights from media education or media education).

          -> Site for Oakleigh Thorne IV        
On the basis of the results of media didactics, advantages are, inter alia, that:
 Courses as opposed to traditional teaching tools are interactive,
          abstract content through simulations can be made visible,
          the traditional linear thinking and learning concepts are broken up and more flexible, network-like concepts can be realized
          Learning control can be individualized and can vary Repetitionsaufgaben,
          Courses can be adapted to specific needs,
          Learning with operational knowledge management (knowledge management) can be connected,
          can be worked asynchronously
          time and can be learned anywhere,
          can be learned just in time,
          integrated work process can be learned
          Documentation and repetitions are easier
          Learning objects are reusable,
          Audio and video documents are easy to integrate,
          an individual learning depending on prior knowledge (pace, sequence of learning content) is possible,
          different prior knowledge is better balanced,
          Recording channels available for each type of learner (reading, audio, video, animation, & c.) and that
          no "exposure" over other players takes place in knowledge gaps.
Disadvantages are seen, among other things, that:
 Learners must learn, with the various forms of publication (Media) deal
          too few teachers in e-learning work (in many areas, but not all),
          the technology and technicians to determine the market
          the presentation of learning content often is not determined by technical and educational factors,
          didactics in creating an e-learning solution is often not considered,
          Screen for almost all people learn more tiring than learning from the paper,
          Self-discipline and independent learning skills are needed
          reduced social interactions with teachers / coaches and players make the experience more difficult and therefore often remain unresolved issues,
          Statements by teachers / trainers are reduced and the knowledge itself must be developed and that
          the additional learning during leisure or at work is perceived as annoying.

          -> Site for Oakleigh Thorne IV        
Current approaches, therefore, combine e-learning with classroom teaching, ie the personal mediation. These approaches operate under the concept of "hybrid learning arrangements" or blended learning. The aim of these approaches is to combine the benefits of classroom teaching with those of media-based learning and to avoid both disadvantages.
While many e-learning concepts keep still to linear knowledge, as they are known from books and other traditional teaching tools that allow modern e-learning systems, flexible and adaptive structures that enter with a certain human touch to the learner. Such systems are based on network-like structures for dialogue. The advantage of such e-learning models is that a much higher interactivity is about the whole learning process. Often this reduces the need for blended learning (unless practical skills - such as equipment operations, or social skills - are the subject of learning activity). The disadvantage is the increased complexity in the need to respond to variable outcomes of learning control, and the need to implement a number of learning, in-depth and Exkurspfade that may be followed in practice only a few students ever.
          Motivation for the use of e-learning
The rapid technological development in the computer industry and the associated new methods for the design of content (especially hypertext and multimedia) promoted the development of so-called e-learning programs in a large scale. In the technical discussion you are still not agreed whether e-learning in the sense of e-mail, e-business, etc. for learning on the Internet or as a modern synonym for CUL (computer-assisted learning) should be used. Today the tendency is even more likely to e-learning to be regarded as mere supplements to classroom teaching as part of the so-called blended learning. Moreover, attempts by various actors to give more weight to the actual learning content, there used to be the technological aspects in the foreground.

          E-learning from the perspective of the introduction in organizations
Successful implementation of e-learning requires for each institution a series of accompanying measures:
 Survey of learning conditions and needs,
          Adaptation of curricula,
          Changes in work processes, so that time and incentives for workplace learning are given
          Adjustment of job descriptions and compensation systems,
          Multidisciplinary teams (educationists, engineers, content experts) are set up either inside the organization rsp. appropriate collaborations are set up and
          Contents are stored in interchangeable formats, and all participants will be made available for use.
Robin Mason with Models of Online Courses proposed an approach, such as e-learning can be introduced in stages:
 Content + Support model (information model, static web site) online activities take a maximum of 20% of class time. The Internet is for support activities (research, use of e-mail, download materials) are available;
          Wrap-around model: (asynchronous discussion forum) relation to non-web-web activity up to 50%. Some lessons with traditional materials (eg books) and interactive learning environment with additional resources. In the Internet example, work plans, exercises and tasks, and common web activities (discussion groups, group work) must be called. Center of activity, however, remains the face-to-face teaching;
          Integrated Model: (100% E-Learning) The core of all activities taking place on the Internet, particularly collaborative activities and exchange of materials.
If e-learning is to be operated effectively and efficiently, it requires in relation to the curricula of certain modifications. In particular, it is important to develop key skills such as media, information and computer literacy. These key skills are ideally taught with the help of information and communication technology (tool character).
Gilly Salmon (Salmon, 2000) distinguishes five stages of the learning process on the way from beginner to e-Learning e-Learning Professional:
 Access and Motivation: In this stage will be set up their own computer environment for future e-learning and customized. This refers both to a possible need for physical installation of hardware and software, but also on the structure of personal motivation to use e-learning and want to use. Often at this stage there is still no access to the learning platform / tutors / other students. Assistance must be made through other media (phone / in person). Especially in this phase are particularly frustrating and difficult problems and can quickly lead to termination of the entire process.
          Online socializing: Once technical and motivational hurdles are overcome, is now e-learning to the learner in principle fully available. However, at this point many features are still unclear and need to be explored by the learner - the personal benefits and applicability of the personal learning process initially remain closed
          Exchange of information: It begins a lively and active exchange of information in the new medium. The functions of the software you are using more and more. In this phase, however, does appear on problems concerning the handling of the new and large data set, ie, it comes to classification, archiving, searching, sorting and structuring
          Knowledge construction: participants use e-learning more and more free and flexible. It is not only the use of the material offered online, but now a more intense co-operative learning among participants. The participants learn from and with each other now.
          Self-organization: In this phase, the participants not only for the content of the learning process but also more responsibility for their organization, ie, it is a matter of learning organization and a division of roles within the participating groups. This phase is not meaningful to all e-learning processes.

E-learning in staff development
Companies could reduce their spending on staff development by means of e-learning dramatically. In addition, process and error costs by qualified personnel, lower error rates and increasing the efficiency by using more modern methods are reduced. At the same time the quality is increased by a uniform level of knowledge of all employees and increases motivation and employee satisfaction.
Objectives of e-learning in staff development include:
 Reduction of downtime from work-related absences from training
          Ensure cost-effective and timely training
          Documentation, control and influence on the learning process
          Securing the legal due diligence of the contractor (legal duty training!)
Need for staff development
 Lack of well-qualified employees in the labor market.
          Requirements and complexity of work tasks is increasing continuously.
          Statutory and external demands (eg legal training obligations).
          Need of permanent knowledge transfer due to continuous research and development.
          Extending vocational skills to motivate employees (= retention).
          Essential tool for quality assurance.
          Assurance and maintenance of the efficiency of the company.
          Clear competitive advantage.

          -> Site for Oakleigh Thorne IV        
Cost
 Travel costs € = 0, additional distribution costs = € 0
          Shorter absences from day to day business / workplace
          Reduction of error costs / increase in customer satisfaction
          Costs compared to classic eLearning classroom training: 90% off
Rethinking within networked universities
The design of courses remains in most cases where e-learning is used, the same. There is a tendency usual teaching and learning to translate content into digital formats. In the future, should be asked whether the learning and teaching should go through computer not unusual ways and thus create new forms of learning and contexts.
The organization of universities and colleges could be fundamentally rethought, if you push out the networking of universities. As the teaching and learning situations usually play within the institutional limits and access restrictions, this would mean that teachers are placed in an institution on its own. From the perspective of the institution, it is the duty of teachers within a subject area to give rise to a consistent curriculum. [4] An individual lecturer would find within its own institution, not a starting point for their own specialized development, because the communication is outside with the other teachers, which are distributed all over the world instead.
The other point would be that crosslinking does not develop despite horizontal collaborative ways of working in higher education. In the future, course contents are created together and offered at all universities. The abolition of rangers and the shift from a vertical to a horizontal high school culture would arise not only qualitative but also tangible synergies. The discourse and criticism but must remain a central part of science.
Until then, must solve a series of problems, which are located in the organizational, human, cultural and technical fields [4].
Even for the students e-learning will require a rethink in the next few years. The present is characterized by media-mediated information, which exert a significant influence on private and public life. People are more important than knowledge holders and students have been more than able to assess the quality of existing information. Pure factual knowledge will lose its importance. In contrast, basic knowledge and the concomitant assessment of competence and comprehension processes are becoming increasingly important.

          The role of the tutor in e-learning
Meanwhile is undisputed that the success of e-learning through the use of tutors is improved. Coaches and teachers are qualified to continue increasing tele-tutors to facilitate learning via the Internet (online learning). Depending on the provider of the qualification is spoken of on-line tutoring, tele-tutoring, e-trainers, e-coaches, etc.. (Christina Rautenstrauch: see! Tele-tutors) in the literature mainly spoken by telephone or online tutors will.
One can distinguish three different job profiles:
 The tele-tutor, the learners using various online tools - such as by: - ??care forums, a virtual classroom, computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) or chats;
          Then there are the online instructors to create individual online learning concept;
          E-learning managers are responsible for the introduction and implementation of e-learning in enterprises.
The supervision of students by tutors is in many cases for the success of e-learning crucial. The dependence of the learner or presence of online tutors can also be seen as a hindrance.
          Evaluation of e-learning courses
With the notion of evaluation, which has prevailed since the 1970s, in education, things like quality control, quality assurance, evaluation or impact monitoring are described. Since a variety of multimedia learning opportunities to compete in the market together, thought of this quality is also in e-learning meaningful.
Evaluation can be conducted during the development process as in-process or after the product development as assessed evaluation.
The in-process, including formative evaluation aims to assess and improve the program during the development phase. You may as gradual optimization of the overall product will be seen to prevent undesirable developments and the system is optimally adapted to the needs of the target group.
When the product evaluated, including summative, evaluation is the final quality assessment in the foreground. It is based on various evaluation criteria, the result of the success or the benefits of the measure to be evaluated.

          -> Site for Oakleigh Thorne IV        
The range of product-valued evaluation criteria varies depending on the evaluation focus. Possible criteria and their systematization:
Content / correctness
 Depth, difficulty, relevance, scope, complexity must be reasonable
          Practical relevance (content comply with current state of knowledge)
          Accuracy (no substantive or technical error)
Instructional design
 If the prior knowledge into account? (Entrance test),
          Learning content to be matched?
          Is there help and feedback?
          Interaction with other learners (communication, cooperation and collaboration) and support from tutors
          Ability to self-determination (subject matter, tasks, task difficulty, etc.)?
          Effectiveness of learning control (learning outcomes are measured?)
Usability
 Self-descriptiveness: Is the product easy or self-descriptive?
          Ease of use: functionality and performance of the product correspond to the technological state-of-the-art?
          User guidance, navigation structure, navigation (always visible is where you are in the program, how to got there and what other alternatives you?)
          Orientation and navigation elements are clearly recognizable in their function?
          Orientation: Is learning to estimate before the beginning of the personal benefits to the learning curve?
          Interaction Feedback: Are there any feedback about interaction?
Media Design
 If the product is aesthetically attractive, functional and uniform designs?
          Supports the design of the interaction between user and product?
          Are media elements like text, image, audio, video, color scheme, etc. used appropriately?
          Are understandable, used the target group known metaphors and icons?

Training for e-learning
The design and implementation of e-learning offers a variety of skills required at the interface between media didactics, computer science-, design and business administration. They are used in conventional courses previously taught infrequently. With increasing interest in both the economy and educational institutions on e-learning in the mid 1990s created a demand for "e-learning experts" who are able to e-learning offers to plan, implement and ein-/durchzuführen. Were initially mainly technical expertise in the fore, later conceptual knowledge and skills from the Media Education in the foreground.
Demand was strong initially operated by relative newcomers, later donned by graduates of schools such as University of degree programs, the early and mid-1990s strengthened interdisciplinary programs (such as the media computer science or information design). As an additional qualification in further education courses developed as a certificate or master's degree programs. They are aimed at people who are already active in the area, or want to work in this area. For example. passes it to the tele-akademie der Hochschule Furtwangen in 1998 the part-time certificate course "expert / expert on New Learning Technologies", which is offered as a blended learning program. Since 1999 is offered in Switzerland, the tertiary part-time Master's program "E-learning and knowledge management" [5]. At the University of Rostock from 2002 there is also the part-time master program "Media and Education". The University of Hagen also offers an advanced Master's course "e-education" at.

          E-learning as distance learning with electronic media
Distance learning in the sense of learning programs, each teaching knowledge and skills (ZFU FAQ): (1) on a contractual basis, (2) to be paid, (3) which takes place exclusively or predominantly on a distance, and (4) in the Teachers monitor learning success or his designee, then these are, by definition, the Distance Learning Protection Act (FernUSG) 1977 (3rd revision 2005) by distance learning. Such e-learning courses in Germany require an authorization by the Central Office for Distance Learning (ZFU) before they go to the market (in October 2009, the Federal Supreme Court on 15 October 2009 - III ZR 310/08, NJW 2010 ., 608 held that if an approval is forthcoming, that it paid course fees must be paid back essential characteristic: the learning success of monitoring may take the form of correction and verification tasks are performed during both the domestic self-learning phase and during the accompanying lessons, is sufficient but also a one-time audit of the implementation of distance learning. To monitor the success of learning is sufficient for the law that the learner has the opportunity to receive by oral questions to the learned in an individual control of learning success by the teacher or his agent).
The ZFU registered nor subject to approval in distance learning courses ("hobby-courses" which are used exclusively for recreation). The sales of these courses is the ZFU display. The decision as to whether there is indeed a "hobby course" is located in the ZFU. The distance learning distance-learning courses such contracts are also subject to the learning programs and are reviewed by the ZFU. This is a special provision of German suppliers (in addition, in 2000, the European Union a "distance selling directive" given to all partner countries, which has its prototype in the German Distance Learning Protection Act). In 2005, the 2097 state-approved correspondence courses 632 - ie: 31% - classified as e-learning courses. About 80% of all distance learning schools to support their distance learning courses now electronically. Thus blurring the line between traditional distance education and e-learning.
