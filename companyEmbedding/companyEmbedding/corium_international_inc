Corium Presents Clinical Results from Pilot Bioequivalence Study of Corplex™ Donepezil Transdermal System at Alzheimer's Association International Conference® 2017
Jul 18 17
Corium International, Inc. announced that Parminder "Bobby" Singh, Ph.D., Corium's Chief Technology Officer and Vice President, Research and Development presented the results from the company’s pilot bioequivalence (BE) study of Corplex™ Donepezil in a poster presentation at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference 2017 (AAIC) in London, UK. As announced on May 11, 2017, data from the pilot BE study demonstrated that Corium’s Corplex Donepezil transdermal product candidate successfully met the criteria for bioequivalence to oral Aricept® (donepezil hydrochloride) using primary pharmacokinetic (PK) endpoints previously established with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Corplex Donepezil is a proprietary once-weekly transdermal patch for delivery of the most commonly prescribed treatment for all stages of Alzheimer's disease. The pilot BE study was a six-month, three-period, randomized crossover study comparing the steady-state pharmacokinetic profiles of once-daily oral Aricept with two Corplex Donepezil transdermal patches that differed only in size. Corium is planning to start its pivotal BE study later this year and remains on track to file a Section 505(b)(2) New Drug Application (NDA) for the product candidate in 2018. The pivotal study will be a simpler, two-way crossover design compared to the three-way crossover pilot study.

PartneringBuilding Long-Term Value  




Working with some of the world’s largest pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, we have a track record of collaborating from initial product concept through commercial GMP manufacture by leveraging our technologies, formulation and development expertise.
We welcome the opportunity to solve complex transdermal challenges that create new markets with first-in-patch products.

Corium is currently seeking strategic partnerships in the following areas:

Commercial marketing rights outside the United States for our CorplexTM Donepezil and Corplex Memantine product candidates for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease;

The development and commercialization of our MicroCor® PTH(1-34), a first-in-class biodegradable microstructure formulation of parathyroid hormone for the treatment of osteoporosis; and

The evaluation, development, and commercialization of new products combining our Corplex and/or MicroCor delivery systems with our partner’s proprietary molecules.

In addition, we look forward to speaking with potential partners regarding manufacturing opportunities for other transdermal products.  
Please  for more information.

ManufacturingFrom Concept to Commercialization  




From complete process development and clinical scale-up services to commercial manufacture, we offer a full range of development and manufacturing solutions to our partners.
Our commercial manufacturing operations are located in Grand Rapids, Michigan, encompassing more than 200,000 square feet of space, including compounding, conversion and packaging equipment with a capacity to manufacture well over 100 million patches annually.  
Our GMP facilities are FDA and DEA registered, ISO9001 and ISO13485 certified and are licensed to handle scheduled drugs and compounds requiring hazardous material handling.  We are qualified for the manufacture of over-the-counter (OTC), medical device and prescription transdermal, dermal, mucosal and wound care products.
In addition to batch compounding and continuous solvent cast technology necessary for the manufacture of many types of transdermal, dermal and mucosal products, Corium is one of a very few companies to utilize extrusion technology for the manufacture of these products.   This extrusion technology enables greater formulation flexibility to achieve optimal drug delivery and results in lower product costs by avoiding solvents and requiring less cycle time and labor due to the single-step, continuous nature of the process.
Corium has manufactured millions of transdermal patches over the years and has expertise in all stages and types of transdermal, dermal and mucosal manufacturing, including:


Process development and scale-up
Prototype, pilot, and commercial manufacturing
Primary, secondary and tertiary packaging
Liquid compounding using hazardous solvents and Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)
Twin screw extrusion and mixer-extrusion capabilities
High speed, high accuracy die cutting and customization (including integrated die cutting and pouching); and
Analytical method development, validation and quality control with physical testing and analytical method capabilities

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of 6,500,000 shares of common
stock in this offering will be approximately $45.8 million, or approximately
$53.0 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares, based on the initial public offering price of $8.00 per
share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purpose of this offering is to create a public market for our
common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering as
follows:

• approximately $15 million to $18 million for Phase 2 clinical trials
  for MicroCor hPTH(1-34) and Corplex Tamsulosin;

• approximately $15 million to $18 million for scale up of production
  capability for our MicroCor products;

• approximately $5 million to $7 million for formulation and development
  of our proprietary Corplex products;

• approximately $2 million to $4 million for advancement of our MicroCor
  technology;

• approximately $5.2 million for the repurchase of shares of common
  stock pursuant to the recapitalization described in more detail in
  "Related Party Transactions—Recapitalization;" and

• any remaining balance for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to in-license,
acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or
assets. However, we have no current plan, commitments or obligations to do so.

Pending other uses, we intend to invest the proceeds in interest-bearing,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government, or hold as cash. We cannot predict whether
the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return. Our management will have
broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds we receive from our
initial public offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds.


Our industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense
competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face competition
from other companies in numerous industries, including pharmaceuticals and drug
delivery. We believe the key competitive factors that will affect the commercial
success of our products and the development of our product candidates include
onset of action, bioavailability, efficacy, compliance, cost, convenience of
dosing, safety and tolerability profile.

Companies focused on delivering small molecules transdermally include 3M,
Johnson & Johnson, Lohmann Therapies Systems, or LTS, Mylan, Hisamitsu, or
Noven, and Actavis. Companies operating in the microneedle transdermal field
include 3M, Zosano, Theraject and Fujifilm. Several academic institutions are
also conducting research in the microneedle field. In addition to microneedle
technologies, there are other methods of transdermal delivery under development
for biologics, including heat ablation, laser, ultrasound and radio frequency.
Companies developing and manufacturing transdermal systems for biologics include
Becton Dickinson, Vyteris, and Zogenix. Some of these companies may be
addressing the same therapeutic areas or indications as we are.

Our current products compete, and products in development will compete, in
highly competitive markets against both transdermal products and products
addressing similar patient and customer needs through other delivery forms.
Clonidine TDS, Fentanyl TDS and our future ANDA products will have competition
from other generic pharmaceutical companies, including Mylan and Actavis, both
of which have their own transdermal manufacturing capability. Other
manufacturers of fentanyl patches use a different technology than ours, and
although fentanyl patches made with either technology have experienced
manufacturing challenges, competitors may claim their technology is superior.
The Crest Whitestrips products compete with teeth whitening products marketed by
various private labels such as those at Walgreens and CVS.

Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater
financial, research and development, and human resources than we do, may succeed
in obtaining patent protection before us, and have greater experience than we do
commercializing products and developing product candidates, including obtaining
FDA and other regulatory approvals for product candidates. Consequently, our
competitors are applying significant resources and experience to the problems of
drug delivery and transdermal drug delivery in particular. We cannot assure you
that our transdermal delivery systems will compete effectively against existing
and future transdermal or other delivery systems.


Company Description
We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development,
manufacture and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products that
leverage our broad experience in transdermal and transmucosal delivery systems.
Together with our partners, we have successfully developed six


 marketed products
in the prescription drug and consumer markets, and we are the sole commercial
supplier of each of those products for our marketing partners. These marketed
products are Clonidine Transdermal Delivery System, or TDS, Fentanyl TDS and
four Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips products. We use our novel transdermal and
transmucosal approaches to bring new products to markets with significant
opportunities. Our development platforms enable transdermal delivery of large
molecules, or biologics, including vaccines, peptides and proteins, as well as
small molecules that are otherwise difficult to deliver in a transdermal dosage
form. Our pipeline includes three partnered products that are the subject of
pending drug marketing applications to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or
FDA. In addition, we have 12 partner- or self-funded programs at earlier stages.

Since 1999, we have built significant know-how and experience in the
development, scale-up and manufacture of complex specialty products and have
formed relationships with our partners that include both the development of new
product formulations and our manufacture of the resulting products. Our partners
include The Procter & Gamble Company, or P&G, Par Pharmaceutical, Inc., Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Agile Therapeutics, Inc., as well as several other
multinational pharmaceutical companies. We have the capability to develop and
manufacture our own product candidates and are one of only a few independent
companies that develops and manufactures transdermal products for other parties.
We believe our proprietary manufacturing processes, know-how and custom
equipment give us a distinct competitive advantage over other pharmaceutical,
consumer products and manufacturing companies.

Transdermal drug delivery is the transport of drugs through the skin for
absorption into the body. We have developed two proprietary technology
platforms, Corplex and MicroCor, that we believe offer significant competitive
advantages over existing transdermal approaches. Corplex and MicroCor are
designed to be adapted broadly for use in multiple drug categories and
indications. We use our Corplex technology to create advanced transdermal and
transmucosal systems for small molecules that utilize less of the active
ingredient while achieving the same or better therapeutic effect, that can
adhere well to either wet or dry surfaces, and that can hold additional
ingredients required to aid the diffusion of low-solubility molecules through
the skin without losing adhesion. Our MicroCor technology is a biodegradable
microstructure system currently in development that enables the painless and
convenient delivery of biologics that otherwise must be delivered via injection.
Biodegradable microstructures integrate drug molecules and a biocompatible
polymer. With slight external pressure, the microstructures penetrate the outer
layers of the skin and dissolve to release the drug for local or systemic
absorption. MicroCor is designed to expand the market for transdermal delivery
of biologics, which cannot currently be delivered by other FDA-approved
transdermal technologies.

In addition to commercialized products, we have a number of products in late
stages of development. The most advanced clinical stage product in our pipeline
is AG200-15, which is in Phase 3 development by our exclusive marketing partner,
Agile. AG200-15 is a combined hormonal contraceptive patch designed to deliver
two hormones, ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, through the skin at levels
comparable to low-dose oral contraceptives, in an easy-to-use format over seven
days. Agile has filed a New Drug Application, or NDA, for approval of this
product by the FDA, which is required before marketing a new drug in the United
States. The FDA has indicated that Agile's NDA was not sufficient for approval
as originally submitted. Agile is preparing to conduct an additional Phase 3
clinical trial based on this guidance and intends to supplement the NDA with the
results of the additional Phase 3 clinical trial. Based on market research
conducted by Agile, AG200-15 has the potential to reach a peak market share of
9% of hormonal contraceptive prescriptions in the United States. Based upon IMS
data, Agile estimates that each percentage point of market share of hormonal
contraceptive prescriptions in the United States currently represents
approximately $108 million of annual gross sales.

We are developing two additional products utilizing our proprietary technologies
that we plan to advance into Phase 2 trials in 2014 and 2015. MicroCor
hPTH(1-34) utilizes our MicroCor technology to deliver parathyroid hormone, a
peptide for treating osteoporosis that is currently available only in a
refrigerated injectable form. Corplex Tamsulosin is a patch being developed to
deliver tamsulosin to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, or enlarged
prostate. Tamsulosin is a drug that relaxes smooth muscle cells in the prostate
and bladder neck, thereby decreasing the blockage of urine flow that occurs with
an enlarged prostate. It is designed to deliver a controlled dose over several
days and to reduce side effects compared to currently marketed products. We are
not aware of any FDA-approved transdermal systems for delivering either
hPTH(1-34) or tamsulosin.

We were incorporated in Michigan in 1995 as Corium Corporation and in 1996 as
Converting Systems, Inc. In 2002, these companies were merged and re-named
Corium International, Inc. and our place of incorporation changed to Delaware.
Our principal executive offices are located at 235 Constitution Drive, Menlo
Park, CA 94025, and our telephone number is (650) 298-8255. We have research and
development operations and corporate offices in Menlo Park, California and
pilot-scale and commercial-scale manufacturing facilities in Grand Rapids,
