Variable Asset Management Fees

                        The Asset Management Fee quoted above is the fee applicable at the fund's
                        targeted performance level. Actual fees could be from a minimum of
                        0.90% to a maximum of 3.00% depending on the performance of the fund.
                        The Asset Management Fee is derived from the performance of the fund
                        relative to the target performance level, measured over rolling 1-year
                        periods and calculated daily. A sharing rate of 15% will apply. This means
                        for every 1% under-performance of the target the fee reduces by 0.15%
                        down to a minimum of 0.90%. For every 1% of out-performance the fee is
                        increased by 0.15% up to a maximum of 3.00%. * Note that quoted asset
                        management fees are calculated net of and exclude any potential
                        performance-related fees payable on the portion of an investment
                        allocated to alternative investment strategies. Actual fees paid will be
                        disclosed to investors periodically.
