History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

Notable properties[edit]
The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent adaption as a hotel.[22] The hotel in the Wilshire Grand Tower, under construction in downtown Los Angeles, will be the largest InterContinental in the Americas and the tallest building in Los Angeles.[23]

History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

Notable properties[edit]
The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent adaption as a hotel.[22] The hotel in the Wilshire Grand Tower, under construction in downtown Los Angeles, will be the largest InterContinental in the Americas and the tallest building in Los Angeles.[23]

History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

Notable properties[edit]
The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent adaption as a hotel.[22] The hotel in the Wilshire Grand Tower, under construction in downtown Los Angeles, will be the largest InterContinental in the Americas and the tallest building in Los Angeles.[23]

History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

Notable properties[edit]
The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent adaption as a hotel.[22] The hotel in the Wilshire Grand Tower, under construction in downtown Los Angeles, will be the largest InterContinental in the Americas and the tallest building in Los Angeles.[23]

History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

Notable properties[edit]
The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent adaption as a hotel.[22] The hotel in the Wilshire Grand Tower, under construction in downtown Los Angeles, will be the largest InterContinental in the Americas and the tallest building in Los Angeles.[23]

Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Bass Hotels[edit]
The origins of InterContinental Hotels Group can be traced back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1876, its red triangle logo was the first ever trademark registered in the United Kingdom.[7]
In 1989, the British Government limited the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, resulting in Bass investing in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 1990, it purchased Holiday Inn International from shareholders and expanded into North America.[7]
InterContinental[edit]
Pan American Airways founder Juan Trippe established the InterContinental brand as a division of PanAm and opened the first hotel in Belém, Brazil in 1946. On August 19, 1981, PanAm sold holding company InterContinental Hotels Corporation (IHC) to UK-based Grand Metropolitan for $500 million. As GrandMet focused its core business and expanded into fast food through the purchase of Burger King, it sold IHC to Japanese-based Saison Group in 1988.[7]
In March 1998, Saison Group sold IHC to British brewery Bass, which traces its roots back to 1777, when William Bass established the Bass Brewery in Burton-upon-Trent. In 1988, in reaction to the British government limiting the number of pubs which brewers could directly own, Bass invested in the expansion of its small line of hotels. In 2000, Bass sold its brewing assets (and the rights to the Bass name) to the major Belgian brewer Interbrew for £2.3 billion and changed its name to Six Continents.[7]
In 2003, the independent corporation InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) was created after Six Continents split into two companies: Mitchells & Butlers took control of the restaurant assets[8] and IHG focusing on hotels and soft drinks.[7] IHG retained Britvic, the soft drinks division, until December 2005 when it sold its interest in the company by an initial public offering.[9] In April/May 2014 the company reportedly rejected a $10 billion takeover bid from an unknown suitor, believed to be Starwood.[10]
In April 2017 the company announced that it been the subject of a malware attack and that hackers had stolen credit card details.[11]
Operations[edit]
The company worldwide headquarters and Europe offices are in Denham, Buckinghamshire in England.[12][13] The Americas office is in Dunwoody, Georgia in Greater Atlanta.[12][14] The Asia, Middle East, and Africa offices are in Singapore. The Greater China offices are in Pudong, Shanghai.[12]
In 2006, IHG and Lend Lease Group (Lend Lease US Public Partnerships), joined forces in the Privatization of Army Lodging program.[15] IHG Army Hotels is a division of IHG that manages on-post hotels and lodgings in 39 different locations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico.[16]
Criticism[edit]
The InterContinental Hotels Group became the target of an international boycott campaign in May 2013 over their plan to operate an Intercontinental-brand luxury hotel in Lhasa, Tibet. According to campaigners from the Free Tibet campaign, the hotel was a "PR coup for the Chinese government". "[17]

Notable properties[edit]
The Crowne Plaza Liverpool John Lennon Airport is the former terminal building of Liverpool Speke Airport, constructed in the 1930s and used until 1986. Its notable art deco features led to its listing as a heritage building, and subsequent adaption as a hotel.[22] The hotel in the Wilshire Grand Tower, under construction in downtown Los Angeles, will be the largest InterContinental in the Americas and the tallest building in Los Angeles.[23]

Suppliers

Doing business with IHG
IHG is committed to working with partners and suppliers that best meet the needs of our organization, our owners, our brands, our hotels and our guests.  We aim to work with partners who are amongst the leaders in their fields and we have divided our supplier base into four broad procurement divisions:  

Marketing (Advertising, Media, PR, Fulfilment, Print, Research, Events, Sponsorships)
Hotel (Food, Beverage, Non Food, Engineering and Hotel Utilities)
Corporate (Legal, Consultancy, Human Resources, and Travel) 
Global Technology (Hardware and Software)

A message from IHG’s Chief Procurement Officer 

At IHG, we value our relationships with our global, regional and local partners and suppliers. We strive to develop strategic relationships that add significant value and innovation across our brands and regions. IHG is committed to responsible procurement and we actively look to work with suppliers who share our values. We invite all prospective partners to register their interest* in partnering with us. Thank you for your continued support, we look forward to continuing to develop partnerships across all areas of the business.

* Please note, the completion of the supplier registration is not an approval for doing business with IHG. It does not guarantee that your company will receive an RFx, request for bid, or a contract from IHG. Completion of the supplier registration does not imply that your company has any type of procurement relationship with IHG, either now or in the future.
The supplier registration file provides key information about your company to internal IHG procurement groups. Please update any outdated or incorrect information in your registration as needed. If your registration has not been accessed for a two (2) year period, (i.e. no updates or changes) it is subject to deletion.

Pet-Friendly Places







 Your pets are guests, too.

At Hotel Indigo, we’re used to welcoming guests with discerning tastes in music, design and food. Some of these guests often have more than two legs. That’s right – we’re a boutique hotel that happily welcomes four-legged furry friends with open arms and full bowls! When you stay at one of our properties, you can be sure that you won’t be the only one enjoying the world-class service that our knowledgeable staff offers. Each one of our hotels finds a fun and unique way to pamper you and your pet. From a welcome biscuit to their very own doggie bed, your pet will get a taste of the exclusive boutique experience that we have to offer at each one of our hotels.


Some of our hotels even have their very own permanent pet residences! Read below for some heart-warming tales about how our furry, fluffy and fishy friends can brighten your day and your stay when you book at select Hotel Indigo properties.

*This offer is valid at select hotels only.

                        Hotel Indigo Baton Rouge
                        From starring in musicals and hosting Lunch with Huey 
                        during Bring Your Pet to Work Week, this four-legged treasure 
                        is a local celebrity. Huey is adored by guests and staff alike 
                        thanks to his friendly, outgoing personality.






  Hotel Indigo Columbus Architectural Centre

  Miles can best be described as intuitive, sweet and 
  disciplined. This pooch knows the hotel schedule better 
  than some of the staff, and takes great care in making 
  sure that everyone feels welcomed at "his" hotel. 





                        Hotel Indigo New Orleans Garden District
                        These two are quite the pair! Rumored to have come 
                        from a long line of Siamese fighting fish, Rex and Zulu 
                        add a unique aesthetic to their surroundings while 
                        delighting guests with their unique, fishy personalities! 








  Hotel Indigo Atlanta Midtown
  A regular at Canine Cocktail Hour, this spunky Jack 
  Russell terrier was adopted from the Atlanta Humane 
  Society. Indie's sweet and fun personality adds a human 
  element to the hotel.
