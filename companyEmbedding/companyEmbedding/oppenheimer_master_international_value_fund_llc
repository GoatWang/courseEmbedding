1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.

As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Special Risks:  Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Value Fund among 
1091,
1091,
936
and 
681
Large Value
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

 Performance data quoted represents past performance, which does not guarantee future results. The investment return
and principal value of an investment in the Fund will fluctuate so that an investors shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Fund
returns include changes in share price and reinvested distributions, but do not consider capital gains or income taxes on an individuals investment.  *April 29, 2016, was the last business day of the Funds semiannual period. See Note 2 of the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements. Index returns are calculated through April 30, 2016.
 The Funds performance is compared to the performance of the MSCI All Country World ex USA Index. The MSCI All Country World ex USA Index is
designed to measure the equity market performance of developed and emerging markets and excludes the U.S. The Index is unmanaged and cannot be purchased directly by investors. While index comparisons may be

useful to provide a benchmark for the Funds performance, it must be noted that the Funds investments are not limited to the investments comprising the Index. Index performance
includes reinvestment of income, but does not reflect transaction costs, fees, expenses or taxes. Index performance is shown for illustrative purposes only as a benchmark for the Funds performance, and does not predict or depict performance of
the Fund. The Funds performance reflects the effects of the Funds business and operating expenses.  The Funds investment strategy and focus can

Fund Performance Discussion 
In a volatile market environment, the Fund returned -7.30% during the reporting period. On a relative basis, the Fund outperformed the MSCI All
Country (AC) World ex USA Index (the Index), which returned -11.28%. The Fund outperformed the Index in eight out of ten sectors during the reporting period, led by an underweight position in financials and stock selection in
materials, information technology and consumer discretionary. The Fund underperformed the Index within industrials and utilities, largely due to stock selection. 
MARKET OVERVIEW

The one-year reporting period was a tumultuous time for global equity markets. Numerous concerns resulted in volatile
global equity markets during the reporting period, including the impact of slowing Chinese growth on commodities prices and the global economy, Greeces debt situation, the strength of the U.S. dollar, along with the timing and impact of U.S.
interest rate hikes. These factors created risk on/risk off market environments 
 

which tend to obscure fundamentals and increase market volatility. Finally, in December, the U.S. Federal Reserve (the
Fed) enacted their long-awaited rate rise, to mixed reviews. In addition, plummeting energy prices, decelerating emerging market growth and sluggish developed market growth all contributed to an environment where investor sentiment swung
back and forth like a pendulum to close 2015.

Volatility continued in the first four months of 2016. Adding to concerns over Chinas slowing economy and falling
crude oil prices were concerns of slowing global and domestic economic growth. However, sentiment improved in March as the Fed began to hint at lowering the trajectory of rate rises. Oil prices stabilized. Commodities, which have been declining from
their super cycle peak for some time, rallied.  FUND REVIEW 
Top performing holdings of the Fund this reporting period included adidas AG, Alphabet, Inc. and Japan Tobacco, Inc. While not appearing to be a traditional
value stock, adidas was a contrarian buy just over a year ago. Investors had become disenchanted with adidas by the fall of 2014 as it was losing market share to Nike and Under Armour, was exposed to Russia and had overpaid for
TaylorMade. However, we felt there might be too much pessimism around this venerable brand. The company quietly began to buy back its own shares. This move, combined with a logical strategy to streamline/reorganize the marketing and R&D budgets
under product managers rather than regional sales heads, was the catalyst for us to get involved. We then met with the Head of Global Brands, an American from Wisconsin, who articulated the companys strategy for North America, which led us to
increase our positon, making it one of the Funds largest. The shares have performed well because of strong results in China, stabilization in Russia and the announcement of a new


CEO who is highly regarded. Alphabet is the new name for Google. Tremendous value was released in 2015 when the company announced that it was reorganizing itself into a holding
companyAlphabetwith separate subsidiaries for its various endeavors. It completed that process in October and announced strong earnings in its core search business. Mobile advertising growth was strong while the pace of cost rises
slowed. We continue to see significant value in the company. After trading sideways for one year, paying a nice dividend, Japan Tobaccos shares have performed well because of the companys robust cash generating ability, rising dividend
and share buybacks. More recently, the company has benefited from a price hike for its premium Mevius (formerly Mild 7) brand. We think there is ample room to raise prices in Japan where a pack of cigarettes sells for less than half the price in the
U.S. and U.K.  Top detractors from performance included Rakuten, Inc., Rolls-Royce Holdings plc and SK Telecom Co., Ltd. Rakuten, Inc., an e-commerce leader in
Japan, had been a good performer for the Fund from early 2013 until the spring of last year. Competition from Amazon and a reinvigorated Yahoo Japan has taken a toll on growth and profit margins, while forays into new overseas businesses remain
unprofitable. Rakuten also has a large credit card business which has been negatively impacted by the extremely low interest rate environment. We did reduce our position but remain shareholders as the
 
 
5      OPPENHEIMER MASTER INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND, LLC 




underlying e-commerce business remains a market leader in Japan and is highly cash generative. Rolls-Royce Holdings plc is the British maker of aircraft jet engines, its main business. Over the
past two years the share price has suffered from a perfect storm of slow demand in the marine businesswhich is energy-related, a soft military aerospace 
market, poorly understood accounting, poor communication to investors, and kitchen sink write-offs after new management took over this past year. We have bought into
the company as its stock price has come down. In our opinion, the long term demand outlook for air traveland therefore civil aircraftis very strong and Rolls-Royce is well placed to compete strongly against GE, the other major supplier
of jet engines in the world. SK Telecom is the leading mobile telecommunications provider in South Korea. During the reporting period the company announced earnings that were somewhat disappointing. SK Telecoms customers have upgraded to 4G
services more slowly than, 
expected. That along with intense market competition, has inhibited growth in revenues per user. We are closely watching
the evolution in the South Korean mobile telecommunications market and SK Telecoms behavior within it.  STRATEGY & OUTLOOK
 The Fund continues to maintain a bottom-up approach to investing along with following the long-term thematic investment philosophy of the
OppenheimerFunds Global Equity Team, with its focus on Mass Affluence, New Technology, Restructuring and Aging. By focusing on company fundamentals, understanding the relationship between macroeconomic and microeconomic catalysts and ignoring
short-term noise, we have found new opportunities amid market volatility. The Fund remains focused on international companies that we believe have durable advantages, but are undervalued relative to their peers, their historic valuations, and/or
their private market value.

Fund Expenses 
Fund Expenses. As a shareholder of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction costs, which may include sales charges (loads) on purchase
payments and/or contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution and service fees; and other Fund expenses. These examples are intended to help you understand your ongoing costs
(in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.  The examples are based on an investment
of $1,000.00 invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire 6-month period ended April 29, 2016.  Actual Expenses. The first section of
the table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with the amount you invested, to estimate the expense that you paid over the period. Simply divide your account
value by $1,000.00 (for example, an $8,600.00 account value divided by $1,000.00 = 8.60), then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled Expenses Paid During 6 Months Ended April 29, 2016 to
estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period.  Hypothetical Example for Comparison Purposes. The second section of the table provides
information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the Funds actual expense ratio, and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the Funds actual return. The hypothetical
account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period. You may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the Fund and other funds. To do so, compare this
5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds.  Please note that the expenses shown in the
table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transactional costs, such as front-end or contingent deferred sales charges (loads). Therefore, the hypothetical section of the table is useful in comparing
ongoing costs only, and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds. In addition, if these transactional costs were included, your costs would have been higher.

 Expenses are equal to the Funds annualized expense ratio, multiplied by the average account value over the period, multiplied by
181/366 (to reflect the one-half year period). Those annualized expense ratios, excluding indirect expenses from affiliated funds, based on the 6-month period ended April 29, 2016 are as follows: 
 




Expense Ratio


  0.82%      
 The expense ratio reflects voluntary and/or contractual waivers and/or reimbursements of expenses by the Funds Manager. Some of
these undertakings may be modified or terminated at any time, as indicated in the Funds prospectus. The Financial Highlights table in the Funds financial statements, included in this report, also shows the gross expense
ratio, without such waivers or reimbursements and reduction to custodian expenses, if applicable.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS April 29,
2016     
  1. Organization 
Oppenheimer Master International Value Fund, LLC (the Fund) is organized as a Delaware limited liability company and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 (1940 Act), as amended, as a diversified open-end, management investment company. The Funds investment objective is to seek capital appreciation. The Funds investment adviser is OFI Global Asset Management, Inc.
(OFI Global or the Manager), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OppenheimerFunds, Inc. (OFI or the Sub-Adviser). The Manager has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with OFI. At period end, 100% of the
shares of the Fund were owned by the Manager, other funds advised or sub-advised by the Manager or an affiliate of the Manager.  Shares of the Fund
are issued solely in private placement transactions that do not involve any public offering within the meaning of Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Investments in the Fund
may only be made by certain accredited investors within the meaning of Regulation D under the Securities Act, including other investment companies. The Fund currently offers one class of shares. 
For federal income tax purposes, the Fund qualifies as a partnership, and each investor in the Fund is treated as the owner of its proportionate share of
the net assets, income, expenses, and realized and unrealized gains and losses of the Fund. Accordingly, as a pass-through entity, the Fund pays no dividends or capital gain distributions. 
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed in the Funds preparation of financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).   
  2. Significant Accounting Policies 
Security Valuation. All investments in securities are recorded at their estimated fair value, as described in Note 3. 
Reporting Period End Date. The last day of the Funds reporting period is the last day the New York Stock Exchange was open for trading during the period.
The Funds financial statements have been presented through that date to maintain consistency with the Funds net asset value calculations used for shareholder transactions. 
Foreign Currency Translation. The Funds accounting records are maintained in U.S. dollars. The values of securities denominated in foreign currencies and
amounts related to the purchase and sale of foreign securities and foreign investment income are translated into U.S. dollars as of the close of the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange), normally 4:00 P.M. Eastern time, on each day the
Exchange is open for trading. Foreign exchange rates may be valued primarily using a reliable bank, dealer or service authorized by the Board of Directors. 
Reported net realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions arise from sales of portfolio securities, sales and maturities of short-term
securities, sales of foreign currencies, exchange rate fluctuations between the trade and settlement dates on securities transactions, and the difference between the amounts of dividends, interest, and foreign withholding

 2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)   

taxes recorded on the Funds books and the U.S. dollar equivalent of the amounts actually received or paid. Net unrealized appreciation and depreciation on the translation of assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies arise from changes in the values of assets and liabilities, including investments in securities at fiscal period end, resulting from changes in exchange rates. 
The effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on investments is separately identified from the fluctuations arising from changes in market
values of securities held and reported with all other foreign currency gains and losses in the Funds Statement of Operations.  Investment Income.
Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date or upon ex-dividend notification in the case of certain foreign dividends where the ex-dividend date may have passed. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are recorded at the
fair market value of the securities received. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis. Discount and premium, which are included in interest income on the Statement of Operations, are amortized or accreted daily. 
Custodian Fees. Custodian fees and expenses in the Statement of Operations may include interest expense incurred by the Fund on any cash overdrafts
of its custodian account during the period. Such cash overdrafts may result from the effects of failed trades in portfolio securities and from cash outflows resulting from unanticipated shareholder redemption activity. The Fund pays interest to its
custodian on such cash overdrafts, to the extent they are not offset by positive cash balances maintained by the Fund, at a rate equal to the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The Reduction to custodian expenses line item, if applicable,
represents earnings on cash balances maintained by the Fund during the period. Such interest expense and other custodian fees may be paid with these earnings. 
Security Transactions. Security transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of
identified cost.  Indemnifications. The Funds organizational documents provide current and former Directors and officers with a limited indemnification
against liabilities arising in connection with the performance of their duties to the Fund. In the normal course of business, the Fund may also enter into contracts that provide general indemnifications. The Funds maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would be dependent on future claims that may be made against the Fund. The risk of material loss from such claims is considered remote. 
Federal Taxes. The Fund, as an entity, will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. The Fund will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a
partnership, and not as an association taxable as a corporation. Therefore, a tax provision is not required. Each shareholder is required for U.S. federal income tax purposes to take into account, in its taxable year with

 
19      OPPENHEIMER MASTER INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND, LLC 






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

  

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  
which (or within which a taxable year of the Fund ends), its distributive share of all items of Fund income, gains,
losses, and deductions for such taxable year of the Fund. A shareholder must take such items into account even if the Fund does not distribute cash or other property to such shareholder during its taxable year. 
Although the Fund is treated as a partnership for Federal tax purposes, it is intended that the Funds assets, income and distributions will be
managed in such a way that investment in the Fund would not cause an investor that is a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Code (RIC) to fail that qualification. 
Use of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases in net assets from operations during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.     
3. Securities Valuation  The Fund calculates the net asset value of its shares
as of 4:00 P.M. Eastern time, on each day the New York Stock Exchange (the Exchange) is open for trading, except in the case of a scheduled early closing of the Exchange, in which case the Fund will calculate net asset value of the
shares as of the scheduled early closing time of the Exchange.  The Funds Board has adopted procedures for the valuation of the Funds
securities and has delegated the day-to-day responsibility for valuation determinations under those procedures to the Manager. The Manager has established a Valuation Committee which is responsible for determining a fair valuation for
any security for which market quotations are not readily available. The Valuation Committees fair valuation determinations are subject to review, approval and ratification by the Funds Board at its next regularly scheduled
meeting covering the calendar quarter in which the fair valuation was determined.  Valuation Methods and Inputs 
Securities are valued using unadjusted quoted market prices, when available, as supplied primarily by third party pricing services or dealers. 
The following methodologies are used to determine the market value or the fair value of the types of securities described below: 
Securities traded on a registered U.S. securities exchange (including exchange-traded derivatives other than futures and futures options) are valued
based on the last sale price of the security reported on the principal exchange on which it is traded, prior to the time when the Funds assets are valued. In the absence of a sale, the security is valued at the mean between the bid and asked
price on the principal exchange or, if not available from the principal exchange, obtained from two dealers. If bid and asked prices are not available from either the exchange or two dealers, the security is valued by using one of the following
methodologies (listed in order of priority): (1) a bid from the principal exchange, (2) the 
 
20      OPPENHEIMER MASTER INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND, LLC 








    

3. Securities Valuation (Continued)  
mean between the bid and asked price as provided by a single dealer, or (3) a bid from a single dealer. A security
of a foreign issuer traded on a foreign exchange, but not listed on a registered U.S. securities exchange, is valued based on the last sale price on the principal exchange on which the security is traded, as identified by the third party pricing
service used by the Manager, prior to the time when the Funds assets are valued. If the last sale price is unavailable, the security is valued at the most recent official closing price on the principal exchange on which it is traded. If the
last sales price or official closing price for a foreign security is not available, the security is valued at the mean between the bid and asked price per the exchange or, if not available from the exchange, obtained from two dealers. If bid and
asked prices are not available from either the exchange or two dealers, the security is valued by using one of the following methodologies (listed in order of priority): (1) a bid from the exchange, (2) the mean between the bid and asked
price as provided by a single dealer, or (3) a bid from a single dealer.  Shares of a registered investment company that are not traded on an
exchange are valued at that investment companys net asset value per share.  Corporate and government debt securities (of U.S. or foreign
issuers) and municipal debt securities, event-linked bonds, loans, mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and asset-backed securities are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices utilizing
evaluated prices obtained from third party pricing services or broker-dealers who may use matrix pricing methods to determine the evaluated prices. 
Short-term money market type debt securities with a remaining maturity of sixty days or less are valued at cost adjusted by the amortization of discount
or premium to maturity (amortized cost), which approximates market value. Short-term debt securities with a remaining maturity in excess of sixty days are valued at the mean between the bid and asked prices utilizing
evaluated prices obtained from third party pricing services or broker-dealers.  Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are valued utilizing
current and forward currency rates obtained from third party pricing services. When the settlement date of a contract is an interim date for which a quotation is not available, interpolated values are derived using the nearest dated forward currency
rate.  A description of the standard inputs that may generally be considered by the third party pricing vendors in determining their evaluated prices is provided
below.

3. Securities Valuation (Continued)  
price obtained does not constitute a readily available market quotation, or a significant event has
occurred that would materially affect the value of the security, the security is fair valued either (i) by a standardized fair valuation methodology applicable to the security type or the significant event as previously approved by the
Valuation Committee and the Funds Board or (ii) as determined in good faith by the Managers Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee considers all relevant facts that are reasonably available, through either public information
or information available to the Manager, when determining the fair value of a security. Fair value determinations by the Manager are subject to review, approval and ratification by the Funds Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting
covering the calendar quarter in which the fair valuation was determined. Those fair valuation standardized methodologies include, but are not limited to, valuing securities at the last sale price or initially at cost and subsequently adjusting the
value based on: changes in company specific fundamentals, changes in an appropriate securities index, or changes in the value of similar securities which may be further adjusted for any discounts related to security-specific resale restrictions.
When possible, such methodologies use observable market inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices of similar securities, observable interest rates, currency rates and yield curves. The methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an
indication of the risks associated with investing in those securities nor can it be assured that the Fund can obtain the fair value assigned to a security if it were to sell the security. 
To assess the continuing appropriateness of security valuations, the Manager, or its third party service provider who is subject to oversight by the
Manager, regularly compares prior day prices, prices on comparable securities, and sale prices to the current day prices and challenges those prices exceeding certain tolerance levels with the third party pricing service or broker source. For those
securities valued by fair valuations, whether through a standardized fair valuation methodology or a fair valuation determination, the Valuation Committee reviews and affirms the reasonableness of the valuations based on such methodologies and fair
valuation determinations on a regular basis after considering all relevant information that is reasonably available.  Classifications 
Each investment asset or liability of the Fund is assigned a level at measurement date based on the significance and source of the inputs to its valuation. Various data
inputs are used in determining the value of each of the Funds investments as of the reporting period end. These data inputs are categorized in the following hierarchy under applicable financial accounting standards: 
1) Level 1-unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (including securities actively traded on a securities exchange)
 2) Level 2-inputs other than unadjusted quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (such as unadjusted quoted prices for similar
assets and market corroborated inputs such as interest rates, prepayment speeds, credit risks, etc.)  3) Level 3-significant unobservable inputs
(including the Managers own judgments about assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability). 
 
22      OPPENHEIMER MASTER INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND, LLC 










    

3. Securities Valuation (Continued)  
The inputs used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risks associated with investing in
those securities.  The Fund classifies each of its investments in those investment companies which are publicly offered and reported on an exchange
as Level 1, and those investment companies which are not publicly offered are not assigned a level, without consideration as to the classification level of the specific investments held by those investment companies. 
The table below categorizes amounts that are included in the Funds Statement of Assets and Liabilities at period end based on valuation input level:

4. Investments and Risks  Risks of Foreign Investing. The Fund may
invest in foreign securities which are subject to special risks. Securities traded in foreign markets may be less liquid and more volatile than those traded in U.S. markets. Foreign issuers are usually not subject to the same accounting and
disclosure requirements that U.S. companies are subject to, which may make it difficult for the Fund to evaluate a foreign companys operations or financial condition. A change in 
 
23      OPPENHEIMER MASTER INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND, LLC 






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

  

4. Investments and Risks (Continued)  
the value of a foreign currency against the U.S. dollar will result in a change in the U.S. dollar value of investments
denominated in that foreign currency and in the value of any income or distributions the Fund may receive on those investments. The value of foreign investments may be affected by exchange control regulations, foreign taxes, higher transaction and
other costs, delays in the settlement of transactions, changes in economic or monetary policy in the United States or abroad, expropriation or nationalization of a companys assets, or other political and economic factors. In addition, due to
the inter-relationship of global economies and financial markets, changes in political and economic factors in one country or region could adversely affect conditions in another country or region. Investments in foreign securities may also expose
the Fund to time-zone arbitrage risk. Foreign securities may trade on weekends or other days when the Fund does not price its shares. At times, the Fund may emphasize investments in a particular country or region and may be subject to greater risks
from adverse events that occur in that country or region. Foreign securities and foreign currencies held in foreign banks and securities depositories may be subject to limited or no regulatory oversight. 
Investments in Affiliated Funds. The Fund is permitted to invest in other mutual funds advised by the Manager (Affiliated Funds). Affiliated Funds
are open-end management investment companies registered under the 1940 Act, as amended. The Manager is the investment adviser of, and the Sub-Adviser provides investment and related advisory services to, the Affiliated Funds. When applicable, the
Funds investments in Affiliated Funds are included in the Statement of Investments. Shares of Affiliated Funds are valued at their net asset value per share. As a shareholder, the Fund is subject to its proportional share of the Affiliated
Funds expenses, including their management fee. The Manager will waive fees and/ or reimburse Fund expenses in an amount equal to the indirect management fees incurred through the Funds investment in the Affiliated Funds. 
Each of the Affiliated Funds in which the Fund invests has its own investment risks, and those risks can affect the value of the Funds investments
and therefore the value of the Funds shares. To the extent that the Fund invests more of its assets in one Affiliated Fund than in another, the Fund will have greater exposure to the risks of that Affiliated Fund. 
Investment in Oppenheimer Institutional Money Market Fund. The Fund is permitted to invest daily available cash balances in a money market Affiliated Fund. The
Fund may invest the available cash in Class E shares of Oppenheimer Institutional Money Market Fund (IMMF) to seek current income while preserving liquidity or for defensive purposes. IMMF is regulated as a money market fund under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.  Equity Security Risk. Stocks and other equity securities fluctuate in price. The value of the Funds
portfolio may be affected by changes in the equity markets generally. Equity markets may experience significant short-term volatility and may fall sharply at times. Different markets may behave differently from each other and U.S. equity markets may
move in the opposite direction from one or more foreign stock markets. Adverse events in any part of the equity or fixed-income markets may have unexpected negative effects on other market segments. 
 
24      OPPENHEIMER MASTER INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND, LLC 








    

4. Investments and Risks (Continued)  
The prices of individual equity securities generally do not all move in the same direction at the same
time and a variety of factors can affect the price of a particular companys securities. These factors may include, but are not limited to, poor earnings reports, a loss of customers, litigation against the company, general unfavorable
performance of the companys sector or industry, or changes in government regulations affecting the company or its industry.   
  5. Market Risk Factors 
The Funds investments in securities and/or financial derivatives may expose the Fund to various market risk factors: 
Commodity Risk. Commodity risk relates to the change in value of commodities or commodity indexes as they relate to increases or decreases in the
commodities market. Commodities are physical assets that have tangible properties. Examples of these types of assets are crude oil, heating oil, metals, livestock, and agricultural products. 
Credit Risk. Credit risk relates to the ability of the issuer of debt to meet interest and principal payments, or both, as they come due. In
general, lower-grade, higher-yield debt securities are subject to credit risk to a greater extent than lower-yield, higher-quality securities. 
Equity Risk. Equity risk relates to the change in value of equity securities as they relate to increases or decreases in the general market. 
Foreign Exchange Rate Risk. Foreign exchange rate risk relates to the change in the U.S. dollar value of a security held that is denominated in a
foreign currency. The U.S. dollar value of a foreign currency denominated security will decrease as the dollar appreciates against the currency, while the U.S. dollar value will increase as the dollar depreciates against the currency. 
Interest Rate Risk. Interest rate risk refers to the fluctuations in value of fixed-income securities resulting from the inverse relationship
between price and yield. For example, an increase in general interest rates will tend to reduce the market value of already issued fixed-income investments, and a decline in general interest rates will tend to increase their value. In addition, debt
securities with longer maturities, which tend to have higher yields, are subject to potentially greater fluctuations in value from changes in interest rates than obligations with shorter maturities. 
Volatility Risk. Volatility risk refers to the magnitude of the movement, but not the direction of the movement, in a financial instruments
price over a defined time period. Large increases or decreases in a financial instruments price over a relative time period typically indicate greater volatility risk, while small increases or decreases in its price typically indicate lower
volatility risk.     
6. Use of Derivatives  The Funds investment objective not only permits
the Fund to purchase investment securities, it also allows the Fund to enter into various types of derivatives contracts, including, but not limited to, futures contracts, forward currency exchange contracts, credit default swaps,

 
25      OPPENHEIMER MASTER INTERNATIONAL VALUE FUND, LLC 






NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

  

6. Use of Derivatives (Continued)  
interest rate swaps, total return swaps, variance swaps and purchased and written options. In doing so, the Fund will
employ strategies in differing combinations to permit it to increase, decrease, or change the level or types of exposure to market risk factors. These instruments may allow the Fund to pursue its objectives more quickly and efficiently than if it
were to make direct purchases or sales of securities capable of effecting a similar response to market factors. Such contracts may be entered into through a bilateral over-the-counter (OTC) transaction, or through a securities or futures
exchange and cleared through a clearinghouse.  Derivatives may have little or no initial cash investment relative to their market value exposure and
therefore can produce significant gains or losses in excess of their cost due to unanticipated changes in the market risk factors and the overall market. This use of embedded leverage allows the Fund to increase its market value exposure relative to
its net assets and can substantially increase the volatility of the Funds performance. In instances where the Fund is using derivatives to decrease, or hedge, exposures to market risk factors for securities held by the Fund, there are also
risks that those derivatives may not perform as expected resulting in losses for the combined or hedged positions. Some derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the Funds initial investment. 
Additional associated risks from investing in derivatives also exist and potentially could have significant effects on the valuation of the derivative
and the Fund. Typically, the associated risks are not the risks that the Fund is attempting to increase or decrease exposure to, per its investment objectives, but are the additional risks from investing in derivatives. Examples of these associated
risks are liquidity risk, which is the risk that the Fund will not be able to sell the derivative in the open market in a timely manner, and counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the
Fund.  The Funds actual exposures to these market risk factors and associated risks during the period are discussed in further detail, by
derivative type, below.  Forward Currency Exchange Contracts  The Fund
may enter into forward currency exchange contracts (forward contracts) for the purchase or sale of a foreign currency at a negotiated rate at a future date. Such contracts are traded in the OTC inter-bank currency dealer market. 
Forward contracts are reported on a schedule following the Statement of Investments. The unrealized appreciation (depreciation) is reported in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities as a receivable (or payable) and in the Statement of Operations within the change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation). At contract close, the difference between the original cost of the contract and the
value at the close date is recorded as a realized gain (loss) in the Statement of Operations.  The Fund has entered into forward contracts with the
obligation to purchase specified foreign currencies in the future at a currently negotiated forward rate in order to decrease exposure to foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated securities held by the Fund. 
The Fund has entered into forward contracts with the obligation to sell specified foreign currencies in the future at a currently negotiated forward rate
in order to decrease exposure to

foreign exchange rate risk associated with foreign currency denominated securities held by the Fund. 
During the reporting period, the Fund had daily average contract amounts on forward contracts to buy and sell of $21,843,524 and $38,821,901,
respectively.  Additional associated risk to the Fund includes counterparty credit risk. Counterparty credit risk arises from the possibility that
the counterparty to a forward contract will default and fail to perform its obligations to the Fund.  Counterparty Credit Risk. Derivative positions are
subject to the risk that the counterparty will not fulfill its obligation to the Fund. The Fund intends to enter into derivative transactions with counterparties that the Manager believes to be creditworthy at the time of the transaction. 
The Funds risk of loss from counterparty credit risk on OTC derivatives is generally limited to the aggregate unrealized gain netted against any
collateral held by the Fund. For OTC options purchased, the Fund bears the risk of loss of the amount of the premiums paid plus the positive change in market values net of any collateral held by the Fund should the counterparty fail to perform under
the contracts. Options written by the Fund do not typically give rise to counterparty credit risk, as options written generally obligate the Fund and not the counterparty to perform. 
To reduce counterparty risk with respect to OTC transactions, the Fund has entered into master netting arrangements, established within the Funds
International Swap and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master agreements, which allow the Fund to make (or to have an entitlement to receive) a single net payment in the event of default (close-out netting) for outstanding payables
and receivables with respect to certain OTC positions in swaps, options, swaptions, and forward currency exchange contracts for each individual counterparty. In addition, the Fund may require that certain counterparties post cash and/or securities
in collateral accounts to cover their net payment obligations for those derivative contracts subject to ISDA master agreements. If the counterparty fails to perform under these contracts and agreements, the cash and/or securities will be made
available to the Fund.  ISDA master agreements include credit related contingent features which allow counterparties to OTC derivatives to terminate
derivative contracts prior to maturity in the event that, for example, the Funds net assets decline by a stated percentage or the Fund fails to meet the terms of its ISDA master agreements, which would cause the Fund to accelerate payment of
any net liability owed to the counterparty.  For financial reporting purposes, the Fund does not offset derivative assets and derivative liabilities
that are subject to netting arrangements in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Bankruptcy or insolvency laws of a particular jurisdiction may impose restrictions on or prohibitions against the right of offset in bankruptcy, insolvency or other
events.  The Funds risk of loss from counterparty credit risk on exchange-traded derivatives cleared through a clearinghouse and for centrally
cleared swaps is generally considered lower than as compared to OTC derivatives. However, counterparty credit risk exists with respect to initial and variation margin deposited/paid by the Fund that is held in futures commission merchant,

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Continued

  

6. Use of Derivatives (Continued)  
broker and/or clearinghouse accounts for such exchange-traded derivatives and for centrally cleared swaps. 
With respect to centrally cleared swaps, such transactions will be submitted for clearing, and if cleared, will be held in accounts at futures commission
merchants or brokers that are members of clearinghouses. While brokers, futures commission merchants and clearinghouses are required to segregate customer margin from their own assets, in the event that a broker, futures commission merchant or
clearinghouse becomes insolvent or goes into bankruptcy and at that time there is a shortfall in the aggregate amount of margin held by the broker, futures commission merchant or clearinghouse for all its customers, U.S. bankruptcy laws will
typically allocate that shortfall on a pro-rata basis across all the brokers, futures commission merchants or clearinghouses customers, potentially resulting in losses to the Fund. 
There is the risk that a broker, futures commission merchant or clearinghouse will decline to clear a transaction on the Funds behalf, and the Fund
may be required to pay a termination fee to the executing broker with whom the Fund initially enters into the transaction. Clearinghouses may also be permitted to terminate centrally cleared swaps at any time. The Fund is also subject to the risk
that the broker or futures commission merchant will improperly use the Funds assets deposited/paid as initial or variation margin to satisfy payment obligations of another customer. In the event of a default by another customer of the broker
or futures commission merchant, the Fund might not receive its variation margin payments from the clearinghouse, due to the manner in which variation margin payments are aggregated for all customers of the broker/futures commission merchant. 
Collateral and margin requirements differ by type of derivative. Margin requirements are established by the broker, futures commission merchant or
clearinghouse for exchange-traded and cleared derivatives, including centrally cleared swaps. Brokers, futures commission merchants and clearinghouses can ask for margin in excess of the regulatory minimum, or increase the margin amount, in certain
circumstances.  Collateral terms are contract specific for OTC derivatives. For derivatives traded under an ISDA master agreement, the collateral
requirements are typically calculated by netting the mark to market amount for each transaction under such agreement and comparing that amount to the value of any collateral currently pledged by the Fund or the counterparty. 
For financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Fund, if any, is reported separately on the Statement
of Assets and Liabilities as cash pledged as collateral. Non-cash collateral pledged by the Fund, if any, is noted in the Statement of Investments. Generally, the amount of collateral due from or to a party must exceed a minimum transfer amount
threshold (e.g. $250,000) before a transfer has to be made. To the extent amounts due to the Fund from its counterparties are not fully collateralized, contractually or otherwise, the Fund bears the risk of loss from counterparty nonperformance.
 The following table presents by counterparty the Funds OTC derivative assets net of the related collateral pledged by the Fund at period end.

9. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates  Management Fees. Under
the investment advisory agreement, the Fund pays the Manager a management fee based on the daily net assets of the Fund at an annual rate of 0.85%.  Sub-Adviser
Fees. The Manager has retained the Sub-Adviser to provide the day-to-day portfolio management of the Fund. Under the Sub-Advisory Agreement, the Manager pays the Sub-Adviser an annual fee in monthly installments, equal to a percentage of the
investment management fee collected by the Manager from the Fund, which shall be calculated after any investment management fee waivers. The fee paid to the Sub-Adviser is paid by the Manager, not by the Fund. 
Transfer Agent Fees. OFI Global (the Transfer Agent) serves as the transfer and shareholder servicing agent for the Fund. The Fund pays the Transfer
Agent a fee based on annual net assets. Fees incurred and average net assets with respect to these services are detailed in the Statement of Operations and Financial Highlights, respectively. 
Sub-Transfer Agent Fees. The Transfer Agent has retained Shareholder Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of OFI (the Sub-Transfer Agent), to
provide the day-to-day transfer

9. Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates (Continued)  
agent and shareholder servicing of the Fund. Under the Sub-Transfer Agency Agreement, the Transfer Agent pays the
Sub-Transfer Agent an annual fee in monthly installments, equal to a percentage of the transfer agent fee collected by the Transfer Agent from the Fund, which shall be calculated after any applicable fee waivers. The fee paid to the Sub-Transfer
Agent is paid by the Transfer Agent, not by the Fund.  Directors Compensation. The Funds Board of Directors (Board) has adopted a
compensation deferral plan for Independent Directors that enables Directors to elect to defer receipt of all or a portion of the annual compensation they are entitled to receive from the Fund. For purposes of determining the amount owed to the
Directors under the plan, deferred amounts are treated as though equal dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the Fund or in other Oppenheimer funds selected by the Directors. The Fund purchases shares of the funds selected for deferral by
the Directors in amounts equal to his or her deemed investment, resulting in a Fund asset equal to the deferred compensation liability. Such assets are included as a component of Other within the asset section of the Statement of Assets
and Liabilities. Deferral of Directors fees under the plan will not affect the net assets of the Fund and will not materially affect the Funds assets, liabilities or net investment income per share. Amounts will be deferred until
distributed in accordance with the compensation deferral plan.  Waivers and Reimbursements of Expenses. The Manager has contractually agreed to waive a
portion of the Funds advisory fee so that the effective advisory fee rate for the Fund will not exceed the combined effective advisory fee and administrative fee rates of Oppenheimer International Value Fund measured as of the last business
day of the prior month. During the reporting period, the Manager waived $261,724  The Manager will waive fees and/or reimburse Fund expenses in an
amount equal to the indirect management fees incurred through the Funds investment in IMMF. During the reporting period, the Manager waived fees and/or reimbursed the Fund $49,709 for IMMF management fees. 
Waivers and/or reimbursements may be modified or terminated as set forth according to the terms in the prospectus. 
   
10. Pending Litigation  In 2009, several putative class action lawsuits were
filed and later consolidated before the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado against OppenheimerFunds, Inc. (OFI), OppenheimerFunds Distributor, Inc. (OFDI), and Oppenheimer Rochester California Municipal Fund, a
fund advised by OFI Global Asset Management, Inc. and distributed by the Distributor (the California Fund), in connection with the California Funds investment performance. The plaintiffs asserted claims against OFI, OFDI and
certain present and former trustees and officers of the California Fund under the federal securities laws, alleging, among other things, that the disclosure documents of the California Fund contained misrepresentations and omissions and the
investment policies of the California Fund were

10. Pending Litigation (Continued)  
not followed. Plaintiffs in the suit filed an amended complaint and defendants filed a motion to dismiss. In 2011, the
court issued an order which granted in part and denied in part the defendants motion to dismiss. In 2012, plaintiffs filed a motion, which defendants opposed, to certify a class and appoint class representatives and class counsel. In March
2015, the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. In May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit vacated the class certification order and remanded the matter to the district court for further proceedings. In
October 2015, the district court reaffirmed its order and determined that the suit will proceed as a class action. In December 2015, the Tenth Circuit denied defendants petition to appeal the district courts reaffirmed class
certification order.  OFI and OFDI believe the suit is without merit; that it is premature to render any opinion as to the likelihood of an outcome
unfavorable to them in the suit; and that no estimate can yet be made as to the amount or range of any potential loss. Furthermore, OFI believes that the suit should not impair the ability of OFI or OFDI to perform their respective duties to the
Fund and that the outcome of the suit should not have any material effect on the operations of any of the Oppenheimer funds.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
   
The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Oppenheimer Master International Value Fund, LLC: 
We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of Oppenheimer Master International Value Fund, LLC, including the statement of investments, as of
April 29, 2016, and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years in the
five-year period then ended. These financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the Funds management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.  We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of April 29, 2016, by correspondence with the custodian, transfer agent and brokers, or by other appropriate auditing procedures
where replies from brokers were not received. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  In our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Oppenheimer Master International Value Fund, LLC as of April 29, 2016, the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

This is to inform you about OppenheimerFunds householding policy. If more than one member of your household maintains an account in a particular fund,
OppenheimerFunds will mail only one copy of the funds prospectus (or, if available, the funds summary prospectus), annual and semiannual report and privacy policy. The consolidation of these mailings, called householding, benefits your
fund through reduced mailing expense, and benefits you by reducing the volume of mail you receive from OppenheimerFunds. Householding does not affect the delivery of your account statements. 
Please note that we will continue to household these mailings for as long as you remain an OppenheimerFunds shareholder, unless you request otherwise. If
you prefer to receive multiple copies of these materials, please call us at 1.800.CALL-OPP (225-5677). You may also notify us in writing or via email. We will begin sending you individual copies of the prospectus (or, if available, the

1. 
Special Risks: Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Diversification does not guarantee profit or protect against loss.




2. 
As of 4/12/13, the purchase and exchange of Fund shares is restricted, subject to certain exceptions.  Please see the prospectus for further information.

Special Risks:  Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks. Emerging and developing market investments may be especially volatile. Eurozone investments may be subject to volatility and liquidity issues.  Investments in securities of growth companies may be volatile.  Mid-sized company stock is typically more volatile than that of larger company stock.  It may take a substantial period of time to realize a gain on an investment in a mid-sized company, if any gain is realized at all. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk.



4. 
Special Risks: Investing in MLPs involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock, including risks related to cash flow, dilution and voting rights. The Fund’s investments are concentrated in the energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by MLPs, which may increase volatility. Energy infrastructure companies are subject to risks specific to the industry such as fluctuations in commodity prices, reduced volumes of natural gas or other energy commodities, environmental hazards, changes in the macroeconomic or the regulatory environment or extreme weather. MLPs may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling. Additional management fees and other expenses are associated with investing in MLP funds.

The Fund is subject to certain MLP tax risks. An investment in the Fund does not offer the same tax benefits of a direct investment in an MLP. The Fund is organized as a Subchapter “C” Corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local income taxes. The potential tax benefit of investing in MLPs depend on them being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation, its income would be subject to federal taxation at the entity level, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution which could result in a reduction of the fund’s value. MLP funds accrue deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of MLP distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investments. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result a MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer.

To the extent that a Fund obtains leverage through borrowings, there will be the potential for greater gains and the risk of magnified losses.


6. 
Special Risks: Senior loans are typically lower-rated and may be illiquid investments (which may not have a ready market).  The Fund may invest without limit in below-investment-grade securities.  The Fund may invest a variable amount in debt rated below "B." May invest 25% or more of its assets in securities issued by companies in the financial services sector which may be susceptible to economic and regulatory events, and increased volatility.   Foreign investments may be volatile and involve additional expenses and special risks, including currency fluctuations, foreign taxes, regulatory and geopolitical risks.  Fixed income investing entails credit and interest rate risks. When interest rates rise, bond prices generally fall, and the Fund’s share prices can fall. Derivative instruments entail higher volatility and risk of loss compared to traditional stock or bond investments. Leverage (borrowing) involves transaction and interest costs on amounts borrowed, which may reduce performance.


7. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


8. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. There is no guarantee that the issuers of stocks will declare dividends in the future, or that dividends will remain at their current levels or increase over time. The Fund is classified as a “non-diversified” fund and may invest a greater portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer. Investing significantly in a particular region, industry, sector or issuer may increase volatility and risk. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.


9. 
This is a new fund with a limited history and an inception date of 10/28/16.


10. 
Special Risks: An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk, including the possible loss of principal amount invested. The stocks of companies with favorable ESG practices may underperform the stock market as a whole. Fund returns may not match the return of its respective index, known as non-correlation risk, due to operating expenses incurred by the Fund. The alternate weighting approach employed by the Fund (i.e., using revenues as a weighting measure), while designed to enhance potential returns, may not produce the desired results. Because the Fund is rebalanced quarterly, portfolio turnover may exceed 100%. The greater the portfolio turnover, the greater the transaction costs, which could have an adverse effect on Fund performance.

Morningstar Ratings1


as of 06/30/2017



Overall





3 Year





5 Year





10 Year







				Morningstar rated the Value Fund among 
1091,
1091,
936
and 
681
Large Value
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 06/30/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison

							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

T. Rowe Price mutual funds are subject to ongoing management fees and may be subject to redemption fees. An IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. See prospectus for details.

The mutual funds referred to in this website are offered and sold only to persons residing in the United States and are offered by prospectus only. The prospectuses include investment objectives, risks, fees, expenses, and other information that you should read and consider carefully before investing.
Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 6/30/17, 72 of 108 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.
