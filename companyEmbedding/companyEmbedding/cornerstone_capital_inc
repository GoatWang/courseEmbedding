Our History










Petersen, Flynn & Dinsmore, Inc. was established in 1978 to fill the need for a client-focused, professional investment management firm where individual clients were not lost in the shuffle.

In 2015, we changed our name to Cornerstone Capital, Inc. to better reflect the firm's current structure.  A Cornerstone has long been the symbol of a solid foundation.  We have chosen this name as we believe it accurately conveys our intent to provide clients with a sound, fundamental base for their financial future in an environment that emphasizes close, service-oriented relationships. Each client at Cornerstone Capital has a custom-built portfolio based upon their specific goals and objectives.

With the name change our ownership structure remains the same - Brad Dinsmore, Mason Ford and Brad Branson are each one-third owners of the firm.

Exploring World Class Mineral Districts. Cornerstone Capital Resources Inc. has a strong and dedicated technical team who are focused on generating and advancing new projects that have great potential for discovery. Cornerstone leverages its own exploration funding through joint venture and strategic partnerships, providing shareholders with potential for success at lower risk. Cornerstone has a diversified portfolio of gold, silver and copper projects in Ecuador and Chile.

"We have re-focused Cornerstone exclusively on our Ecuadorean and Chilean projects, which we believe have the potential to deliver superior returns to our shareholders. In 2014 the Government of Ecuador retained international consultant Wood MacKenzie to advise it on how to make Ecuador a more competitive destination for mining investment, and since that time the government has significantly reduced the tax burden on mining projects. The potential geological endowment of Ecuador remains unknown due to under exploration but may be unparalleled."Brooke Macdonald, President & CEO.

Glossary






Biodiesel: The biofuel substitute for diesel. It derives from oilseed based crops – mainly oilseed rape (OSR) in the UK, and palm oil in South East Asia.
Bioethanol: The biofuel substitute for petrol (gasoline). It derives from cereal based crops – mainly wheat in the UK, and maize (corn), soya beans and sugarcane in the US and South America.
Biofiltration: A pollution control technique using living material to capture and biologically degrade process pollutants. Common uses include processing waste water, capturing harmful chemicals or silt from surface runoff, and microbiotic oxidation of contaminants in air.
Biofuels : Fuels derived from renewable raw materials, such as bark, black liquor or logging residuals.
Biogas: The biofuel substitute for natural gas. It derives from organic waste materials including animal waste and waste generated from municipal, commercial and industrial sources through the process of anaerobic digestion. Biogas is a ‘second generation fuel’, i.e. it is derived from non-food sources.
Biomass Energy: A renewable energy source, is biological material from living, or recently living organisms, such as wood, waste, (hydrogen) gas, and alcohol fuels. Biomass is commonly plant matter grown to generate electricity or produce heat. In this sense, living biomass can also be included, as plants can also generate electricity while still alive. The most conventional way biomass is used however, still relies on direct incineration.
Blended Value: Blended value represents a broader way of thinking about the nature of value creation by organizations, whether for-profit, nonprofit or hybrid, and through the application of capital. Emerson coined the “blended value” term to transcend the previously bifurcated definitions of value as either economic or social/environmental so that the focus could shift to maximizing companies, communities and capital.
Building Automation : Describes the functionality provided by the control system of a building. A building automation system (BAS) is an example of a distributed control system. The control system is a computerized, intelligent network of electronic devices, designed to monitor and control the mechanical and lighting systems in a building. BAS core functionality keeps the building climate within a specified range, provides lighting based on an occupancy schedule, and monitors system performance and device failures and provides email and/or text notifications to building engineering staff. The BAS functionality reduces building energy and maintenance costs when compared to a non-controlled building. Buildings with these systems are sometimes called “Smart Buildings.”
Building Deconstruction: The selective dismantlement of building components, specifically for re-use, recycling, and waste management. It differs from demolition where a site is cleared of its building by the most expedient means. Deconstruction has also been defined as “construction in reverse.”
Building Information Modeling (BIM): The process of generating and managing building data during its life cycle. Typically it uses three-dimensional, real-time, dynamic building modeling software to increase productivity in building design and construction. The process produces the Building Information Model (also abbreviated BIM), which encompasses building geometry, spatial relationships, geographic information, and quantities and properties of building components.
Cap and Trade: A cap being placed on the total amount of allowable emissions, the distribution of this total between polluters, and the creation of a marketplace where owners of the permits can trade with each other.
Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): The process of capturing carbon that is emitted from energy production and diverting it into ground storage areas, to reduce the amount of CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.
Carbon Credits: A generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one ton of carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e). They represent a component of national and international attempts to mitigate the growth in concentrations of greenhouse gases.
Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO2e): The internationally recognised way of expressing the amount of global warming of a particular greenhouse gas in terms of the amount of CO2 required to achieve the same warming effect over 100 years.
Carbon Footprint: The total emissions of greenhouse gases (in carbon equivalents) from whichever source is being measured – be it at an individual, organisation or product level.
Carbon Labeling: Used to measure for the consumers the amount of embedded carbon there is in the product.
Carbon Neutral: Through carbon offsetting organisation to individual are counterbalancing the emissions they produce to make themselves carbon neutral.
Carbon Offsetting: The process of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by purchasing credits from others through emissions reductions projects, or carbon trading schemes. The term often refers to voluntary acts, arranged by a commercial carbon offset provider.
Carbon Sink: An absorber of carbon dioxide; oceans and forests are natural carbon sinks.
Ceres: A non-profit organization advocating for sustainability leadership. Ceres mobilizes a powerful network of investors, companies and public interest groups to accelerate and expand the adoption of sustainable business practices and solutions to build a healthy global economy with a mission to mobilize investor and business leadership to build a thriving, sustainable global economy.
CERFLOR: Sistema Brazileiro de Certificacão Florestal – a Brazilian forest certification system endorsed by PEFC.
CGI: The Clinton Global Initiative – The mission of the CGI is to turn ideas into action.

Clean Development Mechanism (CDM): UN regulated mechanism that allows countries with an emission-reduction or emission-limitation commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to implement an emission-reduction project in developing countries.
Clean Diesel: Also known as ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD),  is a term used to describe a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents. As of 2006, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in Europe and North America is of a ULSD type.
Climate Adaptation Planning: The development of strategies that attempt to reduce a community’s vulnerability to climate change. Adaptation planning differs from climate-change mitigation planning in that it does not attempt to reduce or avoid climate change. Instead, it assumes that climate change is unavoidable and attempts to develop a plan for dealing with the expected local consequences. (See Resilience.)
Combined Heat and Power (CHP): Using the waste heat which is a by-product of energy production to heat space.
Community Choice Aggregation or CCA: A system adopted into law in the states of Massachusetts, Ohio, California, New Jersey and Rhode Island, among others, which allows cities and counties to aggregate the buying power of individual customers within a defined jurisdiction in order to secure alternative energy supply contracts. Currently, nearly one million Americans receive service from CCAs.
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): A form of corporate self-regulation that is integrated into the business model and takes into account not only shareholders but also stakeholders such as employees and customers. CSR efforts often include the entire value chain, including suppliers, buyers The term “corporate social responsibility” came into common use in the late 1960s and early 1970s after many multinational corporations formed the term to describe any group that is impacted by a company’s activities. Annual CSR reports are now published, using a framework such as GRI to increase awareness and transparency around CSR and sustainability progress.and the communities in which the company operates, when addressing issues of social and environmental impact.

Detention Basin: A stormwater management facility installed on, or adjacent to, tributaries of rivers, streams, lakes or bays that is designed to protect against flooding and, in some cases, downstream erosion by storing water for a limited period of a time. These basins are also called “dry ponds,” “holding ponds” or “dry detention basins” if no permanent pool of water exists. A detention basin differs from a retention basin, which includes a permanent pool of water in its design.
Double Bottom Line: A business term used in socially responsible enterprise and investment to refer to both the conventional bottom line, a measure of fiscal performance, and the second bottom line, a measure of positive social impact.
Eco-Footprint: Measures how much area of natural resources human population requires to produce the products it consumes and to absorb its wastes under prevailing

Green Infrastructure: A concept originating in the United States in the mid-1990s that highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about land use planning. In particular there is an emphasis on the “life support” functions provided by a network of natural ecosystems, with an emphasis on interconnectivity to support long-term sustainability. Examples include clean water and healthy soils, as well as the more anthropocentric functions such as recreation and providing shade and shelter in and around towns and cities.
Green Roofs: Roofs that are partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. They may also include additional layers such as root barriers and drainage and irrigation systems.
Greenhouse Gas Inventories: A type of emission inventory that are developed for a variety of reasons. Scientists use inventories of natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) emissions as tools when developing atmospheric models. Policy makers use inventories to develop strategies and policies for emissions reductions and to track the progress of those policies. And, regulatory agencies and corporations rely on inventories to establish compliance records with allowable emission rates. Businesses, the public, and other interest groups use inventories to better understand the sources and trends in emissions.
Greenhouse Gases: A collective term for following gases: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).

OHSAS 18001: A global standard created for occupational health and safety management by the International Organization for Standardization.
Power Purchase Agreements (PPA): Contracts between two parties, one who generates electricity for the purpose of sale and one who is looking to purchase electricity. PPAs are commonly used in public/private partnerships to help finance renewable energy projects. The private developer takes advantage of tax credits and other financial incentives to develop the infrastructure to generate power, while the public partner (typically a municipality) agrees to purchase the power from the developer at a given price for a certain number of years. The PPA helps the developer secure financing for the project by demonstrating to the lender that the generated power will be purchased at a predetermined rate.

SFI: Sustainable Forestry Initiative® program – a North American forest certification programme endorsed by PEFC.
Smart Grid: A smart grid delivers electricity from suppliers to consumers using digital technology with two-way communications to control appliances at consumers’ homes to save energy, reduce cost and increase reliability and transparency. It overlays the electricity distribution grid with an information and net metering system. Such a modernized electricity network is being promoted by many governments as a way of addressing energy independence, global warming and emergency resilience issues. Smart meters may be part of a smart grid, but alone do not constitute a smart grid.
Smart Meter: A smart meter, according to regulatory authorities, is an advanced meter (usually an electrical meter) that records consumption in intervals of an hour or less and communicates that information at least daily via some communications network back to the utility for monitoring and billing purposes (telemetering). Smart meters enable two-way communication between the meter and the central system.
Social Return on Investment (SROI): The SROI concept, essentially a cost-benefit analysis, is used by charities, donors and nonprofit organizations to rate the results of their endeavors with firm evidence of impact and created value. The idea of social return on investment was pioneered in the 1990s by a U.S. venture fund called REDF and has since caught on.
Socially Responsible Investing (SRI): Also known as sustainable, socially conscious, “green” or ethical investing, this term defines any investment strategy seeking both financial return and social good. In its broadest usage, SRI refers to proactive practices such as impact investing, shareholder advocacy and community investing. Socially responsible investments encourage corporate practices that promote environmental stewardship, consumer protection, human rights and diversity. They can also represent the avoidance of investing in industries or products that can be socially harmful, including alcohol, tobacco, gambling, pornography, weapons and/or the military. The term dates back to the Quakers, who in 1758, prohibited members from participating in the slave trade.
Sustainability: Generally defined as the capacity for a culture to thrive today – economically, ecologically and socially – without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same.
Sustainable Finance: The systematic integration of environmental, social, and governance factors into the investment process

The Brundtland Commission: Formally the World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED), known by the name of its Chair Gro Harlem Brundtland, was convened by the United Nations in 1983. The commission was created to address growing concern “about the accelerating deterioration of the human environment and natural resources and the consequences of that deterioration for economic and social development.” In establishing the commission, the UN General Assembly recognized that environmental problems were global in nature and determined that it was in the common interest of all nations to establish policies for sustainable development.
Triple Bottom Line (TBL): Refers to the three prongs of financial, social and environmental accountability. While businesses of the past only had to be accountable for their financial performance, today’s enterprises are increasingly pressed to demonstrate concern for three bottom lines: financial, people/communities, and the environment.
UN PRI: The United Nations-supported Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) Initiative is an international network of investors working together to put the six Principles for Responsible Investment into practice. Its goal is to understand the implications of sustainability for investors and support signatories to incorporate these issues into their investment decision making and ownership practices.
