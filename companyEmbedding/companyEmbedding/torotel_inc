	Engineering Design At Torotel















































































Search








engineering and manufacturing For Highly reliable magnetic components and assemblies




















































Engineering Design
We address the engineering needs of any component with a flexible, collaborative approach.  Since some products require significant customization, we develop solid working relationships with our client’s engineers so designs can be produced with feedback in a timely manner.  Our veteran engineering team often makes helpful adjustments to design during the process, leading to strong prototypes and exceptional production units.  This combination of experience and collaboration produces a high level of confidence that Torotel will deliver flexible, resilient components when and how you need them.
Collaborative Relationships with Clients
The majority of what we design and build are custom solutions to fit customer specific applications. Our engineers work as part of a team with our client’s engineering and supply chain teams to develop solutions that meet specification, quality and schedule requirements.
Cost Effective Design Principles/Engineering for Reliability
Design For Manufacturability (DFM), Six Sigma, and Lean Manufacturing are part of our DNA at Torotel. Our design, manufacturing and quality engineers work together from the initial concept stage to develop products that have reliable supply chain sources, fit well with our manufacturing processes, and have critical to function parameters identified. This enables us to produce products with short cycle times, high reliability and consistent continuity of supply. This all translates to lower cost of ownership for our customers.
Rapid Prototyping/Rescuing Troubled Projects
In a perfect world every project would go exactly as scheduled. Sometimes, however, extra-ordinary capabilities are needed to help get a project schedule back on track. Advantage Torotel. With our streamlined design and manufacturing approach based on lean manufacturing principles we can get prototype or production parts in your hands quickly. Our industry leading cycle time is just one of the differentiators that make Torotel your supplier of choice.

engineering and manufacturing For Highly reliable magnetic components and assemblies




















































Our Approach
It’s not what we make, it’s how we make it.
At Torotel, we make it a point to understand and react to our clients and their specific needs. Our highly-experienced engineering and sales team collaborate with clients to meet the most stringent industry standards in the fields of aerospace, defense, energy and more. But our job is only complete when our employees have not only met, but exceeded your expectations in every aspect of production.
We work with each client from initial design through manufacturing and delivery to produce a solution that will meet the test of time. Our engineering team works in close collaboration with each client – whether creating a design, prototype or a final product – to ensure that every component you receive meets your requirements, business goals and performance expectations.
Due to our implementation of Demand Flow Technology, our delivery times are well below industry standards. Instead of the 10 to 12 weeks many of our competitors offer, we can often deliver your customized product in as little as four weeks. 
Torotel offers the highest quality products that are price competitive and delivered when you need them. Our staff is proud of what they accomplish every day and will work with you to create a customized component you will be proud to use.
