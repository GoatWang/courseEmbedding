The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

                            Walsh, Thomas P.  Docket 491                








Disposition AgreementThis Disposition Agreement ("Agreement") is entered intobetween the State Ethics Commission ("Commission") and Thomas P.Walsh ("Rep. Walsh") pursuant to s. 5 of the Commission'sEnforcement Procedures. This Agreement constitutes a consented tofinal order enforceable in the Superior Court, pursuant to G.L. c.268B, s. 4(j).On June 22, 1993, the Commission initiated, pursuant to G.L.c. 268B, s. 4(a), a preliminary inquiry into allegations that Rep.Walsh had violated the conflict of interest law, G.L. c. 268A. TheCommission has concluded its inquiry and, on January 25, 1994,voted to find reasonable cause to believe that Rep. Walsh violatedG.L. c. 268A, s. 3 and 23.The Commission and Rep. Walsh now agree to the followingfindings of fact and conclusions of law:1. Rep. Walsh has served in the state legislature fromJanuary 1987 to the present. During that time, Rep. Walsh hasserved on various committees, including the Joint Committee onInsurance where he has served as vice chairman since 1992.2. Rep. Walsh has sponsored several bills affecting theinsurance industry.3. In addition, Rep. Walsh, as a member of variouscommittees, has participated in many hearings on bills of interestto the insurance industry. Such participation has included votingon whether such bills should be reported out of committee. Rep.Walsh also has voted on bills of interest to the insurance industrywhen they reached the House floor.4. During the period here relevant, F. William Sawyer("Sawyer") was the senior John Hancock Mutual Life InsuranceCompany, Inc. ("Hancock") lobbyist responsible for Massachusettslegislation. During the period here relevant, Ralph Scott("Scott") was a Hancock lobbyist. Hancock, a Massachusettscorporation, is the nation's sixth largest life insurer doingbusiness in all 50 states. Hancock offers an array of life, healthand investment products. As a Massachusetts domiciled lifeinsurer, Hancock's activities are more comprehensively regulated byMassachusetts than by any other state. At all relevant times,Sawyer and Scott were registered legislative agents (for Hancock)in Massachusetts.5. During the period here relevant, Andrew Hunt ("Hunt") wasa registered legislative agent for the Massachusetts MedicalSociety.6. During the period here relevant, William Carroll("Carroll") was a registered legislative agent for the LifeInsurance Association of Massachusetts ("LIAM"). LIAM is a tradeassociation of life insurance companies doing business inMassachusetts.7. At all relevant times, Rep. Walsh knew that Sawyer andScott were lobbyists for Hancock. Rep. Walsh also knew that Huntwas a lobbyist for the Massachusetts Medical Society and thatCarroll was a lobbyist for LIAM. On occasion, these individualslobbied Rep. Walsh regarding various pieces of legislation.8. Lobbyists are employed to promote, oppose or influencelegislation.9. One way in which some lobbyists further their legislativegoals is to develop or maintain goodwill and personal relationshipswith legislators to ensure effective access to them. Somelobbyists entertain legislators through meals, drinks, golf andsporting events in order to develop the desired goodwill andpersonal relationships.10. Sometime in 1989, Scott provided Rep. Walsh and a guestof the representative with dinner and admission to Hancock'sprivate box at the Boston Garden to watch a Bruins game. Admissionto Hancock's box was alone valued at $128 for Rep. Walsh and hisguest. The cost of the dinner is not known.[1]11. In January 1990, Sawyer provided Rep. Walsh and his wifewith dinner and admission to Hancock's private box at the BostonGarden to watch a Celtics game. Admission to Hancock's box wasalone valued at $141 for Rep. Walsh and his wife. The cost ofthe dinner is not known.[2]12. In November 1991, Sawyer provided Rep. Walsh with twoHancock tickets to a Harry Connick, Jr. concert at the Wang Center.These two tickets were worth $68[3].13. In December 1992, Sawyer provided Rep. Walsh with twoHancock tickets for the Nutcracker at the Wang Center. These twotickets were worth $92.[4]Page 67014. Between March 10, 1993 and March 15, 1993, Rep. Walsh andhis spouse stayed at the Plantation Resort at Amelia Island,Florida, where he attended an educational conference sponsored bythe Conference of Insurance Legislators which ran from March 11thto March 14th. Rep. Walsh stayed at the Plantation Resort with anumber of other legislators and Massachusetts lobbyists.On the evening of March 11, 1993, Rep. Walsh and his wife atedinner at the Plantation Resort with Sawyer and a group ofMassachusetts legislators. Sawyer paid for the dinner. TheWalshes' pro rata share of the cost of the dinner was $104.On the evening of March 12, 1993, Rep. Walsh and his wife atedinner at the Ritz Carlton with a group of Massachusettslegislators and lobbyists. Rep. Walsh did not pay for his or hiswife's meal. Rep. Walsh testified that, although he knew thatseveral Massachusetts lobbyists were at the meal, he did not knowwho paid for the meal. Carroll, the lobbyist representing LIAM,paid for this dinner.[5] The total cost of the dinner wasapproximately $3,000. The Walshes' pro rata share of the cost ofthe dinner was approximately $150.While at Amelia Island, Rep. Walsh golfed twice. On March 11,1993, Rep. Walsh golfed with Sawyer and two other Massachusettslegislators. Rep. Walsh's golf fees were paid for by Sawyer at acost of $80. On March 15, 1993, Rep. Walsh golfed with Hunt andtwo other Massachusetts legislators. Rep. Walsh's golf fees werepaid for by Hunt at a cost of $80.15. Section 3(b) of G.L. c. 268A prohibits a state employeefrom directly or indirectly receiving anything of substantial valuefor or because of any official act or act within his officialresponsibility performed or to be performed by him.16. Massachusetts legislators are state employees.17. Anything worth $50 or more is of substantial value fors. 3 purposes.[6]18. By accepting a total of approximately $693 in drinks,meals, golf and theater entertainment from Sawyer, Scott andHunt[7], all while Rep. Walsh was in a position to take officialactions which could benefit those legislative agents and/or theirprincipals, Rep. Walsh accepted items of substantial value for orbecause of official acts or acts within his official responsibilityperformed or to be performed by him. In doing so, Rep. Walshviolated s. 3(b).[8]19. As the facts above indicate, Rep. Walsh received, inaddition to the $693 in gratuities from Sawyer, Scott and Hunt, atotal of $150 in gratuities of $50 or more, where he did not knowthe specific identity of the source of the gratuities.[9]20. Section 23(b)(3) prohibits a public employee fromknowingly or with reason to know acting in a manner which wouldcause a reasonable person knowing all of the circumstances toconclude that anyone can improperly influence or unduly enjoy hisfavor in the performance of his official duties.21. By accepting gratuities of $50 or more in value where hedid not know the specific identity of the donor, but had reason toknow that the donors were Massachusetts lobbyists, Rep. Walsh actedin a manner which would cause a reasonable person knowing all thesefacts to conclude that the lobbyists present could improperlyinfluence him in the performance of his official duties.[10] Inother words, Rep. Walsh knew or had reason to know that his actionswould create an appearance of favoritism. In so doing, Rep. Walshviolated s. 23(b)(3).[11]22. The Commission is aware of no evidence that thegratuities referenced above were provided to Rep. Walsh with theintent to influence any specific act by him as a legislator or anyparticular act within his official responsibility. Also, theCommission is aware of no evidence that Rep. Walsh took anyofficial action concerning any proposed legislation which wouldaffect any of the registered Massachusetts lobbyists in return forthe gratuities. However, even though the gratuities were onlyintended to foster official goodwill and access, they were stillimpermissible.[12]23. Rep. Walsh cooperated with the Commission'sinvestigation.In view of the foregoing violations of G.L. c. 268A by Rep.Walsh, the Commission has determined that the public interest wouldbe served by the disposition of this matter without furtherenforcement proceedings, on the basis of the following terms andconditions agreed to by Rep. Walsh:(1) that Rep. Walsh pay to the Commission the sum of twothousand, five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for violatingG.L. c. 268A, s.3(b) and s.23(b)(3);[13] and(2) that Rep. Walsh waive all rights to contest thefindings of fact, conclusions of law, and terms andconditions contained in thisPage 671agreement in this or any related administrative orjudicial proceedings to which the Commission is or may bea party.DATE ISSUED:  May 12, 1994---------------[1] This dinner is not identified in Scott's records. Rep. Walshvoluntarily disclosed the dinner in his testimony before theCommission. He had no recollection as to its cost, but believed itdid not equal or exceed $50.[2] This dinner is not identified in Sawyer's records. Rep. Walshvoluntarily disclosed the dinner in his testimony before theCommission. He had no recollection as to its cost, but believed itdid not equal or exceed $50.[3] Rep. Walsh testified that Sawyer informed him that the ticketswere provided to Hancock free-of-charge in return for Hancock'ssupport of the Wang Center's restoration and that, thus, Rep. Walshbelieved that the value of the tickets was zero. Because Sawyerhas refused to testify in this matter, the Commission has beenunable to confirm Rep. Walsh's testimony on this point. However,regardless of whether Hancock paid for the tickets and regardlessof what Sawyer may have told Rep. Walsh, the value of the ticketsfor G.L. c. 268A purposes was the price at which such tickets wereavailable for purchase by the general public.[4] See footnote 3.[5] The Commission has evidence Carroll subsequently receivedcontributions of $500 and $600 from two of the Massachusettslobbyists who were at this meal.[6] See Commonwealth v. Famigletti, 4 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 587(1976); EC-COI-93-14.[7] $128, Scott, 1989; $141, Sawyer, 1990; $68, Sawyer, 1991; $92,Sawyer, 1992; $184, Sawyer, 1993; and $80, Hunt, 1993.[8] For s. 3 purposes, it is unnecessary to prove that thegratuities given were generated by some specific identifiable actperformed or to be performed. As the Commission explained inAdvisory No. 8, issued May 14, 1985, prohibiting private partiesfrom giving free tickets worth $50 or more to public employees whoregulate them,Even in the absence of any specifically identifiablematter that was, is or soon will be pending before theofficial, s. 3 may apply. Thus, where there is no priorsocial or business relationship between the giver and therecipient, and the recipient is a public official who isin a position to use [his] authority in a manner whichcould affect the giver, an inference can be drawn thatthe giver was seeking the goodwill of the officialbecause of a perception by the giver that the publicofficial's influence could benefit the giver. In such acase, the gratuity is given for his yet unidentifiable"acts to be performed."Specifically, s. 3 applies to generalized goodwill-engenderingentertainment of legislators by private parties, even where nospecific legislation is discussed. In re Flaherty, 1991 SEC 498,issued December 10, 1990 (majority leader violates s.3 by acceptingsix Celtics tickets from billboard company's lobbyists). In reMassachusetts Candy and Tobacco Distributors, Inc., 1992 SEC 609(company representing distributors violates s.3 by providing a freeday's outing [a barbecue lunch, golf or tennis, a cocktail hour anda clam bake dinner], worth over $100 per person, to over 50legislators, their staffers and family members, with the intent ofenhancing the distributors' image with the Legislature and wherethe legislators were in a position to benefit the distributors).Section 3 applies to meals and golf, including those occasionsmotivated by business reasons, for example, the so-called "businesslunch". In re U.S. Trust, 1988 SEC 356. Finally, s.3 applies toentertainment gratuities of $50 or more even in connection witheducational conferences. In re Stone & Webster, 1991 SEC 522, andIn re State Street Bank, 1992 SEC 582.Rep. Walsh has argued that s. 3 does not apply to meals givento legislators. There is nothing in the legislative historyregarding s. 3 or the language of s. 3 to support that argument. Inthe Commission's view, s. 3 applies to any form of entertainment,including meals, given to any public official.On the present facts, s. 3 applies to the lobbyistsentertaining Rep. Walsh where the intent was generally to creategoodwill and the opportunity for access, even though specificlegislation was not discussed.[9] The Walshes' $150 share of the March 12, 1993 dinner paid forby Carroll.[10] Moreover, no matter how carefully this matter is investigated,the possibility can never be eliminated that Rep. Walsh would laterbe told of the specific sources of the various gratuities describedabove. This only adds to the appearance concern created by suchconduct.[11] This conduct also raises issues under s.3, discussed above.Nothing in s.3 requires that the public official know the source ofthe gift. All that is required is that the public official knowthat he is receiving the gift for or because of his position. Onthe foregoing facts, that could be inferred even though Rep. Walshdid not know the specific identity of the donor. In any event,because this is a matter of first impression, the Commission hasdecided to resolve this conduct pursuant to s. 23.[12] As discussed above in footnote 8, s. 3 of G.L. c. 268A isviolated even where there is no evidence of an understanding thatthe gratuity is being given in exchange for a specific actperformed or to be performed. Indeed, and such quid pro quounderstanding would raise extremely serious concerns under thebribery section of the conflict of interest of law, G.L. c. 268A,s. 2. Section 2 is not applicable in this case, however, as therewas no such quid pro quo between the lobbyists and Rep. Walsh.Page 672[13] This amount is approximately three times the value of the $843in prohibited gratuities received by Rep. Walsh in violation of s. 3and s. 23(b)(3). It represents both a disgorgement of the gratuitiesand a civil sanction.Page 673

Product Description▼▲
When the glass house Sheila lived in for many years came crashing to the ground, she began a new life outside the safety of those walls. No...it did not feel good or safe, but it did feel true. In twelve stirring, insightful, and revealing chapters, Sheila Walsh shows how personal brokenness can open doors of intimacy with Jesus Christ that might not ever open in any other way. Includes a free, in-depth Bible study for individuals and small groups.

Publisher's Description▼▲
 The other side of brokenness "If I could write only one book in my  lifetime, I would ask God to make it this one, the very book you now hold in your hands. . . ."?Sheila Walsh God loves broken people. And when weary, wounded men and women find a way to open their bruised hearts and somehow welcome Him into their personal darkness, they will find a love beyond anything they have ever known. When the glass house Sheila had lived in for so many years came crashing to the ground, she began a new life outside the safety of those walls. No, it didn't feel good, nor safe?not at all. But it felt true. Sheila saw herself as a broken lamb limping after the Shepherd, not knowing where He was going, but knowing that wherever He went, she wanted to go with Him. In twelve stirring, insightful, and deeply revealing chapters, Sheila Walsh shows how personal brokenness can open doors of intimacy with Jesus Christ that might never open in any other way. It's not that God loves broken people more than those who imagine themselves to be whole?it's simply that they know they are loved. They dare to believe it . . . and through such trust, a new wholeness emerges from yesterday's broken pieces. 


Author Bio▼▲
 Sheila Walsh, Bible teacher and speaker, is the author of the award-winning Gigi, Gods Little Princess series, God Loves Broken People, The Shelter of God's Promises, and a novel, Sweet Sanctuary. Sheila lives near Dallas, Texas with her husband, Barry, and son, Christian.

            Excellent book that shows God loves us beyond measure no matter where we are or what we have done.  Sheila can relate to anyone reading the book because of the journey her life has taken over the years.  She has helped me realize God loves us personally with a fierce love beyond what we can imagine if we only look to him as our source of life.

            This is a truly anointed book. It is especially geared for someone who "feels" their brokenness. And needs to know God loves them in the midst of it. "It's okay not to feel okay." Then, Sheila challenges us to allow God to transform our brokenness into ministry. I taught a women's ABF using this book. Many deep bonds between broken women were forged in the class.

            "God Loves Broken People" by Sheila Walsh is a book that focuses on how we can turn our own brokenness into a closer walk with God. She evens states that this is so important to her that if there was only one book that you read of hers, then is should be this one. Of all the book that Sheila wrote i would say that this one... If you experienced pain and suffering in your life or are going through a dark time, I would definitely recommend this book. If you're looking for a quick read or an inspiring honest book this is for you! If you are struggling with brokenness in any for, grab this!

            This book addresses the issues of pain and suffering and helps people to cope with the challenges that come along with these difficult situations. Using real life stories that are personal to her and those she knows, she tackles some of the hard questions people ask when things seem to go wrong. She provides perspective, hope and encouragement to those encountering trouble. There is something for everyone to gain from this book.


I found the first half of the book to be a tough slog. She kept raising all these difficult questions, but didn't give any answers or solutions or really even much hope to the reader. I ended up putting it down for a few months, then tried picking it back up again. The second half of the book was much more encouraging and gave a really good perspective on dealing with challenging circumstances and ways to find healing while strengthening our faith at the same time. If you can get through the start, the end is worth it.
