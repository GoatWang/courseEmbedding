H.I.G. Capital Announces the Formation of American Hardwood Industries

MIAMI - October 15, 2007 - H.I.G. Capital, a leading global private equity firm, announced today the formation of American Hardwood Industries, Inc. ("AHI" or "Company") through the simultaneous recapitalization of Rossi American Hardwoods ("Rossi") and Hardwood Lumber Manufacturing ("HLM"). Headquartered in Cromwell, CT and with operations in strategically favorable locations for hardwood lumber, American Hardwood Industries is a leading lumber products manufacturer with a diverse product portfolio, including high grade white oak, cherry, hard maple, red oak and other species. Rossi and HLM are vertically-integrated suppliers with robust operations in timber-rights purchasing, sawmills, kiln-drying and logistical support. The Company's products are used heavily in the remodeling market with end uses such as high-end flooring, custom cabinetry, furniture and molding. The Company is a leading exporter of premium American hardwoods to over 40 international markets. AHI has over 150 million board feet of production capacity, making it one of the largest producers in the US.
Founded in 1925, Rossi American Hardwoods is one of the premier manufacturers in the US and one of the leading suppliers to over forty international markets. Rossi American Hardwoods is led by Ted Rossi, who will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of AHI. Hardwood Lumber Manufacturing, strategically located in the best areas in the US for high grade cherry and hard maple, is led by David Marshall who will be President and COO of AHI.
"We are very excited about partnering with one of the top management teams in the sector. Ted is an effective operator and industry leader and Rossi American Hardwoods has developed a reputation as a top quality supplier in international markets. HLM offers a sophisticated, metrics-oriented and disciplined, management approach that is unique in the industry" said Brian Schwartz, Managing Director of H.I.G Capital. Roman Krislav of H.I.G Capital added, "Rossi and HLM have consistently invested in quality equipment and management personnel. We believe American Hardwood Industries is well-positioned to benefit from an improvement in sector fundamentals. We look to continue to partner with outstanding management teams and increase our exposure to the sector." This is H.I.G. Capital's second investment in the sector, after the recapitalization of Virginia-based Augusta Lumber in December 2006.
H.I.G. partnered with management to consummate the transaction. "H.I.G. distinguished itself in really understanding the business and moving quickly to get a deal done. As we look to add to our platform, we are fortunate to have a partner that understands the sector and has the financial resources to help us execute our growth plan and support our acquisition strategy" said Ted Rossi.

Press Releases 



Matrix Announces the Successful Sale of Rossi American Hardwoods and Hardwood Lumber Manufacturing, Inc.
RICHMOND, VA – October 18, 2007 – Matrix Capital Markets Group, Inc. announced today that it has successfully completed the sale of Rossi American Hardwoods (RAH) and Hardwood Lumber Manufacturing, Inc. (HLM) to H.I.G. Capital, a private equity firm headquartered in Miami, FL and Fifth Street Capital, headquartered in White Plains, NY. RAH, based in Cromwell, CT and HLM, headquartered in Charlotte, NC, are two of the country’s leading producers and exporters of US hardwoods. All of the operating entities under RAH and HLM will be consolidated under a new holding company called American Hardwoods Industries and will include Blue Triangle Hardwoods, Graham Lumber, Emporium Hardwoods, and Northern Hardwoods. The companies also announced their intention to include Cross Creek Sales at a future date. Matrix served as exclusive financial advisor to Rossi and Hardwood Lumber on the transaction.
Ted Rossi, President of Rossi American Hardwoods and the Chairman of the newly formed American Hardwoods Industries stated, “The combination of Rossi and Hardwood Lumber, with our management teams and the financial resources of H.I.G. and Fifth Street, creates a formidable, multi-branded global competitor. The H.I.G. and Fifth Street teams have immersed themselves in the industry and proven to me that they share the same vision and see the same opportunities as our team.” Brian Schwartz, Managing Director of H.I.G. Capital indicated, “We are very excited about partnering with one of the effective operators and industry leaders in Rossi American Hardwoods. Rossi has developed a reputation as a top quality supplier in international markets.” Roman Krislav of H.I.G. noted “HLM offers a sophisticated, metrics oriented and disciplined, management approach that is unique in the industry. Rossi and HLM have consistently invested in quality equipment and management personnel. We believe American Hardwood Industries is well-positioned to benefit from an improvement in sector fundamentals. He noted further that “they are committed to growth and will continue to support an aggressive acquisition campaign that seeks to add businesses that provide or deliver quality managers, products, and customer relationships.”
Michael Morrison, Managing Director and Principal at Matrix commented, “The completion of this transaction will facilitate the creation of one the most diversified hardwood forest products platforms in the world. Partnering with H.I.G. Capital and Fifth Street Capital brings best in breed capital providers to an industry that is fragmented and ripe for selective consolidation. The platform will now have a very broad product offering, several seasoned industry executives, increased species availability, deeper market and customer penetration, and a sister company in Augusta Lumber, an existing portfolio company of H.I.G.”
