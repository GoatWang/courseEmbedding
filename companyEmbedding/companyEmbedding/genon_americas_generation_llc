and enter into contracts or agreements with vendors, customers,
partners and suppliers;


               (vi) subject
to its ultimate responsibility for the management of the Company,

committee, and in furtherance of any such delegation, to appoint,
employ, or contract with any person or entity it may in its sole
discretion deem necessary or desirable for the transaction of the
business of the Company, which person or entity may administer the
day-to-day operations of the Company;

on behalf of or against the Company;


               (viii) make
any tax election or decision to be made by the Company under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder; and

necessary or advisable to the carrying out of any of the foregoing
powers, objects or purposes.


          (d)
Number, Election and Term of Office; Chairman . The Board
shall consist of no less than three (3) and no more than
fifteen (15) Managers, as determined by the Member from time
to time. The Managers shall be appointed by the Member. Each
Manager (except in the case of death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal) shall serve for a period of one (1)
year or until his or her successor shall have been duly appointed
and qualified. The Member or the Board shall appoint from among the
Managers a chairman (the “Chairman”). The Chairman
shall preside at all meetings when present. A majority of Managers
present at any meeting at which a quorum is present shall elect an
alternate chairman to preside at such meeting if the Chairman is
not present. The number of members of the Board is hereby set at
three (3) and each of the individuals listed on
Exhibit A attached hereto is hereby appointed,
effective as of the date indicated thereon, as a member of the
Board, to serve until his or her successor shall have been duly
appointed and qualified. The Chairman identified on
Exhibit A is hereby appointed to serve in the capacity
of Chairman, effective as of the date indicated thereon.


          (e)
Removal . Any Manager may be removed from office (with or
without cause) by the Member in its sole and absolute discretion.
Removal action may be taken at any time, and a removed
Manager’s successor may be appointed to serve for the
remainder of the unexpired term.


          (f)
Vacancies . A vacancy occurring in the Board may be filled
for the unexpired term by the Member or, alternatively, the Board
by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Managers remaining in
office unless and until the Member appoints a successor.


          (g)
Compensation . Managers may receive such reasonable
compensation for their services as may from time to time be
approved by the Member. Managers may receive reimbursement of
expenses, as fixed or determined by the Member. A Manager may also
serve the Company in any capacity other than that of Manager and
receive compensation, as determined by the Member or the Board, for
services rendered in that other capacity.


          (h)
Meetings of the Board . Regular meetings of the Board may be
held without notice at such times and at such places as shall from
time to time be determined by the Board. Special meetings of the
Board may be called by or at the request of the Member, the
Chairman or at least two (2) Managers. Reasonable notice
thereof shall be given by the person or persons calling the
meeting. Attendance by a Manager at a meeting shall constitute
waiver of

notice of such
meeting, except where a Manager attends a meeting for the express
purpose of objecting at the beginning of the meeting to the
transaction of business at the meeting. At meetings of the Board,
the presence of at least one half (1/2) of the Managers then in
office (but not less than two (2) Managers) shall be necessary to
constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at such
meeting. The act of a majority of the Managers present at a meeting
at which a quorum is present at the time shall be the act of the
Board.


          (i)
Action by Managers Without a Meeting. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or any committee
thereof may be taken without a meeting upon approval of a majority
of the members of the Board or such committee. Such approval shall
have the same force and effect as a majority vote at a meeting of
the Board or such committee at which a quorum is present and may be
evidenced by one (1) or more written consents describing the
action taken.


          (j)
Participation in Board Meetings . Members of the Board or
any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the Board or
such committee by means of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment which allows all persons participating in
the meeting to hear and communicate with each other, and such
participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at
the meeting.


          (k)
Committees . The Member or the Board may designate one or
more committees, each committee to consist of one or more Managers
or individuals who are not Managers. The Member or the Board may
designate one or more individuals as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
