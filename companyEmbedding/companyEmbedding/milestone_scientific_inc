                    Certain statements contained on www.milestonescientific.com,
                    which are not based on historical facts, are forward-looking
                    statements as the term is defined in the Private Securities
                    Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are subject to substantial
                    uncertainties and risks in part detailed in the respective

                    Although the Company believes that its expectations are reasonable
                    assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its businesses,

                    no assurance that actual results will not differ materially
                    from their expectations. Important factors currently known
                    to management that could cause actual results to differ materially
                    from those in forward-looking statements include the Company's
                    ability to execute properly its business model, to raise
                    additional capital to implement its continuing business model,
                    the ability to attract and retain personnel - including highly
                    qualified executives, management and operational personnel,
                    ability to negotiate favorable current debt and future capital
                    raises, and the inherent risk associated with a diversified
                    business to achieve and maintain positive cash flow and net
                    profitability. In light of these risks and uncertainties,
                    there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information
                    contained on Milestone’s web site will, in fact, occur.

Provides Update Regarding Distribution and Product Platform Strategy for Epidural InstrumentMarketwiredFebruary 22, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareLIVINGSTON, NJ --(Marketwired - February 22, 2017) - Milestone Scientific, Inc. (NYSE MKT: MLSS), a medical R&D and dental products company that designs, patents, incubates and commercializes a growing portfolio of innovative therapeutic injection technologies, today announced it has begun its clinical rollout for the epidural instrument in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) regions, by initiating clinical evaluations at key hospitals in the United Arab Emirates and in Lebanon. Given the extensive published clinical data supporting successful epidural catheter placement in patients with complex co-morbidities, clinicians and key opinion leaders in these territories have expressed further interest in broadening the technique scope into challenging thoracic epidural procedures, as well as extending its use into pediatric cases.Milestone Scientific is also continuing its collaboration with key opinion leaders in Italy with a focus on expanding its clinical utilization at key hospitals in Rome, Florence, Naples and Pesaro, which resulted in additional scientific data accepted for presentation at the upcoming meeting of the European Society for Anesthesiology to be held in Geneva, Switzerland from June 3-5, 2017. Euroanaesthesia is Europe's largest annual event showcasing the latest and the most relevant knowledge with medical experts active in the fields of anesthesia, perioperative medicine, intensive care, emergency medicine and pain treatment.Milestone had a successful showing at Arab Health 2017, which is the largest gathering of healthcare and trade professionals in the MENA region and the 2nd largest healthcare exhibition and congress in the world. Numerous distributors from the MENA and the Asia/Pacific regions expressed the interest in distribution of Milestone's epidural and intra-articular injection instruments.Milestone's DPS Dynamic Pressure Sensing Technology™ continues to lead the way as a superior alternative to the more expensive technologies such as ultrasound and fluoroscopy that are being used to identify the epidural space. A recent clinical publication in the Journal Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine independently confirmed the lower failure rates of pressure-based epidural waveform analysis. Milestone's CompuFlo™ Epidural Instrument is the first commercial product to come to market with waveform-generating dynamic pressure sensing capabilities.Leonard Osser, Chief Executive Officer of Milestone Medical, stated, "We are further encouraged by the interest in our epidural instruments by medical practitioners in Europe and the MENA regions, including the use of our instrument for patients with complex co-morbidities, as well as prospects of intended use into pediatric patients."About Milestone Scientific Inc.Milestone Scientific Inc. (MLSS) is a medical R&D company that designs, patents, incubates and commercializes a growing portfolio of innovative injection technologies.

With the submission of these applications Steven Robins had completed the tasks for which he had been elevated from consultant to President of the Company and he and Milestone mutually agreed upon his resignation.
