Veritas Capital Closes Sixth Fund with $3.55 Billion of Commitments




Fundraising Completed in Four Months; Fund Significantly 
      Oversubscribed






February 15, 2017 07:50 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Veritas Capital, a leading private equity investment firm, announced 
      today that it has completed a $3.55 billion fundraise for Veritas 
      Capital Fund VI. Fund VI reached its hard cap and was significantly 
      oversubscribed, exceeding its target of $3 billion within four months.
    


      Consistent with its predecessor funds, Fund VI will continue Veritas’ 
      successful strategy of investing in technology-focused middle market 
      companies that work with government-related and leading commercial 
      customers across a broad range of sectors including aerospace & defense, 
      healthcare, technology, national security, communications, energy, 
      government services and education.
    

      Veritas Capital is led by Chief Executive Officer and Managing Partner, 
      Ramzi Musallam, and five partners, supported by a team of highly skilled 
      investment professionals. The firm works closely with portfolio company 
      management teams to strategically transform their businesses, including 
      helping to enhance their capabilities, promote new business development, 
      and identify growth opportunities in core and adjacent markets. Last 
      month, the firm agreed to acquire Harris Corporation’s government IT 
      services business for $690 million, further complementing a robust 
      portfolio which includes companies such as Verscend Technologies, Inc., 
      Vencore, Inc. and Abaco Systems, Inc.
    

      “We are grateful for the support and confidence of our existing 
      investors and are pleased to welcome a number of new investors to the 
      fund,” said Mr. Musallam. “The demand for Fund VI reflects the success 
      of our differentiated strategy and our ability to identify and execute 
      attractive investment opportunities. We look forward to pursuing the 
      many exciting opportunities ahead.”
    

      The firm’s predecessor platform fund, Veritas Capital Fund V, completed 
      its fundraising of $1.875 billion of aggregate committed capital in 
      August 2014 and made its first investment in the second quarter of 2015.
