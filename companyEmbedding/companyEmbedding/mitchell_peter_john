Our Values
For us, producing the highest quality professional hair care available is simply not enough. John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always will be) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place. We were the first professional beauty company to stand up against animal testing and our charitable efforts continue to set the standard for giving in our industry. A commitment to caring for people and the planet is a driving force in everything we do.

No Animal Testing
Never Have. Never Will.
In 1980, we became the first professional beauty company to publicly stand up against animal testing. Now, nearly 35 years later, that pledge to our furry friends remains a driving force in all that we do.







Caring For Our Planet
Live Beautifully
Whether we're planting trees, protecting animals or preserving our natural resources, John Paul Mitchell Systems is (and always has been) dedicated to making our world a more beautiful place.











Product Control
The Real Deal on Diversion
Diversion occurs when professional salon products are sold by unauthorized retailers. Oftentimes these products are old, stolen, counterfeit or tampered with. That's why you should only purchase John Paul Mitchell Systems products within the professional beauty salon industry.







Research & Development
Our product development process begins in our state-of-the-art Product Innovation Center (PIC), in Santa Clarita, California. It's here where our products are researched, formulated and tested (on humans!). From concept to completion, our talented teams work hand-in-hand to perfect every formula and bring our newest innovations to life.







The Awapuhi Farm
Green from the get-go. In 1983, our co-founders established a self-sustaining, solar-powered Awapuhi farm in Hawaii—all of the Awapuhi used in our products is still harvested there today.

"I have looked for you, you have come to me, and I thank you." âJohn Paul II, to the young people gathered in St. Peter's Square to pray for him the night before he died.John Paul II, We Love You! not only tells the stories of young people whose lives were touched by the pope, it also offers on-the-scene coverage from Rome of this well-loved pope's final decline, death and funeral. Fr. Peter Mitchell, a priest of the JPII generation, happened to be in Rome during that time and felt called to share those unprecedented days with as many people as possible via e-mail. He became a "sleep-deprived, emotionally drained and physically exhausted scoop reporter" writing moving accounts that soon spread globally via the Internet. The testimonies from young peopleâcombined with Fr. Mitchell's vivid account of the pope's passingâattest to the life-changing impact of this great man on an entire generation of Catholics.Note: The current USA price is $11.99.
