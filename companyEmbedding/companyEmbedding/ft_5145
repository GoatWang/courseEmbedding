Product Overview














Product Overview






Main Features


Barcode scannerhandheld72 line / secdecodedUSB





Honeywell's MS5145 Eclipse is a low cost laser-based alternative to CCD scanners. Its compact form factor and high end feature set simplify its use in a variety of applications at the press of a button.Eclipse is a single-line, hand-held laser scanner. Equipped with Honeywell's patented CodeGate technology, Eclipse can be used in a wide variety of applications. CodeGate technology allows the user to easily target the desired bar code and complete data transmission with the press of a single button. This makes Eclipse a perfect selection for menu scanning, point-of-sale, document processing and inventory control.With Honeywell's state-of-the-art scanning technology, the MS5145 Eclipse has a longer working range and a wider scan field than a typical CCD. The width of the scan line grows as the scanner moves further away from bar codes.CodeSense is a unique feature employed by Eclipse in the absence of infrared object detection. It provides the user with a pulsing laser line for bar code detection. When a bar code is detected, the laser line switches to a constant state to allow for scanning via CodeGate.

    CodeSense™

    Product Details






	The Eclipse 5145 handheld scanner is an economy laser-based alternative to CCD scanners. Its compact form factor and broad feature set make is simple to use in a variety of applications, including:

Menu scanning
Point-of-sale
Document processing
Inventory control





Featuring Honeywell’s patented CodeGate™ technology, the Eclipse 5145 scanner lets you easily target the desired barcode and complete data transmission with the press of a single button. 

We’ve equipped the Eclipse 5145 device with our state-of-the-art scanning technology. That gives it a longer working range and a wider scan field than a typical CCD. The width of the scan line grows as the scanner moves further away from the intended barcode, simplifying targeting. 




You’ll also get a workflow boost from CodeSense™, a unique feature that the Eclipse scanner uses in the absence of infrared object detection. CodeSense provides you with a pulsing laser line for barcode detection. When the scanner detects a barcode, the laser line switches from sleep mode to a constant state so you can begin scanning right away.
Find out more about what your business can accomplish with the Eclipse 5145 scanner and Honeywell workflow solutions. Contact us today.
