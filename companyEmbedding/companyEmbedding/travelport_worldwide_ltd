    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Company[edit]
Travelport is headquartered in Langley, Berkshire. On September 25, 2014, the company completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “TVPT”.[1]
History[edit]




Travelport offices in Cumberland, Georgia


Travelport traces its origins back to 1971, but its most immediate predecessor, Travel Distribution Services (TDS), was founded in 2001 through the acquisition of Galileo International by TDS's parent, Cendant Corporation. Travelport was formed in August 2006, when Cendant sold Orbitz and Galileo to The Blackstone Group in a deal valued at $4.3 billion.[2]
Shortly after the Blackstone-led buyout, in December 2006, Travelport struck a deal to buy one of its rivals, Worldspan, for $1.4 billion.[3]:314–318
In May 2007 the company filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO was priced on July 20, 2007, opening at $15.00 per share, and closed on July 25, 2007. A month later, Travelport completed the Worldspan deal, integrating Worldspan with Galileo.
By combining operations with Worldspan and streamlining overlapping functions that Travelport had inherited from a string of more than 20 earlier mergers under Cendant, Travelport cut its overhead by $390 million in three years and doubled its cash flow.[3]:317
On September 19, 2007, Travelport became the first travel company to receive a 100 percent rating on the sixth annual Corporate Equality Index awarded by the American Human Rights Campaign Foundation.[4] Worldspan achieved the 100 percent rating on HRC's Corporate Equality Index in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
On May 5, 2011, Travelport completed the $720m sale of its GTA (Gullivers Travel Associates) business to Kuoni.

Company[edit]
Travelport is headquartered in Langley, Berkshire. On September 25, 2014, the company completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “TVPT”.[1]
History[edit]




Travelport offices in Cumberland, Georgia


Travelport traces its origins back to 1971, but its most immediate predecessor, Travel Distribution Services (TDS), was founded in 2001 through the acquisition of Galileo International by TDS's parent, Cendant Corporation. Travelport was formed in August 2006, when Cendant sold Orbitz and Galileo to The Blackstone Group in a deal valued at $4.3 billion.[2]
Shortly after the Blackstone-led buyout, in December 2006, Travelport struck a deal to buy one of its rivals, Worldspan, for $1.4 billion.[3]:314–318
In May 2007 the company filed a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to sell a portion of Orbitz Worldwide in an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO was priced on July 20, 2007, opening at $15.00 per share, and closed on July 25, 2007. A month later, Travelport completed the Worldspan deal, integrating Worldspan with Galileo.
By combining operations with Worldspan and streamlining overlapping functions that Travelport had inherited from a string of more than 20 earlier mergers under Cendant, Travelport cut its overhead by $390 million in three years and doubled its cash flow.[3]:317
On September 19, 2007, Travelport became the first travel company to receive a 100 percent rating on the sixth annual Corporate Equality Index awarded by the American Human Rights Campaign Foundation.[4] Worldspan achieved the 100 percent rating on HRC's Corporate Equality Index in 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005.
On May 5, 2011, Travelport completed the $720m sale of its GTA (Gullivers Travel Associates) business to Kuoni.

"We have started 2017 well with a particularly strong performance in Asia Pacific, the world's fastest growing and largest travel region, where we grew our air market share and saw our highest level of quarterly revenue growth for over five years.  I am delighted that our leadership positions in airline content and merchandising, hospitality, mobile commerce and commercial payments are translating into greater revenue from existing customers, as well as new business wins across multiple geographies.  We continue to invest in implementing these new wins, as well as in new product and capability extensions that will expand our focused areas of market leadership and support future growth.  Given our positive start to the year, we are confident in our outlook for 2017 and expect our full year earnings and cash flow to come in towards the higher end of our guidance ranges."

Reported Segments increased by 3 million, or 4%.  United States Reported Segments increased 2% and International Reported Segments increased 4% with increases in both Air and Beyond Air segments.  Travel Commerce Platform RevPas increased 4% to $6.67, driving a $22 million increase in Travel Commerce Platform revenue.  International RevPas increased 5% to $8.20, and United States RevPas decreased marginally by 1% to $4.30.
International Travel Commerce Platform revenue increased by $41 million, with Asia Pacific contributing primarily to this increase.  Revenue from Asia Pacific increased 18% mainly due to a 13% increase in Reported Segments and growth in payment solutions in Beyond Air.
Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA increased by $14 million, or 9%, to $169 million mainly due to the following:

$42 million growth in net revenue; offset by: 
$30 million increase within cost of revenue (excluding a $6 million net decrease related to items that are excluded from net income to determine Adjusted EBITDA) primarily due to increased travel distribution costs per segment and commission costs from our payment solutions business and an increase in Reported Segments 

Operating Income Operating income increased by $19 million to $99 million mainly due to the following:

$14 million increase in Adjusted EBITDA 
$8 million related to revenue deferred in previous years, offset by: 
$2 million increase in amortization of customer loyalty payments

Net Income Net income increased by $39 million to $56 million due to the following:

$19 million increase in operating income 
$25 million decrease in interest expense, net, resulting from an unrealized loss on interest rate derivative contracts recognized in 2016, lower interest rates and a lower debt balance, offset by: 
$5 million increase in provision for income taxes

Adjusted Net IncomeAdjusted Net Income increased by $13 million to $64 million mainly due to the following:

$39 million increase in net income, offset by: 
$17 million decrease in unrealized loss on interest rate derivative contracts recognized in 2016, which is excluded to determine Adjusted Net Income and 
$8 million decrease in corporate and restructuring, equity-based compensation and other costs, which are excluded to determine Adjusted Net Income 

Net Cash Provided by Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities increased by $69 million to $95 million, primarily due to an increase in operating income, improved working capital and lower interest and customer loyalty payments in 2017.
Free Cash Flow Free Cash Flow increased by $68 million to a cash inflow of $71 million, primarily due to an increase in net cash provided by operating activities.
Net Debt Net Debt decreased from $2,205 million as of December 31, 2016 to $2,146 million as of March 31, 2017 and is comprised of $2,333 million in total debt less $187 million in cash and cash equivalents.  The decrease in total debt of $12 million and increase of $47 million in the cash and cash equivalents balance as of March 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 resulted in a decrease of $59 million in the Net Debt balance. 
Full Year 2017 Financial Guidance
The following forward-looking statements, as well as those made elsewhere within this press release, reflect expectations as of May 9, 2017.  We assume no obligation to update these statements.  Results may be materially different and are affected by many factors detailed in this release and in Travelport's quarterly and annual Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings and/or furnishings, which are available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.
Our guidance for the full year 2017 is unchanged, as detailed below, although we expect Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Income per Share (diluted) and Free Cash Flow to be towards the higher end of our guidance ranges.

Travelport continues to anticipate that eNett, its commercial payments business, will grow net revenue by at least 20% in 2017. This is subject to exchange rate movements given that eNett's net revenue is largely denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.




 (1) 
 Adjusted EBITDA guidance consists of Adjusted Net Income guidance excluding expected depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and expected amortization of customer loyalty payments of $240 million to $250 million, expected interest expense, net (excluding the impact of unrealized gain (loss) on interest rate derivative instruments) of $120 million to $125 million and expected related income taxes of $50 million to $55 million. Adjusted Net Income guidance excludes the expected impact of amortization of intangible assets of approximately $40 million, expected equity-based compensation and related taxes and corporate and restructuring costs of $55 million to $65 million and expected income tax benefit related to these adjustments of $5 million to $10 million. We are unable to reconcile Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income to net income (loss) determined under U.S. GAAP due to the unavailability of information required to reasonably predict certain reconciling items such as loss on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of long-lived assets, unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency and interest rate derivative instruments, and the related tax impact of these adjustments. 


 (2) 
 Adjusted Income per Share - diluted guidance consists of Adjusted Net Income divided by our expected weighted average number of dilutive common shares for 2017 of approximately 127.5 million. 


 (3) 
   Free Cash Flow guidance reflects expected net cash provided by operating activities for 2017 of $295 million to $325 million less cash additions to property and equipment of $130 million to $140 million. 




This guidance assumes spot foreign exchange rates as of May 2, 2017, together with the impact of foreign exchange rate hedges undertaken during 2016 as part of our rolling hedging program.  
Impact of Foreign Exchange Movements 
Our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars.  With approximately 91% of our net revenue denominated in U.S. dollars in the first quarter of 2017, exchange rate movements in this currency have a low impact on our net revenue.  Of our costs and expenses in the first quarter of 2017, excluding depreciation on property and equipment, amortization of customer loyalty payments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-core corporate costs, approximately 71% were denominated in U.S. dollars.  
We employ foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly against the British pound, the Euro and the Australian dollar, which are the main non-U.S. dollar components of our costs and expenses.  The year over year impact of foreign exchange movements had a positive impact to Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2017. 
Dividend
On May 5, 2017, Travelport's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share for the first quarter of 2017.  The dividend will be payable on June 15, 2017 to shareholders on record as at market close on June 1, 2017.

TRAVELPORT WORLDWIDE LIMITEDDEFINITIONS (unaudited)
Definitions
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of customer loyalty payments, interest expense, net (excluding unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate derivative instruments), and related income taxes.
Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share - Diluted is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the period divided by the weighted average number of dilutive common shares.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, and items that are excluded under our debt covenants, such as, non-cash equity-based compensation, certain corporate and restructuring costs, non-cash impairment of long-lived assets, certain litigation and related costs, and other non-cash items such as unrealized foreign currency gains (losses) on earnings hedges, and unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate derivative instruments, along with any income tax related to these exclusions.
Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is defined as Adjusted EBITDA less depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of customer loyalty payments.
Capital Expenditures is defined as cash paid for property and equipment plus repayments in relation to capital leases and other indebtedness.
Customer Loyalty Payments are payments made to travel agencies or travel providers with an objective of increasing the number of travel bookings using the Company's Travel Commerce Platform and to improve the travel agencies or travel providers' loyalty, which are instrumented through agreements with a term over a year. Under the contractual terms, the travel agency or travel provider commits to achieve certain economic objectives for the Company. Such costs are specifically identifiable to individual contracts with travel agencies or travel providers, which have determinable contractual lives. Due to the contractual nature of the payments, the Company believes that such assets are appropriately classified as intangible assets. 
Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations, less cash used for additions to property and equipment.
Net Debt is defined as total debt comprising of current and non-current portion of long-term debt minus cash and cash equivalents.
Reported Segments means travel provider revenue generating units (net of cancellations) sold by the Company's travel agency network, geographically presented by region based upon the point of sale location.
Travel Commerce Platform RevPas ("RevPas") represents Travel Commerce Platform revenue per segment and is computed by dividing Travel Commerce Platform revenue by the total number of Reported Segments.

TRAVELPORT WORLDWIDE LIMITEDNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES(unaudited)
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
We utilize non-GAAP (or adjusted) financial measures, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Share – diluted, to provide useful supplemental information to assist investors in understanding and assessing our performance and financial results on the same basis that management uses internally. These adjusted financial measures provide investors greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management to evaluate our core operations, forecast future results, determine future capital investment allocations and understand business trends within the industry. These metrics are also used by our Board of Directors to determine incentive compensation for future periods. Management believes the adjusted financial measures assist investors in the comparison of financial results between periods as such measures exclude certain items that management believes are not reflective of our core operating performance consistent with how management reviews the business.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Net Income (Loss) per Share – diluted, Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent, and should not be considered as, alternatives to net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share – diluted, as determined under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these measures may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. 
We believe Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share-diluted is a useful measure for our investors as it represents, on a per share basis, our consolidated results, taking into account depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and amortization of customer loyalty payments, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense (excluding unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate derivative instruments) and related income taxes but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.  Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share-diluted has similar limitations as Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.  In addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not include all items that affect our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for the period.  Therefore, we believe it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated condensed statements of operations.
We believe our important measure of liquidity is Free Cash Flow. This measure is useful indicator of our ability to generate cash to meet our liquidity demands. We use Free Cash Flow to conduct and evaluate our operating liquidity. We believe it typically presents an alternate measure of cash flows since purchases of property and equipment are a necessary component of our ongoing operations and provides useful information regarding how cash provided by operating activities compares to the property and equipment investments required to maintain and grow our platform.  We believe it provides investors with an understanding of how assets are performing and measures management's effectiveness in managing cash.  Free Cash Flow is non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.  This measure has limitation in that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period, nor do they represent residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures. This measure should not be considered as measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations as determined under U.S. GAAP.
We use Capital Expenditures to determine our total cash spent on acquisition of property and equipment and cash repayment of capital lease obligation and other indebtedness. We believe this measure provides management and investors an understanding of total capital invested in the development of our platform. Capital Expenditures is a non-GAAP measure and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other entities. This measure has limitation in that it aggregates cash flows from investing and financing activities as determined under U.S. GAAP.
Management uses Net Debt to review our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage.  Further, we believe, certain debt rating agencies, creditors and credit analysts monitor our Net Debt as part of their assessment of our business.  Net Debt is not a measurement of our indebtedness under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternative to assess our total debt or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Travelport's results as reported under U.S. GAAP.

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.

STRONG Q3 PERFORMANCE; RAISING FULL YEAR ADJUSTED NET INCOME GUIDANCE 







investor-center--earnings-accouncement-2015q3--840x480.jpg


 
We have started 2017 well with a particularly strong performance in Asia Pacific where we grew our air market share and saw our highest level of quarterly revenue growth for over five years. 



 

Travelport Worldwide Limited (NYSE: TVPT) announces its financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2015.
Key Points
Strong Q3 financial performance with Adjusted Income per Share (diluted) of $0.25, up $0.28 year over year
Net revenue up 6% to $560 million; RevPas up 11% to $6.29
Double-digit revenue growth in Europe (11%), Asia Pacific (14%) and Latin America & Canada (21%)
Over 100 airlines actively merchandising their enriched product content through Travelport, including branded fares and ancillaries 
Beyond Air revenue up 17% to $129 million, accounting for 24% of Travel Commerce Platform revenue (Q3 2014: 22%)
eNett reported revenue growth of 48% 
Hospitality segment attachment up 10% to 49 per 100 airline tickets issued
Adjusted Free Cash Flow generation of $31 million, up $93 million
Raising full year guidance on Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Income per Share (diluted); tightening full year guidance on net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA
 
Gordon Wilson, President and CEO of Travelport, commented:
“Our financial performance during the quarter was driven by double-digit revenue growth across key geographies, particularly in Europe and Asia Pacific, benefiting from the increasing breadth of our Travel Commerce Platform.  We continue to truly differentiate ourselves from the competition in four key areas where we have taken industry-leading positions.  In airline merchandising, we continue to see growing adoption by airlines of our Rich Content and Branding merchandising solution, alongside strong growth in away air bookings.  Moreover, we’ve seen continued momentum in Beyond Air with hospitality and payments both making very good progress.  The integration of our recent acquisition in mobile travel technology, MTT, is progressing ahead of schedule, with many opportunities to explore from a new customer and product perspective.  All of this gives us comfort to tighten our full year guidance on net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA and also raise our guidance on full year Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Income per Share.”

 
The Company refers to certain non-GAAP financial measures in this press release, including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income (Loss), Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share, Capital Expenditures, Net Debt, Trading Working Capital, Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Adjusted Free Cash Flow.  Please refer to pages 10, 12 and 13 of this press release for additional information, including reconciliations of such non-GAAP financial measures.  We have not reconciled Adjusted EBITDA guidance to net income (loss) guidance because we do not provide guidance for share-based compensation expense, provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, litigation and related costs, and other items, as certain of these items are out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted.

Net revenue increased by $31 million, or 6%, to $560 million primarily due to growth in Travel Commerce Platform revenue of $27 million, or 5%.  RevPas increased 11% to $6.29 driving a $42 million increase in Travel Commerce Platform revenue, which was offset by lower volumes.  International Reported Segments increased 2% driving $7 million of the increase, offset by 13% decrease in U.S. Reported Segments, due to the impact of our 2014 renegotiated contract with Orbitz Worldwide, Inc. (“Orbitz Worldwide”).  Overall, total Reported Segments decreased 5% to 84 million.
Within Travel Commerce Platform revenue, there was an $18 million increase in Beyond Air revenue and a $9 million increase in Air revenue.  The Air revenue increase was mainly due to improved mix and merchandising.  Beyond Air revenue increased 17% to $129 million primarily driven by continued growth in payment solutions and hospitality, as well as our expansion into mobile solutions.  Technology Services revenue increased by $4 million primarily due to growth in application development.
Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million, or 2%, to $131 million.  The decrease is primarily the result of lower volumes and increased expenses as we continue to invest in our platform through acquisition, expansion of our go-to-market commercial capabilities and incremental public company administrative expenses.
Operating Income 
Operating income increased by $33 million, or 155%, to $54 million primarily due to a reduction in non-core corporate costs of $29 million mainly related to $20 million of lower equity-based compensation and $6 million of lower unrealized loss on foreign currency derivative contracts, offset by a decrease in Adjusted EBITDA of $2 million.
Net Income 
Net income decreased by $150 million to $5 million primarily due to a $304 million gain on the sale of Orbitz Worldwide shares recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2014 compared to $0 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, offset by a decrease in interest expense and a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $121 million relating to the deleveraging, debt refinancing and IPO transactions completed in 2014 and a $33 million increase in operating income.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss)
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) increased by $33 million to $30 million.
Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $115 million to $62 million primarily as a result of a $77 million decrease in interest payments and $32 million of lower payments on other adjusting items and customer loyalty payments.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow
Adjusted Free Cash Flow increased by $93 million, primarily as a result of changes in our net cash provided by operating activities.
Net Debt 
Net Debt increased from $2,275 million at December 31, 2014 to $2,371 million at September 30, 2015, and is comprised of $2,472 million in total debt less $101 million in cash and cash equivalents.
 
Business Update
Continued Air content leadership and critical mass of participation in our industry-leading merchandising platform
During the period, Travelport signed new and expanded distribution and merchandising deals with a number of network and low-cost carriers across key geographies.
One year on from the successful launch of our industry-leading Rich Content and Branding merchandising solution, over 100 airlines are now fully implemented and actively merchandising their enriched product content, including branded fares and ancillaries, within our point-of-sale applications worldwide. 
In total, over 120 airlines are signed up for this high value-adding distribution capability, representing over 50% of all air segment volumes sold on our Travel Commerce Platform in the first nine months of 2015.
Recent implementations included several leading Chinese airlines such as Cathay Pacific, Air China, China Eastern and Shanghai Airlines, as well as Peruvian Airlines, one of Latin America’s fastest growing regional airlines.
Strong performance in Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America & Canada and continued momentum in corporate and leisure travel 
Revenue growth from Europe was strong across Air and Beyond Air, as Travelport lapped headwinds in Greece, Russia and the Ukraine from the first half of the year and converted recent new customer wins.
Our strong recent progress in Asia Pacific and Latin America & Canada continued, driven by increasing transaction levels at recently converted new customers – particularly in India, South Korea, Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, Chile and Colombia.
Travelport provides transaction and platform services to AXESS International Network, the leading Japanese GDS owned by Japan Airlines.  Our relationship with AXESS was expanded during the quarter, including an agreement to replace AXESS’ point-of-sale agency desktops with a bespoke version of our award-winning Travelport Smartpoint. 
In corporate travel, a major long-term contract renewal was signed with IBM for the use of our Travel Commerce Platform.  IBM, headquartered in the U.S., conduct their business in over 170 countries with over 400,000 employees.  It is reported by Business Travel News that IBM is the largest travel spend corporation in the U.S.
Our penetration in the global corporate travel space was furthered in the quarter by significant new business wins in multiple geographies, including Orient House Travel and Al Futtaim Travel, two of the largest travel management companies (TMCs) in the United Arab Emirates.  We also signed significant multi-year deals with Portman, a leading TMC in the United Kingdom, and Student Agency, the Czech Republic’s largest full-service travel agency.
In leisure travel, we signed new or extended agreements with several key online travel agencies (OTAs) across the world, including new business in Greece with Tripsta, one of the five largest OTAs in Europe.  Furthermore, a new agreement was signed with Cox & Kings, one of the largest travel agencies in India.
 
Continued momentum in Beyond Air 
Hospitality
The attachment of hotel and car bookings to air tickets continued to grow, with hospitality segments booked per 100 airline tickets issued via our Platform increasing to 49 in Q3 (from 45 in Q3 2014). 
Car rental bookings continued to see strong growth in Q3, with car rental days sold up 9% year over year.  Moreover, a new multi-year global content agreement was signed with First Car Rental, a leading car rental company in South Africa.
A new multi-year distribution agreement was signed with SNCF, one of the largest rail operators worldwide.
Mobile
Travelport’s acquisition of MTT, the leading mobile travel platform and mobile technology provider for global airlines and travel companies, was completed on July 3, 2015.
easyJet, Europe’s fourth largest carrier, continues to build on the success of its mobile app (first launched by MTT in 2011).  During the period, the app reached 12.5 million downloads, which compares favorably to Ryanair (4 million) and British Airways (5 million).
Travelport Hotelzon, our corporate hotel booking application, continues to deliver new corporate customer wins across its European network.  Travelport Hotelzon also announced the release of a mobile app designed to help both travel agents and business travelers manage corporate hotel bookings directly from their smartphones.
Payments 
eNett net revenue for Q3 was $27 million, representing growth of 48% year over year on a reported basis. 
Net revenue for Q3 grew 27% sequentially from Q2, with growth accelerating as eNett grew its share of business with existing customers and continued to rapidly acquire and implement its Virtual Account Numbers (VAN) solution with new customers.
eNett’s two largest customers transacted record quarterly volumes during Q3.  Moreover, six out of eNett’s top 10 customers have now re-signed exclusive long-term contracts during 2015. 
Increased ownership stake in Locomote
On October 8, 2015, we increased our shareholding in Locomote from 49% to a majority ownership stake of 55%.  Locomote is a corporate self-booking platform focused on empowering corporate travelers through an improved mobile user experience.  The Locomote platform provides solutions for all corporate travel management needs – including travel authorization and policy compliance, flexibility to change bookings, and more efficient back-office reconciliation.
The investment in Locomote further strengthens our offering to both corporates and TMCs, alongside our developments in enabling improved corporate self-booking through our similar investments in Hotelzon and MTT.  All of these digital assets are commencing working together to drive maximum synergistic value while also taking advantage of the access to industry-leading air, hotel and car rental content that Travelport provides through its APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces.
Outlook and Financial Guidance
The fourth quarter of 2015 has started well and momentum across the business remains positive.  For the full year 2015, Travelport’s guidance for net revenue and Adjusted EBITDA has been tightened, as detailed below, and we reaffirm our expectation for Adjusted EBITDA to be closer to the top end of the guidance range.  Furthermore, we expect Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Income per Share (diluted) will be higher than previously anticipated, principally due to a lower than anticipated tax charge.

This guidance assumes spot foreign exchange rates as of October 26, 2015, together with the impact of foreign exchange rate hedges undertaken during 2014 as part of our rolling hedging program.
The forward-looking statements above, as well as those made elsewhere within this press release, reflect expectations as of November 2, 2015.  We assume no obligation to update these statements.  Results may be materially different and are affected by many factors detailed in this release and in Travelport’s quarterly and annual Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and/or furnishings, which are available on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
 
Impact of Foreign Exchange Movements
Our results of operations are reported in U.S. dollars.  With approximately 93% of our net revenue denominated in U.S. dollars in Q3, exchange rate movements in this currency have a low impact on our reported net revenue.  eNett, which represented approximately 5% of our net revenue in Q3, is the largest source of non-U.S. dollar net revenue.  Approximately 80% of eNett’s net revenue in Q3 was denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. 
Of our costs and expenses in Q3, excluding depreciation on property and equipment, amortization of customer loyalty payments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and non-core corporate costs, approximately 67% were denominated in U.S. dollars. 
We employ foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly against the British pound, the Euro and the Australian dollar which are the main non-U.S. dollar components of our costs and expenses.  The effect of these hedges were to reduce the year over year impact of foreign exchange movements on Q3 Adjusted EBITDA.
Dividend
On October 28, 2015, Travelport’s Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.075 per common share for the third quarter of 2015.  The dividend will be payable on December 17, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 4, 2015.

Forward-Looking Statements

TRAVELPORT WORLDWIDE LIMITED
DEFINITIONS 
 
 
Definitions
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) excluding depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, amortization of customer loyalty payments, interest expense, net, and income taxes.
Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities of continuing operations, adjusted to remove the impact of cash paid for other adjusting items which we believe are unrelated to our ongoing operations and to deduct Capital Expenditures.
Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share - Diluted is defined as Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the period divided by weighted average number of dilutive common shares.
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is defined as net income (loss) from continuing operations excluding amortization of acquired intangible assets, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt, share of earnings (losses) in equity method investments, and items that are excluded under our debt covenants, such as gain on sale of shares of Orbitz Worldwide, Inc., non-cash equity-based compensation, certain corporate and restructuring costs, certain litigation and related costs, and other non-cash items such as foreign currency gains (losses) on euro denominated debt, and earnings hedges along with any income tax related to these exclusions.
Capital Expenditures is defined as cash paid for property and equipment plus repayments in relation to capital leases and other indebtedness.
Customer Loyalty Payments are payments made to travel agencies or travel providers with an objective of increasing the number of travel bookings using the Company’s Travel Commerce Platform and to improve the travel agencies or travel providers’ loyalty, which are instrumented through agreements with a term over a year. Under the contractual terms, the travel agency or travel provider commits to achieve certain economic objectives for the Company. Such costs are specifically identifiable to individual contracts with travel agencies or travel providers, which have determinable contractual lives. Due to the contractual nature of the payments, the Company believes that such assets are appropriately classified as intangible assets.
Net Debt is defined as total debt comprising of current and non-current portion of long-term debt minus cash and cash equivalents, and cash held as collateral.
Reported Segments means travel provider revenue generating units (net of cancellations) sold by our travel agency network, geographically presented by region based upon the point of sale location.
Travel Commerce Platform RevPas (“RevPas”) represents revenue per segment and is computed by dividing Travel Commerce Platform revenue by the total number of Reported Segments.
 
Trading Working Capital is defined as assets and liabilities directly related to our core trading operations (accounts receivables and deferred revenue from travel providers and travel agencies, current prepaid travel agency incentive payments and accounts payable and accrued liabilities for commissions and incentives).
Unlevered Adjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted Free Cash Flow adjusted to remove the impact of cash interest payments.
 
 
TRAVELPORT WORLDWIDE LIMITED
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
 
 
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and should not be considered as alternatives to net income (loss), as determined under U.S. GAAP.  In addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.  We have included Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EBITDA as they are the primary metrics used by management to evaluate and understand the underlying operations and business trends, forecast future results and determine future capital investment allocations.  They are also used by our Board to determine incentive compensation for future periods.
We believe our important measures of liquidity are Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Adjusted Free Cash Flow. These measures are useful indicators of our ability to generate cash to meet our liquidity demands.  We believe Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Adjusted Free Cash Flow provide investors with an understanding of how assets are performing and measures management’s effectiveness in managing cash.  We believe these measures give management and investors a better understanding of the cash flows generated by our underlying business, as our interest payments are primarily related to the debt incurred in relation to previous business acquisitions, cash paid for other adjusting items are unrelated to the underlying business and our Capital Expenditures are primarily related to the development of our operating platforms.  Adjusted Free Cash Flow and Unlevered Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.  These measures should not be considered as measures of liquidity or cash flows from operations as determined under U.S. GAAP.
We believe Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share-diluted is a useful measure for our investors as it represents, on a per share basis, our consolidated results, taking into account depreciation and amortization on property and equipment and amortization of customer loyalty payments, which we believe are ongoing costs of doing business, as well as other items which are not allocated to the operating businesses such as interest expense and related taxes but excluding the effects of certain expenses not directly tied to the core operations of our businesses.  Adjusted Income (Loss) per Share-diluted has similar limitations as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies.  In addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) does not include all items that affect our net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share for the period.  Therefore, we believe it is important to evaluate these measures along with our consolidated statements of operations.
The management uses Net Debt to review the Company’s overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage.  Further, we believe, certain debt rating agencies, creditors and credit analysts monitor our Net Debt as part of their assessment of our business.  Net Debt is not a measurement of our indebtedness under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternative to assess our total debt or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.
We present Trading Working Capital which is a non-GAAP measure.  We view Trading Working Capital as a key liquidity measure to understanding our cash sources and uses from operations.
These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Travelport’s results as reported under U.S. GAAP.
