AMENDMENT NO. 2 
TO STATEMENT ON SCHEDULE 13D 
Filed Pursuant to Rule 13d-1(a) 
 


ITEM 1.
Security and Issuer.  This Amendment No. 2 to Statement on Schedule 13D
(this Amended Schedule 13D) relates to the common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock), of Superior Drilling Products, Inc., a Utah corporation (the Issuer), and is being filed
jointly by Reid Walker, a resident of the State of Texas (Walker), and Hard 4 Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company wholly-owned and controlled by Walker (Holdings, and collectively with Walker, the
Reporting Persons). The Issuers principal executive offices are located at 1583 South 1700 East, Vernal UT 84078. This Amended Schedule 13D further amends and restates, in its entirety, the Statement on
Schedule 13D previously filed by the Reporting Persons on or about June 6, 2014, as previously amended on or about January 2, 2015 (collectively, the Prior Filings). 
This Amended Schedule 13D is being filed to reflect the acquisition of additional shares of Common Stock acquired by the Reporting
Persons since the Prior Filings, and to update certain information concerning the holdings and identities of the Reporting Persons.   


ITEM 2.
Identity and Background.   


              (a)
Name. The names of the Reporting Persons are as follows:  Hard 4 Holdings, LLC
 Reid Walker   


              (b)
Business Address. The business address of each of the Reporting Persons is 3953 Maple Avenue, Suite #150, Dallas Texas 75219. 
 


              (c)

as the sole member and manager of Holdings.  Holdings is a Texas limited liability company formed by Walker as an investment vehicle and
holding company. Walker exercises control over all activities and operations of Holdings.   


(d)  and  (e)
Proceedings. During the previous five (5) years, none of the Reporting Persons have been convicted in any criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) nor has any
Reporting Person been party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction such that, as a result of such proceeding, such Reporting Person was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future
violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activity subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws. 




              (f)
Citizenship.  Walker is a citizen of the United States.

ITEM 3.
Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.  Walker acquired the
185,714 shares of Common Stock over which he has sole voting and dispositive control in the Issuers initial public offering. None of such shares were acquired with borrowed funds and none are pledged as security against any borrowed
funds.  The shares of Common Stock deemed beneficially owned by Holdings were acquired (i) pursuant to a pro rata liquidating
distribution of the Warrant and 357,143 shares of Common Stock from D4D LLC, a Texas limited liability company in dissolution (D4D), to its members, and (ii) in open market purchases at quoted prices. The open market
purchases were funded from the working capital of Holdings.  The shares of Common Stock (including Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the Warrant) held by Holdings were initially acquired by D4D upon conversion of a Convertible Note (as defined in and incorporated by reference to the Prior Filings) between the Issuer and D4D and in the Issuers initial public offering. Such
Convertible Note was purchased by D4D from the Issuer from the working capital of D4D pursuant to the terms of the Securities Purchase Agreement (as defined in and incorporated by reference from the Prior Filings). Holdings funded its pro rata
portion of the capitalization of D4D from its working capital. No interest of Holdings in D4D nor any shares of Common Stock held by Holdings were acquired with borrowed funds. 
No shares of Common Stock held by the Reporting Persons are pledged as security against any borrowed funds. 
Reference is made to the Prior Filings for discussion of D4Ds acquisition and disposition of the securities of the Issuer. 
 


ITEM 4.
Purpose of Transaction.  The shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the
Reporting Persons were acquired for investment purposes. The Reporting Persons periodically review their investment in the Issuer and, based on a number of factors, including the Reporting Persons evaluation of the Issuers business
prospects and financial condition, the market for the Issuers shares, the working capital needs of the Issuer, general economic and stock market conditions and other investment opportunities, the Reporting Persons may acquire additional
securities of the Issuer by exercise of the Warrant or through open market or privately negotiated transactions, or the Reporting Persons may dispose of the shares of Common Stock through open market or privately negotiated transactions, as
applicable.  Except as set for the above, the Reporting Person does not have any additional plans or proposals which would relate to or
would result in:   


 

 
 the acquisition of additional securities of the Issuer or the disposition of securities of the Issuer, although the Reporting Person reserves the
right to exercise the Warrant at any time, or acquire or dispose of securities of the Issuer, from time to time, based on their evaluation of the Issuer and market conditions (as discussed above);





 



 
any material change in the present capitalization or dividend policy of the Issuer;   


 

 
any other material change in the Issuers business or corporate structure, including, but not limited to, if the Issuer is a registered closed-end investment company, any plans or proposals to make any changes in
its investment policy for which a vote is required by Section 13 of the Investment Company Act of 1940;   


 

 
changes in the Issuers charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede acquisition of control of the Issuer by any person; 
 


 

 
causing a class of securities of the Issuer to be delisted from a national securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities
association;   


 

 
a class of equity securities of the Issuer becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of the Act; or 
 


 

 
any action similar to any of those enumerated above.  The Reporting Persons reserve the right
to determine in the future to change the purpose or purposes described above, or engage in any of the activities set forth above.

                                            MADISON- Walker McMillan Reid of Madison, WI died November 28 at the age of 87.  The son of Carol and Stuart Reid, Walker was raised in Oconomowoc, WI. The family moved to Madison, where he made his mark at Madison West High School as a star sprinter on the track team and was the 1947 state champion in the 100-yard dash.  He went on to the University of Wisconsin, became a member of Sigma Chi, and graduated with a degree in Speech and Drama.  In 1951, he joined the U.S. Army as a Lieutenant, serving in combat in Korea.  After the war, he earned a certificate in professional acting at the American Theater Wing, New York, NY.  Fluent in Spanish, Walker worked for the Stewart Warner Company, to bring potable water to mountain villages in Guatemala.  Thereafter, he settled in Guatemala City, where he founded The Community Theater of Guatemala.  From 1974 to 1993 he served as Cultural Affairs Director for the National Park Service's Chamizal National Memorial, El Paso, TX, a theater which celebrates the cultures of United States and Mexico.  In 2011, he returned to Madison, where he lived at Capitol Lakes Retirement Community.  He is survived by his sister, Sylvia Reid Clancy, his niece Caitlin McMillan Clancy, and her husband Prasant Desai, Esq. of Brookline, MA.

Walker was always an integral part of my beautiful memories of visits to El Paso for the Siglo de Oro drama festival and symposium, but I didn't realize until after his retirement how devoted he was to the world of theater, even beyond his Chamizal duties.  He gave of himself so unstintingly.  We will miss him very much.  David Hildner, UW-Madison

Every time I go past the farm I have to think about him.

Walker Reid lives in the memories of those of us who knew him. I first met Walker at the Chamizal National Memorial in El Paso. TX. He had am imposing, yet kind, presence. He was efficient, benevolent, cultured. He had a great sense of humor. I was often daunted by his ability to remember names and numbers. Also I noticed that he would speak well of others; yet, I never heard him speak ill of anyone. Walker had the capacity to bring people together at odds with each other: in that respect he was a true diplomat. Did I mention he was a great storyteller? To this day at the Chamizal, during the annual Siglo de Oro Festival, his name pops up and someone sometime during the event will recall Walker's final words to the theater audience after presenting a company, a command accompanied with a smile: «Favor de divertirse» (Please enjoy!). Walker will be missed; he will also be remembered and continue to be much loved by all. Peace. (from A. Robert Lauer)

                                            MADISON- Walker McMillan Reid of Madison, WI died November 28 at the age of 87.  The son of Carol and Stuart Reid, Walker was raised in Oconomowoc, WI. The family moved to Madison, where he made his mark at Madison West High School as a star sprinter on the track team and was the 1947 state champion in the 100-yard dash.  He went on to the University of Wisconsin, became a member of Sigma Chi, and graduated with a degree in Speech and Drama.  In 1951, he joined the U.S. Army as a Lieutenant, serving in combat in Korea.  After the war, he earned a certificate in professional acting at the American Theater Wing, New York, NY.  Fluent in Spanish, Walker worked for the Stewart Warner Company, to bring potable water to mountain villages in Guatemala.  Thereafter, he settled in Guatemala City, where he founded The Community Theater of Guatemala.  From 1974 to 1993 he served as Cultural Affairs Director for the National Park Service's Chamizal National Memorial, El Paso, TX, a theater which celebrates the cultures of United States and Mexico.  In 2011, he returned to Madison, where he lived at Capitol Lakes Retirement Community.  He is survived by his sister, Sylvia Reid Clancy, his niece Caitlin McMillan Clancy, and her husband Prasant Desai, Esq. of Brookline, MA.

Walker was always an integral part of my beautiful memories of visits to El Paso for the Siglo de Oro drama festival and symposium, but I didn't realize until after his retirement how devoted he was to the world of theater, even beyond his Chamizal duties.  He gave of himself so unstintingly.  We will miss him very much.  David Hildner, UW-Madison

Every time I go past the farm I have to think about him.

Walker Reid lives in the memories of those of us who knew him. I first met Walker at the Chamizal National Memorial in El Paso. TX. He had am imposing, yet kind, presence. He was efficient, benevolent, cultured. He had a great sense of humor. I was often daunted by his ability to remember names and numbers. Also I noticed that he would speak well of others; yet, I never heard him speak ill of anyone. Walker had the capacity to bring people together at odds with each other: in that respect he was a true diplomat. Did I mention he was a great storyteller? To this day at the Chamizal, during the annual Siglo de Oro Festival, his name pops up and someone sometime during the event will recall Walker's final words to the theater audience after presenting a company, a command accompanied with a smile: «Favor de divertirse» (Please enjoy!). Walker will be missed; he will also be remembered and continue to be much loved by all. Peace. (from A. Robert Lauer)
