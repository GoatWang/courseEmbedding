For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net interest income totaled $21.0 million, a 19.1% increase compared with the six months ended June 30, 2016. Net interest margin on a taxable-equivalent basis totaled 3.35% for both the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with 3.15% and 3.11% for the same periods in 2016. In the second quarter of 2017, the net interest margin of 3.35% matched the first quarter of 2017 as increased yields on interest-earning assets were offset by increases in costs of interest-bearing liabilities. As had been experienced in the first quarter of 2017, increased yields on loans and investments reflected a higher interest rate environment in 2017. Additionally, tax-exempt securities were added to the portfolio in late 2016 and early 2017 with taxable-equivalent yields higher than the portfolio average. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities has increased at a slower pace than the yields earned on interest-earning assets in 2017, as the market was initially slow to respond to interest rate changes. Provision for Loan Losses The Company recorded a $100 thousand provision for loan losses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared with no provision expense for the same periods in 2016. In calculating the required provision for loan losses, both quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Favorable historical charge-off data combined with continued stable economic and market conditions resulted in the determination that a modest provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 2017 was required to offset net charge-offs and for loan growth experienced. While asset quality metrics have improved throughout 2016 and 2017, as noted below, the growth the Company has experienced in its loan portfolio is one factor that may result in the need for additional provisions for loan losses in future quarters. Noninterest Income Noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017, excluding securities gains, totaled $5.0 million compared with $4.5 million in the prior year period. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, noninterest income, excluding securities gains, totaled $9.3 million, a $519 thousand increase, or 5.9%, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016. Trust, investment management and brokerage income increased $376 thousand and $504 thousand in comparing the three and six month periods ended June 30 from 2016 to 2017. Approximately half of those increases are attributable to activity at Wheatland Advisors, Inc., which was acquired in December 2016. Trust department fees principally account for the remaining increases as additional revenues have been generated from favorable market conditions and the addition of an office in Berks County, Pennsylvania. Mortgage banking income increased $86 thousand in comparing the second quarter of 2017 with 2016, but decreased $53 thousand in comparing the six months ended June 30, 2017 with 2016. The comparisons reflect some seasonality in mortgage production normally experienced in the second quarter over the first quarter, but also decreased refinance activity as interest rates have increased, some slight compression in margins, as well as the effect of retaining a portion of mortgage production for the loan portfolio in 2017 over 2016. Investment securities gains totaled $654 thousand and $657 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $0 and $1.4 million for the same periods in 2016, as market conditions presented opportunities to act on asset/liability management strategies and interest rate conditions to accelerate earnings on securities through gains, while also meeting the funding requirements of anticipated lending activity. Noninterest Expenses Noninterest expenses totaled $12.4 million and $24.6 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $12.6 million and $23.7 million for the corresponding prior year periods. The principal drivers of increased expense items when comparing 2017 with 2016 were salaries and employee benefits and occupancy, furniture and equipment. As noted in the past few quarters, these increases include previously disclosed market expansion actions by the Company as it has added new, primarily customer-facing, employees and facilities, principally in Berks, Cumberland, Dauphin and Lancaster counties. Salaries and employee benefits totaled $7.4 million and $14.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $6.3 million and $12.5 million for the same periods in 2016. Higher expenses in 2017 were incurred for the aforementioned additional employees, merit increases and increased incentive compensation, increased health care costs and incremental expense for additional share-based awards granted in 2017. In the second quarter of 2016, a reserve of $1.0 million was established for a matter which was resolved in the third quarter of 2016 with the Company's agreement to pay a civil money penalty in that amount to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle administrative proceedings. Other line items within noninterest expenses showed fluctuations attributable to normal business operations between 2017 and 2016. Income Taxes Income tax expense totaled $516 thousand and $940 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $252 thousand and $866 thousand for the same periods in 2016. The Company’s effective tax rate is significantly less than the 34.0% federal statutory rate principally due to tax-exempt income, including interest earned on tax-exempt loans and securities and earnings on the cash value of life insurance policies. The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was 15.0%, compared with 21.0% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The lower effective tax rate for the first half of 2017 compared with 2016 is primarily the result of a larger percentage of tax-exempt income to total income and additional tax credits in 2017, coupled with a larger percentage of non-tax deductible expenses in 2016. In addition, the estimated annual effective tax rate in the first half of 2016 was based on a federal statutory rate of 35%. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company reassessed its estimated annual effective tax rate and changed the base federal statutory rate to 34% in expectation that the Company would not be in the higher tax bracket. FINANCIAL CONDITION Assets totaled $1.47 billion at June 30, 2017, an increase of $60.4 million from $1.41 billion at December 31, 2016 and of $163.6 million from $1.31 billion at June 30, 2016. Loans, which are summarized below, were the principal driver for the growth in total assets at June 30, 2017 from December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. In the June 30 year-over-year comparison, securities available for sale were also a principal growth component, increasing 23.8%, from $324.5 million in 2016 to $401.9 million in 2017. Deposit growth of $43.5 million in the first half of 2017 was the primary source of funding for growth in loans in the period. Year-over-year growth in securities and loans was primarily funded by deposit growth of $108.0 million, coupled with an overall increase in borrowings of $46.8 million and a reduction in cash balances of $25.6 million. Gross loans, excluding those held for sale, totaled $934.4 million at June 30, 2017, increasing $51.0 million, or 5.8% (11.6% annualized), from $883.4 million at December 31, 2016. In comparison with June 30, 2016’s loan balance of $831.9 million, loans increased $102.4 million, or 12.3%. The following table presents loan balances, by loan class within segments, at June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.

The residential mortgage segment also showed substantial growth of $16.0 million (11.8% annualized) during this period. The Company continues to grow in both core markets and new markets through expansion of its sales force and by capitalizing on market disruption caused by the acquisition of some of our competitors by larger institutions. Total deposits grew 3.8% (7.6% annualized) from $1.15 billion at December 31, 2016 to $1.20 billion at June 30, 2017, and increased 9.9% in comparison with $1.09 billion at June 30, 2016, due principally to growth in interest-bearing accounts. The Company continues to increase both noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing deposit relationships from enhanced cash management offerings delivered by its expanded sales force. Shareholders’ Equity Shareholders’ equity totaled $143.3 million at June 30, 2017, an increase of $8.4 million, or 6.2%, from $134.9 million at December 31, 2016. This increase was principally the result of net income totaling $5.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 coupled with a $4.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax, and offset by dividends declared on common stock during the first half of 2017. Asset Quality The allowance for loan losses balance totaled $12.8 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, compared with $13.4 million at June 30, 2016. Management believes the allowance for loan losses to total loans ratio remains adequate at 1.36% as of June 30, 2017. Favorable historical charge-off data and management's emphasis on loan quality have been significant contributors to the determination that a relatively stable allowance for loan losses balance is adequate even as the loan portfolio has been increasing. Asset quality metrics have continued to improve throughout 2016 and 2017. Nonperforming and other risk assets, defined as nonaccrual loans, restructured loans still accruing, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, and other real estate owned totaled $7.4 million at June 30, 2017, a decrease of $943 thousand, or 11.3%, from $8.3 million at December 31, 2016 and $8.3 million, or 52.9%, from $15.7 million at June 30, 2016. Nonaccrual loans decreased $8.9 million from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans totaled 247.1% at June 30, 2017 compared with 181.4% at December 31, 2016, and 95.4% at June 30, 2016, reflecting the decrease in nonaccrual loans. The allowance for loan losses to nonperforming and restructured loans still accruing totaled 200.4% at June 30, 2017, compared with 160.2% at December 31, 2016 and 89.6% at June 30, 2016. Classified loans, or loans rated substandard, doubtful or loss, totaled $21.0 million at June 30, 2017, or approximately 2.2% of total loans, compared with $22.9 million (2.6%) at December 31, 2016 and $20.7 million (2.5%) at June 30, 2016.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-looking Statements: This news release may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, predictions, expectations, or beliefs about events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical facts, including, without limitation, our ability to integrate additional teams across all business lines as we continue expansion of our community banking model into Dauphin, Lancaster and Berks counties and fill a void created in the community banking space from the disruption caused by the acquisition of several competitors, and our belief that we are positioned to create additional long-term shareholder value from these expansion initiatives. Actual results and trends could differ materially from those set forth in such statements and there can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to successfully execute on our strategic expansion east into Dauphin, Lancaster and Berks counties, take advantage of market disruption, and experience sustained growth in loans and deposits or maintain the momentum experienced to date from these actions. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: ineffectiveness of the Company's business strategy due to changes in current or future market conditions; the effects of competition, including industry consolidation and development of competing financial products and services; changes in laws and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; interest rate movements; changes in credit quality; inability to raise capital, if necessary, under favorable conditions; volatilities in the securities markets;  deteriorating economic conditions; the integration of the Company's strategic acquisitions; and other risks and uncertainties, including those detailed in Orrstown Financial Services, Inc.'s (ORRF) Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, under the headings “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Risk Factors” and in other filings made with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The statements are valid only as of the date hereof and Orrstown Financial Services, Inc. (ORRF) disclaims any obligation to update this information. The review period for subsequent events extends up to and includes the filing date of a public company’s financial statements, when filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

About Orrstown

Welcome to Orrstown. It's personal here.




 Orrstown Bank, headquartered in Shippensburg, Pa., is a true local bank. Although Orrstown has the services and perks you’d find at a larger bank, it still has that personal touch.  We get to know our customers so we can provide solutions based on their unique situations. Our customers know they can count on us, and that’s important to us. We greet them by name, and we’re never too busy to take care of them.  At Orrstown, it’s personal. We were established in 1919 in Orrstown, Pa., a small town less than an hour outside of Harrisburg. Until 1981, we only had one branch. Since then,  we've  grown to 22 locations and we’re planning to grow even more. In 2009, we became a publicly traded company (Nasdaq: ORRF).  With nearly $1.3 billion in assets, Orrstown Financial Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Orrstown Bank, provide a full range of financial services including personal banking, business banking, mortgages, retirement and wealth management, and a special selection of services designed for small businesses.

		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Meyer Wilson Law Firm Investigating United Development Funding Claims
Were you sold investments in UDF? Call today.



The investment fraud lawyers at the law firm of Meyer Wilson are investigating
	 potential claims on behalf of investors in United Development Funding
	 (UDF) against the brokerage firms who sold the investments to their customers.


		If you invested in United Development Funding at the recommendation of
		 your broker and lost money, we invite you to contact an investment fraud
		 lawyer at Meyer Wilson today for a free review.
		Fill Out a Free Online Review Form


About UDF
For several years, UDF, a Texas-based non-traded real estate investment
	 trust (REIT), has marketed itself to retail investors on the premise that
	 it offers “unique and fundamentally sound investments in affordable
	 residential real estate.” According to UDF’s website, all
	 UDF investments are sold through brokerage firms. Under securities industry
	 rules, brokerage firms are required to conduct extensive due diligence
	 on any investment that a firm sells to its customers. It has been reported
	 that UDF has raised approximately $1 billion in funding through brokerage
	 firm sales to retail investors in recent years.
The Raid

	According to
	The
Wall Street Journal, federal agents raided UDF’s offices in February, issuing subpoenas
	 to company executives and removing various materials from the premises.
	 A spokesperson for the FBI said that the agents were conducting “law
	 enforcement activity” but declined further comment. No charges have
	 yet been filed.

News of the FBI raid sent shares of UDF’s largest fund, United Development
	 Funding IV, plummeting 54%.
Potential Problems Revealed

	Just two days before the FBI raid,
	The Wall Street Journal published an article highlighting potential problems with UDF IV’s
	 concentrated lending practices. According to the article, although UDF
	 operates in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida, 99% of the UDF
	 IV fund’s portfolio consists of loans made to borrowers in Texas.
	 The article further states that 67% of the balance of UDF IV loans was
	 made to a single borrower, Texas-based Centurion American Development,
	 or Centurion’s affiliates.

In December 2015, a Dallas hedge fund publicly raised questions about UDF
	 on an Internet site. Among the allegations raised by the hedge fund was
	 that UDF had used new investor money to repay investors in UDF’s
	 earlier investment vehicles “consistent with a Ponzi scheme.”
What To Do Next
The lawyers at Meyer Wilson have represented approximately 1,000 investors
	 over the last 15 years and have recovered tens of millions of dollars
	 on their behalf. If you invested money in United Development Funding through
	 the recommendation of a brokerage firm and lost money in those investments,
	 contact the lawyers at Meyer Wilson to discuss your potential recovery
	 options. You might be able to recover your losses against the brokerage
	 firm that sold you the investments. Initial consultations are free and
	 all of our cases are handled on a contingency fee basis.

Read More Client Testimonials Below






I had spoken to a local attorney about my investment losses and he didn't know how to help me, so he referred me to David Meyer. David and his staff were not only professional, but they were also really congenial and pleasant to speak with. Any time I had a question they were always responsive and made sure I understood each step in the process of recovering my losses. My overall experience was positive and I would encourage anyone who even thinks they have been a victim of stockbroker misconduct to call David.

					- S.T.,Canton, Ohio
				

Meyer Wilson represented me in a suit brought last year against my brokerage firm, securing a very fair and equitable settlement for me. I was impressed with the professional manner in which they handled our relationship and kept me aware of developments in the case. I highly recommend them.

					- R.G., M.D.,Cincinnati, Ohio
				





I rolled over my retirement account to my stockbroker when I retired and trusted him to provide me an investment plan that would cover my living expenses and protect my life savings. He sold me a variable annuity and controlled how my retirement was invested in the stock market. I relied on him totally as the expert and I ended up losing a big portion of my savings. I was referred to Meyer Wilson to file my arbitration claim against the brokerage firm. Mr. Meyer and his associates and staff were great to work with. They explained everything to me, walked me through each stage of the arbitration, worked hard to prepare my case, and I am very happy with the outcome.

					- L.B.,Tennessee
				

I really appreciate all of the efforts of the legal team at Meyer & Associates. They were very prompt in responding to me and answering my questions, often the same day. I am happy I received the highest settlement that I think was possible. Thanks for a job exceptionally well done!

					- J.H.,Indiana
				





When the financial advisor we trusted with our life savings lost all of it in the stock market we did not know where to go for help. Fortunately, we found the law firm of Meyer & Associates. They aggressively pursued the brokerage firm responsible and we were delighted with the outcome. We don't know what we would have done without the lawyers and staff at Meyer & Associates - we will always be thankful for what they did for us.

					- Mr. and Mrs. H.,Ohio
				

I am thankful I had the opportunity to work with you and get to know you. Our family cannot thank you enough for the outstanding work you and your firm did to win our case. Your passion, commitment and compassion to win this case for our family were simply amazing. After going to several other attorneys who would not even take the case I was so fortunate to have found you to take the case. Right from the start you had the passion and desire to win this case for us. I have never worked with an attorney or firm as compassionate as yours. I would highly recommend your firm to anyone.

					- G.A.
				





My husband and I needed a law firm with expertise in financial investment fraud, and Meyer Wilson handled everything for us. We were very glad to find Meyer Wilson. Their entire staff made us fill that we were part of the Meyer Wilson Family.

					- A.H.
				

When our broker lost a large portion of our retirement savings, we didn't know where to turn and thought we would just have to accept that we were left with nothing.
We saw an article about Attorney David Meyer and called his office. We were not used to dealing with attorneys and didn't know what to expect, but Mr. Meyer and his staff were kind and kept us well informed about our rights. We were very satisfied with the results they were able to get for us and the short length of time it took to have some of our losses returned. Having the money reinvested has definitely made life easier for us.

					- A.W.,Ohio
				





I was a business litigation attorney for approximately 30 years and practiced law with one of largest law firms in the nation. I have been involved in many large, complex cases, and I believe I have a reasonable understanding of how lawyers and law firms should go about their work.
Everything that David P. Meyer and Associates did for me in connection with my securities arbitration claim was done in a first class manner, much as I would expect from the best large law firms. It has been my pleasure to have dealt with David Meyer and I strongly recommend his firm to anyone who has a potential investment misconduct claim.

					- R.S., Esq.,California
				

At a time in our life when we thought life would be easier because we had worked hard and carefully planned and saved for our "Golden Years", we discovered our stockbroker had lost our entire life's savings. We thought there was no hope of recovering any of it. That's when we were referred to David Meyer and Associates. Mr. Meyer and his staff explained the arbitration process and gave us hope. Thanks to their hard work, the arbitration and settlement process put us back on track. They were a Godsend when we needed them most.

I accepted an early retirement from my large employer after more than 30 years, based on the recommendation of my stockbroker that I had plenty of money to live on. I put every dollar I had into my stockbroker's hand and trusted him and his brokerage firm. As the months went by, I was losing money at a alarming rate and I soon found out that many of my co-workers were losing their retirement savings with the same brokerage firm. I do not remember how I heard about David Meyer & Associates but they came to be my knight in shining armor. Hiring Mr. Meyer's law firm was probably the smartest thing I've done in my life. Dozens of my co-workers hired them too. It took some time to get through the process but David and his firm did a great job for all of us. I can honestly say that I would probably be back to working 40 hours a week again, if not for David's success with our claims.
There's an old saying, "You can't take on City Hall"; well, David did better than that - he took on this large brokerage firm......and won! I have nothing but the highest praise for David Meyer and his staff of very qualified people.

					- R.H.,Ohio
				

"We had never participated in any type of lawsuit before, but after our stockbroker mishandled our investments and nearly lost all of the money it took us over thirty years to save, we felt we needed to do something. We hired Mr. Meyer and he went to bat for us against the brokerage firm. The staff at David Meyer and Associates communicated with us regularly as they led us through the process of recovering our losses. They were always helpful and we felt well served by them. Not knowing what to expect, we were pleased with how fast we were able to obtain a recovery. Hiring Mr. Meyer to help us recover our losses has made retirement easier for us."

					- J.R.,Kentucky
				





I, and many of my coworkers, retired after 30+ years of employment and rolled over our lump-sum retirement to a national brokerage firm. The broker we entrusted with our life savings failed to protect our nest egg and we lost a big portion of our retirement. A group of us all hired David Meyer & Associates to hold the brokerage firm accountable for not investing our retirement properly. Mr. Meyer and his firm got a great result for us and we are now able to enjoy our retirement.

					- B.H.,Texas
				

My husband and I hired a financial planner to ensure the safety of our retirement nest egg, but he lost most of that money through a series of investments that were inappropriate for people at our stage in life. After my husband passed, I didn't know where to turn and had even spoken to a local attorney that did not think there was anything I could even do. I felt like the situation was my fault for trusting the broker. I heard about David Meyer & Associates and he and his staff let me know what my rights were and that there was hope through the arbitration process. They took care of everything and I was surprised at how easy they made it for me to pursue a claim. Mr. Meyer and his staff was always professional and responsive to my calls and they really took their time with me to review paperwork and mad sure that I remained well informed throughout the process. I feel like Mr. Meyer not only helped me to recover my investment losses, but he also helped me to get justice for my late husband.

					- J.S.,Ohio
				





Mr. Meyer was able to help me recover losses from my retirement account that occurred when my stockbroker failed to invest my IRA properly for someone at my stage in life. As they handled my case, Mr. Meyer and his staff were always available to answer my questions and they were responsive to my needs. I felt as if they really cared about me and my situation and I was impressed with their professionalism.

					- L. M.,Florida
				

I trusted my brokerage firm that I have been with for years with money that my father had intended to be invested in safe, secure investments to provide for my mother's living expenses after his passing as well as for his family members. The brokerage firm recommended an investment that was later found to be invested in securities different than had been represented. I was very pleased with the results that Meyer and Associates were able to obtain for me and my family.

					- J.F.,Indiana
				





I was angry when my retirement savings were mismanaged by my stockbroker. I knew I had lost most of my hard-earned money, but I was unsure of what, if anything, I could do about it. My daughter-in-law had heard of Mr. Meyer's law firm so I gave them a call. They supplied me with the information I needed to know about my rights as an investor and why I had a claim to recover some of my losses from the brokerage firm. I was very much impressed with the way they handled my claim and pleased with the result they were able to get for me. It was well worth the call.

					- G.C.,Tennessee
				

I was very pleased with Mr. Meyer’s handing of my arbitration claim. Throughout the process, I felt that I was treated with respect and I always appreciated the extra effort David Meyer and his staff put forth to recover the money my stockbroker had lost. I never felt my relationship with David was limited to an attorney-client relationship. I always thought it was more like a friend helping another friend. They did a tremendous job and when it was over, David was able to get back a lot more money for me than I ever expected. I have kept the firm’s number handy and would tell anyone that has been a victim of stockbroker misconduct to contact Meyer and Associates.

					- C.F.,Ohio
				





We were devastated when our long-time stockbroker inexcusably caused our company's pension plan and profit sharing plans to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in unsuitable investments in just 3 short years with two different brokerage firms. Thankfully, our accountant had heard of Meyer & Associates and referred us to Mr. Meyer for help. Mr. Meyer understood that our employees were the real victims, and he dedicated himself to making the brokerage firms put as much money back into our coffers as possible. I urge anyone who thinks they have been wronged by their stockbroker or brokerage firm to seek the advice of Meyer & Associates - I am so thankful that I did.

					- M.F.,Ohio
				

Our brokerage firm recommended that we mortgage our paid-off home and then convinced us to invest the loan proceeds into unsuitable annuities. The results were devastating. We never imagined that we would be retired, with limited income, and find ourselves faced with a new mortgage payment and large investment losses. Thankfully, we hired Meyer Wilson - they skillfully guided us through the NASD (now FINRA) arbitration process and achieved an outstanding recovery for us. We do not know what we would have done without their help.

					- Mr. and Mrs. R.,Springfield, Ohio
				





From my first call to the firm to the final communication with them was a remarkable experience. The staff listened to my situation with care and concern through our entire journey. I entered with the dark shadow of fear of the unknown and Meyer Wilson walked me through my doubt and fears back into the light of reality and satisfaction. I cannot put into words the sense of security I felt while dealing with my case. The firm exemplifies professionalism in every phase of my journey through the legal system. Thank you Meyer Wilson for your council and support.

					- K.P.,Idaho
				

My wife and I became victims in a ponzi scheme set up by our financial adviser, one we had worked with for many years. He was working with a legitimate investment firm and we had no reason to believe we were being taken. He also covered his tracks very well and even his company was unaware of what he was doing. We tried to recover our losses for over a year but were unsuccessful and every road was a dead end. We heard about Meyer Wilson and contacted them for help. They worked with us extensively over the next months and they were able to recover a large amount of our lost investment. They were in contact with us throughout the whole process and kept us informed of where we stood and what we needed to do. I can't stress enough how much we appreciate all that they have done for us and what a blessing it was to find them. They come highly recommended and you would do well to contact them for assistance.

					- M.L.
				





Meyer & Associates pursued my securities arbitration case with great care and attention. They covered every detail and I am ecstatic about the results. As a lawyer myself, I can appreciate how hard they worked on my behalf. I recommend Meyer & Associates highly and without any reservation.

					- C. Hostler, Esq.,West Virginia
				

I think this is the first time I have used a law firm to resolve issues
 with regard to what I felt was a serious breach of trust and negative
 performance from a financial manager. From the moment I contacted MeyerWilson,
 I was always treated with what felt like genuine respect and real interest
 in my situation. I had some changes of personnel during it all, but the
 new people were equally respectful and competent which made everything
 feel seamless. Being my first time to work with a law firm on this type
 of issue I was constantly surprises at both the competence, skills, respect,
 thoroughness, and the pleasant ease the experience was. I highly recommend
 both the firm and their unusually qualified and helpful people working there.

					- D.G.,Salt Lake City, UT
				





The case I brought to Meyer Wilson involved more of an ethical injustice
	 and had many legal hurdles. Despite this, Mr. Chad Kohler, Esq., explained
	 thoroughly all aspects of my case, advised me using his expertise, and
	 guided me through a mediation process resulting in a satisfactory settlement.
	 Had it not been for the representation of Meyer Wilson, and in particular,
	 Mr. Kohler, I would have never had a resolution.

					- V.B.
				

My experience with Meyer Wilson proved to be a very professional, as well
	 as, personal interaction. Chad Kohler represented my case with the caring
	 and realistic guidance needed to attain a satisfactory resolution during
	 mediation. I appreciate the personal interest and legal expertise he and
	 his staff offered me during a difficult time. I was able to make an informed
	 decision and feel that with the help of Meyer Wilson my case was resolved
	 with the best possible outcome.

	 note funds were a sham, and the broker used the clients’ money to
	 fund a lavish lifestyle that included airplanes, a boat, and various cars
	 and motorcycles. The broker ultimately pleaded guilty to various federal
	 charges and was sentenced to 6.5 years in prison. The brokerage firm agreed
	 to settle the claims even though it alleged that it was unaware of the
	 broker’s misconduct and despite the fact that the daughter did not
	 open a brokerage account with the firm.

	 were victimized by a Ponzi scheme perpetuated by their former stockbroker.

Meyer Wilson recovered $415,000 on behalf of an elderly widow against a
	 large national brokerage firm that failed to process a husband’s
	 written instructions making his wife the beneficiary of two annuities.

$245,000 Recovered for 89-year-old Woman

	 money after Meyer Wilson filed a claim on her behalf against her brokerage
	 firm. The firm's registered representative fraudulently sold her a
	 whole life insurance policy as part of an overall investment scheme that
	 caused her significant losses and was wholly unsuitable. The money recovered
	 was a significant portion of the investments she made into the insurance
	 policy. The attorneys at Meyer Wilson were able to successfully defeat
	 the brokerage firm's motion to dismiss, which argued that claims were
	 not appropriate since the life insurance policy was not a security. The
	 arbitration panel agreed with Meyer Wilson, which argued that the life
	 insurance policy was part of an overall investment strategy recommended
	 to the claimant by her financial adviser.

Ponzi Scheme Losses Returned to California Victims
Meyer Wilson represented a group of individuals who were victims of a Ponzi
	 scheme operated by a financial adviser in California. The broker was affiliated
	 with a large independent broker-dealer during the time he sold numerous

	 case against the firm on behalf of the group of victims and recovered

A large independent broker-dealer entered into a settlement with Meyer
	 Wilson clients relating to the improper sale tenants-in-common interests,
	 or TICs, to three California customers. A TIC is an undivided interest
	 in real property. Many brokerage firms sell TICs to their customers as
	 a way to purportedly invest in commercial real estate ventures like shopping
	 malls. Meyer Wilson's claims focused on the brokerage firm's failure
	 to conduct proper due diligence and misrepresentations made by the brokerage
	 firm's registered representatives downplaying the substantial risks
	 that TICs involve.

Retired Cincinnati Couple Recovers $180,000 in Churning Case
Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims on behalf of a husband and wife
	 who were the victims of a long-time churning scheme perpetuated by their
	 stockbroker involving unit investment trusts (UITs). UITs are similar
	 to mutual funds and intended to be long-term investments, but the broker
	 in this case frequently purchased and held UITs in the customers'
	 accounts customers for only a few months at a time before selling and
	 purchasing different UITs, generating a commission on each purchase and
	 sale. The final settlement negotiated by Meyer Wilson represented a substantial
	 portion of the clients' overall losses.

Meyer Wilson Wins FINRA Arbitration - Brokerage Firm Hilliard Lyons Ordered to Pay $180,000

	 widow whose life savings was invested in various unsuitable investments,
	 including non-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs). A REIT is
	 a company that owns or finances income-producing real estate. A non-traded
	 REIT is not traded on a major stock exchange. Meyer Wilson argued that
	 the investments sold to the widow were unsuitable and that the brokerage
	 firm failed to properly supervise the investment recommendations made
	 by its brokers.

Each private placement ultimately failed and suffered substantial losses.

Illinois Couple Recovers Investment Losses

$650,000 Recovered for Retired Ohio Couple Relating to Whole Life Insurance Policies Sold by Their Financial Advisor
An Ohio financial advisor convinced a retired Ohio couple, both of whom
	 were in their early 70s at the time and completely free of any debt, that
	 to achieve their estate planning goals they needed to take out a $1.2
	 million mortgage on property that they owned to fund three whole life
	 insurance policies. The policies came with combined monthly premiums exceeding
	 $38,500 (or $462,000 per year). The financial advisor assured the couple
	 that the policies would ultimately pay for themselves. About three years
	 later, however, it was apparent that the policies would never work as
	 promised. By that time, the mortgage proceeds were entirely depleted,
	 and the dividends from the policies were still not nearly enough to cover
	 the hefty monthly premiums. Meyer Wilson filed claims on behalf of the
	 couple against the financial advisor’s supervising brokerage firm.
	 The brokerage firm filed a motion to dismiss arguing that it did not have
	 any duty to supervise the sale of whole life insurance. The arbitration
	 panel denied the brokerage firm’s motion. Meyer Wilson ultimately
	 negotiated a settlement recovering nearly all of the couple’s actual losses.





$650,000 Recovered for Investor in Ponzi Scheme
The victim of a large-scale Ponzi scheme in the Midwest recovered $650,000
	 of his investment losses from the brokerage firm responsible for supervising
	 the broker who sold the fraudulent securities. Meyer Wilson filed a FINRA
	 arbitration on behalf of the victim and then negotiated the settlement
	 through the process of mediation by emphasizing all the red flags of the
	 broker’s misconduct that the firm missed in its supervisory responsibilities.

Meyer Wilson Recovers $550,000 in Legal Malpractice Case
Meyer Wilson successfully settled claims against a law firm and its attorney
	 that were brought in court on behalf of two retirees for the legal malpractice
	 of an attorney attempting to represent them in an investment misconduct
	 case. The attorney had no experience representing investors against brokerage
	 firms and failed to timely file an appropriate action on their behalf.
	 The two retirees then hired Meyer Wilson to represent them. The attorneys
	 at Meyer Wilson were able to successfully argue that the clients’
	 underlying investment misconduct case was straightforward and had significant
	 value. The settlement for these clients reflects what should have happened
	 in the underlying case had the attorney properly and timely brought their
	 claims before a FINRA arbitration panel.





Over $500,000 for Texas Investors
Meyer Wilson successfully negotiated individual settlements on behalf of
	 a group of Texas investors who were each sold unsuitable investments by
	 the same stockbroker. Each investor’s portfolio was heavily concentrated
	 in oil-related stocks and sustained significant losses when the energy
	 markets declined in 2015. Many of the investors were retirees who saw
	 their portfolios decline by 50 percent or more. The brokerage firm agreed
	 to settle all of the investors’ claims within less than six months
	 after the claims were filed by Meyer Wilson.

$450,000 Recovered in Broker Theft Case Involving Large National Brokerage Firm
Meyer Wilson recovered $450,000 on behalf of a developmentally impaired
	 individual who was the victim of theft by her stockbroker. The broker
	 – who was later sentenced to five years in prison for his crimes
	 – orchestrated dozens of money transfers directly from the victim’s
	 brokerage accounts to outside third-party bank accounts that were set
	 up in the victim’s name and over which the broker controlled. From
	 there, the broker stole the victim’s money. Although the victim’s
	 brokerage accounts were entirely depleted within a short three-month timeframe,
	 documents obtained by Meyer Wilson during the course of the case showed
	 that the brokerage firm never made a single compliance inquiry into any
	 of the withdrawals. The brokerage firm agreed to settle the victim’s
	 claims for an amount in excess of the victim’s total losses.





Brokerage Firm Pays $262,500 Relating to Improper Sales of Alternative Investments
A large independent brokerage firm settled with Meyer Wilson clients relating
	 to its improper sale of several private placements and real estate investment
	 trusts. The claims on behalf of these investors focused on the lack of
	 due diligence performed on the recommended products, as well as misrepresentations
	 of the risks (or lack thereof) involved. The couple’s entire life
	 savings was decimated after they agreed to the investment proposal on
	 the belief that it was suitable for them.

Utah Retiree Recovers $172,500 in Case Involving Illiquid Alternative Investments
A 74-year-old’s savings was wiped out as a result of a highly inappropriate
	 investment plan implemented by his broker in a non-traded equipment leasing
	 fund and a non-traded real estate investment trust. His advisor continued
	 for years to misrepresent the nature and value of the investments, up
	 until the broker was fired from the firm. Meyer Wilson successfully defeated
	 a motion to dismiss by the brokerage firm and negotiated a settlement
	 of $172,500.





Meyer Wilson Settles Case Against Brokerage Firm 30 days After Filing FINRA Arbitration
An investor who suffered a 98% loss of his account while following an investment

		Recovering Losses
		Caused By Investment Misconduct





Contingency Fee Basis
No Fee Unless We Win Your Case

	At Meyer Wilson, our
	securities fraud lawyers only work cases on a contingency fee basis, meaning that there is no fee
	 unless a positive recovery is obtained in your case. If and when our legal
	 team is able to win your case and secure financial compensation, attorney
	 fees will be based on an agreed upon percentage or sum. We do not charge
	 a retainer fee or consultation fee and there is no cost for the investigative
	 work we do prior to offering you representation. To put it simply;
	if we don't win, you don't pay.

Why contingent fees?
We choose to work cases on a conditional fee agreement for several reasons,
	 all of which are intended to ultimately benefit the people we serve. As
	 evident by our numerous successful case resolutions and positive client
	 testimonials, our use of contingent fees is another prominent aspect in
	 our firm's ability to satisfy our clients and obtain the results they need.

Focusing on Your Experience 
 We value the trust our clients place in our firm and attorneys, and we
	 reciprocate by doing everything in our power to make their experience
	 with us as smooth and comfortable as possible. We know that when individual
	 and institutional investors come to use after having been bilked by stockbrokers,
	 brokerage firms, and other entities, times can be chaotic. We understand
	 that, in many cases, our clients' livelihoods, professional careers
	 and businesses, and financial futures may be at stake. With these high
	 stakes in mind, we focus on doing our part to alleviate their worries
	 and concerns. At Meyer Wilson, we want you make your legal experience
	 and time with us and rewarding as the results you obtain. Eschewing up-front
	 fees is only one of the ways in which we accomplish this goal.


Leveling the Playing Field 
 From a logistical viewpoint, working your case on a contingency fee basis
	 allows our firm to level the playing field with some of the largest, most
	 financially powerful institutions in the country. Often, our clients'
	 claims involve immensely powerful legal opponents who have access to seemingly
	 limitless resources and powerful legal teams. By pursuing various legal
	 avenues on our own funds, we are not limited by what you are able to pursue
	 had you been required to foot the bill - these powerful entities cannot
	 force you into submission when you have our firm by your side.


Confidence in Our Abilities 
 While we view contingent fees as the ethically and logistically correct
	 avenue to take, we know that they also serve another purpose. They show
	 prospective clients that we are confident in our abilities to
	obtain successful resolutions, recover losses, and win cases. We want our clients to feel that they have the best at work for them
	 and their case, and we believe that our use of contingent fees exemplifies
	 this idea. We put our money where our mouth is and we don't shy away
	 from a challenge.

We intentionally keep our caseload small, ensuring you the best service.

Discuss Your Case with an Investment Fraud Attorney

	Having taken the contingency fee basis approach since our firm's inception,

	 an essential driving force behind our ability to secure successful results.
	 If you have any questions about our fee agreement, or if you wish to discuss
	 your personal case, please do not hesitate to
