The performance quoted represents past performance, which is no indication of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Returns shown at net asset value have all distributions reinvested. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that shares, on any given day or when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Therefore, there can be no assurance of future results.

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

Description[edit]
Lord Abbett is a privately owned, limited liability company with 64 active partners (as of March 31, 2017). Managing Partner Daria L. Foster leads the firm and is responsible for setting strategic direction and business management. Robert A. Lee, Partner and Chief Investment Officer, is responsible for directing the portfolio management, research, and trading activities for the firm’s equity and fixed-income strategies. Lee assumed the role of CIO on July 1, 2016, after former CIO Robert I. Gerber retired. [2]
The firm focuses solely on actively managed investment portfolios. Lord Abbett’s strategies are available within separate and sub-advised accounts, commingled and mutual funds, and managed account platforms.[3][4]
History[edit]
On November 18, 1929, several weeks after the stock market crash that ushered in the Great Depression, Andrew James Lord and his associates created Lord, Westerfield & Co., Inc., with headquarters at 68 William Street, a few blocks from the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1931, the Westerfields resigned from the company. Leon Abbett, a member of the founding group and the son of a former two-time New Jersey governor and state Supreme Court justice, provided the capital contribution that enabled the firm to continue. Two years later, the name of the company was changed to Lord, Abbett & Co.[5]
In 1932, Lord created an investment trust, American Business Shares, which is now known as the Lord Abbett Income Fund. Two years later, the Lord Abbett Affiliated Fund was launched.[6]
Lord Abbett, along with other investment companies, made important contributions to the drafting of the Investment Company Act of 1940, which defines the responsibilities and limitations of investment firms. Citation:.[7]
In 1971, Lord Abbett launched the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund, one of the first funds to invest in a combination of fixed−income securities. The firm launched its institutional business in 1976, with the introduction of a large-cap value product for an institutional client.[8]
In the early 1990s, fund performance and asset growth slowed, prompting the company to reorganize. Managing Partner Bob Dow (who had managed the Lord Abbett Bond Debenture Fund) increased the number of partners and expanded the mutual fund lineup to include international stocks and large-cap growth stocks. Assets rose from $17 billion in 1996, when Dow took over, to more than $100 billion in 2007. Daria Foster, who succeeded Dow in 2007, continued to diversify the company’s fund offerings, lowered costs and fees for many of the funds, and expanded the distribution channels that sell the funds.[9]
In 1987, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters from Wall Street to the General Motors Building on Fifth Avenue in New York City, where it would stay for the next decade. In 2000, Lord Abbett moved its headquarters to Jersey City, New Jersey.
As of March 31, 2017, Lord Abbett managed $143.5 billion in assets, which includes about $1.7 billion for which Lord Abbett provided investment models to managed account sponsors.
International Products[edit]
In May 2014, Lord Abbett launched a suite of UCITS [Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities] funds to provide non-U.S. institutions and non-U.S. resident investors with access to select Lord Abbett investment strategies. The funds are listed on the Irish Stock Exchange.[10]

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.
