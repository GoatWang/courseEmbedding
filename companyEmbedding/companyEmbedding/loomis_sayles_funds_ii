 Primary Benchmark: Bloomberg Barclays US Government/Credit IndexPortfolio ManagementDan Fuss, CFA, CICMatt Eagan, CFAElaine StokesBrian KennedyTotal Fund Assets (as of 6/30/2017): $13.7 billionLipper Category: General Bond FundsMorningstar Category: Multisector BondStrategy Highlights
Value driven, opportunistic approach
Long-term investment horizon
Allocations to out-of-benchmark securities can provide value and diversification
Initial portfolio position in any one holding is typically 0-3%; 5% maximum position size
Investment Strategy
Under normal circumstances, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings made for investment purposes) in fixed income securities
May invest up to 35% of assets in below investment grade fixed income securities
May invest up to 20% of its assets in equity securities such as common stocks and preferred stocks (with up to 10% of its assets in common stocks)
May invest any portion of its assets in securities of Canadian issuers and up to 20% of assets in foreign securities, including emerging markets
About Risk
Fixed income securities may carry one or more of the following risks: credit, interest rate (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), inflation and liquidity. 
Below investment grade fixed income securities may be subject to greater risks (including the risk of default) than other fixed income securities. 
Foreign and emerging market securities may be subject to greater political, economic, environmental, credit, currency and information risks. Foreign securities may be subject to higher volatility than US securities due to varying degrees of regulation and limited liquidity. These risks are magnified in emerging markets.
Currency exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may cause the value of the fund’s investments to decline.
Equity securities are volatile and can decline significantly in response to broad market and economic conditions.   
Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against a loss.1 As of the most recent prospectus, the investment advisor has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses once the expense cap of the fund has been exceeded. This arrangement is set to expire on 1/31/18. Transfer Agent Fee waivers for Class N are contractual and are set to expire 1/31/18. When an expense cap has not been exceeded, the fund may have similar expense ratios and/or yields. 2The 30-day SEC yield is a standardized calculation, calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share at the end of the period and annualizing the result. A subsidized 30-day SEC yield reflects the effect of fee waivers and expense reimbursements. The SEC yield is not based upon distributions of the fund and actual income distributions may be higher or lower than the 30-day SEC yield amounts. Unsubsidized 30-day SEC yield is calculated using the gross expenses of the fund. Gross expenses do not include any fee waivers or reimbursement.The Bloomberg Barclays US Government/Credit Bond Index includes securities in the Government and Credit Indices. The Government Index includes treasuries (i.e., public obligations of the US Treasury that have remaining maturities of more than one year) and agencies (i.e., publicly issued debt of US Government agencies, quasi-federal corporations, and corporate or foreign debt guaranteed by the US Government). The Credit Index includes publicly issued US corporate and foreign debentures and secured notes that meet specified maturity, liquidity, and quality requirements. Indexes are unmanaged. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
3. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
4. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
