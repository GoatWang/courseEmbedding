      Thomas Rankin Associates     MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS   • Advertising •Public Relations •Direct Marketing • Collateral Materials   TRA Mission  To help our clients achieve theirmarketing objectives through the development and implementation ofstrategically sound, functionally integrated, and creatively drivencommunications programs. info@trankin.com ©2010Thomas Rankin Associates    


       PR and Propaganda                            TRA ADVISOR		    PR AND PROPAGANDA: ON THE ETHICS OF TRUTH by Tom Rankin, APR						    President, Thomas Rankin Associates What's the difference between PR and propaganda? In a word, truth. In the opinion of this humble worker for same, if what you're "spinning" has a solid basis in fact, you're doing PR. If not, it's propaganda. Plain and simple. But what is 'truth', not in the larger, cosmic sense, but in terms of practical, everyday reality? And as a marketer/practitioner, what are your obligations for determining it? According to the Code of Ethics of the Public Relations Society of America, members have an obligation to "Investigate the truthfulness and accuracy of information released on behalf of those represented." So what does this mean, really? I just opened a news release at random from our files and read the following claim about the MMQ 6100 form measuring system from Mahr Federal: "The system is designed to easily check roundness, circular flatness, concentricity, perpendicularity, parallelism and coaxiality." OK, I haven't done this, but I suspect it would be very easy to verify that the instrument does indeed make these checks. But how about some of the additional claims: "Overall spindle accuracy is ± .035 microns (± 1.4 microinches). Tilt centering table capabilities include a centering range of ± 2 millimeters (± .079") and tilting range of ± .6"." How am I to verify that, or do I even have to? Take another example, this from a biotech client: "The PolyGenyx HaploScan technology is the only robust, direct measurement, high-throughput SNP haplotyping approach that is not dependent on family samples, allele frequency, sex chromosomes or computer algorithms." Through working with this client, I have some understanding of what SNP haplotypes are (for those who may be curious, they are related, genetically transmittable groupings of SNPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms). But it would take a PhD in molecular biology to even understand the company's "Proof of Principle" for this technology, much less set out to verify it. The bottom line is that in many instances, we really cannot "investigate the truthfulness" of our client's claims. We must take them on faith, trust their claims because we trust them. Does this make us chumps, then? In our enthusiasm to do good work for our clients, do we risk crossing into an ethical no-man's land? And if so, what then separates us from those Nazi propagandists of old who also took certain things on faith and also trusted those who led them? It's an uncomfortable position to be in, admittedly, but it is also a real one and should be recognized as such by those who practice not only PR, but marketing communications in general. However, two other things also help make the process somewhat self-correcting and mitigate the risk of taking truth on faith. One is another provision in the PRSA Code, which obligates practitioners to "Act promptly to correct erroneous communications." This can take many forms, from sending a simple correction to the media, to--as in the case of a client who intentionally provides false and misleading information--publicly resigning the account and repudiating all work that has been released on their behalf. This is not good "PR" for the offending entity, even in the world of propaganda. The other is an even stronger incentive for honesty in making technical claims, and serves as the unspoken "or else" that follows the ubiquitous "trust us." This is the reaction in the usually tight-knit, technical/industrial marketplace to making false and misleading claims: for both client and practitioner, the result is total and complete censure. Once a company or PR practitioner looses an editor's trust, he or she is unlikely to get it back, and releases from that company are unlikely to ever see print. And if both practitioner and editor are hoodwinked, customers will certainly not be, at least not for very long, and word of their disenchantment will be heard loud and long among engineering circles. So does this mean that truth will always win out and the world is filled with goodness and light? Not in the least. We must be vigilant. But it does mean that we are not alone in our faith and that there are reactions in equal proportion to our actions. That, at least, is a comfort. ©2005 Thomas Rankin Associates       MarCom in Hard Times: How to Cut Your Budget and Improve Results  Why a Marketing Communications             Firm?

Planning enhances creativity. The best ads and sales literature are always those that hit the 'hot buttons' of your customers and prospects. What those buttons are, and how best to hit them requires a thorough knowledge of your products, your markets and your customers' needs--knowledge acquired through the research involved in strategic planning. So too with PR: the best news is always real news. News with substance, not hype. By developing an in-depth understanding of your organization and the informational resources at our disposal, we can help you identify newsworthy subjects, prepare them with the style, format and creativity required, and then deal with the press to see that these materials receive the widest and most prominent coverage. But strategic planning has another benefit as well--cost effectiveness. With the number of publications, shows, conferences, etc., available, there are always more opportunities to spend marketing dollars than there are dollars to spend. Thorough strategic planning helps maximize existing resources, no matter what your level of expenditure. ©2004 Thomas Rankin Associates              MarCom in Hard Times: How to Cut Your Budget and Improve Results  Why a Marketing Communications             Firm?

Few companies can afford to advertise effectively in all the publications serving all of their markets. However, developing and distributing professionally prepared PR materials can generate coverage—and inquiries—far beyond the scope of even the most ambitious advertising program. Today public relations is widely acknowledged as the premier strategic marketing tool for technology. Strategic marketing PR is a highly sophisticated process that utilizes a large number of tools integrated into a single, cohesively driven plan. These tools  include everything from trade feature articles and case histories, press tours, direct marketing pieces and letters, to product literature and web sites, and yes, even news releases and traditional advertising. Thomas Rankin Associates is a full-service marketing communications firm with over twenty years experience helping companies succeed in their marketing efforts. We have developed materials that have helped launch new ventures and established others as preeminent market leaders.     Here are some of the things PR can do for you:  • Generate awareness of your company among your target audiences • Build credibility�for your company, your products or technology • Educate prospects and customers on the efficacy of your products or technology • Publicize collaborations and joint ventures • Build reputation within the market to help attract and impress investors • Establish your company brand and help sell your products and services • Gain visibility for key executives, promote their issues and ideas • Position your company as a market leader • Introduce new technology, products and services • Generate inquiries that lead to sales         prLinks   Feature Articles Newsletters News Releases     Public Relations PR Planning Guide Collateral Materials      Home | TRA         Press Room | Portfolio | Services         | TRA Advisor | About         TRA | e-mail Us         Thomas Rankin Associates     MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS   • Advertising •Public Relations •Direct Marketing • Collateral Materials   TRA Mission  To help our clients achieve theirmarketing objectives through the development and implementation ofstrategically sound, functionally integrated, and creatively drivencommunications programs. info@trankin.com ©2010Thomas Rankin Associates

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Virginia:













Does Rankin Thomas Dean T/A carry a valid contracting license?



In Virginia all remodeling and construction work with a cost of $1000 and up, requires a licensed contractor. There are three classes of license for contractors, from A to C. These are based on the size and scope of projects. 
Rankin Thomas Dean T/A currently holds license 2705003154 (Highway/Heavy), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Virginia?



All applicants for A and B contractor licenses are required to complete a pre-license education course that has been approved by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation's Board for Contractors. Additionally contractors must prove at least 2 years of work experience in their specific trade. 











Your liability risk when hiring Rankin Thomas Dean T/A



Licensed contractors in the state of Virginia are not required to carry general liabilty or workers' compensation insurance. It is always a good idea to only hire contractors that have current general liabilty and workers' compensation policies. Request copies of the insurance certifcates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Rankin Thomas Dean T/A



Virginia does offer support to homeowners for construction projects gone wrong. The Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act provides relief to eligible consumers who have incurred losses through the improper or dishonest conduct of a licensed residential contractor. The Recovery Fund is supported entirely by assessments paid by licensed contractors, not by any tax revenues. Filing a claim does not guarantee payment.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Virginia,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids.Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process.Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.
