      Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-JP4 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$35,667,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$129,067,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$215,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$52,478,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$758,206,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$61,106,000a class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$61,106,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49,882,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$56,117,000b class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$22,447,000b class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      The following classes are not expected to be rated:
    

      --$17,459,000a class F;
    

      --$32,423,640a class NR.
    

      a) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      b) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 29, 2016.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 40 loans secured by 72 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of $997,640,641 as of 
      the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JP Morgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association, Starwood Mortgage Funding VI LLC, 
      Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance LLC, and Ladder Capital Finance LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance, asset 
      summary reviews on 100.0% of the pool, and cash flow analysis of 92.7% 
      of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 1.28x and 99.4%, respectively, are better 
      than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 
      1.20x and 105.6%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: Three loans, representing 21.8% of 
      the pool have investment-grade credit opinions. Hilton Hawaiian Village 
      (9.4%), the largest loan in the pool, has an investment-grade credit 
      opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a stand-alone basis. 9 West 57th (6.3%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf'* on a stand-alone basis. 
      Moffett Gateway (6.0%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'BBB-sf'* on a stand-alone basis.
    

      Highly Concentrated by Loan Size and Property Type: The largest 10 loans 
      account for 56.3% of the pool, which is above the YTD 2016 and 2015 
      averages of 54.6% and 49.3%, respectively. Combined retail, office and 
      hotel properties consist of 89.0% of the transaction, which is above the 
      YTD 2016 combined total of 74.7%.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.0% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMCC 
      2016-JP4 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A+sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could occur. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as 
      prepared by Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence described 
      in Form 15E focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an 
      impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions.

      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Lower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than 
      those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 1.28x and 99.4%, respectively, are better 
      than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 
      1.20x and 105.6%, respectively.


                                        








Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: Three loans, representing 21.8% of 
      the pool have investment-grade credit opinions. Hilton Hawaiian Village 
      (9.4%), the largest loan in the pool, has an investment-grade credit 
      opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a stand-alone basis. 9 West 57th (6.3%) has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf'* on a stand-alone basis. 
      Moffett Gateway (6.0%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 
      'BBB-sf'* on a stand-alone basis.


                                        








Highly Concentrated by Loan Size and Property Type: The largest 10 loans 
      account for 56.3% of the pool, which is above the YTD 2016 and 2015 
      averages of 54.6% and 49.3%, respectively. Combined retail, office and 
      hotel properties consist of 89.0% of the transaction, which is above the 
      YTD 2016 combined total of 74.7%.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.0% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.


                                        








Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMCC 
      2016-JP4 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'A+sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could occur. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 11.


                                        








USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10


                                        








Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as 
      prepared by Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence described 
      in Form 15E focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an 
      impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions.

Copyright Â© 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

Wells Fargo Mortgage Loans Review 2017

January 4, 2017

Finding the Right Mortgage, Mortgages




You can trust that we maintain strict editorial integrity in our writing and assessments; however, we receive compensation when you click on links to products from our partners and get approved. Here's how we make money.

Wells Fargo Mortgage is the 800-pound gorilla of home loans. But standing next to this gorilla is a big elephant in the room.
Wells Fargo has been the leading originator and servicer of residential mortgages for 24 out of the past 25 years. The bank has a loan product selection that is long and wide. Last year, it financed one of every eight home loans in America.
âWeâre not a perfect company. We made a mistakeâ
But in 2016, Wells Fargo suffered a costly and embarrassing corporate setback. After news spread that thousands of employees set up as many as 2 million unauthorized customer accounts in a five-year cross-selling scheme, the bank is struggling to regain consumer confidence.
And on Oct. 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $50 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit alleging the bank overcharged 250,000 customers for mortgage appraisal fees.
âWells Fargo is a great company, and itâs been a great company for over 160 years,â says Greg Gwizdz, national sales manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. âBut weâre not a perfect company. We made a mistake. And I think it has been well documented that we have made corrections based on that mistake.â
He says the bank has changed its compensation policies, given refunds to customers, reviewed sales practices and âtaken steps to change the organization to make sure that that doesnât happen again.â
If youâre considering Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, hereâs what you need to know.

Hal M. Bundrick, CFP



NerdWallet's rating: 3.5 / 5


AT A GLANCEA full range of traditional and specialty mortgages.Minimum credit score of 620, though alternative credit data may be considered for certain loan products.A first-time homebuyer program allows down payments as low as 3% plus âexpanded credit criteria.â




Get started 





Compare Wells Fargo with other lenders.
A full product mortgage lender
Wells Fargo offers the extended list of mortgage products youâd expect from a âbig boxâ lender. Beyond conventional mortgages, home equity lines of credit and government loans from the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Affairs and Department of Agriculture, Wells Fargo Mortgage offers:

Jumbo loans on up to 89.9% of a homeâs value, with support provided by a specialized private mortgage banking team.
Renovation loans, with financing based on after-home-improvement value built into purchase or refi loans.
New construction home loans, with options for an extended rate lock during the building period.
Relocation and employee mortgage programs for many large companies.
A loan program with special benefits for eligible union members.

The Union Plus Mortgage program is available to 59 national and international labor unions and 30,000 local unions. Participants get a $500 award card on a purchase loan or a $300 award card on a refinance.Â âIf you [become] disabled, unemployed or your union goes on strike, you can apply for a grant and interest-free loan to make your mortgage payment,â Gwizdz says.
Programs for first-time or declined homebuyers
Wells Fargoâs yourFirst Mortgage offers down payments as low as 3% on fixed-rate mortgages, expanded credit criteria and incentives for homebuyer education.
âFrom a credit perspective, this would be [considering] things like utility bills and other forms of credit, in addition to just a standard credit report,â Gwizdz says. âAnd we provide an eighth lower interest rate (0.125%) if consumers go through our homebuyer education classes.â
Gwizdz says these classes arenât for learning about mortgages and the mortgage process.Â âItâs really learning about being a homeowner and understanding everything that comes with that: the taxes and the insurance and the maintenance â and saving money because, guess what, the furnace is going to break, and the roof is going to leak.â
Meanwhile, the My Home Roadmap program offers free credit counseling for customers who have been turned down for credit or have decided not to apply for a mortgage. It offers a referral for up to two hours of free counseling with a certified credit counselor to discuss your situation.

Wells Fargo mortgage process
You canât get a prequalification or complete a mortgage application online at Wells Fargo. While the bankâs website offers some affordability tools, educational videos and national mortgage rates, thatâs pretty much as far as you can go online.
Once youâre ready to make an application, you can sign into yourLoanTracker, the online bridge between you and your Wells Fargo Mortgage loan advisor. After you apply in person or over the phone, this is where you can track your applicationâs status and exchange information and documents via computer or mobile device. There are also e-signature capabilities.
Even though the lending process and timeline are typical, the online interface can save a lot of the time you otherwise might spend on taking or mailing documents to a loan office.
Gwizdz says technology upgrades are in the works, with âfull online capabilitiesâ coming soon.

What Wells Fargo does best

Wells Fargo offers a deep product bench for borrowers at every financial stage in life.
Specialty loan programs target first-time homebuyers, union members and others.
While some other large banks areÂ growing wary of mortgage lending, Wells Fargo maintains a dominant position.

Where Wells Fargo falls short

Borrowers canât yet apply for a mortgage online.
With a long list of government actions, the embattled bank has an uphill climb to regain consumer trust.

Wells Fargo has a world-class selection of mortgage products and deep resources for customers to draw upon, but the fact remains that this bank has a lot of baggage. While employees are putting on brave faces and working to regain trust, homebuyersÂ may find it hard to put their largest purchase in the hands of Wells Fargo Mortgage.
âWhat I say to my team is, âAt this point, our actions have to speak louder than our words,'â Gwizdz says. âAnd all we can do is continue to provide great service to all of our customers and give it some time, and we believe weâll win back the trust of our customers. But we have to earn it back.â

NerdWalletâs star ratings for mortgage lenders are awarded based on our evaluation of the products and services that lenders offer to consumers who are actively shopping for the best mortgage. The six key areas we evaluated include the loan types and loan products offered, online capabilities, online mortgage rate information, customer service and the number of complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a percentage of loans issued. We also awarded lenders up to one bonus star for a unique program or borrower focus that set them apart from other lenders. To ensure consistency, our ratings are reviewed by multiple people on the NerdWallet Mortgages team.

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-JP4; Presale IssuedBusiness WireNovember 29, 2016ReblogShareTweetShareCHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Link to Fitch Ratings' Report: J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-JP4 (US CMBS)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/890559Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-JP4 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as follows:--$35,667,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$129,067,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$215,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$266,136,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$52,478,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$758,206,000a class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$61,106,000a class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$59,858,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$61,106,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$49,882,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$105,999,000ab class X-C 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$56,117,000b class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$22,447,000b class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable.The following classes are not expected to be rated:--$17,459,000a class F;--$32,423,640a class NR.a) Notional amount and interest only.b) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of Nov. 29, 2016.The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, primary assets of which are 40 loans secured by 72 commercial properties having an aggregate principal balance of $997,640,641 as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JP Morgan Chase Bank, National Association, Starwood Mortgage Funding VI LLC, Benefit Street Partners CRE Finance LLC, and Ladder Capital Finance LLC.Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, including site inspections on 79.5% of the properties by balance, asset summary reviews on 100.0% of the pool, and cash flow analysis of 92.7% of the pool.KEY RATING DRIVERSLower Fitch Leverage: The pool's leverage statistics are lower than those of other recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and Fitch loan to value (LTV) of 1.28x and 99.4%, respectively, are better than the year-to-date (YTD) 2016 average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.20x and 105.6%, respectively.Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loan: Three loans, representing 21.8% of the pool have investment-grade credit opinions. Hilton Hawaiian Village (9.4%), the largest loan in the pool, has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a stand-alone basis. 9 West 57th (6.3%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'AAAsf'* on a stand-alone basis. Moffett Gateway (6.0%) has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf'* on a stand-alone basis.Highly Concentrated by Loan Size and Property Type: The largest 10 loans account for 56.3% of the pool, which is above the YTD 2016 and 2015 averages of 54.6% and 49.3%, respectively. Combined retail, office and hotel properties consist of 89.0% of the transaction, which is above the YTD 2016 combined total of 74.7%.RATING SENSITIVITIESFor this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.0% below the most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMCC 2016-JP4 certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A+sf' could occur. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could occur. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities on page 11.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10Fitch was provided with Form ABS Due Diligence-15E (Form 15E) as prepared by Ernst & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence described in Form 15E focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and it did not have an impact on Fitch's analysis or conclusions.Read MoreAdditional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Applicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Analyzing Large Loans in U.S. Commercial Mortgage Transactions (pub. 18 Aug 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/885802Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower U.S. and Canadian Commercial Mortgage Transactions (pub. 01 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882237Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130Rating Criteria for Structured Finance Servicers (pub. 01 Jul 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/884140Rating Criteria for U.S. Commercial Mortgage Servicers (pub. 14 Feb 2014)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/735382U.S. and Canadian Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance Criteria (pub. 11 Nov 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/889634Related ResearchJPMCC 2016-JP4 -- Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/890955Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1015483ABS Due Diligence Form 15E 1https://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf15E_frame.cfm?pr_id=1015483&flm_nm=15e_1015483_1.pdfSolicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1015483Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
