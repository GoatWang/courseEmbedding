Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







Research and Markets has exceptional standards in terms of customer service. Stephen was my contact since

                         an initial enquiry last October. He never failed to reply promptly and efficiently. The information provided has always been clear and to the point. This quality of service extends to Thomas at the Orders Department. I will be happy to order publications from Research and Markets again if the situation arises.

HONOLULU, May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. (NYSE:    ALEX) ("A&B" or "Company") today announced consolidated income from continuing operations available to A&B shareholders, net of taxes, of $4.4 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $3.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016. Results for the first quarter of 2017 included $3.7 million of after-tax costs ($4.8 million pre-tax), or $0.07 per diluted share, related to the evaluation of a real estate investment trust ("REIT") conversion. 








"We made important strategic progress in the first quarter as we continued to identify and execute on growth opportunities in our Commercial Real Estate ("CRE") segment and advanced our evaluation of a possible REIT conversion. Within CRE, same-store net operating income ("NOI") improved compared to last year's first quarter. In addition, we renewed two major leases on favorable terms, moved forward redevelopment projects at Lau Hala Shops and Pearl Highlands Center and, importantly, announced the development of Ho`okele Shopping Center, a 94,000-square-foot, Safeway-anchored retail center in Kahului, Maui—all of which will advance our strategic objective of increasing recurring earnings from our commercial portfolio," said Chris Benjamin, president & chief executive officer. "REIT evaluation costs and other organizational initiatives will continue to weigh on consolidated earnings for the balance of the year, but underlying CRE performance was strong. Land Operations posted a modest loss due primarily to a noncash write down of a solar facility investment to account for tax benefits received, while Materials & Construction was challenged by lower material sales and paving margins."
"We are taking positive steps to improve performance throughout the organization. In CRE, we're bringing property management and leasing in house to achieve enhanced accountability and more effective management, while at Grace Pacific we're undertaking a comprehensive performance improvement initiative. All of this is progressing along with the REIT evaluation, which we expect to conclude within the next few months," said Benjamin.
First Quarter 2017 and Recent Highlights
Commercial Real Estate

Operating Profit/ Same-Store NOI. Increased operating profit 9.2% to $14.3 million in 1Q17 from $13.1 million in 1Q16 and increased same-store NOI by 2.5%.1 
Occupancy. Portfolio occupancy remained stable at 94%. 
Leasing. Executed 43 leases in the quarter. Cash re-leasing spreads averaged a positive 13.3% on comparable leases. 
Redevelopment/Repositioning. Commenced construction work at the 48,400-square-foot Lau Hala Shops (former Kailua Macy's) and the 6,300-square-foot Pearl Highlands Center food court. Eighty-seven percent of the GLA at Lau Hala Shops and 55% of the GLA at the Pearl Highlands Center food court are under lease or letter of intent. 
Development for Hold. In February 2017, announced the development of the 94,000-square-foot, Safeway-anchored Ho`okele Shopping Center on 8.9 acres of A&B's lands adjacent to Maui Business Park. The Company projects a 7.5-8.5% stabilized yield on cost of $41.9 million. 
Dispositions. In January, sold the 16,600-square-foot Maui Clinic Building for $3.4 million.

Land Operations

Development. Closed the sale of a Maui Business Park parcel (1.04 acres) for $2.4 million. Joint venture closings included two units at Ka Milo and two townhomes at The Collection. 
Parcel Sales. Closed the sale of an urban-zoned vacant parcel (0.8 acres) on Maui for $1.6 million.

Materials & Construction

Operating Profit/Adjusted EBITDA. Earned operating profit of $5.6 million, compared to $8.0 million for the first quarter of 2016, and Adjusted EBITDA of $7.9 million1, compared to $10.4 million1 for the first quarter of 2016. 
Backlog. Grace's backlog at March 31, 2017 was $213.2 million2, compared to $242.9 million2 at December 31, 2016. 
Performance Improvement Initiative. Kicked off a comprehensive performance improvement initiative.

Financial Results
Consolidated
The Company reported consolidated income from continuing operations available to A&B shareholders, net of taxes, of $4.4 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $3.7 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016. Results for the first quarter of 2017 included $3.7 million of after-tax costs ($4.8 million pre-tax), or $0.07 per diluted share, related to the evaluation of a REIT conversion, and a noncash write down of a solar facility investment to account for tax benefits received, which amounted to $1.2 million after taxes ($2.0 million pre-tax), or $0.02 per diluted share. The Company recorded $2.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, of tax benefits related to the adoption of a new accounting requirement in the fourth quarter of 2016 to prospectively include excess tax benefits related to share-based awards in income taxes. These excess tax benefits previously were recorded in equity. 
Net income attributable to A&B shareholders (including discontinued operations) was $6.3 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss attributable to A&B shareholders of $7.5 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2016. In addition to the items cited previously, results for the first quarter of 2017 included $2.4 million of after-tax income from discontinued Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar (HC&S) operations. Results for the first quarter of 2016 included $10.8 million of after-tax losses from discontinued HC&S operations. 
Revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $93.2 million, compared to revenue of $91.4 million for the first quarter of 2016. The increase in revenue primarily is attributable to increased development and parcel sales, partially offset by lower materials and construction sales revenue and lower commercial real estate revenue.
Segment Performance First Quarter 2017 ("1Q17") vs. First Quarter 2016 ("1Q16")
Commercial Real Estate. CRE performed well in 1Q17, posting operating profit of $14.3 million, up 9.2%, compared to $13.1 million in 1Q16, primarily due to acquisition costs for Manoa Marketplace included in 1Q16, lower depreciation expenses and increased same-store performance. Same-store NOI increased 2.5%1 compared to 1Q16. Improvements in same-store performance for Hawaii retail, office and ground leases were partially offset by two Maui industrial tenant terminations and the downsizing of a mainland industrial tenant by 154,000 square feet in July 2016 (118,000 square feet, or 77%, of this vacancy was re-leased in February 2017).  There is no change to the Company's previous guidance of a 3 to 4 % increase in same-store NOI for the full-year 2017. For the quarter, Hawaii properties produced 87% of total NOI and mainland properties produced 13%. 
Hawaii occupancy improved in 1Q17 to 94% from 93% in 1Q16, and mainland occupancy fell from 95% in 1Q16 to 94% in 1Q17 due to the above-mentioned mainland industrial tenant downsizing. Overall portfolio occupancy was 94%, consistent with 1Q16. 
In 1Q17, the Company executed 43 leases, 33 of which were comparable (either renewals or new leases of the same space within 12 months) and were renewed/re-leased with positive cash leasing spreads of 13.3%. Included in completed leases for the first quarter were two major leases (one Hawaii industrial and one mainland industrial) that were re-leased at an average re-leasing spread of 14.6%.
Land Operations. Land Operations posted a 1Q17 operating loss of $2.4 million. Results for 1Q17 included the sale of a Maui Business Park lot, the sale of an urban-zoned parcel on Maui, and joint venture sales of two Ka Milo units and two townhomes at The Collection, offset by joint venture expenses (equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures totaled $0.1 million). Offsetting these positive effects was a noncash reduction of the carrying value of the Company's investment in the Waihonu solar project of $2.0 million, as tax credits and other tax benefits related to the project reduce the value of the investment. The remaining operating loss is primarily attributable to segment expenses and agricultural operations.
In 1Q16, the segment's operating loss was $3.2 million and included equity in earnings of real estate joint ventures of $0.5 million, which included five unit closings at Kukui`ula and joint venture expenses. The remaining operating loss was primarily attributable to segment expenses and agricultural operations.
Materials & Construction. The segment posted operating profit of $5.6 million for 1Q17 and $8.0 million for 1Q16, and Adjusted EBITDA of $7.9 million1 for 1Q17 and $10.4 million1 for 1Q16. 1Q17 operating profit and Adjusted EBITDA were impacted by decreased aggregate and material sales volume, as well as lower paving margins despite an increase in tons of asphalt placed in 1Q17 compared to 1Q16. Paving margins were impacted by competitive pricing pressures and an increased mix of lower margin projects. As a result of completed and billed work during the period and the lack of major bids offered by governmental entities during 1Q17, backlog declined by 12.2% from the end of 2016 to $213.2 million at the end of 1Q17.
Other. During the quarter, the Company opportunistically sold the nearly vacant 16,600-square-foot Maui Clinic Building for $3.4 million.
Interest expense declined from $6.9 million for 1Q16 to $6.2 million for 1Q17. General corporate expenses were lower, decreasing from $6.9 million for 1Q16 to $5.7 million for 1Q17. The decrease was primarily due to lower professional services fees. REIT evaluation costs for 1Q17 amounted to $4.8 million. There were no material REIT evaluation costs incurred in 1Q16. The Company reported an income tax benefit of $2.2 million in the quarter due principally to the previously-described adoption of a new accounting requirement. These benefits were partially offset by tax expense related to income from continuing operations before income taxes.

USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
The Company calculates NOI as CRE operating profit, less depreciation and amortization, straight-line lease adjustments and general, administrative and other expenses. NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance metric because management believes it helps both investors and management understand the ongoing core operations of the Company's properties excluding corporate and financing-related costs and noncash depreciation and amortization. NOI is an unlevered operating performance metric of the Company's commercial properties and allows for a useful comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. This measure thereby provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income (loss) from operations or net income (loss). NOI should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income (loss) as an indicator of the Company's financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of the Company's liquidity. Other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating NOI, and accordingly, the Company's presentation of NOI may not be comparable to other real estate companies. The Company also presents same-store NOI, which represents NOI generated by properties that were owned throughout the entire duration of both periods under comparison, including stabilized properties. The Company believes that the CRE segment's operating profit is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement to NOI and same-store NOI. A reconciliation of CRE operating profit to CRE segment NOI and same-store NOI is as follows:

The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA for the Materials & Construction segment, which is a non-GAAP measure. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance for the Materials & Construction segment because management believes that it provides insight into the segment's core operating results, future cash flow generation, and/or the underlying business trends affecting performance on a consistent and comparable basis from period to period. The Company provides this information to investors as an additional means of evaluating the segment's ongoing core operations. The non-GAAP financial information presented herein should be considered supplemental to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes that Materials & Construction operating profit is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement to the segment's Adjusted EBITDA. Reconciliation of the Materials & Construction segment's operating profit to Adjusted EBITDA follows:

 Backlog represents the amount of revenue that Grace Pacific and Maui Paving, LLC, a 50-percent-owned unconsolidated affiliate, expect to realize on contracts awarded or government contracts in which Grace Pacific has been confirmed to be the lowest bidder and formal communication of the award is perfunctory. Backlog primarily consists of asphalt paving and, to a lesser extent, Grace's consolidated revenue from its Prestress and construction- and traffic-control-related products. Backlog includes estimated revenue from the remaining portion of contracts not yet completed, as well as revenue from approved change orders. The length of time that projects remain in backlog can span from a few days for a small volume of work to 36 months for large paving contracts and contracts performed in phases. Backlog reasonably expected to be filled within the next fiscal year is $178.0 million. Maui Paving's backlog at March 31, 2017 and 2016 was $13.3 million and $12.3 million, respectively.

Baldwin Brass ManufacturingBaldwin uses brass for its door hardware due to its durability, strength, and appearance. You only need to hold a solid brass Baldwin product to feel the quality and durability. Brass is heavier, stronger, and provides smoother operation compared to steel or aluminum door hardware. Baldwin is forged, not cast, so it is denser and heavier. Solid brass arrives at the Baldwin manufacturing facility in bars where it is super heated and forged by expert craftsman into its final shape. It is then trimmed and polished with extreme detail. Resulting in a very high quality piece of hardware. Baldwin is committed to providing quality door hardware, thus brass will be their material for as long as they are around.








Baldwin Luxurious FinishesBaldwin hardwares product line is extensive and now offers up to 22 unique finishes. This kind of selection allows customers to pick the exact style they are looking for, from contemporary and modern to rustic and classic. Each finish has its own manufacturer technique, of which Baldwin has nearly perfected. Chrome, Nickel, and Bronze are created with up to 30 layers of metal plating over solid brass for maximum durability.Living Finishes are aged 6 to 12 months and will continually change over time to reveal a classic vintage feel.

	For the most reliable and long lasting finish, choose a piece with Baldwin's Lifetime PVD finish. PVD stands for physical vapor deposition, which offers a superior quality, especially in coastal areas. The creation process includes adding a formula of layered nickel alloys to protect against aging and to provide high levels of resistance to corrosion from air with high salt. Baldwin pioneered the Lifetime PVD finishes for decorative hardware. Baldwin is the only manufacturer that has lifetime finishes in Satin and Polished Nickel.

Handing

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.

Handing



X
Handing

Handing is a term used to describe which way a door handle turns. To
    determine the handing of a door, stand on the outside of the room you are
    going to enter. For example, if you are entering your house, stand outside
    the house entirely; if you are considering your bathroom door, stand in the
    room that connects to the bathroom. Face the door. Notice which side the
    hinges are on.


Door Swings Inward

Left handing - The hinges are on the left
Right handing - The hinges are on the right




Door Swings Outward

Left hand reverse - The hinges are on the left
Right hand reverse - The hinges are on the right

Solid Construction



X
Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.








										28 Degree Latch

Concealed Screws



X
Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.

SmartKey



X
SmartKey Re-Key Technology

	SmartKey allows for locks to be quickly and easily re-keyed, without the need to remove the lock from the door. Re-keying a lock can be done via the following 3 Steps:



 

Insert original functioning key.
Turn 1/4 turn clockwise.



 

Insert and remove SmartKey learning tool.
Remove functioning key.



 

Insert a new key.
Turn 1/2 turn counter-clockwise.
Done. Your lock is now re-keyed!

Solid Construction

Solid Construction


Solid Construction is used to describe products composed entirely from a premium material like brass, stainless steel or bronze, and manufactured as one solid piece, with no hollow spaces or interior gaps. Representing a significant increase in quality, these products are typically more expensive than both their hollow counterparts and those that use lesser metals like zinc or aluminum. Heavier, more durable, and often times naturally corrosion resistant, they are made to last a lifetime and the difference is noticeable.

Concealed Screws

Concealed Screws
On many knobs and levers, the screws that mount the hardware on the door are visible on the interior. Concealed Screws means that these screws are hidden behind the rosette, providing a cleaner more decorative look to your door hardware.








										Concealed Screws

28 Degree Latch



X
28 Degree Latch
A 28 Degree Latch requires less rotation than a standard latch, fully retracting at 28 degrees. This provides smoother operation and a more ergonomic feel when turning the handle.

Door Thickness

Door Thickness




Most interior doors are 1-3/8 inches
            thick, while most exterior doors measure 1-3/4 inches. If your door
            is thicker than this, you may need an
            additional component known as a 'thick door kit.'

Backset

Backset




The backset describes the length of
            the latch itself. To determine this, start at the edge of the door
            and measure out to the center of the borehole drilled in your
            door.

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]
List of businesses owned by Alexander & Baldwin, Inc.[edit]

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]

Alexander & Baldwin, Inc. is an American company that was once part of the Big Five companies in territorial Hawaii. The company today operates businesses in real estate, sugarcane, and diversified agriculture. It was also the last "Big Five" company to cultivate sugarcane. It remains one of the State of Hawaii's largest private landowners, owning over 87,000 acres (35,000 ha) throughout the state. In addition, the company owns 47 income properties in Hawaii and the continental United States. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ALEX?ltr=1.
Alexander & Baldwin has its headquarters in downtown Honolulu at the Alexander & Baldwin Building, which was built in 1929. The Alexander & Baldwin Sugar Museum exhibits some of sugarcane company's history.

History[edit]
Before Annexation[edit]
In 1831, Dwight Baldwin (1798–1886) and Charlotte Fowler Baldwin were sent by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) as medical missionaries to the Sandwich Islands, as the Hawaiian Islands were called at the time. Reverend William Alexander and Mary McKinney Alexander arrived the following year in 1832.
Alexander & Baldwin was founded by their sons Samuel Thomas Alexander and Henry Perrine Baldwin (1842–1911) as Samuel T Alexander & Co., in 1870. The two purchased 561 acres (227 ha) of land on the island of Maui between Pāʻia and Makawao, on which they began to cultivate sugarcane.
The land the partners cultivated was semi-arid former dry forest, not ideal for growing sugarcane, a crop that required much water. Samuel Alexander realized that rain was plentiful miles away in the rainforests on the windward slopes of Haleakalā mountain. Thus, he designed a 17-mile (27 km) long irrigation aqueduct that diverted water from that part of Haleakalā to their plantation. Work started on the aqueduct in 1876 and was completed two years later in 1878.
After completion of the aqueduct, the company grew and was eventually renamed Alexander & Baldwin Plantation. Between 1872 and 1900, the company gradually took over more land and sugar mill operations. In 1898, Alexander and Baldwin purchased a controlling interest in one of its rival companies, Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company (HC&S) from Claus Spreckles.[2] By 1899, the company had bought out Maui’s two main railroad lines (Kahului Railroad Company and Maui Railroad & Steamship Company). In 1900, the company incorporated and was renamed Alexander & Baldwin, Ltd.

The Big Five Era[edit]
Following incorporation, the company continued to prosper. It came to be one of Hawaii’s Big Five companies which held a virtual oligarchy over Hawaii’s economy during the region’s territorial years. In this period, the company entered many new businesses and controlled more than 100,000 acres (40,000 ha) of land in the Territory.
In 1905, Alexander & Baldwin and other Big Five companies took control of the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company (C&H), giving Alexander & Baldwin a factory where they could refine its sugar.
Over the following decades, the company opened or bought out sugar operations at Puʻunene, Kahuku, and Kauaʻi island as well as pineapple operations on Maui and Kauaʻi. In 1908, the company bought a portion of the Matson Navigation Company, a major shipping line operating in the territory. The company sold its sugar interests on Kauaʻi and consolidated all of its Maui operations into an enlarged Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company in the 1930s while continuing its pineapple operations as well as its sugarcane plantation in Kahuku until the 1960s.

Following World War II, the company entered a new business: land development and real estate. The company formed a new subsidiary, the Kahului Development Co., to develop housing in the Kahului area. In the following years, the company became more involved in the development of its land and the Kahului Development Co. became A&B Properties, Inc.
In 1962, the company purchased all outstanding interests in the Hawaii Commercial & Sugar Company and the sugar operation became wholly owned by Alexander & Baldwin. In 1964, the company also bought out the interests in Matson Navigation Company held by three of its fellow "Big Five" competitors: American Factors, C. Brewer & Co., and Castle & Cooke. In 1969, the company purchased all remaining, outstanding shares in Matson and the shipping company became a wholly owned subsidiary of Alexander & Baldwin.
Diversification[edit]
In recent decades, the company’s development and real estate division has grown as A&B Properties developed new residential and commercial projects on other land the company owned. In addition, Alexander & Baldwin entered diversified agriculture, beginning to cultivate coffee and macadamia nuts in the 1980s.
End of Sugar Production[edit]
On January 6, 2016 Alexander & Baldwin announced plans to transition out of sugar farming on Maui by the end of the year, discontinuing the Maui Sugar brand and ceasing production of sugar at the last remaining plantation on the Hawaiian islands.[4]
Matson Spinoff[edit]
As of June 2012 Matson Shipping in which the company had held an investment for 140 years was spun off as a separate company. [5][6]
Criticism[edit]
Alexander & Baldwin has drawn repeated criticism from Maui residents over the use of pre-harvest field burning by its subsidiary Hawaiian Commercial & Sugar Company. HC&S cultivates approximately 35,000 acres of sugarcane on Maui, with roughly 400 acres per week being burned from March to November each year to remove dried leaves from the cane before it is harvested and processed.[7] A spokesman for HC&S claimed that "burning, in the field, is the only economical means HC&S has found to-date of removing the dried leafy material from its crop."[8] Maui environmentalists and physicians have countered by asserting that the burning process has caused increased rates of asthma and respiratory disease, especially among children, released carcinogens from burning PVC pipes used in the irrigation system,[7] and resulted in highway closures and car crashes.[9][10] Community organizers have called on A&B to replace burning with green harvesting methods,[11] and in 2012, presented the Hawaii Department of Health with a petition signed by 8,700 Maui residents, asking it to deny the company a burning permit for the coming year.[12]
The company's Puunene Mill has also attracted criticism from residents, who have pointed out that its equipment does not meet federal emissions standards and that its high coal consumption produces unsafe levels of sulfur dioxide.[13]
Some activists have reported receiving threats from or being assaulted by HC&S employees and members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, which has been active in lobbying for continued cane burning on behalf of Alexander & Baldwin.[7][10]
The company's agricultural practices, as well as its history and the careers of its missionary founders, were satirized by Maui author Tim Parise in the novel Totum Hominem.[14]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
