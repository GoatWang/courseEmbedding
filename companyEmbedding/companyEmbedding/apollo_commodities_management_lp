Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

I moved while opening the credit card account so I did not receive statements on time (or maybe they did not send it to me). Called and got $17 back. As for the rest, I...show more

When I opened a credit card with them the person who wrote a check to my current credit card company to transfer the balance left off a digit. I have never heard of a banking institution that can't count to 16 or...show more

                                            The one star is generous! I purchased car insurance and paid 450.00 for the policy and had to cancel 3 days later and only received a refund for $220!
