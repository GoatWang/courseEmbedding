Product Description▼▲
When Dr. Mark Baker and Nurse Kelly Atkinson are held at the mercy of a dangerous gunman, the lives of every emergency room patient are at stake. At the end of the evening three men are dead. One of them is a police officer who couldn't be saved despite Mark's best efforts. The other two are members of the feared drug cartel. Though the standoff is over, the killing is not, because when the drug cartel loses its members, revenge is not far behind. Facing an adversary whose desire is dark and efforts are ruthless, Mark finds himself under suspicion as a killer, yet still a potential victim. When he turns to his high school sweetheart, attorney Gwen Woodruff, for help, Kelly helplessly looks on, as she hides her own feelings for the good doctor.

Publisher's Description▼▲
When Dr. Mark Baker and Nurse Kelly Atkinson are held at the mercy of a dangerous gunman, the lives of every emergency room patient are at stake. At the end of the evening three men are dead. One of them is a police officer who couldn't be saved despite Mark's best efforts. The other two are members of the feared Zeta drug cartel. Though the standoff is over, the killing is not, because when the drug cartel loses its members, revenge is not far behind. Facing an adversary whose desires are dark and efforts are ruthless, Mark finds himself under suspicion as a killer, yet still a potential victim. When he turns to his high school sweetheart, attorney Gwen Woodruff, for help, Kelly helplessly looks on, as she hides her own feelings for the good doctor.  At the height of the conflict, three questions remain: Who is the shooter? Who will the next victim be? And can Mark prove his innocence before the gun turns on him?

            In Fatal Trauma, the reader is set up for a thrill filled ride. From the first pages, the action pulsates. Theres also a complicated romance and strong faith element. What I liked most were the intense medical scenes coupled with the question of how the complex mystery would be resolved. The characters were interesting and at varied stages in their personal lives and faith journeys. It was a world I enjoyed entering.

            Dr. Richard Mabry has written another excellent book that kept me turning the pages on past bedtime. I had to keep reading to learn what happened next and to find out how things would end. The suspense continued to mount as I kept rooting for the good guys and waiting for the bad guys to trip up. The person behind all the bad stuff came as a total surprise. I often have a fairly good clue halfway through a book and just keep reading to see how the hero and heroine are going to figure things out. This book was not like that. I appreciated the weaving of the Good News into the book as several of the characters dealt with their beliefs and where they placed their faith. Its a well-written book that I highly recommend to those who enjoy a story full of suspense, excitement, surprises, medical drama, and romance.

            I can't imagine anything more stressful for a ER doctor than a simple day at work. Everything changes and it truly is never the same day twice. Every patient you get into the Trauma department could be that patients final chance at life, and it all rests in your hands. But what if your typical day at the office was interrupted by an armed gunman who brought you a patient bleeding out. His request, if you don't save him, you all will die one by one. Definitely not what you dreamed would happen when you arrived for work today, but such is the premise behind Richard L. Mabry's latest suspense novel Fatal Trauma. 


I have absolutely LOVED every single novel Richard L. Mabry has written because to truly appreciate any medical suspense novel, you have to have a working knowledge of what it takes to be a doctor working in a hospital and the terminology and procedures have to line up correctly to be believable, and thankfully due to being a retired physician, this comes across beautifully in all his novels. 


Dr. Mark Baker is attempting to keep a handle on things when the armed man holds a gun, to ER nurse, Kelly Atkinson's head. Unless they can save the unconscious man in the wheelchair, more people will die beginning with Kelly. Just how does someone save a man who clearly appears to be dead while waiting for the possibility of help to arrive? How do you distract an armed gunman who seems to be drug induced? Will there be a possible future for Mark and Kelly if they can find a way out of what has walked into their ER tonight? You'll have to pick this one up to find out!


I received Fatal Trauma by Richard L. Mabry M.D. compliments of Abingdon Press and Litfuse Publicity for my honest review. I did not receive any monetary compensation for a favorable review outside the complimentary copy of the novel and the opinions contained here are strictly my own. This novel is definitely adrenaline filled. From the first chapter, readers are thrust into a situation one hopes never happens in real life and as the body count begins to rise, you wonder how it will all turn out. My favorite part about this novel is the authentic medical descriptions that move the story along. You can tell its genuine because of the author's background in the medical field and for me, this is why I love any of Richard L. Mabry's novels. He takes you someplace you could have never imagined happening to people in the medical field, but there is always that possibility. For me, this one rocks the suspense at a full 5 out of 5 stars! Readers even get a sneak peek at the next novel, Miracle Drug coming out soon. A reader's discussion guide is also included.

            Fatal Trauma had my heart in my throat from the first page forward, and made me keep turning the page, and I was not disappointed.


We have a you ER doctor and nurse busy working and taking care of patients, when a gunman arrives with a man in a wheelchair having been shot, the man pushing the chair has a gun to the head of the nurse, and threatens everyone on the room. Oh my, this is just a taste of what you are about to experience as you enter the world and mind of Dr. Mabry.


The twists and violence didnt make sense to me, but when drugs are involved nothing makes is too much and of course there is a lot of money involved. This is not just one sweet romantic book, no, but it does have some romance, you just wont be sure who is involved for a while.


I never saw a lot of what happened coming, and some that I thought were the criminals turned out to be one of the good guys, and others, oh my they sure fooled me. Who can be trusted, just one and that is God, and yes there is a Christian focus in this book, and made my enjoyment of this book even greater.


If you love suspense as I do, this is going to be a favorite book for you, a real page-turner, and dont let your guard down, you will be waiting for the other shoe to drop.


I received this book through Litfuse Publicity Blog Tours, and was not required to give a positive review.

ANOTHER PAGE-TURNER FROM DR. RICHARD L. MABRY, M.D.

            Dr. Mark Baker was in the wrong place, at the wrong time.


He was at work.  In the busy Emergency Room at busy Memorial Hospital.  Thats where it all started, and thats where his life abruptly changed.


He just didnt know it yet.


Writing in his traditional (read edge of the seat, pulse-pounding suspense) style, Dr. Richard Mabry brings his technical skills as a retired physician to yet another page-turner.   As the book deals with life and death on various levels, Dr. Mabry also brings his faith.


Demonstrating once again that faith and life do not have to live in separate compartments, author Richard Mabry tells the tale of life and death, winning and losing, and most of all . . . the tale of love.  Love for one another, and Gods love for all humanity.  


He doesnt preach.  He doesnt teach.  He is a master at Show and Tell.  A game that we all enjoyed when we were growing up has become a vehicle for entertaining readers, and impacting their lives.  And they dont even know it, yet!


5 stars for another inspirational journey from Dr. Richard L. Mabry!

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsDivinely InspiredByAmy Leuseron February 16, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI first looked at this book because I liked what it had to say re: the husbands role in a marriage. God used it as an opportunity to show me areas in my own role (the wife), that He desired me to focus on instead. This book, although small, had a big impact on improving my marriage, by helping me understand God's wisdom in its design.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Overview


Overview

With more than 5 million people in the United States living with Alzheimer's disease and nearly 10 million loved ones caring for them, addressing the concerns of these elders and their caregivers is a matter of increasing importance. Relying on their many years of experience in this area, Jane Thibault and Richard Morgan offer this book to provide a fresh, hopeful model of dealing with life and death in the realm of Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. Caregivers have two basic needs: affirmation that caregiving is not in vain and reassurance that the lives of those for whom they care are not being lived in vain. Care receivers need more than medical attention; they need tender care, involvement in the community, and a sense of connection with a loving God. When patient and caregiver regard this shared experience as a "mutual spiritual path," each plays a role in deepening the spiritual life of the other. No Act of Love Is Ever Wasted is an excellent resource for individuals caring for loved ones as well as for counselors, support group leaders, pastors, and other professionals. In addition to offering practical ways to help, this book serves as a reminder that every act of love brings positive transformation to the recipient, to the giver, and to the world.

The Journal Pen

Designed to fit into the spine binding of popular writing journals, check books and notepads, without impeding their function. Curved to fit with the curvature of the binding, yet flat so it does not catch clothing. Simple and with no moving parts, refillable, and available in hand diamond cut finish, hammered texture finish, and a very limited quantity of the prototype.
