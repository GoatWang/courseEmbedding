Life and journalism[edit]
The son of Michael Freedland, a biographer and journalist, and Sara Hocherman,[4] he was educated at University College School, a boys' independent school in Hampstead, London, and at Wadham College, Oxford.
The younger Freedland began his Fleet Street career at the short-lived Sunday Correspondent. In 1990 he joined the BBC, working as a news reporter across radio and television, appearing most often on The World at One and Today on Radio 4. In the summer of 1992, he was awarded the Laurence Stern fellowship[5] on The Washington Post, serving as a staff writer on the national news section. He became Washington Correspondent for The Guardian in 1993, remaining in that post until 1997 when he returned to London as an editorial writer and columnist. Bring Home the Revolution: The case for a British Republic (1998), Freedland's first book, argued that Britain should reclaim the revolutionary ideals it exported to America in the 18th century, and undergo a constitutional and cultural overhaul. The book won a W. Somerset Maugham Award for non-fiction and was later adapted into a two-part series for BBC Television.
Between 2002 and 2004, Freedland was an occasional columnist for the Daily Mirror and from 2005 to 2007 he wrote a weekly column for the London Evening Standard. He has also been published in Newsweek and The New Republic magazines.
Jacob's Gift (2005) is a memoir recounting the lives of three generations of his own Jewish family as well as exploring wider questions of identity and belonging.[6] In 2008, he broadcast a two-part series for BBC Radio 4 – British Jews and the Dream of Zion – as well as two TV documentaries for BBC Four: How to be a Good President[7] and President Hollywood.
A leading liberal Zionist in the UK,[8] he wrote in 2012 that he only uses the word Zionism infrequently. He explained:


“
That is because the word has become so misunderstood, so freighted with excess baggage, that it has become all but impossible to deploy it without extensive explanation and qualification. Most of the time, it is best avoided. Part of the trouble is that a single variant – right-wing Zionism – has come to stand for the whole.[9]
”


Of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict he wrote: "Israelis want security, yet their government’s actions will give it no security. On the contrary, they are utterly self-defeating." Freedland has called for negotiations to end the cycles of violence: "The only real security is political, not military. It comes through negotiation, not artillery fire" because "in trying to crush today’s enemy, Israel has reared the enemy of tomorrow."[10]
In March 2014, it emerged that Freedland would assume the role of executive editor of the opinion part of The Guardian from May. His responsibilities included the comment section of the newspaper and the development of longer articles for the paper and the website.[11] Freedland remained in this role until early 2016. He continues to write a Saturday column for the newspaper.[12]
Nominated on seven occasions, Freedland was awarded a special Orwell Prize in May 2014 for his journalism.[13][14]
Views[edit]
Freedland sees the Grenfell Tower fire as an example of rich people disregarding the interests of poor people. Freedland states that warnings from residents were ignored or lead to legal threats. Freedland wrote about, "a local authority and its arm’s length management company that decided to save a grand total of £4,750 by opting for the cheaper and more flammable version of cladding for this tower." Freedland maintains, "Grenfell Tower should mark a point of no return. No return to the frenzied deregulation, cost-cutting and rampant inequality of the last four decades. These are not new evils. They have been lurking for many years. But it took the light of a burning building for the whole nation to see them. (...) And [the local authority and the management company cut costs] even though the risk was plain to see to anyone paying attention. The management company RMS, for example, which specialises in modelling catastrophes risk, has detailed a recent spate of fires in China involving similar cladding acting as an accelerant, engulfing entire skyscrapers in flames within three or four minutes." Freedland wrote further, "So Grenfell Tower threatens to stand forever as a warning against four of the defining features of our era. First, deregulation – elevated to an ideal by the free marketeers of Thatcherism and pursued ever since. Protections for consumers or workers or residents have long been recast and despised as “red tape”, choking plucky entrepreneurs. A favourite slogan of the right was the promise of “a bonfire of regulations”. Well, they got their bonfire all right. (...) But most obviously, Grenfell Tower is a story of inequality, of the poor herded into a cramped building made unsafe because it was prettified to improve the view of the nearby rich."[15]
Freedland sees the setbacks for the Conservative party in the 2017 general election as evidence the British public are tired of austerity. Freedland maintains the people were first told austerity was to be temporary but later found it was intended to be permanent. Freedland maintains the British are, "sick and tired" of "cherished public services" like schools and policing short of money. People dislike seeing libraries closed, children's centres empty, nurses forced to go to food banks, teachers brinking in food for hungry pupils. Freedland maintains if the Conservatives do not want further election setbacks they should improve public services and fund this by taxing, "the better off". Freedland writes, "The alternative is to be branded forever as the party of meanness and neglect of the public realm, in an era when people are hankering for something better."[16]
Thriller writer[edit]
Freedland has published six books: two non-fiction works under his own name and six novels, originally under the pseudonym Sam Bourne.
The Righteous Men (2006), is a religious thriller published under the Bourne nom de plume. The book made a brief appearance in the gossip columns when a damning review by Michael Dibdin,[17] originally written for The Guardian, appeared instead in The Times. The Guardian's readers' editor[18] discovered that when Dibdin originally submitted his review to The Guardian he offered to withdraw it if it were deemed too awkward – an offer the editor, Alan Rusbridger, accepted. The Righteous Men was picked as a Richard and Judy Summer Read in June 2006 and soon rose to the top of the The Sunday Times best-sellers' list. It stayed on the list for several months and has now sold more than half a million copies in the UK; it has been translated into 30 languages.
The book was followed by another Sam Bourne title, The Last Testament (2007), this time set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace process, and by The Final Reckoning (2008), based on the true story of the Avengers: a group of Holocaust survivors who sought revenge against their Nazi persecutors. The Final Reckoning just missed the peak of The Sunday Times best-seller list. Just before The Chosen One (2010), the fourth thriller by Sam Bourne was published in the UK, The Bookseller reported in April 2010 that HarperCollins had signed Freedland for three more Bourne books, describing the author as "the UK's bestselling thriller writer with sales of well over one million ... in less than five years."[19]
HarperCollins published "Pantheon" in July 2012. Freedland's sixth novel, The 3rd Woman, is published by HarperCollins in August.
HIs Seventh novel under Sam Bourne, To Kill a President, was published by HarperCollins on 12 June 2017.[20]

A leading liberal Zionist in the UK,[8] he wrote in 2012 that he only uses the word Zionism infrequently. He explained:


“
That is because the word has become so misunderstood, so freighted with excess baggage, that it has become all but impossible to deploy it without extensive explanation and qualification. Most of the time, it is best avoided. Part of the trouble is that a single variant – right-wing Zionism – has come to stand for the whole.[9]
”


Of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict he wrote: "Israelis want security, yet their government’s actions will give it no security. On the contrary, they are utterly self-defeating." Freedland has called for negotiations to end the cycles of violence: "The only real security is political, not military. It comes through negotiation, not artillery fire" because "in trying to crush today’s enemy, Israel has reared the enemy of tomorrow."[10]
In March 2014, it emerged that Freedland would assume the role of executive editor of the opinion part of The Guardian from May. His responsibilities included the comment section of the newspaper and the development of longer articles for the paper and the website.[11] Freedland remained in this role until early 2016. He continues to write a Saturday column for the newspaper.[12]
Nominated on seven occasions, Freedland was awarded a special Orwell Prize in May 2014 for his journalism.[13][14]
Views[edit]
Freedland sees the Grenfell Tower fire as an example of rich people disregarding the interests of poor people. Freedland states that warnings from residents were ignored or lead to legal threats. Freedland wrote about, "a local authority and its arm’s length management company that decided to save a grand total of £4,750 by opting for the cheaper and more flammable version of cladding for this tower." Freedland maintains, "Grenfell Tower should mark a point of no return. No return to the frenzied deregulation, cost-cutting and rampant inequality of the last four decades. These are not new evils. They have been lurking for many years. But it took the light of a burning building for the whole nation to see them. (...) And [the local authority and the management company cut costs] even though the risk was plain to see to anyone paying attention. The management company RMS, for example, which specialises in modelling catastrophes risk, has detailed a recent spate of fires in China involving similar cladding acting as an accelerant, engulfing entire skyscrapers in flames within three or four minutes." Freedland wrote further, "So Grenfell Tower threatens to stand forever as a warning against four of the defining features of our era. First, deregulation – elevated to an ideal by the free marketeers of Thatcherism and pursued ever since. Protections for consumers or workers or residents have long been recast and despised as “red tape”, choking plucky entrepreneurs. A favourite slogan of the right was the promise of “a bonfire of regulations”. Well, they got their bonfire all right. (...) But most obviously, Grenfell Tower is a story of inequality, of the poor herded into a cramped building made unsafe because it was prettified to improve the view of the nearby rich."[15]
Freedland sees the setbacks for the Conservative party in the 2017 general election as evidence the British public are tired of austerity. Freedland maintains the people were first told austerity was to be temporary but later found it was intended to be permanent. Freedland maintains the British are, "sick and tired" of "cherished public services" like schools and policing short of money. People dislike seeing libraries closed, children's centres empty, nurses forced to go to food banks, teachers brinking in food for hungry pupils. Freedland maintains if the Conservatives do not want further election setbacks they should improve public services and fund this by taxing, "the better off". Freedland writes, "The alternative is to be branded forever as the party of meanness and neglect of the public realm, in an era when people are hankering for something better."[16]
Thriller writer[edit]
Freedland has published six books: two non-fiction works under his own name and six novels, originally under the pseudonym Sam Bourne.
The Righteous Men (2006), is a religious thriller published under the Bourne nom de plume. The book made a brief appearance in the gossip columns when a damning review by Michael Dibdin,[17] originally written for The Guardian, appeared instead in The Times. The Guardian's readers' editor[18] discovered that when Dibdin originally submitted his review to The Guardian he offered to withdraw it if it were deemed too awkward – an offer the editor, Alan Rusbridger, accepted. The Righteous Men was picked as a Richard and Judy Summer Read in June 2006 and soon rose to the top of the The Sunday Times best-sellers' list. It stayed on the list for several months and has now sold more than half a million copies in the UK; it has been translated into 30 languages.
The book was followed by another Sam Bourne title, The Last Testament (2007), this time set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace process, and by The Final Reckoning (2008), based on the true story of the Avengers: a group of Holocaust survivors who sought revenge against their Nazi persecutors. The Final Reckoning just missed the peak of The Sunday Times best-seller list. Just before The Chosen One (2010), the fourth thriller by Sam Bourne was published in the UK, The Bookseller reported in April 2010 that HarperCollins had signed Freedland for three more Bourne books, describing the author as "the UK's bestselling thriller writer with sales of well over one million ... in less than five years."[19]
HarperCollins published "Pantheon" in July 2012. Freedland's sixth novel, The 3rd Woman, is published by HarperCollins in August.
HIs Seventh novel under Sam Bourne, To Kill a President, was published by HarperCollins on 12 June 2017.[20]

Life and journalism[edit]
The son of Michael Freedland, a biographer and journalist, and Sara Hocherman,[4] he was educated at University College School, a boys' independent school in Hampstead, London, and at Wadham College, Oxford.
The younger Freedland began his Fleet Street career at the short-lived Sunday Correspondent. In 1990 he joined the BBC, working as a news reporter across radio and television, appearing most often on The World at One and Today on Radio 4. In the summer of 1992, he was awarded the Laurence Stern fellowship[5] on The Washington Post, serving as a staff writer on the national news section. He became Washington Correspondent for The Guardian in 1993, remaining in that post until 1997 when he returned to London as an editorial writer and columnist. Bring Home the Revolution: The case for a British Republic (1998), Freedland's first book, argued that Britain should reclaim the revolutionary ideals it exported to America in the 18th century, and undergo a constitutional and cultural overhaul. The book won a W. Somerset Maugham Award for non-fiction and was later adapted into a two-part series for BBC Television.
Between 2002 and 2004, Freedland was an occasional columnist for the Daily Mirror and from 2005 to 2007 he wrote a weekly column for the London Evening Standard. He has also been published in Newsweek and The New Republic magazines.

Protections for consumers or workers or residents have long been recast and despised as “red tape”, choking plucky entrepreneurs. A favourite slogan of the right was the promise of “a bonfire of regulations”. Well, they got their bonfire all right. (...) But most obviously, Grenfell Tower is a story of inequality, of the poor herded into a cramped building made unsafe because it was prettified to improve the view of the nearby rich."[15]
Freedland sees the setbacks for the Conservative party in the 2017 general election as evidence the British public are tired of austerity. Freedland maintains the people were first told austerity was to be temporary but later found it was intended to be permanent. Freedland maintains the British are, "sick and tired" of "cherished public services" like schools and policing short of money. People dislike seeing libraries closed, children's centres empty, nurses forced to go to food banks, teachers brinking in food for hungry pupils. Freedland maintains if the Conservatives do not want further election setbacks they should improve public services and fund this by taxing, "the better off". Freedland writes, "The alternative is to be branded forever as the party of meanness and neglect of the public realm, in an era when people are hankering for something better."[16]
Thriller writer[edit]
Freedland has published six books: two non-fiction works under his own name and six novels, originally under the pseudonym Sam Bourne.
The Righteous Men (2006), is a religious thriller published under the Bourne nom de plume. The book made a brief appearance in the gossip columns when a damning review by Michael Dibdin,[17] originally written for The Guardian, appeared instead in The Times. The Guardian's readers' editor[18] discovered that when Dibdin originally submitted his review to The Guardian he offered to withdraw it if it were deemed too awkward – an offer the editor, Alan Rusbridger, accepted. The Righteous Men was picked as a Richard and Judy Summer Read in June 2006 and soon rose to the top of the The Sunday Times best-sellers' list. It stayed on the list for several months and has now sold more than half a million copies in the UK; it has been translated into 30 languages.
The book was followed by another Sam Bourne title, The Last Testament (2007), this time set against the backdrop of the Middle East peace process, and by The Final Reckoning (2008), based on the true story of the Avengers: a group of Holocaust survivors who sought revenge against their Nazi persecutors. The Final Reckoning just missed the peak of The Sunday Times best-seller list. Just before The Chosen One (2010), the fourth thriller by Sam Bourne was published in the UK, The Bookseller reported in April 2010 that HarperCollins had signed Freedland for three more Bourne books, describing the author as "the UK's bestselling thriller writer with sales of well over one million ... in less than five years."[19]
HarperCollins published "Pantheon" in July 2012. Freedland's sixth novel, The 3rd Woman, is published by HarperCollins in August.
HIs Seventh novel under Sam Bourne, To Kill a President, was published by HarperCollins on 12 June 2017.[20]

Life and journalism[edit]
The son of Michael Freedland, a biographer and journalist, and Sara Hocherman,[4] he was educated at University College School, a boys' independent school in Hampstead, London, and at Wadham College, Oxford.
The younger Freedland began his Fleet Street career at the short-lived Sunday Correspondent. In 1990 he joined the BBC, working as a news reporter across radio and television, appearing most often on The World at One and Today on Radio 4. In the summer of 1992, he was awarded the Laurence Stern fellowship[5] on The Washington Post, serving as a staff writer on the national news section. He became Washington Correspondent for The Guardian in 1993, remaining in that post until 1997 when he returned to London as an editorial writer and columnist. Bring Home the Revolution: The case for a British Republic (1998), Freedland's first book, argued that Britain should reclaim the revolutionary ideals it exported to America in the 18th century, and undergo a constitutional and cultural overhaul. The book won a W. Somerset Maugham Award for non-fiction and was later adapted into a two-part series for BBC Television.
Between 2002 and 2004, Freedland was an occasional columnist for the Daily Mirror and from 2005 to 2007 he wrote a weekly column for the London Evening Standard. He has also been published in Newsweek and The New Republic magazines.
Jacob's Gift (2005) is a memoir recounting the lives of three generations of his own Jewish family as well as exploring wider questions of identity and belonging.[6] In 2008, he broadcast a two-part series for BBC Radio 4 – British Jews and the Dream of Zion – as well as two TV documentaries for BBC Four: How to be a Good President[7] and President Hollywood.
A leading liberal Zionist in the UK,[8] he wrote in 2012 that he only uses the word Zionism infrequently. He explained:


“
That is because the word has become so misunderstood, so freighted with excess baggage, that it has become all but impossible to deploy it without extensive explanation and qualification. Most of the time, it is best avoided. Part of the trouble is that a single variant – right-wing Zionism – has come to stand for the whole.[9]
”


Of the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict he wrote: "Israelis want security, yet their government’s actions will give it no security. On the contrary, they are utterly self-defeating." Freedland has called for negotiations to end the cycles of violence: "The only real security is political, not military. It comes through negotiation, not artillery fire" because "in trying to crush today’s enemy, Israel has reared the enemy of tomorrow."[10]
In March 2014, it emerged that Freedland would assume the role of executive editor of the opinion part of The Guardian from May. His responsibilities included the comment section of the newspaper and the development of longer articles for the paper and the website.[11] Freedland remained in this role until early 2016. He continues to write a Saturday column for the newspaper.[12]
Nominated on seven occasions, Freedland was awarded a special Orwell Prize in May 2014 for his journalism.[13][14]
Views[edit]
Freedland sees the Grenfell Tower fire as an example of rich people disregarding the interests of poor people. Freedland states that warnings from residents were ignored or lead to legal threats. Freedland wrote about, "a local authority and its arm’s length management company that decided to save a grand total of £4,750 by opting for the cheaper and more flammable version of cladding for this tower." Freedland maintains, "Grenfell Tower should mark a point of no return. No return to the frenzied deregulation, cost-cutting and rampant inequality of the last four decades. These are not new evils. They have been lurking for many years. But it took the light of a burning building for the whole nation to see them. (...) And [the local authority and the management company cut costs] even though the risk was plain to see to anyone paying attention. The management company RMS, for example, which specialises in modelling catastrophes risk, has detailed a recent spate of fires in China involving similar cladding acting as an accelerant, engulfing entire skyscrapers in flames within three or four minutes." Freedland wrote further, "So Grenfell Tower threatens to stand forever as a warning against four of the defining features of our era. First, deregulation – elevated to an ideal by the free marketeers of Thatcherism and pursued ever since. Protections for consumers or workers or residents have long been recast and despised as “red tape”, choking plucky entrepreneurs. A favourite slogan of the right was the promise of “a bonfire of regulations”. Well, they got their bonfire all right. (...) But most obviously, Grenfell Tower is a story of inequality, of the poor herded into a cramped building made unsafe because it was prettified to improve the view of the nearby rich."[15]

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
