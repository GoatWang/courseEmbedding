15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with a 15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

A Safe & Secure Home
We want you to feel safe in your new home!  That’s why every new home in Columbus comes with a Schlage Keypad Lock .  You can control the locks on your home directly from your phone.  This safety device allows you to see what time the door is locked and unlocked using specific user codes. *Not included in Smart Series homes.
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Columbus and Central Ohio.  From the white fences of New Albany to the old world architecture of Dublin, our neighborhoods are a step above.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in: Blacklick,  Delaware, Gahanna, Galena, Grove City, Hilliard, Lewis Center, Licking Heights, Marysville, Olentangy, Pickerington, Powell, and Westerville.

Our Company
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Today, our commitment to our customers is evident in all of our new homes in Indianapolis. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.
Industry Leading 15-Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry Leading 15-Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.

Quality Construction
At M/I Homes, quality construction has always been a part of our backbone. This means we go above the industry standards to ensure our homes are well built. We use 2”x6” lumber to create stronger, more stable exterior walls.  This also allows for R19, a thicker insulation than the standard (R13).  We also build our homes' walls with the ZIP System®, a one-of-a-kind structural system with a built-in, energy efficient barrier that keeps the elements out while keeping you comfortable and helping you save on your energy bills!
Where We Build
We are building new homes in premier locations across Indianapolis and Central Indiana. Whether it's neighboring the Carmel Arts District, Monon Trail, inches from Grand Park, or historic Cumberland Trail, we build where you want to live.  We offer new community and new home opportunities in leading school districts, Avon, Brownsburg, Carmel, Center Grove, Clark Pleasant, Franklin Township, Franklin, Hamilton Southeastern, Lawrence, Noblesville, Pike, Mt. Vernon, Washington, Westfield-Washington and Zionsville.

Leading New Homebuilder in Tampa
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. Our new homes in Tampa are no exception.  M/I Homes in Tampa offers a wide variety of award winning floor plans to choose from whether you are a first-time home buyer or looking to move up to a new home. Choose from one of our beautiful move-in ready homes or build your own to fit your lifestyle in one of our beautiful communities and see for yourself why we are the new home leader.
Cleaner, Greener and More Cost Efficient Living
Every home we build is built to our stringent Whole Home guidelines. What does this mean to you? Not only do you get one of the most energy efficient homes on the market today, but we also care about the environment and use procedures to lessen the carbon footprint. Each home is tested and provided with a HERS score showing just how energy efficient your home is.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry-Leading 15 Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.
Where We Build
We build new homes in premier locations across the Tampa Bay Area. You can find your perfect home in locations such as The Westchase area, Citrus Park, Odessa, Lutz, New Tampa, Lakeland, Land O'Lakes, and Riverview.

The Triangle’s Leading Homebuilder
From our very beginnings in 1976, M/I Homes has been deeply committed to quality, value, integrity and above all, treating the customer right. You can choose from a wide selection of move-in ready homes or can build your own new home to fit the way you live in one of our convenient new home communities.  The Triangle Division of M/I enjoys a rich history of more than 25 years in this marketplace and has been recognized numerous times as Division of the Year for the company.
15 Year Transferable Structural Warranty
We back our homes with an Industry-Leading 15 Year Structural Warranty. What kind of company would offer that kind of coverage? One that's confident it builds a better home. That means you can buy with confidence. And it's transferable, so your home will have added value when you decide to sell.
Quality Construction
At M/I Homes, quality construction has always been a part of our backbone. This means we go above the industry standards to ensure our homes are well-built. Every home we build is Energy Star® Certified, and our Whole Home envelope means you save money and live in a healthier environment. Our homes are inspected by an independent, RESNET certified rater so we can show you how much you’ll save compared to a home built to standard code or a resale home.
Where we Build
We are building new homes in premier locations throughout the Triangle. From resort style living to elegant executive homes and low maintenance townhomes, even ranch-style villa homes, our neighborhoods are a step above. We offer new communities and new home opportunities in Wake County in Raleigh, Cary, Fuquay-Varina, Holly Springs, Wake Forest, and Wendell.  In Johnston County, you can find us in Clayton. We're also in Pittsboro and Chapel Hill located in Chatham County, and we're soon to be returning to Durham.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
