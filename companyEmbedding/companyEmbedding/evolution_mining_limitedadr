Evolution Mining is a leading, growth-focussed Australian gold miner. Evolution operate six wholly-owned mines – Cowal in New South Wales; Mt Carlton, Mt Rawdon, and Cracow, in Queensland; and Mungari and Edna May in Western Australia. In addition Evolution holds an economic interest in Ernest Henry, in Queensland, that will deliver 100% of future gold and 30% of future copper and silver produced from an agreed life of mine area. Outside of the life of mine area Evolution will have a 49% interest in future copper, gold and silver production from Ernest Henry.
In FY16 Evolution produced 803,476 ounces of gold at an AISC of A$1,014 per ounce. Evolution has guided FY17 Group gold production guidance to 800,000 – 860,000 ounces at an AISC of A$900 – A$960 per ounce.
 Evolution Mining was created in late 2011 to form a mid-tier Australian gold producer through the merger of Catalpa Resources Ltd and Conquest Mining Ltd and the concurrent acquisition of Newcrest Mining’s interests in the Cracow and Mt Rawdon mines. The Company has continued to grow through acquisition, completing the acquisition of Cowal in July 2015 and Mungari in August 2015.
Evolution has a reputation for consistency and reliability. It has a track record of consistently achieving production and cash cost guidance.
As a result of our achievements, Evolution has been announced as winner of the NSW Mining operation of the year awarded by NSW Minerals Council (April 2017), Craig Oliver Award, RIU Explorers Conference (February 2017), 2016 Miner of the Year, Australian Gold Mining Journal (February 2017), 2016 Dealer Award at Diggers and Dealers (August 2016), Best Asia-Pacific Mining Deal at Mines and Money Hong Kong (April 2016) and winner of 8th Annual International M&A awards (April 2016).
