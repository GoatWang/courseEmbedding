New product from Strayer Education, Inc. creates 360-degree job

      immersion experience to power the recruitment and development of talent

      in industries with high-volume job postings

 WASHINGTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Strayer Education, Inc., an education services company, today announced

      the launch of PathBoost. PathBoost creates scalable solutions for a

      company's biggest frontline challenges: talent acquisition, retention

      and productivity. Through a suite of products designed for the pre-hire,

      onboarding and first-time manager experiences, PathBoost delivers

      scalable learning solutions with measurable ROI. The first product to

      launch is PathBoost|Hire.

    


This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here:

http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160810005587/en/




Strayer Education's PathBoost|Hire, an online pre-hire screening and skill development platform, provides custom, interactive content designed to build the knowledge and skills of job applicants and new hires. Learning chapters comprised of real-life scenarios, documentary style mini-films and other features engage users in a 360-degree job immersion experience. The tool also enhances the recruitment strategies of companies within retail, tourism, hospitality and other top industries with a high volume of frontline job openings. (Photo: Business Wire)  



      PathBoost|Hire is an online pre-hire screening and skill development

      platform that enhances employer recruitment strategies and prepares

      jobseekers for specific job openings. The mobile responsive tool is

      intended for use by companies with a high volume of frontline openings

      such as retail, tourism, hospitality, financial services, automotive and

      other top industries.

    


      "According to a recent Harris Interactive/Glassdoor survey, sixty seven

      percent of employers believe that retention rates would increase if

      employees had a crystal clear picture of the role they are applying for

      and what is expected of them during the interview and on-boarding

      process," said Karl McDonnell, CEO of Strayer Education, Inc.

      "Additionally, culture and fit are increasingly important to new

      employees. PathBoost|Hire provides a deeper-level of understanding of

      not only the hard and soft skills needed for success, but also of the

      company's identity and how it connects to the industry at large."

    


      PathBoost|Hire provides interactive, custom content in five key areas:

      industry knowledge, brand overview, core job skills, mindsets and

      behaviors, and interview preparation. Content areas are brought to life

      in a 360-degree job immersion experience that includes real-life

      on-the-job scenarios, thought-provoking questions, aptitude assessment

      and documentary style mini-films.

    


      "Imagine that the job application and interviewing process are

      completely transformed," said Sarah Puil, senior vice president of

      product development. "Rather than the sterile act of submitting your

      resume online and waiting for a call, job seekers are provided with a

      realistic job preview so they can learn more about the industry, company

      and role at measured intervals to best gauge their fit for the position

      early and prepare them throughout the interview and, ultimately,

      onboarding processes. Equally, hiring managers using PathBoost will be

      able to optimize their time spent on seeking and screening suitable

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.
