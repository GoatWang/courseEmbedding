INCOME FUND I

 


















Our investment Strategy is to buy commercial properties at what we identify as deep discounts. Our investors value our expertise in our diligent underwriting process to acquire what we believe to be high quality properties with historically strong cash flow. Our qualified team looks for these types of assets across the nation—meaning a regionally diverse portfolio that we feel is more resilient to the ebb and flow of the real estate market. We are a boutique asset manager that is offering a private fund to allow accredited investors to participate. We offer four tranches: 8.5%, 10%, 12% preferred targeted annual return, plus a new 1-D tranche with a profit share and fees — Please speak with one of our Investor Relations representatives or read the PPM for further details. Note: Series 1B 10%, Series 1C 12% and Series 1D 10% plus profit share is currently closed.

Secured Income Fund II, LLC 



















Fund Type: Private Mortgage Lending





StrategyHow It WorksBenefitsFund News



Fund inception: 2010
Traditionally, people have looked to residential real estate as a source of easy credit and did not tap into the equity available in commercial or investment properties. The market has shifted, and now that “new” source of equity is being utilized. In response, Stonecrest is taking advantage of lending opportunities in equity-rich, realistically priced residential, commercial, and investment properties for qualified borrowers.
Stonecrest has taken the market experience and strategic approach that made our Private Capital Fund a success and applied them to the Secured Income Fund II. Our goal is to grow the Fund portfolio while delivering stable yields and minimizing risk. Secured Income Fund II offers investors healthy returns on loans with attractive loan-to-value ratios, which translates into lower risk.






Fund managers solicit, underwrite, process, and fund private money loans for commercial and residential borrowers in California. The Fund has produced a stable yield since inception – outperforming income markets and competitors.
Secured Income Fund II, LLC is modeled on our successful Private Capital Fund (est. 2004). Our proven underwriting guidelines are the same for both funds:

Ensure that there is sufficient equity in the underlying property
Ensure that our borrowers are financially able to make their loan payments
Identify our borrowers’ exit strategies in advance
Perform thorough internal appraisal and review of property
Secure stable yield for fund investors
Cross-collateralize when possible for additional security
Place emphasis on income producing properties that generate positive cash flow
Avoid overexposure to a single borrower
Stay sensitive to average loan amounts relative to the overall value of fund









 Stable yields.
 Intra-fund diversification to minimize overall portfolio risk.
 Safe positions in equity-strong properties.
 Choice between income or compounding distribution.
 Qualification for 401K, IRA, and pension plans.
 Professional full-service account management.

SPONSOR

KB Loan Fund II  makes mezzanine loans to (or preferred equity investments in) wholly-owned subsidiaries of KB Exchange Holdings (the "Sponsor")  as bridge financing for its acquisitions. The Sponsor provides simplified 1031-exchange solutions for private investors through fractional ownership. Through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the Sponsor acquires high-quality commercial properties utilizing fractional ownership structures. The principals of the Sponsor are highly experienced real estate syndicators having acquired more than $2 billion of commercial income-producing properties and placing 1031-exchange equity into the capital structure of the acquired properties.
 
PURPOSE OF MEZZANINE LOANS
The mezzanine loans (or preferred equity investments) made by KB Loan Fund II are part of the capital stack between the first mortgage (approximately 60%-65% LTV) and the equity provided by the Sponsor. The mezzanine loans are used as "bridge" financing for equity needed between the acquisition of the property and the sale of fractional interests in the underlying property owner or the property itself. Funds deployed by KB Loan Fund II will be secured by indirect interests in income-producing commercial real estate. The Sponsor currently has significant investor demand for its property interests and expects that demand to increase in the coming years.
 
INVESTMENT PROGRAM
A typical acquisition is one in which the Sponsor acquires a newly-constructed, single-tenant property with a financially strong tenant – usually a publicly-traded company. The Sponsor targets properties that investors would want to own if they had the equity needed for such a transaction, which is typically larger (in sales price) than what an investor could purchase individually. Although the Sponsor may invest in other types of fractional ownership interests, Delaware Statutory Trusts (DSTs) are presently the fractional ownership structures preferred by lenders due to the Sponsor retaining control of the investment and all major decisions throughout the life of the investment.
 
REPAYMENT PLAN
The mezzanine loans (or preferred equity investments) are retired as the fractional interests in the underlying property are sold to 1031-exchange investors. Mezzanine loans  bear interest at a fixed rate and may include points and/or origination fees and  have terms of up to twelve (12) months. Repayment of the mezzanine loans (or preferred equity investments) by the borrower are senior to any payment of fees to the Sponsor, although subordinate to the payment of any senior mortgage.

If you do not agree, do not click "I Understand and Agree".  The information in the Company's website is only for the attention of the residents of jurisdictions where it can be lawfully disseminated.

1.5         The Company's website is not intended to offer or to promote the offer or sale of the shares in the Company (the "Shares") in the United States or to US Persons.
			

1.6         The Company requires that all US Persons who acquire its securities be "qualified purchasers" as defined in Section 2(a)(51) and related rules of the Investment Company Act ("QPs") regardless of how they acquire the securities. Accordingly, each acquirer of the securities will be deemed to represent that (i) it is either (a) a QP and is acting for its own account or the account of another QP, or (b) not a US Person and is acquiring the securities outside the United States in an "offshore transaction" meeting the requirements of Regulation S under the Securities Act; (ii) it understands that the Company may receive a list of all participants holding positions in its securities from one or more book-entry depositaries; and (iii) it will provide notice of applicable transfer restrictions to any subsequent transferees.

1.8         The Company delivers to its shareholders annual audited financial statements an unaudited interim report, and such other shareholder notices as the Company deems appropriate. Unless a shareholder indicates otherwise by written notice to the Company, the shareholder hereby consents to receive the Company's financial statements, shareholder newsletters, and other shareholder notices and materials via email to the shareholder's email address in the Company's records or via the Company's website.  Although the Company does not impose any additional charges for electronic delivery, the shareholder may, of course, incur costs associated with the shareholderâ€™s electronic access, such as usage charges from the shareholder's Internet access providers. The shareholder may revoke its election to receive such documents via electronic delivery at any time by written notice to the Company requesting that the Company send such documents via facsimile or in hard copy via the postal service to the address notified to the Company by the shareholder from time to time.
