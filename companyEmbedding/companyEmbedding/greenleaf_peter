Product Description
Edited by Don Frick and Larry C. Spears, with a Foreword by Peter F. Drucker, this collection of essays is organized around the general themes of power, management, organizations, and ethics. This book starts off with an unpublished book manuscript which Greenleaf had titledThe Ethic of Strength. Part Two, “Essays on Power, Management, and Organizations,” explores the quandary of how to exercise power without violating the rights of others. Part Three, “Leadership and the Individual,” was Greenleaf’s last major essay before writing “The Servant as Leader.” Part Four concludes the book with “In Person with Robert K. Greenleaf” – a treat for all who wish they could sit down and chat with this remarkable man. Dr. Joseph DiStefano had the privilege of doing just that in December, 1986. On Becoming a Servant-Leader includes a Foreword by Peter F. Drucker.

Managing For Success



Sucampo Shifts Into Growth With Hard-Charging CEO 






MOREY STETTNER
12/24/2015


 Reprints




Like many CEOs, Peter Greenleaf knows that disagreements will inevitably arise among smart, driven executives. He says the best leaders serve as aligners who bring people together to pursue a shared vision, even if they hold different views on how to get there.
Greenleaf, 45, became chief executive of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals (SCMP) in March 2014.
A a year later, he and his executive team discussed the Bethesda, Md.-based biopharmaceutical firm's strategy.
"There was some debate over how we were building the company," Greenleaf recalled.
"Part of that was our acquisition strategy: Should we look at accretive deals that build our financial stability or dilutive deals that take longer but (strengthen our drug pipeline)?"
The leadership team, consisting of eight execs, split evenly on the issue.
Facing what Greenleaf calls "a strategic bifurcation," the CEO resolved the matter by convening an off-site meeting.
"We got together with just this one agenda item for one full day," he said. "We weren't going to leave the room until we had alignment."
The group decided to pursue accretive deals.
Four months after that meeting, Sucampo announced an all-cash tender offer to acquire R-Tech Ueno, a Japanese pharmaceutical firm.
He praises his team for not just reaching agreement on what to do, but also following through rapidly.
He credits the group's ability to engage in respectful discussion, listen well and trust each other.
Workers Become Owners
With roughly 85 employees, Sucampo makes Amitiza for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome.
After the company was founded in 1996 and had some success, Greenleaf came aboard in 2014 as a change agent to propel Sucampo's growth.
In his first six months as CEO, Greenleaf overhauled the management team.
He retained key insiders while bringing in newcomers, many of whom he knew from his past jobs in the pharmaceutical industry.
"People were joining a company with somewhat dated success," he said. "Our go-forward strategy was totally different."
Greenleaf and his new leadership team instituted an employee stock-option plan.
Most of the workforce now doubles as owners.
"We put a lot of time and attention into drafting the right long-term ownership plan," he said. "The message is, 'You're part of this company, and your future rides on it.'"
See The Vision
To boost employee engagement, Greenleaf sought everyone's input on the firm's mission and values.
Staffers completed online surveys and met in groups to hash out what they felt the company should stand for.
"Our employees helped create it and craft it into a statement that (everyone) can believe in," Greenleaf said.
He learned earlier in his career the importance of articulating and pursuing an ambitious vision.
As a product marketing manager at Centocor Biotech in the late 1990s, Greenleaf helped convince the firm's leaders and its board of directors of the marketing potential of a promising drug, Remicade, that had hit regulatory headwinds.
"We were tenacious in presenting our proposal," he said.
"And we were able to take Remicade from concept to launch to help patients. It became a $5 billion drug, and I was fortunate to be able to set the vision and stay long enough — for six years — to see it through.
"Every year, you have to go back and sell the vision."
