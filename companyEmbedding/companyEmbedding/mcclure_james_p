After the
        Spicer Massacre, two days later, Logan's band killed two
        men on Dunkard Creek, Green County, Pennsylvania. On June
        6th, they killed a man in sight of Fort Redstone. On June
        11th, a company of rangers, led by Capt. Francis McClure
        and Lieutenant Samuel Kinkade, pursued Logan on Ten Mile
        Creek. The two officers, being some distance in advance
        of the rest of the band, were ambushed. McClure was
        killed, and Kinkade was badly wounded.The Indian Wars of

Robert B.
        McClure is a son of Robert McClure, of Washington, who
        was a noted draughtsman. He also practiced medicine in
        Washington for twenty-five years under the
        "Thompsonian" system, and was very successful
        in his treatment of cholera during its prevalence in
        1832. Robert McClure died in 1852. Robert B. McClure, his
        son, settled in West Middletown in 1844, and the
        following year commenced the manufacture of
        threshing-machines. He is said to have been the first to
        manufacture machines for threshing and cleaning grain in
        the State of Pennsylvania. He is still engaged in that
        business and in the manufacture of carriages and
        agricultural implements. Previous to his commencement of
        the business in 1845, Mr. McClure had followed the trade
        of millwright. Since April 20, 1864, he has been a
        justice of the peace. History of Washington County,
        Pennsylvania Hopewell Township, p. 810-819
