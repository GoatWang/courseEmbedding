Robust specialises in production and sale of security and fire steel doors, with a cost leading manufacturing facility in Nykroppa, Sweden. The steel doors are sold to end customers through construction companies, wholesalers, and installation companies. Robust also has two manufacturing facilities in Cheadle and Staffordshire in England, to serve the UK market.
Robust is headquartered in Nykroppa, Sweden. The origins of the Company date back to 1886. Over the last decade security doors have increasingly been sold with a “wood-look” or high quality wood finish. Steel security doors have experienced solid growth in the Swedish housing renovation segment based on their cost effective burglary, noise, smoke and fire preventing qualities. Following a significant lean program in the Nykroppa production facility, Robust has positioned itself as the cost leader in the industry with the shortest lead times. Robust expects to capitalize on its competitive advantage to gain further market share both organically and through potential add-on acquisitions to strengthen its geographical positions.

Private Equity as an asset class



	Private equity is an alternative asset class consisting of equity securities in operating companies that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange. The term "private equity fund" is often used as a reference to various types of investment companies (also called "funds") that invest capital in companies as mentioned above. These funds typically invest in a number of companies in different industries to achieve a diversification in comparison to investing in a single company.

	The vast majority of the money being invested in private equity funds, comes from long term institutional investors such as pension funds, endowments, insurance companies, banks and fund-of-funds.

	Private equity is often referred to as active ownership since the fund's financial investment in a company is combined with active participation in the company's management and development. The investments made by private equity funds entail therefore not only access to capital, but also to other resources such as financial and industrial competence and networks.

	Most investments are owned by the funds for 3 to 6 years and are then exited though a  trade sale (to an industrial buyer), stock exchange listing (IPO) or through a secondary sale to a financial investor (private equity fund or other).

Norvestor aquires oil services firm Presserv
07/11/2016 · Norway · Oil & Gas ·  Norvestor 

Norvestor VII L.P. and Norvestor VII OS L.P. (“Norvestor”), funds managed by Norvestor Equity AS, has signed an agreement to invest in Presserv AS (“Presserv”) Presserv is a rapidly growing leading specialist in preservation and corrosion protection within the oil, gas, shipping and storage tank industries. They offer highly cost efficient products and services for the protection of customers’ assets through use of new technologies and methods. The company has experienced strong growth through the downturn in the oil and gas industry, by offering new and cost efficient alternatives in key international offshore markets.
“Since the establishment in 1996 Presserv has developed its unique concept within corrosion protection and preservation. Partly driven by the current market environment there is an overall trend in the industry to take better care of assets and equipment to prolong product life-time and improve asset integrity. We have seen market opportunities during both up- and downturns, combined with an ambition to expand further internationally. To be able to move forward more rapidly we acknowledge the need for support and are therefore very pleased to have Norvestor onboard as a partner. There is no doubt that their skills and experience will contribute to the continued development of Presserv. ”, says Niklas Hermansson, CEO of Presserv.
“We are very pleased with the agreement to partner with Presserv. Their unique position and highly experienced team in the preservation and corrosion protection market create an ideal platform investment for Norvestor within the asset integrity market. It is great to see a company using the downturn to introduce cost efficient methods for preservation to oil companies, asset/equipment owners and other players in the oil and gas market. The potential for continued growth is significant as the market realise the cost savings Presserv’s offerings can achieve.”, says Tor Erling Gunnerød, Partner in Norvestor Equity and chairman designate in Presserv.
Following the acquisition, Norvestor will become the largest shareholder in Presserv with approximately 80% of the shares; the management will hold the remaining shares. Presserv had consolidated pro-forma revenues of NOK 64 million in 2014 and NOK 96 million in 2015 and is expected to grow by more than 25% during 2016. Presserv employs 26 people and is headquartered in Stavanger, Norway

    photo: READ Cased Hole Limited
    

Norvestor VII L.P. and Norvestor VII OS L.P., funds managed by Norvestor Equity AS, has signed an agreement to invest in READ Cased Hole Limited.
READ Cased Hole is an independent specialised provider of production logging and well integrity evaluation services with a 25-year track record from analysing wellbore data. RCH’s “best-in-class” technologies and diagnostic excellence ensure that customers have accurate answers to plan immediate action and maximise the long-term performance of their wells.
“Since joining READ Cased Hole in December 2013, we have assembled a great team and embarked on an exciting journey to grow our position as the independent alternative for cased-hole logging and evaluation services. Our partnership with Norvestor marks a new era for READ Cased Hole, and they are as eager as we are to continue on our ambitious plan to consolidate our market position as well as expanding our range of services and geographical reach,” says Roy Martin, CEO of READ Cased Hole.
“READ Cased Hole is a well-established company with an impressive development and solid growth through a challenging period in the oilfield services market. The combination of an industry leading cased-hole analyst team, a state-of-the art tool fleet, innovative new technologies and a cost effective service model is a strong value proposition in a market where operators are looking to increase utilisation while saving cost. In READ Cased Hole, we are partnering up with a strong management team with proven track record and a history of building great businesses,” says Tor Erling Gunnerød, Partner in Norvestor Equity and chairman designate in RCH.
Following the acquisition, Norvestor will become the largest shareholder in RCH with approximately 95% of the shares and the management team will hold the remaining shares. RCH had consolidated pro-forma revenues of GBP 5.5 million in 2015 and is expected to grow by more than 20% during 2016. RCH employs 33 people and is headquartered in Aberdeen, Scotland.
