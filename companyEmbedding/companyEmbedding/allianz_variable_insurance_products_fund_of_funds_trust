Allianz investment options
    



Allianz variable annuities provide variable investment options that allow you to participate in the market. By diversifying your investments, you can help even out the market ups and downs. However, diversification means more than just putting your money into many different investment options. You should take into consideration the asset classes and money managers that may be appropriate for your personal investment goals. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.

Investing in a variable annuity may be the answer for part of your overall retirement strategy. A variable annuity offers a unique combination of features, including market participation through a variety of investment options; tax-deferred growth opportunities; and optional protection benefits that can provide certain accumulation, income, and beneficiary guarantees for an additional cost. Please note that we no longer offer any variable life insurance products.
Variable annuities and variable life insurance products are subject to investment risk, including loss of principal, and contract/policy values fluctuate daily. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate with market conditions so that units, upon distribution, may be worth more or less than the original cost.
For more complete information about variable annuities and variable investment options, call your financial professional or Allianz Life Financial Services, LLC at 800.624.0197 for a prospectus. The prospectuses contain details on investment objectives, risks, fees, and expenses, as well as other information about the variable annuity and variable investment options, which you should carefully consider. Please read the prospectuses thoroughly before sending money.
Guarantees are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing company. Variable annuity and variable life insurance guarantees do not apply to the performance of the variable subaccounts, which will fluctuate with market conditions. 
• Not FDIC insured • May lose value • No bank or credit union guarantee • Not a deposit • Not insured by any federal government agency or NCUA/NCUSIF

Applicants' Representations
1. Each of FOF Trust and VIP Trust is organized as a Delaware statutory trust and is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company. AIM, a Minnesota corporation, is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz SE, and an investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”). AIM currently serves Start Printed Page 7822as investment adviser to each existing Fund of Funds (as defined below). ALFS, a Minnesota corporation, is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz SE, and a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”). ALFS serves as the distributor for each existing Fund of Funds.
2. Applicants request the exemption to the extent necessary to permit any existing or future series of the Trusts or any other existing or future registered open-end management investment company or series thereof that: (i) Is advised by AIM or an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with AIM (any such adviser, or AIM, an “Adviser”)[1] 
          ; (ii) invests in other registered open-end management investment companies (“Underlying Funds”) in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act; and (iii) is also eligible to invest in securities (as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Act) in reliance on rule 12d1-2 under the Act (each, a “Fund of Funds”), to also invest, to the extent consistent with its investment objectives, policies, strategies and limitations, in financial instruments which may not be securities within the meaning of section 2(a)(36) of the Act (“Other Investments”).[2] 
           Applicants also request that the order exempt any entity controlling, controlled by or under common control with ALFS that now or in the future acts as principal underwriter with respect to the transactions described in the application.
3. Consistent with its fiduciary obligations under the Act, each Fund of Funds' board of trustees will review the advisory fees charged by the Fund of Funds' Adviser to ensure that they are based on services provided that are in addition to, rather than duplicative of, services provided pursuant to the advisory agreement of any investment company in which the Fund of Funds may invest.
Applicants' Legal Analysis
1. Section 12(d)(1)(A) of the Act provides that no registered investment company (“acquiring company”) may acquire securities of another investment company (“acquired company”) if such securities represent more than 3% of the acquired company's outstanding voting stock or more than 5% of the acquiring company's total assets, or if such securities, together with the securities of other investment companies, represent more than 10% of the acquiring company's total assets. Section 12(d)(1)(B) of the Act provides that no registered open-end investment company may sell its securities to another investment company if the sale will cause the acquiring company to own more than 3% of the acquired company's voting stock, or cause more than 10% of the acquired company's voting stock to be owned by investment companies and companies controlled by them.
2. Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act provides, in part, that section 12(d)(1) will not apply to securities of an acquired company purchased by an acquiring company if: (i) The acquired company and acquiring company are part of the same group of investment companies; (ii) the acquiring company holds only securities of acquired companies that are part of the same group of investment companies, government securities, and short-term paper; (iii) the aggregate sales loads and distribution-related fees of the acquiring company and the acquired company are not excessive under rules adopted pursuant to section 22(b) or section 22(c) of the Act by a securities association registered under section 15A of the Exchange Act or by the Commission; and (iv) the acquired company has a policy that prohibits it from acquiring securities of registered open-end investment companies or registered unit investment trusts in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(F) or 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act.
3. Rule 12d1-2 under the Act permits a registered open-end investment company or a registered unit investment trust that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act to acquire, in addition to securities issued by another registered investment company in the same group of investment companies, government securities, and short-term paper: (i) Securities issued by an investment company that is not in the same group of investment companies, when the acquisition is in reliance on section 12(d)(1)(A) or 12(d)(1)(F) of the Act; (ii) securities (other than securities issued by an investment company); and (iii) securities issued by a money market fund, when the investment is in reliance on rule 12d1-1 under the Act. For the purposes of rule 12d1-2, “securities” means any security as defined in section 2(a)(36) of the Act.
4. Section 6(c) of the Act provides that the Commission may exempt any person, security, or transaction from any provision of the Act, or from any rule under the Act, if such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the Act.
5. Applicants state that the Funds of Funds will comply with rule 12d1-2 under the Act, but for the fact that the Funds of Funds may invest a portion of their assets in Other Investments. Applicants request an order under section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption from rule 12d1-2(a) to allow the Funds of Funds to invest in Other Investments while investing in Underlying Funds. Applicants assert that permitting the Funds of Funds to invest in Other Investments as described in the application would not raise any of the concerns that the requirements of section 12(d)(1) were designed to address.
Applicants' Condition
Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with all provisions of rule 12d1-2 under the Act, except for paragraph (a)(2) to the extent that it restricts any Fund of Funds from investing in Other Investments as described in the application.
Start Signature

Deputy Secretary.

VOTING INSTRUCTION FORM ARE AVAILABLE AT HTTP://WWW.PROXY-DIRECT.COM/AZL20528.  
SECTION A - PROPOSALS                                                           
PROPOSAL NO. 1 - ELECTION OF TRUSTEES 
 At the Meeting, shareholders will be asked to elect the nine nominees
named below (the "Nominees") as Trustees of the Trust.  The persons named on the
enclosed voting instruction form will vote for the election of each of the      
Nominees unless authority to vote for any or all of the Nominees is withheld in 
the voting instruction form.  If elected, each Trustee will serve until a       
successor is elected and qualified or until such Trustee dies, resigns, retires,
or is removed as provided in the governing documents of the Trust.  If any or   
all of the nominees should become unavailable for election due to events not now
known or anticipated, then the persons named on the voting instruction form will
vote for such other nominee or nominees as the current Trustees may recommend.  

TRUSTEE NOMINEE INFORMATION 
The following table sets forth important information regarding each 
Nominee.  All nine Nominees are currently serving as Trustees of the Trust.     
Each of the Nominees has indicated that he or she is willing to serve as a      
Trustee.  The business address for each Nominee is the same as that of the      
Funds' investment adviser: 5701 Golden Hills Drive, Minneapolis, MN 55416.  The 
term of office for each Nominee is indefinite.  If a Nominee is elected as a    
Trustee, he or she will oversee 48 separate portfolios in the Fund Complex (as  
defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  However, if the            
reorganization of certain Funds is conducted as anticipated at the Meeting, a   
Nominee elected as Trustee will oversee 35 separate portfolios in the Fund      
Complex.

      There were eleven joint meetings of the Board during the fiscal year ended

Board that he was eligible to attend.                                           

      Approval of the election of each of the Nominees to the Board requires the
affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares voted at the Meeting.  The votes  
of each Fund of each separate Trust, respectively, will be counted together with
respect to the election of the Nominees to the Board.                           

   THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES UNANIMOUSLY RECOMMENDS A VOTE FOR THE PROPOSAL TO
APPROVE THE ELECTION OF EACH OF THE NOMINEES TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.          
PROPOSAL NO. 2 -- RATIFICATION OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 
The Audit Committee of the Board has appointed KPMG LLP ("KPMG") as 
independent registered public accountants for each of the Trusts for the fiscal 
year ending December 31, 2009.  While shareholder ratification of KPMG as       
independent registered public accountants for each of the Trusts is not         
required, the Board is submitting the appointment of KPMG to the shareholders   
for ratification as a matter of good corporate practice.  If the shareholders   
fail to ratify the appointment, the Audit Committee will reconsider whether or  
not to retain that firm.  Even if the appointment is ratified, the Audit        
Committee, which is solely responsible for appointing and terminating the       
independent registered public accountants of the Trusts, may in its discretion, 
direct the appointment of different independent registered public accountants   
for a particular Trust at any time during the year if it determines that such a 
change would be in the best interests of that particular Trust and its          
shareholders.  A representative of KPMG is expected to be present at the Meeting
with the opportunity to make a statement if he or she desires to do so and to   
respond to shareholder questions.

SECTION B - OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE TRUSTS                              
MANAGEMENT OF THE TRUSTS
     Overall responsibility for management of each Trust rests with its Board,
who are elected by the shareholders of such Trust.  Trustees serve on both of   
the Boards of the VIP Trust and the FOF Trust.  The Trustees elect the officers 
of the Trust to supervise its day-to-day operations.  Subject to the Declaration
of Trust, the Board manages the business of the Trust, and the Trustees have all
powers necessary or convenient to carry out this responsibility including the   
power to engage in transactions of all kinds on behalf of the Trust.  The Board 
is responsible for oversight of the officers and may elect and remove, with or  
without cause, such officers as the Board considers appropriate.                

   The shareholders of each Trust are insurance company separate accounts.
Separate account contract owners own units in the insurance company separate    
accounts through variable life insurance policies and variable annuity          
contracts, and the separate accounts in turn own shares of the VIP Trust or FOF 
Trust, among other mutual fund investment options.  A Contract Owner may        
communicate with the Board of either Trust by phone at 1-800-624-0197, or by    
mail at 5701 Golden Hills Drive, A3-765, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55416.          

    The Board has established the following standing committees to assist in
the oversight of the Trusts:                                                    

1.   The AUDIT COMMITTEE, made up of Mr. Burnim, Ms. Ettestad, Mr. Gelfenbien,  
Ms. Leonardi, Mr. Lewis, Mr. McClean and Mr. Reeds, met four times during the   
last fiscal year.  Mr. Reeds serves as chairman of the Audit Committee.  The    
functions of the Audit Committee include advising the full Board with respect to
accounting, auditing and financial matters affecting the Trust.  None of the    
members of the Audit Committee are "interested persons," as defined by the      
Investment Company Act of 1940.                                                 

2.   The INVESTMENT COMMITTEE, made up of Mr. Burnim, Ms. Ettestad, Mr.         
Gelfenbien, Ms. Leonardi, Mr. Lewis, Mr. McClean and Mr. Reeds, met four times  
during the last fiscal year.  Mr. Gelfenbien and Mr. McClean serve as co-       
chairmen of the Investment Committee.  The functions of the Investment Committee
include evaluating and supervising the investment adviser, Allianz Investment   
Management LLC (the "Manager"), and subadvisers to the various investment       
portfolios of the Trust.  None of the members of the Investment Committee are   
"interested persons," as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940.         

3.   The NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE, made up of Mr. Burnim,  
Ms. Ettestad, Mr. Gelfenbien, Ms. Leonardi, Mr. Lewis, Mr. McClean and Mr.      
Reeds, met three times during the last fiscal year.  Ms. Ettestad and Ms.       
Leonardi serve as co-chairpersons of the Nominating and Corporate Governance    
Committee.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee advises the Board 
with respect to the selection and nomination of candidates for election to the  
Board.  It does not consider nominees recommended by shareholders of the Trust. 
None of the members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are    
"interested persons," as defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940.         

    The process for identifying and evaluating candidates to be nominated as
Trustees requires that each candidate be evaluated by the Nominating and        
Corporate Governance Committee with respect to the relevant business and        
industry experience that would enable the candidate to serve effectively as a   
non-interested Trustee, as well as his or her compatibility with respect to     
business philosophy and style.  In addition, the members of the Nominating and  
Corporate Governance Committee may conduct in-person interviews of each         
candidate using a standardized questionnaire.  When all of the viable candidates
have been evaluated and interviewed, the Nominating and Corporate Governance    
Committee determines which of the viable candidates should be (a) recommended to
fill a vacancy on the Board, when at least two-thirds of the Trustees have been 
elected by the shareholders, or (b) presented to the shareholders for election  
to become a member of the Board.  In addition, the Nominating and Corporate     
Governance Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board to       
determine whether it may be appropriate to add individuals with different       
backgrounds or skill sets from those persons who are already members of the     
Board.  Other than the process described here, the Nominating and Corporate     
Governance Committee does not impose a minimum set of qualifications or         
standards upon those individuals whom they are considering as nominees for      
Trustee.  Neither Trust regularly pays third parties fees to assist in the      
process of identifying and evaluating candidates.  However, the Nominating and  
Corporate Governance Committee has the resources and

authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including the authority
to retain special counsel and other experts or consultants at the expense of the
Trusts.                                                                         

The charter for the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is
attached hereto as Appendix A.                                                  

13.   The VALUATION AND INVESTMENT POLICY COMMITTEE, made up of Mr. Kletti,     
Darin Egbert, Brian Muench, Michael J. Tanski, Bradley K. Quello, Jeremy Smith  
and David Teske, met 12 times during the last fiscal year.  The Valuation and   
Investment Policy Committee monitors the valuation of portfolio securities and  
other investments of the Funds.  When the Board is not in session, the Pricing  
Subcommittee of the Valuation and Investment Policy Committee determines the    
fair value of illiquid and other holdings.  All of the members of the Valuation 
and Investment Policy Committee are "interested persons," as defined by the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.                                                 

OFFICER INFORMATION 
The following table sets forth important information regarding the  
officers of the Trusts (along with Jeffrey Kletti, the "Officers").  Jeffrey

obtained from the Trustee Nominee table in Section A, Proposal No. 1 above.

ANNUAL REPORTS OF THE TRUSTS
      Upon request, the Trusts will send to you a copy of the most recent annual
report and the most recent semi-annual report succeeding the annual report, if  
any.  Please contact the Trusts by phone at 1-877-833-7113, or by mail at 5701  
Golden Hills Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55416, and one will be sent to you,  
without charge, by first class mail, within three business days.                

SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS 
  Neither Trust is required to hold annual shareholders meetings.  Since
neither Trust holds regular meetings of shareholders, the anticipated date of   
the next shareholders meeting cannot be provided.  Any shareholder proposal     
which may properly be included in the proxy solicitation material for a         
shareholders meeting must be received by the respective Trust a reasonable time 
before such Trust begins to print and send proxy materials to shareholders.     

SHAREHOLDER WITH THE SAME ADDRESS 
The Trusts' practice is to "household," or consolidate shareholder  
mailings of proxy statements to shareholders who share the same address.  This  
means that a single copy of this proxy statement is sent to the address of      
record.  If at any time you wish to receive multiple copies of the proxy        
statement at your address, you may contact the Trusts by phone at 1-877-833-    
7113, or by mail at 5701 Golden Hills Drive, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55416, and  
the Trusts will mail additional proxy statements for each of your accounts      
within 30 days of your request.  You may also contact the Trusts in the same    
manner and request that you receive a single copy of proxy statements if you are
receiving multiple copies at a particular address.

SECTION C - PROXY VOTING AND SHAREHOLDER MEETING INFORMATION                    
A special joint meeting of shareholders of the Funds will be held as
specified in the Notice of Special Joint Meeting that accompanies this proxy    
statement.  At the Meeting, shareholders (the separate accounts) will vote their
shares of the Funds.                                                            

You have the right to instruct Allianz Life and Allianz Life of NY  
(together, "Allianz") on how to vote the shares of the Funds held under your    
Contract.  The number of Fund shares for which you may provide instructions will
be based on the dollar amount of Fund shares that you own beneficially through  
the subaccount accumulation units and/or annuity units in your Contract on the  
record date, July 31, 2009.  Each accumulation unit or annuity unit             

10

P-->DEF 14A16th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
represents a specified dollar value and a specified number of Fund shares. For  
each dollar of value, the Contract Owner is permitted to vote one Fund share.   
Fractional votes are counted. If you execute and return your voting instruction 
form, but do not provide voting instructions, Allianz will vote the shares      
underlying your Contract in favor of the proposals described above. Allianz will
vote any shares for which it does not receive voting instructions, and any      
shares which it or its affiliates hold for their own account, in proportionately
the same manner as shares for which it has received voting instructions. Allianz
will not require voting instructions for a minimum number of shares, and        
therefore a small number of shareholders could determine the outcome of any     
proposal.                                                                       

   For the Meeting to proceed, there must be a quorum.  This means that at
least 25% of a Fund's shares must be represented at the Meeting either in person
or by proxy.  Because Allianz is the only shareholder of the Funds, its presence
at the Meeting in person or by proxy will meet the quorum requirement.          

     The affirmative vote of a plurality of the shares voted at the Meeting is
required to approve the election of each of the Nominees to the Board.  The     
affirmative vote of a majority of the shares voted at the Meeting is required to
ratify the selection of KPMG as independent registered public accountants for   
the Trusts.  The votes of each Fund of each separate Trust, respectively, will  
be counted together with respect to the election of the Nominees to the Board   
and the ratification of KPMG.                                                   

You may revoke your voting instructions up until voting results are 
announced at the Meeting or at any adjournment of the Meeting by giving written 
notice to Allianz prior to the Meeting by mail to Allianz Variable Insurance    
Products Trust, c/o Advisory Management, A 3-825, 5701 Golden Hills Drive,      
Minneapolis, Minnesota 55416, by executing and returning to Allianz a voting    
instruction form with a later date, or by attending the Meeting and voting in   
person.  If you need a new voting instruction form, please call the Fund at 1-  
800-950-5872 ext. 35857, and a new voting instruction form will be sent to you. 
If you return an executed form without voting instructions, your shares will be 
voted "FOR" the proposal.                                                       

The Funds will pay all costs of solicitation, including the cost of 
preparing and mailing the Notice of Special Joint Meeting of shareholders and   
this proxy statement to Contract Owners.  Representatives of the investment     
adviser, without cost to the Funds, also may solicit voting instructions from   
Contract Owners by means of mail, telephone, or personal calls.                 

ADJOURNMENT 
    In the event that voting instructions received by the time scheduled for
the Meeting are not sufficient to approve the election of the Trustees or the   
ratification of the independent registered public accountants, representatives  
of Allianz may move for one or more adjournments of the Meeting for a period of 
not more than 120 days in the aggregate to allow further solicitation of voting 
instructions on the proposals.  Any adjournment requires the affirmative vote of
a majority of the voting power of the shares present at the Meeting.            
Representatives of Allianz will vote in favor of adjournment.  The Funds will   
pay the costs of any additional solicitation and of any adjourned Meeting.  A   
shareholder vote may be taken on one or more of the proposals in this proxy     
statement prior to adjournment if sufficient voting instructions have been      
received.                                                                       

                            By Order of the Board of Trustees,

 THE ALLIANZ VARIABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS FUND OF FUNDS
 TRUST

   This Charter sets forth the purpose, authority, and responsibilities of
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees of   
the Allianz Variable Insurance Products Trust (the "VIP Trust") and Board of    
Trustees of the Allianz Variable Insurance Products Fund of Funds Trust (the    
"FOF Trust") (collectively, the VIP Trust and the FOF Trust are referred to as  
the "Trusts").  The Charter will be reviewed and approved annually by the Boards
of Trustees of the Trusts.                                                      

PURPOSE                                                                         
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has two primary   
purposes:  responsibility for the nomination of one or more persons to serve as 
a member of the Boards of Trustees of the Trusts, and responsibility for        
corporate governance matters affecting the Trusts.                              

AUTHORITY                                                                       
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee has been duly     
established by the Boards of Trustees of the Trusts, and shall be provided with 
appropriate resources to discharge its responsibilities effectively.            

COMPOSITION AND TERM OF MEMBERS OF THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE      
COMMITTEE                                                                       
      The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall be composed of all
the members of the Boards of Trustees who are not "interested persons" of the   
Trusts ("Independent Trustees") as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (" 1940 Act").  The members of the Boards of Trustees who   
are members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee are listed in  
Exhibit A hereto.  The members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance       
Committee shall designate one member to serve as Chair of the Nominating and    
Corporate Governance Committee.  Each member of the Nominating and Corporate    
Governance Committee shall serve until a successor is appointed.                

MEETINGS 
     The Chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall call
meetings on an "as needed" basis to address the Committee's responsibility for  
the nomination of one or more persons to serve as a member of the Boards of     
Trustees of the Trusts.  Meetings regarding                                     

12

P-->DEF 14A20th�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
that responsibility may be held as often as deemed appropriate by the Chair of  
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Meetings regarding its       
responsibility for corporate governance matters affecting the Trusts will be    
held prior to, as part of, or otherwise incident to the regular meetings of the 
Board of Trustees. Counsel to the Independent Trustees of the Trusts will serve 
as counsel to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, and will be    
responsible for preparing and maintaining the minutes of the meetings of the    
Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. Minutes of each such meeting will
be circulated to all members of the Nominating and Corporate Governance         
Committee in a timely manner.                                                   

RESPONSIBILITIES                                                                
      The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall provide assistance
to the Board of Trustees in fulfilling its responsibilities to the shareholders 
of the Trusts.                                                                  

FUNCTIONS OF THE NOMINATING AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE                  
     1.    As required by Rules 10f-3, 12b-1, 15a-4, 17a-7, 17a-8, 17d-1, 17e-
1, 17g-1, and 18f-3 under the 1940 Act, the Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee shall nominate persons to become Independent Trustees of the Trusts.  
The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall evaluate the            
qualifications of a candidate to become an Independent Trustee and his or her   
independence from the Allianz Life Advisers, LLC, the various sub-advisers, and 
other principal service providers to the Trusts.  A candidate must be           
"disinterested" in terms of both the letter and the spirit of Section 2(a)(19)  
of the 1940 Act, as well as satisfy the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act  
of 2002.  The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall also consider 
the effect of any relationships beyond those delineated in that Act that might  
impair the independence of a candidate, such as business, financial, or family  
relationships with Allianz Life Advisers, LLC, the various sub-advisers, or     
principal service providers to the Trusts.                                      

2.    Candidates may be recommended by members of the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee and by members of the Board of Trustees.  Each   
candidate will be evaluated by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
with respect to the relevant business and industry experience that would enable 
the candidate to serve effectively as an Independent Trustee, as well as his or 
her compatibility with respect to business philosophy and style.  The members of
the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee may conduct an in-person      
interview of each viable candidate using a standardized questionnaire.  When all
of the viable candidates have been evaluated and interviewed, the Nominating and
Corporate Governance Committee shall determine which of the viable candidates   
should be presented to the Boards of Trustees for selection to become a member  
of the Boards of Trustees.                                                      

    3.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall review the
corporate governance procedures of the Boards of Trustees no less frequently    
than annually and shall recommend any appropriate changes to the Boards of      
Trustees.                                                                       

      4.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall periodically
review the composition of the Boards of Trustees to determine whether it may be 
appropriate to add individuals with backgrounds or skill sets different from    
those persons who are already serving as members of the Boards of Trustees.     

13

P-->DEF 14A21st�Page�of�22TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
      5.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall periodically
review the compensation received by Independent Trustees and shall recommend any
appropriate changes to the amount or form of such compensation to the Boards of 
Trustees.                                                                       

NOMINATIONS WITH RESPECT TO OTHER COMMITTEES OF THE BOARDS                      
1.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall make  
nominations for membership on all of the Committees created by the Boards of    
Trustees and shall review such assignments no less frequently than annually.    

    2.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall review, as
necessary and no less frequently than annually, the responsibilities of each of 
the Committees created by the Boards of Trustees, including whether there is a  
continuing need for such a Committee, whether there is a need for the Boards of 
Trustees to create any additional Committees, and whether any of the existing   
Committees should be combined or reorganized.  The Nominating and Corporate     
Governance Committee shall make recommendations for any such action to the      
Boards of Trustees.                                                             

RETIREMENT POLICIES                                                             
   1.    It shall be the policy of the Nominating and Corporate Governance
Committee that Independent Trustees will retire from active service on the      
Boards of Trustees by the end of the year in which they reach their 72nd        
birthday.

     1.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall monitor the
performance of independent legal counsel employed by the Independent Trustees as
defined in Rule 0-1 under the 1940 Act, and shall be responsible for the        
supervision of such independent legal counsel.                                  

  2.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall have the
resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including
the authority to retain special counsel and other experts or consultants at the 
expense of the Trusts.                                                          

  3.    The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee shall consider
such other matters as may be referred to it from time to time by the Boards of  
Trustees.

securities, together with the securities of
other investment companies, represent
more than 10% of the acquiring
company’s total assets. Section
12(d)(1)(B) of the Act provides that no
registered open-end investment
company may sell its securities to
another investment company if the sale
will cause the acquiring company to
own more than 3% of the acquired
company’s voting stock, or cause more
than 10% of the acquired company’s
voting stock to be owned by investment
companies and companies controlled by
them.
2. Section 12(d)(1)(G) of the Act
provides, in part, that section 12(d)(1)
will not apply to securities of an
acquired company purchased by an
acquiring company if: (i) The acquired

part of the same group of investment
companies; (ii) the acquiring company
holds only securities of acquired
companies that are part of the same
group of investment companies,
government securities, and short-term
paper; (iii) the aggregate sales loads and
distribution-related fees of the acquiring
company and the acquired company are
not excessive under rules adopted
pursuant to section 22(b) or section
22(c) of the Act by a securities
association registered under section 15A
of the Exchange Act or by the
Commission; and (iv) the acquired
company has a policy that prohibits it
from acquiring securities of registered
open-end investment companies or
registered unit investment trusts in
reliance on section 12(d)(1)(F) or
12(d)(1)(G) of the Act.
3. Rule 12d1–2 under the Act permits
a registered open-end investment
company or a registered unit investment
trust that relies on section 12(d)(1)(G) of
the Act to acquire, in addition to
securities issued by another registered
investment company in the same group
of investment companies, government
securities, and short-term paper: (i)
Securities issued by an investment
company that is not in the same group
of investment companies, when the
acquisition is in reliance on section
12(d)(1)(A) or 12(d)(1)(F) of the Act; (ii)
securities (other than securities issued
by an investment company); and (iii)
securities issued by a money market
fund, when the investment is in reliance

necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
fairly intended by the policies and
provisions of the Act.
5. Applicants state that the Funds of
Funds will comply with rule 12d1–2
under the Act, but for the fact that the
Funds of Funds may invest a portion of
their assets in Other Investments.
Applicants request an order under
section 6(c) of the Act for an exemption
from rule 12d1–2(a) to allow the Funds
of Funds to invest in Other Investments
while investing in Underlying Funds.
Applicants assert that permitting the
Funds of Funds to invest in Other
Investments as described in the
application would not raise any of the
concerns that the requirements of
section 12(d)(1) were designed to
address.
Applicants’ Condition
Applicants agree that any order
granting the requested relief will be
subject to the following condition:
Applicants will comply with all
provisions of rule 12d1–2 under the Act,
except for paragraph (a)(2) to the extent

authority.

Before you invest, you may want to review the Fund�s Prospectus, which contains more information about the Fund and its risks. You can find the Fund�s
Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information (�SAI�) and other information about the Fund online at www.allianzlife.com/azlfunds. You can also get this information at no cost by calling 1-800-624-0197 or by sending an email request to variableannuity@send.allianzlife.com. The Fund�s Prospectus and SAI, both dated April 25, 2016, as supplemented October 14, 2016, are incorporated by
reference into this Summary Prospectus.  �




Investment Objective
 The Fund seeks high total investment return.
 �




Fees and Expenses
 Fees and Expenses of the Fund  The
following table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. The Fund is offered exclusively as an investment option for certain Contracts. The table below reflects only Fund expenses and does not reflect
Contract fees and expenses. If Contract fees and expenses were included, the fees and expenses in the following table would be higher. Please refer to the Contract prospectus for a description of those fees and expenses.

(1)�
Because Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not included in the Fund�s Financial Highlights, the Fund�s total annual fund operating expenses do not correlate to the ratios of expenses to average net assets
shown in the Financial Highlights table of the prospectus. 


(2)�
Other Expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses have been restated to reflect estimated expenses for the current fiscal year. 
Example  This example is intended to help you compare the cost of
investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the
Fund�s operating expenses remain the same, and that you reinvest all dividends and distributions. It does not reflect any Contract fees. If Contract fees were included, the costs shown would be higher. Although your actual costs may be higher
or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:  �

 Portfolio Turnover  The Fund pays
transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or �turns over� its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund
operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund�s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund�s portfolio turnover rate was 64% of the average value of its portfolio.

Investments, Risks, and Performance
 Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund 
The Fund is a fund of funds that invests primarily in a combination of three underlying mutual funds (the �Underlying Funds�), which are managed by
the Manager. The Fund is designed to provide a diversified portfolio consisting of Underlying Funds in equity and fixed income asset classes, combined with the MVP (Managed Volatility Portfolio) risk management process intended to adjust the risk of
the portfolio based on quantitative indicators of market risk, such as the current level of fund and market volatility.  Under normal market conditions,
the Manager will allocate approximately 80%-100% of the Fund�s assets to the Underlying Funds. Of this allocation, approximately 50% will be allocated to the AZL BlackRock Global Allocation Fund, approximately 20% to the AZL Global Equity Index
Fund, and approximately 30% to the AZL Enhanced Bond Index Fund. The percentage allocations to each strategy will be monitored regularly by the adviser, but generally will not exceed plus or minus 10% of the target ranges. The Manager may allocate
the Fund�s assets outside of the target ranges specified here when the Manager believes that doing so would better enable the Fund to pursue its investment objective or is necessary for temporary defensive purposes. 
Up to 20% of the Fund�s assets may be allocated to the Fund�s MVP risk management process, which is intended to manage the risk of the Fund and its
allocation to equities. This process could cause the equity exposure of the Fund to fluctuate, but equity exposure generally will not be lower than 10%. Generally, the MVP risk management process would not reduce equity exposure during periods of
moderate and low market volatility. During periods of extreme market volatility, the MVP process could result in equity exposure that is much lower than 10%. 
The Manager will implement the Fund�s MVP risk management process using futures. Futures provide the Manager an effective method to reduce volatility of
the Fund and limit the need to decrease or increase allocations to underlying funds. The process is intended to limit market exposure during periods of high volatility, although the process may not always be successful. In some market conditions
exhibiting high volatility, the process may result in the Fund underperforming the market during rising markets, and outperforming the market during declining markets. The Manager seeks to maintain an annualized volatility level for the Fund at or
below 10% over a typical business cycle (i.e., over a period of a year or more). The actual or realized volatility for short-term or long-term periods of time will be dependent on the market environment and may be significantly higher in the event
that the strategy is unsuccessful. The MVP process is employed when normal market conditions, as defined by the Manager, do not exist.  The AZL BlackRock
Global Allocation Fund seeks high total investment return. It invests in a portfolio of equity, debt and money market securities. At any given time, the Underlying Fund may emphasize either debt securities or equity securities. In selecting equity
investments, the Underlying Fund mainly seeks securities that the Underlying Fund�s subadviser believes are undervalued. The Underlying Fund may buy debt securities of varying maturities, debt securities paying a fixed or fluctuating rate of
interest, and debt securities of any kind. The Underlying Fund may invest up to 35% of its net assets in �junk bonds,� corporate loans and distressed securities. The Underlying Fund may also invest in real estate investment trusts and
securities related to real assets (like real estate- or precious metals-related securities) such as stocks, bonds or convertible bonds issued by REITs or companies that mine precious metals. 
The AZL Global Equity Index Fund seeks to match the performance of the MSCI World Index as closely as possible. It invests primarily in the securities which
constitute the MSCI World Index.
 The AZL Enhanced Bond Index Fund seeks to exceed the total return of the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. It invests
under normal market conditions at least 80% of its net assets in investment-grade debt securities (those of medium and high quality) of all types and repurchase agreements for those securities. The subadviser uses the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond
Index as a guide in structuring the Underlying Fund and selecting its investments and manages the Fund to have similar overall interest rate risk to the index.

Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund  The price per share of the
Fund will fluctuate with changes in value of the investments held by the Fund. You may lose money by investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other government agency. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its objective.
 As a fund of funds, the Fund is subject to
allocation risk, which is the risk associated with the Manager�s decision regarding how the Fund�s assets should be allocated among the various underlying investment options. The Manager�s decisions about the

� �
The Allianz Variable Insurance Products Fund of Funds Trust

� 2 








Summary Prospectus
�
AZL� MVP BlackRock Global Strategy
Plus Fund � 
allocation of the Fund�s assets could cause the Fund to underperform other funds with similar investment objectives. There also can be no guarantee that investment decisions made by the
Manager will produce the desired results. The Fund, as a shareholder of the underlying fund, indirectly bears its proportionate share of any investment management fees and other expenses of the underlying fund. 
Because the Fund may utilize futures pursuant to its MVP risk management process, the Fund also is subject to derivatives risk, including risks related to
futures and options. Investing in derivative instruments involves risks that may be different from or greater than the risks associated with investing directly in securities or other traditional investments. The value of options and futures
contracts depend primarily upon the price of the securities, indexes, commodities, currencies or other instruments underlying them. Price movements are also influenced by, among other things, interest rates, changing supply and demand relationships,
trade, fiscal, monetary, and exchange control programs and policies of governments, and national and international political and economic events and policies. The cost of�options is related, in part, to the degree of volatility of the
underlying indices, securities, currencies, or�other assets. Accordingly, options on highly volatile indices, securities, currency, or other assets may be more expensive than options on other investments. Changes in the value of the derivative
may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the principal amount invested.  Because the Fund
invests primarily in the Underlying Funds, it is subject to the following risks associated with those investments:



�
�
Market Risk��The market value of portfolio securities may go up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably. 


�
�
Issuer Risk��The value of a security may decline for a number of reasons directly related to the issuer of the security. 


�
�
Selection Risk��If an Underlying Fund is actively managed, there can be no guarantee that investment decisions made for the fund will produce the desired results. 


�
�
Growth Stocks Risk��Returns on growth stocks may not move in tandem with returns on other categories of stocks or the market as a whole. Growth stocks may be susceptible to rapid price swings or to
adverse developments in certain sectors of the market. 


�
�
Leveraging Risk��An Underlying Fund may engage in certain kinds of transactions, including the use of derivatives, that may give rise to a form of leverage. The use of leverage may require the Fund to
liquidate a portfolio position at a disadvantageous time or may exaggerate the effect of any increase or decrease in the value of the Fund�s portfolio securities. 


�
�
Capitalization Risk��Investing in small- to mid-sized companies creates risk because smaller companies may have unpredictable or limited earnings, and their securities may be less liquid or experience
more volatile prices than those of large companies. 


�
�
Credit Risk��The failure of the issuer of a debt security to pay interest or repay principal in a timely manner may have an adverse impact on a Fund�s earnings. 


�
�
Convertible Securities Risk��The value of convertible securities may be affected by interest rates, default by the issuer on principal or interest payments, and the value of the underlying stock into
which the securities may be converted. 


�
�
Interest Rate Risk��Debt securities held by the Underlying Fund may decline in value due to rising interest rates. Interest rates in the U.S. are at, or near, historic lows, which may increase the
Fund�s exposure to risks related to rising rates. 


�
�
Foreign Risk��Investing in the securities of non-U.S. issuers involves a number of risks, such as fluctuations in currency values, adverse political, social or economic developments, and differences in
social and economic developments or policies. 


�
�
Depositary Receipt Risk��Depositary receipts involve many of the same risks as those associated with direct investment in foreign securities. 


�
�
Liquidity Risk��An investment that is difficult to purchase or sell may have an adverse effect on the Underlying Fund�s returns. 


�
�
Private Placed Securities Risk��An Underlying Fund may invest in privately placed securities, which are subject to resale restrictions. 


�
�
Initial Public Offerings Risk��Securities purchased in initial public offerings (IPOs) may be issued by companies with limited operating histories or companies that are undercapitalized. The trading
market for these securities may be limited. 


�
�
Portfolio Turnover��An Underlying Fund may trade its portfolio securities frequently, which could result in higher transaction costs and could adversely affect the Fund�s performance.



�
�
Index Fund Risk��An Underlying Fund does not attempt to manage market volatility or reduce the effects of poor bond performance. In addition, factors such as Fund expenses, selection of a representative
portfolio, changes in the composition of the index, or the timing of purchases or redemptions of Fund shares may affect the correlation between the performance of the index and the Fund�s performance.

Summary Prospectus
�
AZL� MVP BlackRock Global Strategy
Plus Fund �


�
�
Call Risk��If interest rates fall, issuers of callable debt securities are more likely to prepay prior to the maturity date. The Fund may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the prepayment in
investments that will generate the same level of income. 


�
�
Extension Risk��If interest rates rise, debt securities may be paid in full more slowly than anticipated. 


�
�
Currency Risk��Investing in securities that trade in and receive revenues in foreign currencies creates risk because foreign currencies may decline relative to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a potential
loss to the Fund. In the case of hedging positions, the U.S. dollar may decline in value relative to the currency that has been hedged. 


�
�
Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Risk��Investing in mortgage-related or other asset-backed securities involves a variety of risks associated with the credit markets, such as rising or falling
interest rates, increases in the rate of defaults or prepayments, and the quality of the pool of mortgages (subprime risk) or other assets that backs the security. 


�
�
Repurchase Agreements and Purchase and Sale Contracts Risk��If the other party to a repurchase agreement or purchase and sale contract defaults on it obligation under the agreement, the Fund may suffer
delays and incur costs or lose money in exercising its rights under the agreement. If the seller fails to repurchase the security in ether situation and the market value of the security declines, the Fund may lose money. 


�
�
Emerging Markets Risk��Emerging markets may have less developed or more volatile trading markets, less developed legal and accounting systems, and greater likelihood of government restrictions,
nationalization, or confiscation than developed countries. 


�
�
Sovereign Debt Risk��Sovereign debt instruments are subject to the risk that a governmental entity may delay or refuse to pay interest or repay principal on its sovereign debt, due, for example, to cash
flow problems, insufficient foreign currency reserves, political considerations, the relative size of the governmental entity�s debt position in relation to the economy or the failure to put in place economic reforms required by the
International Monetary Fund or other multilateral agencies. 


�
�
U.S. Government Obligations Risk��Certain securities in which the Fund may invest, including securities issued by certain government agencies and government sponsored enterprises, are not guaranteed by
the U.S. Government or supported by the full faith and credit of the United States.  Performance Information 
The following bar chart and table provide an indication of the risks of an investment in the Fund by showing changes in its performance from year to year and
by showing how the Fund�s average annual returns for one year and since its inception compare with those of a broad-based measure of market performance, the FTSE World Index. The Fund�s performance also is compared to the returns of the
S&P 500 Index, the FTSE World (ex U.S.) Index, the BofA Merrill Lynch Current 5-Year U.S. Treasury Index, the Citigroup (Non-USD) World Government Bond Index and the Reference Benchmark, which are relevant to the Fund because they have
characteristics similar to the Fund�s investment strategies. The Reference Benchmark: 30% of the S&P 500 Index; 20% FTSE World (ex U.S.) Index; 30% BofA Merrill Lynch Current 5-year U.S. Treasury Index; and 20% Citigroup (Non-USD) World
Government Bond Index.  Both the bar chart and the table assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions.

The performance of the Fund will vary from year to year. The Fund�s performance does not reflect the cost of insurance and separate account charges which
are imposed under your Contract. If they were included, performance would be reduced. Past performance does not indicate how the Fund will perform in the future. 
Prior to October 14, 2016, the Fund was known as the AZL MVP BlackRock Global Allocation Fund and invested in different underlying investments. Consequently,
the performance information below may have been different if the Fund had been managed according to its current investment strategies prior to October 14, 2016.

Financial Intermediary Compensation
 Shares of the Funds are sold exclusively to certain insurance companies in connection with particular Contracts. The Trust and
its related companies may pay such insurance companies (or their related companies) for the sale of shares of the Funds and related services. Such insurance companies (or their related companies) may pay broker-dealers or other financial
intermediaries (such as banks) that sell the Contracts for the sale of shares of the Funds and related services. When received by an insurance company, such payments may be a factor that the insurance companies consider in including a Fund as an
investment option in the Contracts. The prospectus or other disclosures relating to a Contract may contain additional information about these payments. When received by a broker-dealer or other intermediary, such payments may create a conflict of
interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and salespersons to recommend the Fund over other mutual funds available as investment options in the Contracts. Ask the salesperson or visit the financial intermediary�s website
for more information.
