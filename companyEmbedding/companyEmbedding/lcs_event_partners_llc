	Explanation of Responses:








	(


	1) 





	This Form 3 is filed jointly by Levin Capital Strategies, L.P. ("LCS"), Levin Capital Strategies GP, LLC ("LCS GP"), Levin Capital Trilogy Master Fund, Ltd. ("Trilogy"), LCS, LLC ("LCSL"), Levcap Alternative Fund, L.P. ("Levcap"), LCS Event Partners, LLC ("LCSEP"), Safinia Partners, L.P. ("Safinia"), LCS L/S, LLC ("LCSLS"), and John A. Levin (collectively, the "Reporting Persons").







	(


	2) 





	The Reporting Persons are passive investors in the Issuer and are voluntarily filing this Form 3 as a result of acquiring over 20% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Reporting Persons have not acquired the shares with a purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the Issuer. Pursuant to Rule 16a-1(a)(4) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), this filing shall not be construed as an admission that the Reporting Persons are, for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or otherwise, the beneficial owners of any of the securities reported herein under Section 16 or otherwise. Each of the Reporting Persons specifically disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein that are not directly owned by such Reporting Person, except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein.







	(


	3) 





	Shares owned directly by Trilogy. LCSL, as the general partner of the domestic feeder fund which owns a controlling interest in Trilogy, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Trilogy. LCS, as the investment advisor of Trilogy, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Trilogy. Mr. Levin, as the Chief Executive Officer of LCS, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Trilogy.







	(


	4) 





	Shares owned directly by Levcap. LCSEP, as the general partner of Levcap, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Levcap. LCS, as the investment advisor of Levcap, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Levcap. Mr. Levin, as the Chief Executive Officer of LCS, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Levcap.







	(


	5) 





	Shares owned directly by Safinia. LCSLS, as the general partner of Safinia, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Safinia. LCS, as the investment advisor of Safinia, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Safinia. Mr. Levin, as the Chief Executive Officer of LCS, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Safinia.










	Remarks:



	As the investment manager to certain managed accounts (the "Managed Accounts"), LCS may be deemed to share dispositive over 6,136,241 shares held in the Managed Accounts and may be deemed to share voting power over only 4,296,969 of such shares. As the sub-investment advisor to Transamerica Large Cap Value Fund ("Transamerica"), LCS may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over 1,098,376 shares held by Transamerica. LCS receives an asset-based management fee for serving as investment manager to the Managed Accounts, except that with respect to 50,711 shares held in Managed Accounts, LCS receives a performance-based incentive fee. The performance-based incentive fee LCS receives for such Managed Accounts does not constitute a reportable pecuniary interest under Section 16a-1(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, as such fee is based on the performance of the overall account, over a period of one year or more and the shares of the Issuer held in such accounts constitute no more than 10% of the market value thereof. LCS receives an asset-based management fee for serving as sub-investment advisor to Transamerica. Accordingly, LCS does not have a reportable pecuniary interest in the shares held by Transamerica or the shares held in the Managed Accounts. In addition, none of LCS GP, Trilogy, LCSL, Levcap, LCSEP, Safinia, LCSLS and Mr. Levin have a reportable pecuniary interest in the shares held by Transamerica or the shares held in the Managed Accounts.

ITEM 4. 
PURPOSE OF TRANSACTION. 
The Reporting Persons are currently
holding the Issuers securities being reported hereunder for investment
purposes. On September 29, 2015, John A. Levin, on his own behalf and on behalf
of Levin Capital Strategies L.P. and various family related entities, sent a
letter to the Companys Chairman and members of its Board of Directors. A copy
of the letter is attached to this Schedule 13D/A as Exhibit B hereto. Among
other things, the letter details the Companys declining stock price since its
spinoff in November 2014 and certain potential conflicts of interest that Levin
believes exist as a function of the Companys external management structure,
particularly its management by Fortress. In addition, Levin offered to work
constructively with the Company, its Board of Directors and Chief Executive
Officer to further explore such issues. The entirety of the letter is
incorporated herein by reference.
Except as detailed in the preceding
paragraph, the Reporting Persons currently have no current plans or proposal
with respect to the Issuers securities. As outlined in the letter, the
Reporting Persons remain dedicated to encouraging good corporate governance
principles as they apply to the Issuer and to protecting the value of their
investment in the Issuer. In furtherance of such goals, the Reporting Persons
may consider various plans or proposals which relate to or could result in the
transactions or changes contemplated by Items 4(a) through 4(j) of Schedule
13D/G. Such plans or proposals could include, without limitation, (i)
acquisitions of additional shares in the open market or otherwise, (ii)
potentially seeking possible changes in the present board of directors and
management of the Issuer, (iii) making one or more proposals for adoption by
stockholders of the Issuer (including proposals to improve the Issuers
corporate governance or to amend the Issuers organizational documents), (iv)
making proposals to the Issuers board of directors and management, (v) seeking
to call a special meeting of stockholders to elect directors or approve
stockholder proposals, and soliciting proxies or consents in connection
therewith, (vi) proposing an extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a
merger, reorganization, recapitalization or liquidation, involving the Issuer or
any of its subsidiaries, or sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of
the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries, which transaction may involve the
Reporting Persons or third parties unrelated to the Reporting Persons, (vii)
alone or in conjunction with others, seeking to acquire the Issuer or
substantial assets or outstanding securities of the Issuer, including by merger,
tender offer or stock or asset purchase, or (viii) selling all or a portion of
the shares now owned or hereafter acquired by the Reporting Persons. In the
interim the Reporting Persons may, in connection with their holdings of the
Issuers securities, communicate with other stockholders or third parties
regarding the Issuer, its business, prospects and alternatives to maximize
stockholder value and to otherwise protect the Reporting Persons interest in
the Issuer.

Exhibit B 
Levin Capital Strategies L.P., and John A. Levin and various
family-related entities with dispositive power over 5,592,968 shares of New
Senior Investment Group, representing 6.46% of the current outstanding shares of
the company, has sent the following letter to New Seniors Chairman and Members
of its Board of Directors: 
September 29, 2015
New Senior Investment Group Inc. 1345 Avenue of the
Americas 46th Floor New York, NY 10105 Attention: Wesley
R. Edens, Chairman of the Board 
Cc: Board of Directors 
Dear Wes, 
In my long experience in the investment management business, I
have spoken to members of company boards of directors and management teams about
my views on numerous occasions, but this marks the first time that I am sending
a public letter to the Chairman of the Board of Directors and members of its
Board of Directors. I take this communication seriously and I sincerely hope
that you will as well.
Since the effective date of the spinoff from Newcastle
Investment Corp on November 6, 2014, New Senior Investment Group (New Senior)
share price has declined -46.1% versus the MSCI US REIT Index decline of -1.2%
and the S&P 500 decline of -5.5%, as reported on Bloomberg. While operating
results of the company have been strong, with increasing occupancy at your
properties and significant growth in Funds from Operations (FFO) led by CEO
Susan Givens, the issue with your stock valuation is not one of business
performance but fundamentally one of structure and alignment of shareholder
interest. 
The external management structure is one that can lead to
serious conflicts of interest. While we have no issue with management at any
company succeeding alongside of shareholders, we believe the structure currently
in place between New Senior and Fortress leaves the interests of shareholders
and management significantly misaligned. 
On May 7th, 2015, on Fortress second quarter conference call,
you said the following regarding the Fortress Permanent Capital Vehicle (PCV)
business that includes New Senior, The goal for that business from my
standpoint is going to be $12 billion to $15 billion in capital by the end of
the year. It's $6 billion right now. Since you made this statement, the
companies externally managed by Fortress that were spun out of Newcastle have
dramatically underperformed with New Senior down -37.0%, New Residential down
-21.1% and New Media down -30.6%, as compared with the S&P 500 decline of
9.0% and the MSCI US REIT Index decline of -3.6%, as reported on Bloomberg that
includes dividends paid. As the Chairman of each of these companies, you have a
fiduciary duty to their public shareholders, and that duty conflicts with your
role at Fortress and specifically with Fortress desire to raise capital in
these vehicles to increase its fee streams. Setting targets for capital raising
may or may not be helpful in getting Fortress stock price up, but it sends a
terrible message to the shareholders of companies that are externally managed by
Fortress.
As we know, this issue of equity capital raise played out in
New Senior before the end of the second quarter and is the main reason, in our
view, for the precipitous stock decline versus benchmarks. On June
22nd, New Senior announced an equity offering underwritten by Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, and Morgan Stanley to raise capital to
purchase properties in a related party transaction from a privately-held
Fortress affiliate, Holiday Retirement (Holiday). The announcement came with
New Senior trading at $15.25 per share; already well below our estimated Net
Asset Value (NAV), and was then executed approximately 10% lower at $13.75 per
share. We believe the equity offering was mistimed and inopportune and doing an
equity offering well below NAV was extremely troubling. We believe this has
created the perception that Fortress has little regard for public shareholders.
New Senior stock closed at $9.95 on September 29, 2015, the stock price has now
dropped an additional -27.6% from the $13.75 offering and -34.8% below the
$15.25 it was trading at before the offering was announced.
With New Seniors stock trading dramatically below NAV, we call
upon Fortress to take meaningful action to demonstrate a more appropriate
balance between the external manager and the public shareholders in order to
help bridge the substantial value discrepancy. We understand that New Senior has
been a stand-alone public entity for less than a year, but Fortress has not
earned the benefit of the doubt that they care about shareholder value in this
and its other permanent capital vehicles. It is our view that the current
structure does not align Fortress interest closely enough to New Senior shareholders. Until demonstrable actions are
taken, potentially across the entire Fortress permanent capital universe, we
believe these discounts to NAV will persist. If Fortress wants to be in the
long-term business of taking private equity fee streams in public equity
vehicles, we firmly believe that it must behave in a way that demonstrates
appreciation that shareholder value is essential. By rebuilding trust with the
public markets, we believe Fortress will benefit greatly and be able to continue
to grow its permanent capital businesses and succeed alongside of shareholders. 


Levin Capital Strategies looks forward to working
constructively with you and the New Senior Board of Directors, as well as Susan
Givens (who we hold in high regard) and her management team, to further explore
these issues. We would like to address the external management structure and
ways to further align Fortress compensation to stock price performance, a path
toward internalization of management, Board composition and independence, and
stock buyback and potential liquidation if the gap between the market price and
NAV persists. We stand ready to meet with you at your earliest convenience.
Sincerely, 
John Levin

Helping Christian Schools Impact Their Communities Student-Centered Learning. Christ-Centered Culture.






 



 

The League of Christian Schools (LCS) is the premiere Assemblies of God accrediting agency established by the Peninsular Florida District Council in 1983. Originally called Florida League of Assemblies of God Schools (FLAGS) and under the leadership of Dr. James Ferrell, the agency realized that limiting its services to Florida would restrict us from reaching an important group of district churches. The Peninsular Florida District Council extends beyond the borders of Florida to the US Virgin Islands, as well as the British Virgin Islands, making it the only US Assemblies of God district to have churches on foreign soil. With a desire to reach out to our international churches within the district, the International League of Christian Schools (ILCS) was born. In 1992 the Peninsular Florida District Presbytery approved the name change from Florida League of Assemblies of God Schools (FLAGS) to Florida League of Christian Schools (FLOCS). Together, FLOCS and ILCS now reach the international Christian education community as the primary choice for Christian preschool and K-12 education, adhering to the distinctives of our faith while promoting biblical, academic, and professional excellence in its member schools.
League of Christian Schools, (LCS) is an internationally recognized accrediting agency as well as nonprofit voluntary membership organization, with a mission focus of reaching out to missionary-established schools across the globe. Our services help schools in the US, as well as in over 100 other countries guarantee the transfer of credit for students into foreign and local schools, colleges, and universities, while placing special focus upon Assemblies of God schools.
The LCS mission is to equip member schools to train students in the values and person of Christ in order to prepare them for success in this life and eternity to come.

  Leadership Team

League of Christian Schools is a ministry of the Assemblies of God and, as such, we adhere the to following truths. We do NOT require that schools teach these doctrines specifically; however, open opposition to these may be grounds for dismissal. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact the LCS office directly.

WE BELIEVE… and declare His design and plan for mankind.The Scriptures are Inspired by God
WE BELIEVE…-revealed in three persons…Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (commonly known as the Trinity).There is only One True God
WE BELIEVE…In the Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ. As God’s son Jesus was both human and divine.
WE BELIEVE…though originally good, Man Willingly Fell to Sin-ushering evil and death, both physical and spiritual, into the world.
WE BELIEVE… (trusting Christ, through faith and repentance, to be our personal Savior). [1 of 4 cardinal doctrines of the AG]Every Person Can Have Restored Fellowship with God Through ‘Salvation’
WE BELIEVE…and practice two ordinances-(1) Water Baptism by Immersion after repenting of one’s sins and receiving Christ’s gift of salvation, and (2) Holy Communion (the Lord’s Supper) as a symbolic remembrance of Christ’s suffering and death for our salvation.
WE BELIEVE…the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a Special Experience Following Salvation that empowers believers for witnessing and effective service, just as it did in New Testament times. [1 of 4 cardinal doctrines of the AG]
WE BELIEVE… The Initial Physical Evidence of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit is ‘Speaking in Tongues,’ as experienced on the Day of Pentecost and referenced throughout Acts and the Epistles.
WE BELIEVE…Sanctification Initially Occurs at Salvation and is not only a declaration that a believer is holy, but also a progressive lifelong process of separating from evil as believers continually draw closer to God and become more Christlike.
WE BELIEVE…The Church has a Mission to seek and save all who are lost in sin. We believe ‘the Church’ is the Body of Christ and consists of the people who, throughout time, have accepted God’s offer of redemption (regardless of religious denomination) through the sacrificial death of His son Jesus Christ.
WE BELIEVE…A Divinely Called and Scripturally Ordained Leadership Ministry Serves the Church. The Bible teaches that each of us under leadership must commit ourselves to reach others for Christ, to worship Him with other believers, to build up or edify the body of believers-the Church and to Meet human need with ministries of love and compassion.
WE BELIEVE…Divine Healing of the Sick is a Privilege for Christians Today and is provided for in Christ’s atonement (His sacrificial death on the cross for our sins). [1 of 4 cardinal doctrines of the AG]
WE BELIEVE…in The Blessed Hope-When Jesus Raptures His Church Prior to His Return to Earth (the second coming). At this future moment in time all believers who have died will rise from their graves and will meet the Lord in the air, and Christians who are alive will be caught up with them, to be with the Lord forever. [1 of 4 cardinal doctrines of the AG]
WE BELIEVE…in The Millennial Reign of Christ when Jesus returns with His saints at His second coming and begins His benevolent rule over earth for 1,000 years. This millennial reign will bring the salvation of national Israel and the establishment of universal peace.
WE BELIEVE…A Final Judgment Will Take Place for those who have rejected Christ. They will be judged for their sin and consigned to eternal punishment in a punishing lake of fire.
WE BELIEVE…and look forward to the perfect New Heavens and a New Earth that Christ is preparing for all people, of all time, who have accepted Him. We will live and dwell with Him there forever following His millennial reign on Earth. ‘And so shall we forever be with the Lord!’


In an effort to clarify our mission, objectives, and philosophical framework, LCS takes official positions on certain topics and ideas. Furthermore, LCS is a ministry of the Assemblies of God and therefore all positions held by the Assemblies of God on doctrinal, moral, and social issues are also held by LCS.
