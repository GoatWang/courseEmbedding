About SALT
 


















SALT lets you leverage your blockchain assets to secure cash loans. We make it easy to get money to spend without having to sell your favorite investment.

 

























 
 







Process

 







Easy application, fast approval, and no credit checks.
Get cash deposited directly into your bank account.

 













 
 







Economics 

 







Competitive interest rates with no prepayment fees.
Maintain your position and avoid less-than-optimal tax events.

 













 
 







Liberty

 







Freedom to get your assets back whenever you want.
Cash to spend however you want.

 

























SALT streamlines every step of the loan. We've simplified the application process by focusing on the value of the borrower’s blockchain assets instead of their credit score. Borrowers are automatically matched with capital from our extensive network of lenders. SALT keeps collateral assets safe in a fully-audited, ultra-secure architecture during the life of the loan so members can borrow with confidence.

Collateral > Credit Score
 


















In the past, the difficulty and costs of liquidating, transferring, and storing assets has required lenders to focus on the creditworthiness of their borrower as well as the value of their borrower’s assets. This inefficiency results in limited accessibility to cash and higher interest rates for borrowers.
Distributed ledgers represent a paradigm shift in the storage and transfer of assets and, for the first time in history, there is a perfect form of collateral: blockchain assets. SALT is pioneering an evolutionary leap for lending in which the value of a borrower’s assets are fully recognized and credit history is made irrelevant.

        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to
        require information. As a result, if the securities that are the subject of this Form D are "covered securities" for purposes 
        of NSMIA, whether in all instances or due to the nature of the offering that is the subject of this Form D, States cannot
        routinely require offering materials under this undertaking or otherwise and can require offering materials only to the
        extent NSMIA permits them to do so under NSMIA's preservation of their anti-fraud authority.
