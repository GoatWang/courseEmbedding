In 1977, Kurt Rumens first began selling stoves to supplement his income as a rock musician.  Soon, some retailers started suggesting product improvements so he drafted sketches incorporating his best ideas and submitted them back to his manufacturer. He quickly received a terse letter telling him to stick to selling and not product development; but recognizing the importance of aesthetics and efficiency in hearth design, he used the feedback as the foundation for his own hearth-products company. So in 1979, he created what is now known as Lopi. The next year, Lopi pioneered the now standardized use of clear ceramic glass and a pre-heated air wash system within wood stoves to keep the fireviewing area clean.  In 1984, Lopi became the first U.S. hearth products manufacturer to develop an EPA-certified, non-catalytic wood stove. Today, Lopi is the brand now known for its American classic style of innovation into its high-performance wood, gas and pellet burning stoves, fireplaces and inserts. Find out more about our Lopi products here.



 
 


 
 




In 1985, the Avalon brand of stoves was developed and quickly emerged as a leading line of wood stoves, only to be rated one of the cleanest-burning lineups of wood stoves in the world by industry expert, Daniel J. Melcon. Today, the Avalon brand is known for its beautiful wood, gas and pellet fireplaces, stoves and inserts, featuring organic styling and natural design. In early 2016, Avalon introduced the Radiant Plus Gas Inserts, the first in a new series of value-priced products from Avalon. The Avalon brand is now transitioning toward a product line with reliable performance and great features at a reasonable price point. Find out more about our Avalon products here.



 
 


 
 




In 1992, Travis Industries acquired Fireplace Xtrordinair, a brand that quickly emerged as the elite line of gas fireplaces and inserts.  Today, Fireplace Xtrordinair is now referred to as FireplaceX and is well known for their premium quality gas fireplaces, gas inserts, wood fireplaces and wood inserts that offer a wide variety of custom-crafted styles with unique detailing. With a reputation for innovative design, excellent craftsmanship and energy efficiency, more than a million customers have chosen FireplaceX for their homes across North America. Find out more about our FireplaceX products here.



 
 


 
 




In 2007, the Tempest Torch line of gas torches is launched and awarded the Best-in-Show Vesta Award honoring design, innovation and technology within the Hearth, Patio and Barbeque Industry. The Tempest Torch breaks the barriers of standard torch design, featuring a spinning, spiral-like flame for a dramatic presentation of dancing fire. With the Tempest Torch, the display possibilities are nearly endless, as it can be featured virtually anywhere outside, from decks, patios, walkways, entertainment spaces, pools, businesses or storefronts, and even on exterior walls. Find out more about our Tempest Torch products here.



 
 


 
 




In 2014, DaVinci Custom Fireplaces was introduced as a new brand in the House of Fire lineup. The DaVinci brand was quickly recognized as the most unique and innovative custom fireplaces ever made, winning the coveted Vesta Award for Best New Gas Fireplace at the 2014 HPBExpo. These custom, made-to-order fireplaces solve all building and installation inefficiencies and offer the very best of design, innovation and functionality in the custom fireplace world. With DaVinci, there are no design limitations. Find out more about DaVinci Custom Fireplaces here.

      Bigger, stronger Travis Sanheim a product of Ron Hextall's patience    


 



      Bigger, stronger Travis Sanheim a product of Ron Hextall's patience    


        By Jordan Hall | CSNPhilly.com 



July 15, 2016 9:00 AM
















VOORHEES, N.J. — It was as if Ron Hextall was proclaiming the beauty of patience — that hallowed belief of the Flyers’ general manager, the sturdiest pillar to his rebuild.
At Flyers development camp last week, Hextall illustrated his beloved patience by painting a picture.
His subject: Travis Sanheim.
“Travis is the best example coming in as an 18-year-old,” Hextall said.
Sanheim, a 2014 first-round pick of the Flyers, was just starting to bloom at the time. He was a kid still growing into his body, but that’s what the Flyers liked. Far from an NHL physique, that’s no longer the case with the 20-year-old.
He’s on his way.
“Sanheim was about 172 (pounds) when we drafted him,” Hextall said, “and he has gained upwards of 25-plus pounds.”
Sanheim says he’s now between 201-202 pounds. He cautioned that the added size is good weight — gaining muscle by proper nutrition and training.
It’s also “a process” that hasn’t come to fruition, according to Hextall.
“It’s taken a good two years now and it’s not done,” he said. “It’s probably going to take about four years to see Travis’ strength develop to its maximum strength.”
Sanheim agreed.
“I’ve definitely put on some weight and I think that’s something I said all along needed to happen,” he said. “I’ve been trying to put the work in, eating right and trying to do everything with what I can to help me get stronger and bigger. I think I’ve still got some work to do but I’ve definitely come a long ways.”
So at 6-foot-4, 200-plus pounds, Sanheim’s still filling out — a scary thought given his current size is nothing at which to scoff. Even scarier considering his offensive game is already refined. 
Following a 65-point campaign in 67 games in 2014-15 with the WHL’s Calgary Hitmen, Sanheim accumulated 68 points (15 goals, 53 assists) last season, despite playing 15 fewer games. His 53 assists were second among all WHL defensemen and his 68 points were fourth. (Fellow Flyers defensive prospect Ivan Provorov was first with 73.)
“Offense is my game and something I want to continue to develop going forward and bring to the next level,” Sanheim said.
Sort of like a certain someone with the Flyers: Shayne Gostisbehere.
The Calder Memorial Trophy runner-up was the first of the Flyers’ promising bundle of blue-line prospects to crack the NHL. Once he did, he took off with offense.
That left an impression on Sanheim, a dexterous defenseman like Gostisbehere.
“He’s obviously offensive-minded, as well, and likes the skill side of the game,” Sanheim said. “I think watching him and seeing him have success at that next level, it definitely motivates us and gives us confidence in being able to play our game and play it at the next level.”
In all likelihood, what’s next for Sanheim is AHL affiliate Lehigh Valley, where last season, after finishing at junior, he played four games, tallying three points on a goal and two assists.
Sanheim admitted speed wasn’t the biggest difference between junior and the AHL. Instead, it was strength.
“Just playing against men and having guys play you hard whether it’s you carrying the puck and them trying to get it off you or them having the puck and you trying to get it off them,” he said. “Just how hard they battled and how hard it was to get the puck off them.
“To be able to get those games in at the end of the year I think is crucial for me going forward.”
So, too, is size. It’s a prerequisite of Hextall’s, one Sanheim is inching closer to fulfilling. Once he does, he may not be far away from wearing a Flyers sweater.
“All of these kids have to get bigger,” Hextall said. “Unfortunately, you can’t just snap your fingers and put on 15 pounds, because if you do, then it’s not the right weight. You’ve got to gain weight, gain strength, but also continue to keep your flexibility, your mobility, agility, speed.”
Hextall still remembers how Sanheim looked when the Flyers drafted him two years ago.
“He’s a skinny little guy, not real strong, but then you see him the first year after being drafted and notice that he is stronger,” Hextall said. “He’s stronger on the stick, defends better, boxes guys out. 
“It’s amazing how quickly it happens, but it has been two years. For me, that’s quick. For most people, that’s not very quick.”
No, that’s patience — a beauty to Hextall.
Minor dealThe Flyers on Friday signed forward Petr Straka to a one-year deal. It will be the fourth season in the organization for Straka, who had 19 goals and 18 assists in 64 games last season with the Lehigh Valley Phantoms.
Straka spent three games last season with the Flyers, recording two assists.
If he makes the Flyers' roster, his NHL salary would be $650,000.

      NHL Notes: Rangers ink Mika Zibanejad to 5-year extension    


        By The Associated Press 



July 25, 2017 2:34 PM
















NEW YORK -- The New York Rangers have signed center Mika Zibanejad to a $26.75 million, five-year deal.
Zibanejad will count $5.35 million against the salary cap through 2021-22 as the Rangers count on him to take on a bigger role following the trade of Derek Stepan. General manager Jeff Gorton announced the contract Tuesday morning, before the team and Zibanejad were set to go to arbitration.
The 24-year-old Swede had 14 goals and 23 assists for 37 points in 56 games last season, his first with New York. The Rangers acquired Zibanejad from the Ottawa Senators for Derick Brassard a year ago.
Zibanejad has 188 points in 337 NHL games with the Senators and Rangers since Ottawa drafted him sixth overall in 2011 (see full story).
Olympics: Team Canada names Burke GM for 2018 GamesSean Burke will be the general manager and Willie Desjardins the head coach for Canada at the first Olympics without NHL players since 1994.
Hockey Canada named its management and coaching staffs for the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics on Tuesday. St. Louis Blues assistant general manager Martin Brodeur will work under Burke on the management side, while Desjardins will be assisted by Dave King, Scott Walker and Craig Woodcroft.
Canada has been grooming Burke for this responsibility for some time as he served as assistant GM for the 2017 world championships, GM for the 2016 Spengler Cup and Deutschland Cup and director of player development for the 2016 worlds. Desjardins coached Canada's 2010 world junior team and assisted in 2009.
USA Hockey has not yet named its GM or coach (see full story).
Sabres: Goalie Lehner re-signed to 1-year dealBUFFALO, N.Y.  -- The Buffalo Sabres have re-signed goaltender Robin Lehner to a $4 million, one-year contract.
The team announced the deal Tuesday. Lehner was a restricted free agent.
The 26-year-old Swede showed he could stay healthy last season, setting career highs with 59 games played, 23 wins and two shutouts. He ranked third in the NHL with 1,758 saves and finished with a .920 save percentage and 2.68 goals-against average.
Bothered by injuries and concussion problems, Lehner had never before played more than 36 games in his NHL career. The Sabres took a chance on Lehner when they traded a first-round pick to the Ottawa Senators for him at the 2015 draft.
Lehner will again be a restricted free agent next summer when this contract expires.
Devils: 3 restricted free agents re-signedNEWARK, N.J. -- The New Jersey Devils have re-signed restricted free agent defenseman Mirco Mueller, forward Joseph Blandisi and goaltender Scott Wedgewood.
Mueller got a two-year deal worth an average of $850,000 a season, Blandisi a two-year, two-way deal worth an average of $680,000 in the NHL, and Wedgewood a one-year, two-way deal worth $650,000 in the NHL. General manager Ray Shero announced the contracts Tuesday.
Re-signing Mueller for two years was the most significant move after New Jersey acquired the 22-year-old from San Jose before the Vegas expansion draft. The Swiss defender has just six points in 54 NHL games with the Sharks, but still is considered a good prospect after being a first-round pick in 2013.
Mueller will make $775,000 next season and $925,000 in 2018-19.

      There's a new game in town: The Philadelphia Rebels

      There's a new game in town: The Philadelphia Rebels

The opportunity to watch a Briere play again in Philadelphia will be an exciting reality for hockey fans this season.
No, Danny Briere isn’t coming out of retirement as the former Flyers forward has committed to handling the day-to-day operations of the organization’s newest ECHL team.  
However, Briere will be keeping close tabs on his younger son, Carson, who’s currently on the Philadelphia Rebels' 30-man roster and is setting his sights on making the team’s final cuts during training camp.
“It’s great,” Briere said Monday. “Growing up here for most of my life, I love Philly. It’s fun getting to play in the same city that [my dad] did. Whenever I think of him playing, I always think of that playoff run [in 2010] for the Flyers.”
After spending the past two seasons at IceWorks in Aston, Pennsylvania, the NAHL’s (North American Hockey League) Rebels are moving their operation to the Penn Ice Rink at the Class of 1923 Arena, where they made the formal announcement on Monday. It will be the organization’s third different home rink in the past four seasons after relocating from the Rio Grande Valley in 2015.
“It was a no-brainer,” team owner Marko Dundovich said. “When the opportunity presented itself, it was very easy. I think it will give the boys a better opportunity to play, get them seen and I think it’s going to continue to grow here, and our business and organization will do much better here.”
The Rebels and junior hockey simply didn’t attract a broad appeal in the Philadelphia suburbs like ownership had hoped, and as a result, attendance lagged as the team typically averaged around 125 fans a game.
“It was the first time we tried Junior A hockey here,” Dundovich said. “If we had a 300-, 400- or 500-person fan base, we would have been OK in Aston, but I think it was tough to sell a junior hockey ticket in Aston. It’s a difficult sell in a small town.”   
Conversely, hockey fans in Philadelphia haven’t had much of an alternative to the Flyers since the Phantoms left the city in 2009 for Glens Falls, New York. Rebels forward Aaron Maguyon, who stays with former Flyers captain Keith Primeau throughout the season, feels the team cannot only fill the 2,500-seat ice rink, but the players will greatly benefit from the college vibe.  
“I think it prepares us for the future and playing college hockey, for sure, so in that way, it’s like a sneak peek for what’s to come," Maguyon said. "I think it helps pull guys closer together. We have restaurants we can go to or just activities we can do in the city."
According to the league website, the NAHL set a new single-season NCAA record with 280-plus commitments, and the Rebels had 12 commit to Divison I programs. Head coach Joe Coombs has built a tier-II junior hockey powerhouse over the past two years. Last season, the Rebels finished with the NAHL’s best regular-season record, advancing to the championship game of the Robertson Cup in Duluth, Minnesota, where they came up short in a 2-0 loss to the Lone Star Brahmas. 
“This is business,” Coombs said. “Let’s bring the game to the people. Over the last two years, we struggled with our attendance. I didn’t even know this place was here — UPenn hockey rink — and we couldn’t think of a better venue right here in University City to try and market our brand of hockey and bring our game to the people.”  
And who knows? You might just see a few former Flyers in the seats, as well.

Uber’s Top Ranks Thin Out as CEO Travis Kalanick Steps Away


      By Ellen HuetEllen Huet and Mira RojanasakulMira Rojanasakul

Published: June 14, 2017
       | Updated: June 21, 2017





Over the past four months, Uber Technologies Inc. faced a new scandal or controversy nearly every week: allegations of harassment and discrimination, a corporate theft lawsuit, allegedly deceiving authorities, a video of the ride-hailing giant’s co-founder arguing with a driver and a director making a sexist comment at a staff meeting to address issues of sexism.
During that same time, almost a dozen senior executives marched out—or were frog-marched to the door. A few left amicably, but others, such as former self-driving unit head Anthony Levandowski and former head of business Emil Michael, were ousted in relation to legal or cultural problems at the company. In the past week, Uber has made some key outside hires to reform the company’s strategy and brand.

To fill the gaps, Uber promoted some people from within the company. But other high-profile seats—including chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer and senior vice president of engineering—remain empty. The COO search is one of particular importance to the company and has been going on for at least three months.
Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick announced earlier this month that he would take a leave of absence from the business he helped start. After pressure from investors, however, Kalanick resigned completely, leaving Uber without a top executive. The company plans to be run by committee, though the details of decision-making remain unclear.
