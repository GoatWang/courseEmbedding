Job Details
               Since 1853, Wheaton Academy has been delivering a Christ-centered high school education. The mission of Wheaton Academy is to nurture growth in our students through relationships, excellence and service to the glory of God. This mission cannot be accomplished without the prayer and financial support from the friends of Wheaton Academy. We ask that you prayerfully consider becoming a Wheaton Academy Associate to help ensure that God's work will continue here for another 150 years. A Wheaton Academy Associate commits to:Pray regularly for Wheaton Academy students, employees and leadershipShare the mission of Wheaton Academy with othersGive a minimum of $1,000 annually to the Academy Fund* Please note that a pledge of $3,000 or more to Transforming Every Student: The Campaign for Wheaton Academy qualifies donors as Wheaton Academy Associates, as the campaign includes the Academy Fund needs through the 2009-2010 school year. The Academy Fund was created solely to provide resources for student financial aid, and the fund's budget exceeds $500,000 annually. Many Academy families make financial sacrifices so their children can be educated at WA. Sadly, even with those financial sacrifices, some families still cannot afford this nurturing Christian education. Your on-going support of these crucial resources will allow students whose parents seek excellent Christian education for their children to attend Wheaton Academy. You can have a lasting impact in students' lives by sharing with them about WA, helping them financially to attend by becoming a WA Associate, and praying for them while they are a student here. We value your partnership with us and we pray that Christ would be glorified through his work at Wheaton Academy.
