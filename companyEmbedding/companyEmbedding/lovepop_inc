Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

B4680436.4
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT 
DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS 
------------------------------------------------------------x 
: 
LOVEPOP, INC., : 
: 
Plaintiff, : Civil Action No. 1:17-cv-11017 
: 
v. : 
: 
PAPERPOPCARDS INC. : 
: 
Defendant. : 
------------------------------------------------------------x 
COMPLAINT 
Plaintiff LovePop, Inc. (“LovePop”), for its Complaint against PaperPopCards Inc. 
(“Paper Pop” or “Defendant”), alleges, on knowledge as to itself and otherwise on information 
and belief, as follows: 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1.LovePop specializes in creating unique 3D pop-up greeting cards for multiple 
purposes and occasions. LovePop’s cards are displayed and sold primarily online at LovePop’s 
website www.lovepopcards.com. LovePop’s website includes images of each of its cards, 
together with videos displaying how each 3D card “pops-up” when opened. 
2.LovePop has learned that defendant Paper Pop has slavishly copied several of 
LovePop’s designs without LovePop’s authorization, and is selling virtually identical or 
substantially similar copies of LovePop’s cards on Paper Pop’s website www.paperpopcards.com
and in retail stores. The cards which Paper Pop copied from LovePop are all original, copyright-Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 1 of 23
2 
B4680436.4
protected works of visual art that are registered exclusively to LovePop before the U.S. 
Copyright Office. 
3.In addition to copying LovePop’s card designs, Paper Pop has also copied the 
videos associated with those designs and is displaying virtually identical or substantially similar 
videos on Paper Pop’s website. 
4.Paper Pop continues to copy, display, and distribute virtually identical or 
substantially similar copies of LovePop’s card designs and associated videos, despite having no 
authorization from Plaintiff to do so and despite Plaintiff’s demands that Defendant cease and 
desist from such unlawful conduct, in direct violation of U.S. copyright laws. 
5.Moreover, Paper Pop has used LovePop’s registered trademark LOVEPOP in a 
URL for its web page and in online advertisements for its products, thereby trading on 
LovePop’s goodwill and diminishing the value of LovePop’s trademark. 
6.LovePop brings this action against Paper Pop for infringement of LovePop’s 
registered copyrights in its card designs and associated videos, in violation of the Copyright Act 
of 1976, as amended, 17 U.S.C. §§ 101 et seq.(the “Copyright Act”). LovePop also asserts 
claims against Paper Pop for infringement of LovePop’s registered trademark under section 
32(1) of the United States Trademark (Lanham) Act of 1946, as amended (the “Lanham Act”), 
15 U.S.C. § 1114(1); trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false designation of origin 
under Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1125(a); and related claims under 
Massachusetts statutory and common law. LovePop seeks to recover damages for Paper Pop’s 
infringements and a permanent injunction to prevent Paper Pop from further unlawful copying, 
infringement, and injury to LovePop in the future. Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 2 of 23

B4680436.4
THE PARTIES 
7.LovePop is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business located at 
61 Chatham Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109. 
8.On information and belief, Paper Pop is a New York corporation with its principal 
place of business located at 54 West 40th Street, New York, New York 10018. 
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 
9.This Court has personal jurisdiction over Paper Pop because Paper Pop regularly 
conducts business in this District through the sale of Paper Pop cards in retail stores located 
throughout this District. Paper Pop also regularly conducts business in this District through 
Paper Pop’s interactive website www.paperpopcards.com. Paper Pop’s actions have caused 
injury to LovePop within this District. 
10.This action arises under the Copyright Act, the Lanham Act, and Massachusetts 
state law. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 
§1121 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338(a). This Court has supplemental jurisdiction over the 
state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1367. In addition, because there is diversity of 
citizenship between the parties to this action and the matter in controversy exceeds $75,000, the 
Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. 
11.Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a 
substantial part of the events giving rise to LovePop’s claims occurred in this District.

Plaintiff’s Trademark 
20.Since at least as early as February 2014, LovePop has used the mark LOVEPOP®

LOVEPOP in connection with, inter alia, “greeting cards, stationery, . . . and decorative paper 
sculptures.” (A copy of the Certificate of Registration for the mark LOVEPOP® is attached 
hereto as Exhibit 4.) Registration No. 4,730,483 is valid and subsisting and therefore constitutes 
prima facie evidence of LovePop’s exclusive right to use the mark. 
22.LovePop has used its LOVEPOP® mark prominently and consistently in 
connection with the promotion and sale of its 3D pop-up greeting cards. As described above, 
LovePop’s products have received widespread media coverage, in which the LOVEPOP® mark 
has been featured prominently. 
23.As a result of LovePop’s extensive use and promotion, the LOVEPOP® mark is 
well known and widely associated with LovePop’s products, and has acquired significant and 
valuable goodwill. Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 8 of 23

B4680436.4
37.The Infringing Design associated with the “Willow Tree” card is virtually 
identical or substantially similar to the Copyrighted Design associated with LovePop’s “Willow 
Tree” card. 
38.The Infringing Design associated with the “Balloon Bouquet” card is virtually 
identical or substantially similar to the Copyrighted Design associated with LovePop’s “Balloon 
Bouquet” card. 
39.On information and belief, Paper Pop’s infringing “Willow Tree” and “Balloon 
Bouquet” designs are new designs that are not yet displayed on Paper Pop’s website. Paper 
Pop’s infringing “Willow Tree” and “Balloon Bouquet” designs are featured in a marketing 
email that Paper Pop distributed on May 9, 2017, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 6. 
40.Paper Pop intentionally and willfully copied the Copyrighted Works without 
LovePop’s permission or consent. 
41.Paper Pop had direct access to the Copyrighted Works through LovePop’s 
website, which displays cards bearing the Copyrighted Designs, together with their 
corresponding Copyrighted Videos. 
42.Paper Pop also had direct access to the Copyright Designs due to the availability 
of cards bearing those designs in specialty card stores and at LovePop kiosks in New York and 
Boston. 
43.There is a copyright notice on the back of all LovePop cards bearing the 
Copyrighted Designs. 
44.LovePop’s website also contains a copyright notice on every webpage, including 
the webpages which display the Copyrighted Works. Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 13 of 23
14 
B4680436.4
45.Upon information and belief, at the time that Defendant copied the Copyrighted 
Works and displayed and distributed the Infringing Works, it knew or should have known that 
the Copyrighted Works were protected by copyright. 
46.Upon information and belief, Paper Pop knew or should have known at all 
relevant times that LovePop owns all rights to the Copyrighted Works and that Paper Pop would 
need to obtain permission from LovePop to copy the Copyrighted Works and display and 
distribute the Infringing Works. Paper Pop never made any effort to obtain such rights prior to 
copying the Copyrighted Works and displaying and distributing the Infringing Works. Paper 
Pop intentionally usurped LovePop’s rights in its Copyrighted Works. 
47.By letters dated December 1, 2016 and May 17, 2017, LovePop, through its 
counsel, advised Paper Pop that its copying of the Copyrighted Works and displaying and 
distributing the Infringing Works constituted copyright infringement and demanded that Paper 
Pop immediately cease such activity. 
48. Paper Pop has refused to comply with LovePop’s demands. Paper Pop continues 
to copy the Copyrighted Works and display and distribute the Infringing Works. 
49.On information and belief, Paper Pop began promoting and distributing cards 
bearing its infringing “Willow Tree” and “Balloon Bouquet” designs only after receiving 
LovePop’s December 1, 2016 letter demanding that Paper Pop cease infringing LovePop’s 
copyrighted designs. 
50.Paper Pop’s purpose in copying LovePop’s Copyrighted Works and displaying and 
distributing the Infringing Works is to obtain commercial benefit from such unauthorized use of 
LovePop’s Copyrighted Works. Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 14 of 23
15 
B4680436.4
Defendant’s Violation of Plaintiff’s Trademark 
51.Paper Pop has deliberately used LovePop’s well-known and registered mark 
LOVEPOP® in an attempt to trade on the goodwill embodied in that mark. 
52.Paper Pop has created a sub-page on its website that incorporates LovePop’s 
registered mark in the Uniform Resource Locator or “web address,” in the form 
http://www.paperpopcards.com/lovepop (the “Infringing URL”). The Infringing URL currently 
leads to a “not found” error message, but, on information and belief, the page at one time 
contained content related to Paper Pop’s products. 
53.Paper Pop has purchased Internet advertisements through Google’s AdWords 
service that feature the Infringing URL – including LovePop’s registered trademark – in the text 
of the advertisement. These advertisements appear before the organic search results when 
Internet users search for Paper Pop cards in Google’s search engine. An image of an 
advertisement featuring the Infringing URL appears below: 
This advertisement is referred to herein as the “Infringing Advertisement.” (Attached hereto as 
Exhibit 7 is a screen shot of a Google search results page in which the Infringing Advertisement 
appears.) 
54.Paper Pop intentionally and willfully used LovePop’s registered trademark, 
without LovePop’s consent, in an advertisement for Paper Pop’s own products. 
55.Paper Pop’s infringing use of the LOVEPOP® trademark is likely to cause 
confusion in the marketplace, thereby harming consumers and diminishing the value of 
LovePop’s brand and mark. Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 15 of 23
16 
B4680436.4
56.Upon information and belief, a consumer purchasing a Paper Pop product after 
viewing the Infringing Advertisement might mistakenly believe that Defendant’s products are 
provided by, endorsed by, or otherwise associated with Plaintiff. 
57.Upon information and belief, as a result of Defendant’s actions, consumers 
seeking 3D pop-up greeting cards of the quality indicated by the LOVEPOP® mark are likely to 
be diverted from LovePop to its competitor, Paper Pop, and are likely to be misled about the 
nature, characteristics, quality, source, or association of Defendant’s products. 
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF 
Copyright Infringement in Violation of § 501 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 501 
58.LovePop realleges and incorporates herein the allegations set forth in the 
foregoing paragraphs of this Complaint. 
59.LovePop enjoys exclusive rights with respect to the Copyrighted Works, 
including the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, display, and create derivative works based 
on the same. 
60.Paper Pop is not authorized to reproduce, publish, distribute copies of, display, or 
prepare derivative works based on all or any portion of the Copyrighted Works. Paper Pop has 
used the Copyrighted Works in the manufacturing, promoting, and selling of cards, and to 
advertise the same. As illustrated above, Paper Pop’s Infringing Works are virtually identical or 
substantially similar to the Copyrighted Works. 
61.Paper Pop is copying the Copyrighted Works and displaying and distributing 
infringing copies of those works without LovePop’s consent or authorization. 
62.Paper Pop knows or has reason to know that: (i) the Copyrighted Works are 
protected by the Copyright Act; (ii) Paper Pop is not authorized to copy, or to display and 
distribute infringing copies of, the Copyrighted Works without LovePop’s consent; (iii) Paper Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 16 of 23
17 
B4680436.4
Pop does not have LovePop’s consent to copy, or to display and distribute infringing copies of, 
the Copyrighted Works; and (iv) Paper Pop’s actions constitute copyright infringement under the 
Copyright Act. 
63.Paper Pop has knowingly and willfully engaged in unauthorized copying of 
LovePop’s Copyrighted Works and displaying, distributing and/or selling infringing copies of 
those works with the intent to deprive LovePop of the revenues that it would have otherwise 
earned from selling cards bearing its Copyrighted Designs to others, and with the intent to 
wrongfully benefit from the labor and intellectual capital that LovePop invested in the creation of 
the Copyrighted Works. 
64.The natural and foreseeable result of Paper Pop’s wrongful conduct has been and 
will continue to be to deprive LovePop of the benefits of selling cards bearing its Copyrighted 
Designs. LovePop has lost and will continue to lose revenues from Paper Pop’s continued 
unauthorized use of the Copyrighted Works, including without limitation, its distribution and 
sale of cards bearing the Infringing Designs, and has sustained and will continue to sustain 
damage as a result of Paper Pop’s wrongful conduct. 
65.Paper Pop’s conduct has caused LovePop to sustain money damages including but 
not limited to loss of sales. 
66.Paper Pop has been unjustly enriched by its wrongful use of LovePop’s 
Copyrighted Works and infringements of those works. 
67.Paper Pop’s unauthorized copying, reproducing, displaying, and use of the 
Copyrighted Works without consent or authorization constitutes copyright infringement pursuant 
to 17 U.S.C. § 101 et seq. because Paper Pop’s goods and services incorporate unauthorized Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 17 of 23
18 
B4680436.4
copies of the Copyrighted Works and/or derivative works. Moreover, Paper Pop’s Infringing 
Works are virtually identical or substantially similar to the Copyrighted Works. 
68.Paper Pop had access to the Copyrighted Works by virtue of LovePop’s website, 
which displays the Copyrighted Works to the public, and because Paper Pop had the ability to 
view and/or purchase cards bearing the Copyrighted Designs through LovePop’s website, 
specialty card stores and LovePop kiosks. 
69.LovePop has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm as a result of 
Paper Pop’s activities. Unless permanently enjoined, Paper Pop will continue to act in the 
unlawful manner complained of herein, all to LovePop’s irreparable harm. LovePop’s remedy at 
law is not adequate to compensate it for the injuries suffered and threatened. 
SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF

70.LovePop realleges and incorporates herein the allegations set forth in the

built up in its LOVEPOP® mark. Paper Pop’s acts constitute infringement of LovePop’s 
federally registered trademark rights in violation of Section 32(1) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1114(l). 
75.LovePop has been, is now, and will be irreparably injured and damaged by Paper 
Pop’s conduct as described above, and unless such conduct is enjoined by the Court, LovePop 
will suffer further harm to its registered trademark, reputation, and goodwill. This harm

and their respective goods. Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 19 of 23
20 
B4680436.4
78.Paper Pop’s conduct is willful, intentional, deliberate, in bad faith, and undertaken 
with knowledge of LovePop’s prior rights, and with full knowledge that Paper Pop has no right,

of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Case 1:17-cv-11017 Document 1 Filed 06/01/17 Page 20 of 23
21 
B4680436.4
85.LovePop has been, is now, and will be irreparably injured and damaged by Paper
