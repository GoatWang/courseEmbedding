Quantum Cascade Lasers

Quantum Cascade Lasers
    Pranalytica is the premier manufacturer of Quantum Cascade Lasers (QCLs) and QCL systems for industrial and defense markets. Having unmatched performance in the entire 4µm to 12µm spectral region covered by QCLs, Pranalytica's lasers further existing applications and enable new ones in fields as diverse as spectroscopy, free space optical communications,  directed infrared countermeasures and other security areas.

Pranalytica is a vertically integrated QCL company, controlling the entire chain of laser system manufacturing starting from the fundamental laser design to laser fabrication and system integration. The vertical structure of the company allows tailoring laser system characteristics to the most restrictive customer specifications.

For most applications, optical power and efficiency are the main two figures of merit. Pranalytica uses its unique proprietary QCL designs that specifically target high power, high efficiency operation. The laser designs were developed under a $10 million DARPA program that was fully dedicated to QCL performance improvement. Pranalytica also uses its proprietary packaging and thermal management solutions to fully extract the available device performance and to provide well characterized and reliable high power products that can be easily integrated into real world systems. 

The company now offers an industry leading family of high power, high efficiency singly-emitter products, with CW optical power levels exceeding 2W and 3W at 4.0µm and 4.6µm, respectively, and over 1W in the LWIR spectral region. Several single-emitters can be spectrally combined in Multilux platform to cover multiple spectral bands with total optical power of up to 20W. Optimization of SWaP characteristics is of a critical importance for a number of applications that include infrared beacons and target designators. To address these applications, Pranalytica has recently introduced to the market unique ultra-small high power QCW lasers with a hermitic butterfly package measuring less than 2cm3 and delivering over 1.5W at 4.0µm and over 2.5W at 4.6µm in a collimated output beam. 

For spectroscopy applications Pranalytica offers widely tunable systems. Omnilux platform incorporates four external cavity lasers covering 6-10µm with more than 100mW of average power in the entire spectral region. A single-emitter version of the system is currently being developed.

Gas Sensors

The Optical-Nose (O-Nose™) Technology


Optical spectroscopy is one of the most powerful methods for quantitatively analyzing the composition of gas mixtures, including at trace levels.  This is due to the fact that the vast majority of polyatomic molecules exhibit distinct optical absorption features in the mid-wave and longvawe infrared (MWIR and LWIR, respectively) spectral regions.  Probing these features with tunable lasers allows simultaneous, quantitative measurement of the composition of multiple gases, even if their absorption features overlap.

Pranalytica stands in a unique position among gas sensing companies as a pioneer in both novel methods and algorithms for gas sensing, and in game-changing spectroscopic light sources.

Pranalytica's unique, patented algorithms for quantitative measurement of constituent gases in a mixture with overlapping absorption features have originally been developed with funding from DRAPA.  Subsequently Pranalytica's unique method for quantifying gas sensor performance in the presence of interfering species has become a de-facto method of chemical sensor evaluation.

In parallel, Pranalytica successfully leveraged its position as the world leader in commercial high performance MWIR and LWIR quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) to create high performance spectroscopic laser sources.

Combining its unique laser and sensing technologies has allowed Pranalytica to field gas sensing instruments of unparalleled performance.  Our instruments are characterized for their very high sensitivity (typically parts per billion – ppb – or better), combined with excellent immunity to interference from other gases that plague many competing sensors.

Our sensors, based on our unique suite of Optical-Nose (O-Nose™) Technology, have found acceptance in a wide range of applications.  In the industrial arena, our sensors continuously and autonomously monitor technological processes in semiconductor fab lines or trace gas contamination with sub-ppb precision, facilitating yield improvements and cost-effective process control.  In the environmental sciences, our sensors monitor gaseous precursors to smog, enabling better understanding of pollution control and mitigation.  In medicine, Pranalytica's sensors analyze human breath to monitor kidney dialysis, to detect early onset of a dangerous pregnancy complication, pre-eclampsia, and other applications.  In the security landscape, our sensors provide monitoring safeguards against chemical warfare agents, explosives, and toxic industrial chemicals.  Pranalytica has recently expanded its sensing technology to remote detection of explosives via optical spectroscopy, allowing their reliable identification at safe distances.

Combining unmatched gas sensing expertise with world-leading spectroscopic laser sources, Pranalytica has the track record to successfully tackle the most difficult gas sensing problems, allowing its customers to solve problems that may be intractable by any other means.




Figure 1. Schematic of the "optical nose" technology platform (O-Nose™)

Since the O-Nose technology is based on a platform concept, the carbon dioxide laser can be replaced with a carbon monoxide laser [4], a spin-flip Raman laser [5], or a tunable semiconductor laser [6]with or without obtaining power boost from an optical amplifier such as a fiber amplifier [7]. This flexibility will permit, in the future, virtually limitless options for measurement of any trace gas species [8]. Specifically, a combination of the CO2 and a CO laser based instrumentation was shown to detect ppb levels of ammonia, benzene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, ethylene, methanol, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, propylene, trichloroethylene, and HCN [9,10]. The O-Nose technology is the engine of the Nephrolux™ that measures ppb level ammonia in expired human breath in presence of large number of other interfering species including >4% carbon dioxide, >10% water vapor, and more that 200 volatile organic compounds. This instrument is user friendly and has been deployed in UCLA's kidney dialysis center and in the OB/GYN center in the Olive View Medical Clinic in Sylmar, CA where they are used exclusively by physicians and nurse practitioners to collect clinical data on kidney dialysis patients and potential pre-eclampsia patients. The O-Nose technology is also the engine in the Nitrolux™ that is designed to measure sub-ppb levels of ammonia in semiconductor industry clean rooms and ambient air monitoring. Because at ppb and sub-ppb levels, the absorption caused by the gaseous species being detected is very small, a number of optoacoustic cells can be inserted in the path of the optical beam. Such "optical multiplexing" allows monitoring of multiple streams of gases simultaneously in the industrial environment. [11]

Multiwavelength Laser Systems
Photonics SpectraMar 2011Pranalytica Inc.Request Info 
        

             Pranalytica Inc. has unveiled high-power multiple-wavelength laser systems that provide multiwatts of continuous-wave room-temperature power output at one short-wavelength infrared and two mid-wave infrared wavelengths. The three laser outputs are collinear and collimated, and each has the beam quality required for a variety of defense and homeland security applications. The first system, MultiLux-20-40-46-CW, provides >1.2 W of power at 4.6 μm, >0.4 W at 4 μm, and >3 W at 2.1 μm. The collinearity between the combined laser outputs at the three wavelengths is better than 1 μrad. coupled with suitable beam quality, this enables projection over long distances.Visit company websitehttp://www.pranalytica.comAbout this supplier/Company.aspx?CompanyID=18097
