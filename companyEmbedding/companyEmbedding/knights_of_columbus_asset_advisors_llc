Investing in the Church with Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors
3/1/2015
Alton J. Pelowski

With more than $97 billion of life insurance in force and managing $20 billion in assets, the Knights of Columbus has been a pillar of financial strength for its members and their families. Managing the assets of the Knights’ top-rated life insurance program, the Order’s investment staff screens portfolios in light of Catholic teachings and has generated positive investment results for the insurance program.
Beginning this month, the Order will offer similar investment strategies to Catholic institutions, making a series of products available to them through a new registered investment advisor subsidiary, Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors LLC. Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson recently spoke with Columbia Editor Alton J. Pelowski about the launch of the K of C Asset Advisors and how it will benefit the Order and the broader Catholic community.
Columbia: How are the Order’s life insurance products related to the mission of the Knights of Columbus?
Supreme Knight: From the very beginning, Father Michael J. McGivney conceived of a fraternal benefit society to support the Catholic community, and the Knights of Columbus has taken seriously the responsibility of securing the financial future of our members and their families. Father McGivney’s founding vision continued to be an inspiration as the Order grew and adopted a modern life insurance program.
Today, the Knights of Columbus is among the largest companies in America, as ranked on the Fortune 1000 list. For nearly 40 consecutive years, we have earned the highest rating from A.M. Best, citing our impressive financial and fraternal strength. In addition, the Order has been named a World’s Most Ethical Company® by the Ethisphere Institute — one of only two such companies in the life insurance category.
At the foundation of these achievements, there has always been an acute sense that we do not view our clients merely as customers. Rather, we recognize them as fraternal brothers, and that is a distinction that makes a great difference. Our approach puts our brother Knights and their families before profits and requires us to manage all of the associated risks accordingly.
Columbia: And the Order’s approach to investments is tied to its mission as well?
Supreme Knight: Yes, our insurance program and investment philosophy relate to the fraternal vocation of every Knight and to the paternal responsibility of the Order as a whole. By “paternal,” I do not mean “paternalistic” and the negative connotations of that term. Rather, I am referring to the authentic vocation of fathers, which is to serve and protect their families.
Pope Francis referred to this vocation in his inaugural homily on March 19, 2013, when he reflected on St. Joseph, who he said “exercises his role as protector … with an unfailing presence and utter fidelity.” Pope Francis has also spoken about the grace of fatherhood and “spiritual paternity,” which is realized in the defense of others.
Just as a father has a special vocation to protect his family, the Knights of Columbus has a special vocation to protect our members and their families, who have entrusted their future financial security to us through our insurance program or annuity program.
As a distinctly Catholic organization, the Order’s responsibility to defend and protect also goes beyond its individual members and their families. In a particular way, Knights are called to witness to the virtue of charity and to build up the Church.
Columbia: How does this Catholic identity affect the kind of things that the Order chooses to invest in?
Supreme Knight: Companies involved with funding things such as abortion, contraception, pornography, embryonic stem-cell research and human cloning are eliminated from the Knights of Columbus insurance program portfolios. There is no minimum revenue test, meaning that as little as one penny of revenue from any of those sources eliminates a company from further consideration.
Our investment team has been managing screened portfolios on behalf of the insurance program for many years, and has achieved positive financial returns for our insurance and annuity portfolios while fully adhering to Catholic teachings.
Columbia: With that having been said, what is Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors?
Supreme Knight: Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors has been established to expand the scope of the Order’s investments program. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Knights of Columbus that is largely comprised of our current investment staff. Up until now, our investment staff has been structured as a “captive investment firm.” In other words, our people have managed assets only for the Order, and at the same time we “outsource” very little investment decision-making to others. With K of C Asset Advisors, we will now be an SEC-registered investment advisor with the capacity to manage capital for Catholic institutions unaffiliated with the Order.
K of C Asset Advisors will be responsible for managing the insurance and annuity assets for our members, and it will also have investment products available to other institutional investors, including Catholic dioceses, hospitals, parishes and schools.
Columbia: How did this program come about? Why launch it now?
Supreme Knight: In its service to the Church, the Knights of Columbus has long included among its investments the support of capital projects in various dioceses and parishes. The first investment of this kind took place in 1896, when the Supreme Council provided a loan to St. Rose of Lima Church in Meriden, Conn. Our ChurchLoan program has approved more than $600 million of low-interest loans to Catholic churches and schools, and currently includes more than 100 active accounts.
Over the years, many Catholic institutions have also approached the Knights of Columbus about the possibility of managing their assets. In our analysis, we have found that there is a large institutional Catholic marketplace that is highly fragmented, meaning there are a large number of small providers. And one of the biggest challenges confronting Catholic institutional investors is the very small number of Catholic-screened products that they can invest in. Given the size and scale of managing the Knights of Columbus general account, we believe that K of C Asset Advisors will be in a unique position to provide a high quality service to institutions that seek security, stability and Catholic-screened investment options.
Columbia: What kinds of investment products and services will be offered?
Supreme Knight: We expect that at its launch, K of C Asset Advisors will offer both fixed-income and equity mutual funds. The strategies for these funds will be consistent with those used by the investment team on behalf of our insurance program. And very importantly, these funds will comply with Catholic moral teaching.
K of C Asset Advisors may also offer investment advisory and other services to certain customers in a separate account. Additionally, certain customers will be offered an “outsourced chief investment officer” strategy through which it will partner with Catholic institutions to develop goals and objectives and allocate assets in a manner designed to achieve those goals.
Columbia: Will these funds be available to individuals?
Supreme Knight: Initially, the mutual funds are expected to be available only to institutions. However, employees of institutional investors may have access to the funds via 401(k) and similar types of savings plans, providing a Catholic-screened option that was not previously available to them.
Columbia: Is there anything else that members of the Knights should know about Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors? 
Supreme Knight: The service and dedication that insurance members have received from our dedicated field force of agents and committed investments team will be unchanged. We will continue to proudly offer products “by brother Knights, for brother Knights.”
Extending our proven, Catholic-screened investment strategies to other Catholic institutions through K of C Asset Advisors will simply be an opportunity for the Order to strengthen and support Catholic communities. In the future, I believe this will become one of the great services the Knights of Columbus can make to the financial health and sustainability of our dioceses, parishes, religious communities, schools, colleges and health care facilities. It makes sense for us to do so, since members of the Order are, first and foremost, members of the Body of Christ, and the vitality of our Church is directly related to the vitality of the Knights of Columbus.

Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors
allows Catholic institutions to invest with integrity


Chief Investment Officer Anthony V. Minopoli (standing right) and members of the Knights of Columbus investment team work in the trading room at the Order’s headquarters.

It may seem strange to compare the Knights of Columbus to Wall Street’s old guard, but the world’s largest Catholic fraternal order’s history of addressing the financial needs of families actually predates the biggest and brightest investment firms. Father Michael J. McGivney founded the Knights of Columbus in 1882, three years before Goldman Sachs began its dance with the bulls and bears. As the Order’s fraternal benefit program developed, the Knights began formally managing investments with a loan to St. Rose of Lima Parish in Meriden, Conn., in 1896 — just one year after J.P. Morgan & Company was established and 22 years before Merrill Lynch.
The Knights of Columbus has since grown to become a Fortune 1000 company and for decades has earned top ratings for financial strength. In February 2015, Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors LLC formalized its longstanding role as the Order’s institutional investment arm.
With the announcement of the new initiative, Supreme Knight Carl A. Anderson said, “The Catholic community has traditionally been served by investment managers with a broad, rather than a Catholic, focus. We believe a Catholic firm committed to Catholic values can offer a more compelling solution for Catholic entities.”
Since that time, Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors has helped dozens of Catholic institutions unaffiliated with the Knights to invest in a manner consistent with the U.S. bishops’ investment guidelines. In addition, the K of C subsidiary has provided historically compelling returns, below-market fees and profitability that benefits the work of the Knights of Columbus and the Church.
GROWTH AND SERVICE
In October 2011, the Knights of Columbus sponsored a conference in Chicago on the topic of sustainable and ethical investments.
“Our approach to sustainable investing works to understand the ‘personal’ consequences for all those affected by a particular trade or investment,” the supreme knight said in remarks at the conclusion of the conference. “The ethics of the investor matters; so do the guiding philosophy and ethical standards of those people leading the company being invested in.”
According to Anthony V. Minopoli, president and chief investment officer of Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors, the idea for the Knights’ investment group was born of the 2011 conference and follow-up conversations.
“The conference, coupled with conversations about whether the Knights could manage money for other organizations, made us realize there was an opportunity there,” he said.
In his research, Minopoli discovered a mostly untapped $160 billion Catholic institutional investment market.
Since the Knights already had an internal investment team and more than $20 billion of assets under management, it was an easy step to open these funds to the public, said Thomas Duffy, Asset Advisors vice president of investment strategy.
“For decades the Knights had said, ‘No thanks — we only invest our own money,’” Duffy explained. “But we finally got to the point that we knew we should make this capability available. As a service to the Church and to Catholic investors everywhere, we can help them pursue strong riskadjusted returns while maintaining the integrity of their Catholic beliefs.”
Supreme Knight Anderson has affirmed that while the Order is proud to provide this service in support of Catholic communities, both the investment team and dedicated field force has remained committed to serving members and their families.
“The Knights of Columbus will continue to evaluate new financial products that are beneficial to our members and our agents,” the supreme knight said.
Since early 2015, nearly 100 clients in the United States, including at least 16 dioceses and archdioceses, have gotten on board with Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors.
Currently, two fixed-income funds are managed strictly by the Asset Advisors team, while four equity funds are managed in collaboration with the renowned Boston Advisors management group.
“We’ve made sure to price these funds at levels below the industry averages across the board,” Duffy said. “The fees are extremely competitive.”
Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors’ low fees often get the attention of financial officers of dioceses, parishes, Catholic schools and hospitals, religious orders and other Catholic institutions. And the fact that these investments are truly Catholic — screened according to the guidelines of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops — is keeping that attention.
Duffy pointed out that investing is not a “morally neutral” activity, but one that can be fraught with ethical pitfalls.
“For example,” Duffy said, “someone who wants to invest in an index fund might not appreciate the fact that these funds are investing in firms that profit from, say, the production of abortifacients, pornography or even land mines. But as our bishops have explained, it is inappropriate for Catholics to profit from such illicit practices. So, in keeping with the bishops’ guidelines, Asset Advisors screens out all those companies.”
While strict compliance means Asset Advisors has to dig a little deeper into their work, Minopoli said, the investors’ peace of mind is worth the extra effort.
“There’s an old saying that the impossible takes 20 minutes longer. Here at the Knights of Columbus, we’ll take the extra 20 minutes and get our investments the right way,” Minopoli said.
“Investing in a way that is consistent with Church teaching is important,” he added. “We can provide that comfort level because it’s part of our mandate as the Knights of Columbus — it’s part of who we are.”
CATHOLIC, COMPLIANT, CONFIDENT
The Knights’ emphasis on ethical business practices extends beyond investments to all aspects of the organization and its insurance program. For three consecutive years the Order has been named a World’s Most Ethical Company® by the Ethisphere Institute. In addition, the Knights’ Catholic identity further influences how profits are managed.
“It’s typical for an investment firm to give all their profits to its shareholders and partners,” Duffy said. “But the Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Knights of Columbus, so our profits get up-streamed to the Order, which donated more than $175 million last year alone to help Catholic causes and charities such as the Special Olympics.”
In other words, rather than financing luxuries for its brokers, the dividends from Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors’ work go where they are needed most.
“The hallmark of the Knights’ giving is that it gets to the right place,” Minopoli affirmed. “It gives us great satisfaction to know that as Asset Advisors grows and becomes truly profitable, we are contributing money back to the Knights of Columbus and its charitable mission.”
The Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors team is proud of its performance relative to peers in the investing world.
“We don’t just compare well to other funds that are Catholic,” Minopoli said, “but we’re looking at the broad Lipper and Morningstar investment analyses for our various strategies. We know we have to maintain our ranking each and every day to earn our investors’ confidence — just as we have been for years, for those who have purchased Knights of Columbus insurance or annuities.”
For more than 40 consecutive years, the Knights of Columbus — Asset Advisors’ parent company — has achieved the highest possible ratings for financial strength from A.M. Best.
“This speaks to our ability to produce strong, risk-adjusted returns,” said Duffy. “The Order likes to take smart risks, to make sure that we get paid well for any risk we do take. Over time, we’ve found these strategies to be extremely effective.”
According to the investors themselves, there’s yet another reason to choose Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors.
As chief financial officer for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, William Baird sees to it that the Church in Baltimore achieves the best return on its investments. For the last seven years, Baird has worked for the archdiocese, but 25 years of experience in the secular investment world taught him that an investment is only as good as the team that supports it.
“For me, investments are not only about whether they’re Catholic compliant, as important as that is, but also about a process where you have the opportunity to get attractive returns through the managers you select,” Baird said. “After my visit to New Haven, whether to invest with the Knights became a pretty easy decision to make, given the talent and caliber of Tony’s team.”
Like the Baltimore Archdiocese, the Sisters of Life, a New York-based religious order, invests with Asset Advisors. According to the order’s superior general, Mother Agnes Mary Donovan, the Sisters of Life do not see ethical investing as a luxury but a necessity.
“In addition to the three traditional vows of poverty, chastity and obedience, the Sisters of Life take a fourth vow to protect and enhance the sacredness of human life,” said Mother Agnes. “It is critically important to us that our investments in companies are building a culture of life. The Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors researches the companies they invest in and provide us with morally and fiscally appropriate places for our financial resources.”
“As our community and missions grow,” Mother Agnes added, “the Knights of Columbus Asset Advisors team is helping us to provide for the needs of God’s people and the sisters who serve them.”
