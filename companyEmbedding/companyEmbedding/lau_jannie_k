Career history: InterDigital, IKON Office Solutions Inc.
Family: Married to Todd Longsworth with sons Tobin (5) and daughter Ridley (1).
Motto to live by: Be the change you wish to see in the world.
Your proudest moment: Being able to support my mother financially, as her only child, ever since my father passed away from colorectal cancer when I was 26.
Your biggest break: Todd sitting down next to me on the second day of bankruptcy class in law school.
What makes you tick?: My belief that I have just one life to live.
Best career advice you ever got: Find a job worthy of the time you must spend away from your family.




Your biggest challenge: Juggling parenthood, my career and giving back to the community.
Your biggest disappointment: My father succumbing to cancer before his grandchildren were born.
Where you see yourself in five years: In my experience, life is unpredictable, so I’m going to be honest and say that I have no idea.
How you give back: Given my family’s history, I am especially proud of my volunteer efforts toward the cause of eradicating cancer and my service on the Southeast Region board of directors of the East Central Division of the American Cancer Society.
Your first job: Vegetable chopper and cashier at my parents’ Chinese takeout restaurant.
