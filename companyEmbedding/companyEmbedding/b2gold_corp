About
Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, B2Gold Corp. is one of the fastest-growing gold producers in the world. Founded in 2007, today, B2Gold has four operating mines, one mine under construction and numerous exploration projects in various countries, including Nicaragua, the Philippines, Namibia, Mali and Burkina Faso. Construction of B2Gold’s Fekola Mine in southwest Mali is on budget and ahead of schedule, and is planning for an October 1, 2017, production start. As a result, B2Gold is well positioned to maintain its low-cost structure and growth profile.
Based on current assumptions and updates to B2Gold’s long-term mine plans, the Company is projecting consolidated annual gold production of between 545,000 to 595,000 ounces in 2017 (including the estimated pre-commercial production from the Fekola Mine of between 45,000 and 55,000 ounces), which will increase significantly in 2018 to between 900,000 to 950,000 ounces (i.e. including the planned first full-year of production at Fekola).

Minerals Market Research Reports & Industry Analysis
Minerals are solid, naturally occurring chemical substances with structures that are highly organized atomically. They also have very specific physical properties, and are formed through biogeochemical processes. Though they may look like rocks to the untrained eye, minerals differ from rocks substantially in that they have only one specific chemical composition, while rocks are a mix of many kinds of minerals or mineraloids. 
	 Some of the many chemical compositions minerals can have, ordered approximately by their abundance in the Earth�s crust from highest to lowest, include the Silicate class, the Carbonate class, the Sulfate class, the Halide class, the Oxide class, the Sulfide class, the Phosphate class, the Element class, and the Organic class. Minerals are a critical commodity to many industries following their mining and processing and form a material input to chemicals manufacturing, metallurgy, building materials manufacturing, electrical grid infrastructure, electronics, glass products, vehicles, and high-technology. Rare earth minerals or rare earth elements are particularly crucial to numerous energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies.
Common oxide minerals include chromite, hematite, and magnetite. Economically, minerals from the Sulfide class are arguably just as valuable as metal ores, and include chalcopyrite, or copper iron sulfide, galena, or lead sulfide, and pentlandite, or nickel iron sulfide. The Element class is home to those minerals called native metals or intermetallic elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, as well as natural alloys. The Element class is also where one could find semi-metals and non-metals, such as bismuth, graphite, and sulfur.

B2Gold (BTG) executives will host a conference call to discuss the results on Thursday, August 10, 2017, at 10:00 am PDT / 1:00 pm EDT. You may access the call by dialing the operator at +1 (647) 788-4919 (local or international) or toll free at +1 (877) 291-4570 prior to the scheduled start time or you may listen to the call via webcast by clicking http://www.investorcalendar.com/event/18241.

(BTG) Headquartered in Vancouver, Canada, B2Gold Corp. (BTG) is one of the fastest-growing intermediate gold producers in the world. Founded in 2007, today, the Company has four operating mines, one mine under construction and numerous exploration projects in various countries, including Nicaragua, the Philippines, Namibia, Mali, Burkina Faso and Finland. Construction of the Company’s Fekola Mine in southwest Mali is approximately three months ahead of schedule and on budget, and is projected to commence production on October 1, 2017. As a result, the Company is well positioned to maintain its low-cost structure and growth profile. Based on current assumptions and updates to B2Gold’s current year guidance and long-term mine plans, the Company is projecting consolidated gold production in 2017 of between 545,000 and 595,000 ounces (including estimated pre-commercial production from the Fekola Mine of between 45,000 and 55,000 ounces); and in 2018 significantly increasing to between 900,000 and 950,000 ounces, with the inclusion of the anticipated first full-year of commercial production at the Fekola Mine. ON BEHALF OF B2GOLD CORP.“Clive T. Johnson”President and Chief Executive Officer The Toronto Stock Exchange neither approves nor disapproves the information contained in this news release.   This news release includes certain “forward-looking information” and “forward-looking statements” (collectively “forward-looking statements”) within the meaning of applicable Canadian and United States securities legislation, including projections, estimates and other statements regarding future financial and operational performance, events, mine life and production estimates and guidance, including the Company’s projected gold production of between 545,000 to 595,000 ounces in 2017 and between 900,000 and 950,000 ounces in 2018; and statements regarding anticipated development and production from the Fekola Project commencing October 1, 2017, the Fekola Project being approximately three months ahead of schedule and on budget and the Fekola Project  being a low-cost mine and its anticipated effect on the Company’s gold production in 2018. All statements in this news release that address events or developments that we expect to occur in the future are forward-looking statements.

All such forward-looking statements are based on the opinions and estimates of management as of the date such statements are made. Forward-looking statements necessarily involve assumptions, risks and uncertainties, certain of which are beyond B2Gold’s control, including risks associated with the volatility of metal prices and our common shares; risks and dangers inherent in exploration, development and mining activities; uncertainty of reserve and resource estimates; risk of not achieving production, cost or other estimates; risk that actual production, development plans and costs differ materially from the estimates in our feasibility studies; risks related to hedging activities and ore purchase commitments; the ability to obtain and maintain any necessary permits, consents or authorizations required for mining activities; uncertainty about the outcome of negotiations with the Government of Mali; risks related to environmental regulations or hazards and compliance with complex regulations associated with mining activities; the ability to replace mineral reserves and identify acquisition opportunities; unknown liabilities of companies acquired by B2Gold (BTG); ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions; fluctuations in exchange rates; availability of financing; risks relating to financing and debt; risks related to operations in foreign and developing countries and compliance with foreign laws; risks related to remote operations and the availability of adequate infrastructure, fluctuations in price and availability of energy and other inputs necessary for mining operations; shortages or cost increases in necessary equipment, supplies and labour; regulatory, political and country risks; risks related to reliance upon contractors, third parties and joint venture partners; challenges to title or surface rights; dependence on key personnel and ability to attract and retain skilled personnel; the risk of an uninsurable or uninsured loss; adverse climate and weather conditions; litigation risk; competition with other mining companies; changes in tax laws; community support for our operations including risks related to strikes and the halting of such operations from time to time; risks related to conflict with small scale miners; risks related to failures of information systems or information security threats; the ongoing audit by the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources in relation to our Masbate Project and the final outcome thereof; ability to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting as required by law; risks related to compliance with anti-corruption laws; as well as other factors identified and as described in more detail under the heading “Risk Factors” in B2Gold’s most recent Annual Information Form and B2Gold’s other filings with Canadian securities regulators and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), which may be viewed at www.sedar.com and www.sec.gov, respectively (the “Websites”). The list is not exhaustive of the factors that may affect the Company’s forward-looking statements. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate, and actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that any events anticipated by the forward-looking statements will transpire or occur, or if any of them do, what benefits or liabilities B2Gold (BTG) will derive therefrom. The Company’s forward-looking statements reflect current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date hereof and the Company does not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements if circumstances or management's beliefs, expectations or opinions should change other than as required by applicable law. For the reasons set forth above, undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking statements.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/26/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

The most comprehensive equity research coverage available online.


          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!
          
          Equity research by professional analysts - especially their rationales more than their forecasts - contains far more interesting and important information about the actual fundamentals of the traded companies than can be gathered from conventional news reports.
          
          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.
