What are analysts saying about Arch Capital Group stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Arch Capital Group stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Shares of Arch Capital have underperformed the Zacks categorized Property and Casualty industry quarter to date. The company witnessed its 2017 estimates moving south over the last 30 days. Exposure to catastrophe losses poses an inherent risk to the P&C business, inducing volatility in underwriting results. Also, a still low interest rate environment and intense competition raise concerns for the company. Nonetheless, with a strong product portfolio, Arch Capital has been maintaining an exemplary track record of premium growth. This apart, the company has been making efforts to diversify its Mortgage Insurance business through strategic acquisitions. Moreover, the insurer remains focused in boosting shareholders’ value through share buybacks and dividend payments. Such effective capital deployment makes the stock an attractive pick for yield-seeking investors." (6/27/2017)
2. Wells Fargo & Company analysts commented, "We await more details from the company to determine whether this will potentially lead to additional reserve charges across the industry." (6/7/2017)
3. BMO Capital Markets analysts commented, "We are incorporating a $4 embedded value into our ACGL valuation stemming from the future earn-out of already written mortgage insurance business. In addition, we expect the incorporation of the UGC book to lower the overall earnings volatility of Arch as a majority of earnings over the next 12-24 months will come from already written mortgage insurance. While Arch was never known for volatility, the reduced PMLs and mortgage insurance earn-out should stabilize it even further, justifying an increased valuation." (2/28/2017)
4. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (The) analysts commented, "management is willing to ramp up its sub-scale mortgage operations faster than previously expected" with the acquisition of American International Group Inc (NYSE: AIG)'s United Guaranty operations.The brokerage noted that the acquisition shows the willingness of the company to deploy significant capital to scale its mortgage insurance business faster than it could do so organically."Our analysis implies that Arch could see approximately 10–50 percent of EPS accretion, which could increase Arch ROEs by approximately 50bps to 300bps, all else being equal," analyst Michael Nannizzi wrote in a note.The brokerage said the shift to mortgage "would provide the company with an additional earnings lever not available to pure P&C peers." Also, the company appears to be more willing to bypass organic growth via the usage of M&A.Related Link: Stocks Affected By Hurricane Season"Given market conditions and returns in MI are much more attractive than P&C more broadly, on a pro-forma basis a potentially scaled up MI platform could have a significant impact on earnings," Nannizzi highlighted.Nannizzi also raised his price target to $79 from $66, equivalent to 1.4x 2Q17E book value (from 1.1x previously)."[W]e believe the company should garner a higher multiple as it continues to shift its business profile away from reinsurance and into mortgage insurance," (9/7/2016)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Arch Capital Group (NASDAQ:ACGL) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 7 Hold Ratings, 4 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.36)Consensus Price Target: $91.67 (7.52% downside)

Arch Street Capital Advisors, LLC is a full service real estate investment and advisory firm. We provide a comprehensive suite of customized advisory services and investment advice exclusively to select institutional clients. Our clients include international financial institutions, global pension funds and family offices. 












One-stop solutionfor investing in U.S. real estate Arch Street Capital Advisors, LLC is a full service real estate investment and advisory firm founded in 2003. We specialize in advising investors on their U.S. real estate strategies and have advised clients on more than $6.0 billion of transactions. About Us 



14 
Years Experience 





Our Services We provide our clients with a comprehensive rangeof advisory services. 




WE SPECIALIZE IN ADVISING INVESTORS ON THEIR U.S. REAL ESTATE STRATEGIES. 



Acquisitions
Asset Management
Joint Ventures
Restructuring & Workouts
Sharia Compliant Transactions




Through frequent dialogue with our clients, we create well-defined investment criteria for each of our clients which include desired property sectors, targeted geographic regions, acceptable risk parameters and appropriate investment return thresholds. We then use our established network of public and private real estate owners, developers and brokers to source investment opportunities on behalf of our clients.
We coordinate all required due diligence to assist clients in making fully informed investment decisions, including financing advisory services and collaboration with counsel in the documentation of every acquisition. With legal, investment banking and acquisitions experience, our professionals are well positioned to offer clients important leadership in the negotiation, documentation and closing of every acquisition.


Our professionals have many years of asset management expertise and take a hands-on approach to monitoring assets and making strategic and tactical recommendations to our clients. This experience is utilized to make strategic decisions that enhance the economic returns of our clients’ investments.
We carefully screen on behalf of our clients, property management and leasing agents to ensure that they have a proven track record not only in management and leasing, but also in areas such as research, valuation, financial reporting, risk management, technology and construction. Strategic changes and tactical decisions that affect property and/or portfolio performance are reviewed and approved by us after consultation with our clients.
Once acquired on behalf of a client, each asset or portfolio of assets is subject to a hold/sell analysis prepared in connection with the annual plan. A property’s performance is reviewed as is its contribution to portfolio returns, if applicable. The decision to hold or sell an asset considers numerous factors including: client objectives, asset sector dynamics, market / submarket status, anticipated capital requirements, rent roll quality, and capital market conditions.
Once a property or portfolio of properties is identified for disposition we will present supporting analysis to our client. We then discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches, and if our client agrees with the sale recommendation we will effect the disposition process. As a firm we proactively manage the disposition process, the basic components of which include preparation for sale, marketing for sale and execution of sale.


We frequently represent clients in the formation of joint ventures for the acquisition or development of real estate. These joint venture relationships have included partnerships between our clients and private owners, private developers, public REITs and private REITs. In addition to performing the traditional acquisition advisory services necessary to complete a real estate acquisition, we also provide clients seeking joint venture relationships with specific advisory services related to the details of joint venture structures including: joint venture governance and decision making; fees associated with acquisition, asset management and disposition; performance based “promotes”; dissolution/exit mechanisms; buy-sell/change of control procedures; exclusivity and performance reporting.
We assist our international clients in overcoming one of the significant hurdles in attracting joint venture investment opportunities with U.S. based real estate partners – i.e., the concern by partners that a non-U.S. based investor will be inaccessible for real-time decision making relating to U.S. investments. On behalf of our clients we act as a local representative with the ability to attend meetings, tour properties, participate in conference calls and make decisions on a U.S. timetable. It is our job to bridge any time zone differences and ensure that decision making is always conducted in a manner that maximizes the opportunity for a successful investment.


We provide restructuring advisory services for our clients to improve the financial performance or recovery of underperforming investments. In particular, we specialize in aiding clients in situations where decisions need to be made quickly, often times with imperfect information. Working in conjunction with our clients we will assist in devising and implementing turnaround and restructuring plans. This often includes modifying and amending loan terms, waiver negotiations, loan buybacks, recapitalizations of transactions, modeling and re-forecasting of financial projections.


We are considered a leading advisor to clients seeking real estate acquisitions and financing structured in a Sharia compliant manner. Since the firm’s inception, we have been a thought leader on strategy and structuring ideas relating to the acquisition and financing of real estate on a Sharia compliant basis. We are often called upon to speak on the topic of Sharia compliant real estate investing by international publications and professional associations.







Our Portfolio We have been involved in over $6.0 billion worth of transactions spanning the following sectors: Multifamily, Office, Retail, Industrial, Hospitality, Student Housing, Seniors Housing, Condo Development, Land Entitlement, and Single Family Housing.

In the United States we have the capability to address all sectors including utility scale solar PV and wind power projects. We also provide services to developers and asset owners in the commercial, industrial, municipal, small-scale utility and distributed generation communities. In all cases Roman Arch CEF looks to develop long-term collaborative partnerships with its clients.At this time we are primarily focused on solar PV, municipal LED street lighting, small hydro and wind power projects and assets. However, we are also interested in being of assistance to parties focused on other existing or emerging renewable energy assets and technologies. We are primarily focused on markets within the Western Hemisphere including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We are very active internationally across all sectors. We have in the past been active in Europe, most notably Italy and Germany.

If the arch collapsed, so did their business, so to speak. I've always liked and appreciated this story. The words ROMAN ARCH were chosen to be prominent in the name of our firm to exemplify this same commitment to excellence we strive for on behalf of our clients. We stand firmly behind the advice we impart to our clients with our success being inextricably tied to their success as well.
