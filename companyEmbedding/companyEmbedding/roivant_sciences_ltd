Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer’s DiseaseAlzheimer’s disease is the most common form of dementia and the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. A chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer’s usually develops slowly and can get worse over time. According to the Alzheimer’s Association, Alzheimer’s disease affects approximately 5.4 million people in the United States today and the number of patients afflicted with the disease is growing every year. By 2050, it is projected that approximately 14 million people will be living with Alzheimer’s disease in the US. In 2017, total healthcare costs for Alzheimer’s and other dementias are estimated to reach $259 billion in the US alone. Meanwhile, no new treatment options for patients have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease since 2003.An estimated 80% of Alzheimer’s disease patients age 65 and older are classified as mild-to-moderate, which is the patient population Axovant is focused on treating with intepirdine (RVT-101). Axovant is currently developing intepirdine in a Phase 3 international, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intepirdine in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease patients called the MINDSET study.Learn More About Mindset

Dementia With Lewy Bodies (DLB)
Lewy body dementia, or LBD, is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder and represents the second most common form of dementia. LBD is characterized by a build-up of abnormal proteins known as Lewy bodies in areas of the brain that control cognition, movement, alertness, and behavior.

Lewy body dementia includes two similar conditions – dementia with Lewy bodies, or DLB, and Parkinson’s disease dementia, or PDD. The primary difference between both conditions generally depends on the timing of the onset of cognitive decline relative to the onset of movement-related symptoms.

In dementia with Lewy bodies, cognitive decline generally occurs within one year of the onset of movement disorder symptoms. In Parkinson’s disease dementia, movement disorder symptoms precede cognitive decline by more than a year.

Along with suffering from impaired cognition and behavioral disturbances, LBD patients often suffer from: visual hallucinations; fluctuations in cognition, attention and alertness; sensitivity to neuroleptic (antipsychotic) medications; REM behavior disorder, or RBD, in which people physically act out their dreams; and Parkinsonism (movement disorder, with symptoms including muscle rigidity and tremors).

The Lewy Body Dementia Association estimates that there are 1.4 million patients with Lewy body dementia in the United States.

Our subsidiary, Axovant, is currently developing two drug candidates to treat certain aspects of Lewy body dementia – intepirdine (RVT-101) and nelotanserin. Currently, there are no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of DLB. Intepirdine has the potential to be the first drug approved by the FDA for the treatment of DLB.

Gait and Balance Impairments in Dementia
Axovant is currently conducting a phase 2 study to evaluate the effects of intepirdine on gait and balance in patients with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. In this study, Axovant intends to further investigate the observation of a reduced rate of falls seen in patients treated with intepirdine in a prior 684-patient study of intepirdine on a background of stable donepezil therapy.

Visual Hallucinations in Lewy Body Dementia
Axovant is currently conducting a phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study evaluating nelotanserin in patients with Lewy body dementia (LBD) suffering from visual hallucinations.

The safety, efficacy, and tolerability of nelotanserin at doses of 40 mg and 80 mg will be evaluated over a 4-week treatment period in approximately 20 subjects with LBD. This is a crossover study so every subject will receive placebo for 4 weeks and nelotanserin for 4 weeks, but neither patients or their doctor will know which treatment they are taking. The primary outcome measure will be safety and tolerability. The frequency and severity of visual hallucinations over a 4-week treatment period will be a secondary outcome measure. Patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study.

Rem Behavior Disorder (RBD) In DLB
Axovant is currently conducting a phase 2, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating nelotanserin in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) experiencing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD).

The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 80 mg of nelotanserin will be evaluated over a 4-week period in approximately 60 patients with DLB. The primary efficacy evaluation will be a change in the frequency of REM sleep behaviors by the end of 4 weeks. Patients who complete the study will be eligible to receive nelotanserin in an extension study.

Alzheimer’s DiseaseAxovant plans to develop and, if successful, commercialize products that combine cholinesterase inhibitors with peripheral muscarinic receptor antagonists including glycopyrrolate, which could mitigate the peripheral side effects of cholinesterase inhibitors.Axovant recently completed a proof of concept study for RVT-103 designed to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and tolerability of 5 mg donepezil plus placebo versus 10 mg of donepezil when given concomitantly with one of three different regimens including either glycopyrrolate or trospium over a 10-day period. The study measured subject nausea in 48 healthy, elderly subjects using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) at baseline and once every two hours for eight hours after dosing on Days 1, 3, 7, and 10.On the final day of dosing, when nausea for subjects in the 5 mg donepezil plus placebo arm achieved a peak mean change from baseline on the VAS, subjects in the arms receiving 10 mg donepezil plus either glycopyrrolate or trospium demonstrated a 67 percent to 95 percent reduction in nausea relative to the 5 mg donepezil plus placebo arm.Based on these results, the Company expects to meet with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss additional studies that could support registration of RVT-103 and expects to initiate a proof of concept study for RVT-104 in the second half of 2017.

Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is a malignant transformation of tissue within the male prostate gland. Often characterized by slow growth, prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the United States. Approximately 2.9 million men in the United States are currently living with prostate cancer, and 180,000 men are newly diagnosed each year. Symptoms of prostate cancer include increased urinary frequency, dysuria, hematuria, and nocturnal urination. Current treatments include combinations of surgery, radiation or proton beam therapy, androgen deprivation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Myovant is currently developing relugolix, an oral, once-daily, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist. By inhibiting GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland, relugolix rapidly reduces the circulating gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), leading to the suppression of estrogen in women and testosterone in men. Suppression of these hormones improves the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and decreases prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with advanced prostate cancer.

Uterine FibroidsUterine fibroids are non-cancerous tumors that develop from the muscle and connective tissue of the uterus. Approximately 25% of women of reproductive age have uterine fibroids, and 1 in 4 experience symptoms requiring treatment. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they may cause debilitating symptoms including heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, anemia, and pelvic pain. Current treatments include hormonal contraceptives, GnRH agonists, and surgical interventions including myomectomy and hysterectomy.Myovant is currently developing relugolix, an oral, once-daily, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.

EndometriosisEndometriosis is a gynecological medical condition in which cells that normally line the uterus grow outside of the uterine cavity. An estimated 7.5 million women in the United States have endometriosis, and 3 in 4 experience symptoms requiring treatment. During the menstrual cycle, endometriosis lesions grow, differentiate, and shed into the abdomen, causing symptoms including non-menstrual pelvic pain and pain during menstruation (dysmenorrhea). Current treatments include hormonal contraceptives, danazol, GnRH agonists, and various surgical interventions for severe cases.Myovant is currently developing relugolix, an oral, once-daily, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist.

Female Infertility
Approximately 25% of infertile women have problems related to ovulation, including the inability to produce fully matured eggs or release an egg from the ovary (i.e., “ovulate”). In the course of treating infertility related to anovulation, fertility specialists use a group of medications to temporarily correct ovulatory problems and increase a woman’s chance for pregnancy. These and related procedures are broadly termed Assisted Reproductive Technology, or ART. Approximately 1.5 million cycles of ART were performed globally in 2012.

Myovant is currently developing MVT-602, an analog of kisspeptin, a naturally-occurring peptide in humans that plays a key role in egg maturation and ovulation by increasing the release of LH and FSH through the stimulation of GnRH secretion.

Recent evidence from trials performed in women undergoing assisted reproduction revealed that the native kisspeptin peptide has the potential to act as an alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or GnRH agonists in triggering egg maturation, an essential step in all assisted reproduction cycles. Myovant believes that MVT-602 may induce the release of LH and FSH in a manner that more closely mimics natural physiology, potentially avoiding side effects associated with hCG or GnRH agonist administration, including ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

Farber Disease
Farber disease is an ultra-rare lysosomal storage disease caused by a mutation in both alleles of the ASAH1 gene, resulting in the deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase. This leads to the accumulation of the pro-inflammatory sphingolipid ceramide, and a macrophage driven inflammatory process causing the development of typical clinical symptoms. Like many other lysosomal storage diseases, Farber disease has a broad phenotypic spectrum, and is likely underdiagnosed.

Farber patients typically present with the cardinal symptoms of joint contractures or arthritis, subcutaneous nodules, and weak or hoarse voice.

It may take years for all three cardinal symptoms to appear together, and they may vary greatly in severity. Patients may also present with systemic inflammation (fever), severe pain, peripheral osteolysis, failure to thrive, and developmental delay.

Recombinant human acid ceramidase (rhAC) is an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) under development for the treatment of Farber disease. Initially developed by Dr. Edward Schuchman at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, rhAC showed positive results in various preclinical studies. rhAC was granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Enzyvant is currently conducting the pre-clinical studies for rhAC to enable a clinical trial in patients with Farber disease.

Complete DiGeorge Syndrome
DiGeorge Syndrome is a rare genetic disease caused by a defect in multiple genes on chromosome 22, leading to defective development of the pharyngeal pouch system and variety of consequences including congenital heart disease, dysfunctional calcium metabolism, and thymic hypoplasia among others. Children born with complete DiGeorge Syndrome (cDGS) represent approximately 1% of the overall DiGeorge population and lack any thymic tissue (athymia). This causes severe immunodeficiency due to an inability to produce normally functioning T-cells, which defend against infection and regulate essential processes in the immune system. cDGS is uniformly fatal if untreated, with death typically occurring in the first two years of life due to susceptibility to infection.

RVT-802 is a biologic therapy being developed for the treatment of primary immune deficiency resulting from cDGS. RVT-802 utilizes proprietary processes developed by Dr. Louise Markert (Professor of Pediatrics, Duke University) to harvest, culture, and engraft allogeneic thymic tissue. Preliminary clinical results suggest a survival rate of over 70% for treated patients. The findings of Dr. Markert and her research team have been published in the New England Journal of Medicine as well as numerous other peer-reviewed scientific journals and clinical publications.

RVT-802 has been granted Orphan Drug designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Enzyvant anticipates a potential BLA filing in 2018 for the treatment of cDGS. Enzyvant continues to collaborate with Dr. Markert and is exploring other indications for which RVT-802 may play a therapeutic role.

Moderate-to-Severe Dermatologic Indications
Dermavant has an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for the development and commercialization of cerdulatinib in topical applications beyond oncology. Dermavant intends to pursue the clinical development of cerdulatinib, a dual spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) and janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, as a topical therapy for a variety of dermatologic conditions. Dermavant believes that the profile of cerdulatinib is ideal for development in skin diseases where a growing body of evidence suggests that both JAK and Syk are important drivers of disease manifestation.

Inflammatory Skin Diseases
Dermavant plans to pursue the clinical development of RVT-201, a novel caspase-1 inhibitor, as a topical therapy for multiple dermatologic conditions.

Overactive BladderUrovant’s lead therapeutic candidate is vibegron, an investigational oral β3-adrenergic agonist being developed for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. β3-adrenergic receptors play an important role in the bladder fill-void cycle. By stimulating that pathway, vibegron has the potential to relax the bladder detrusor muscle. Relaxing the bladder allows it to store urine more efficiently, thereby decreasing the symptoms of OAB.Urovant has licensed international rights, excluding Japan and certain Asian territories, for the development and commercialization of vibegron (formerly MK-4618) from Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc. Over 2,700 patients with symptoms of overactive bladder have been enrolled in clinical studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of vibegron, including a completed global randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled Phase 2b study of over 1,300 subjects that met its primary and key secondary endpoints, and a completed randomized, placebo and active comparator-controlled Phase 3 study of over 1,000 patients conducted outside of the United States that met its primary and key secondary endpoints. Urovant anticipates initiating an international Phase 3 registration program for vibegron in 2017.

Roivant Sciences Ltd. is a company that in-licenses late-stage drug candidates and develops them through subsidiaries.[1][2] Roivant has operations in the U.S. (Durham, N.C., and New York City), Switzerland, and Bermuda.[2]
The company was founded in May 2014 by Vivek Ramaswamy.[2] The company's leadership includes Dr. Lawrence Friedhoff, who led the development of Aricept (donepezil) and Aciphex (rabeprazole), William Symonds, who led the development of Sovaldi (sofosbuvir), Dr. Mayukh Sukhatme, Matthew Gline, Marianne Romeo and Alan Roemer.[1]
The company's subsidiaries include:

Axovant Sciences was founded in 2014, and as of 2016 was developing intepirdine as an add-on treatment for Alzheimers disease and nelotanserin for Lewy body dementia.[3][4] It held its IPO in 2015 and raised $315 million.[5] Biotech analysts John Carroll of FierceBiotech and Adam Feuerstein of The Street noted that the IPO was overvalued based on the inexperience of the CEO and the low quality of its lead product, describing it as something that "GSK sold for lunch money".[6][7][8]


Myovant was founded in partnership with Takeda to address women’s health and endocrine disease treatments, is developing therapies for uterine fibroids, endometriosis, prostate cancer and female infertility.[9] Myovant has a license in some territories for relugolix.[10]


Enzyvant was founded to develop therapies for rare diseases.[11][12] One of its treatments is a version of ceramidase being developed as treatment for Farber disease.[13] Another was licensed from Duke University in 2017 and is a potential treatment for a kind of DiGeorge syndrome; the treatment is thymus tissue that is harvested, treated, and implanted in a person with the condition.[13]


Dermavant was founded to develop drugs for skin diseases.[14][15]

OSAKA, Japan and HAMILTON, Bermuda, June 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502) and Roivant Sciences Ltd. today announced the formation of Myovant Sciences Ltd. ("Myovant"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering innovative women's health and prostate cancer solutions by efficiently advancing new medicines to market that have the potential to improve the lives of millions of patients. In addition, Lynn Seely, MD, an endocrinologist who led the development of XTANDI® (enzalutamide) for the treatment of prostate cancer as the Chief Medical Officer of Medivation from 2005 to 2015, was named the President & Chief Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc.       








Myovant Partnership Summary
Takeda has granted Myovant an exclusive, worldwide license (excluding Japan and certain other Asian countries) to relugolix (TAK-385), a phase 3 drug candidate that has been evaluated in over 1,300 patients to date. Relugolix has successfully demonstrated significant clinical benefit and was generally well-tolerated across multiple, large, randomized phase 2 clinical trials in three different indications. Relugolix is being developed as an oral, once-daily, potential best-in-class gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist for uterine fibroids, endometriosis and prostate cancer. Takeda will retain commercial rights for relugolix in Asian countries, including Japan, where Takeda is actively conducting two phase 3 registration studies for the treatment of uterine fibroids. Takeda has also granted Myovant an exclusive, worldwide license to RVT-602 (TAK-448), a novel, oligopeptide kisspeptin receptor agonist as a product candidate for the treatment of infertility in females. Financial terms of the partnership were not disclosed.
"With Takeda strengthening its focus around the core therapeutic areas of oncology, gastroenterology and central nervous system diseases, as well as establishing a strategy that embraces innovative partnerships, it is important that we seek alternatives to further develop and create value around promising assets that are either outside these areas of focus or where strategic partnership makes more sense for our business," said Andrew Plump, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical and Scientific Officer of Takeda. "The formation of Myovant Sciences represents such an innovative partnership arrangement to further advance relugolix by relying on Roivant's and Myovant's in-house development capabilities in the major markets where they are building deep expertise, while leveraging Takeda's commercial presence in certain Asian territories."
"We are very pleased to partner with Takeda to meet the needs of patients suffering from hormone-driven diseases and disorders," said Vivek Ramaswamy, CEO of Roivant Sciences, Inc.  "The creation of Myovant enables a 'win-win' outcome for both our partner and for patients by launching a company to address major unmet medical needs in women's health, prostate cancer and beyond."
Appointment of Dr. Lynn Seely as President & Chief Executive Officer 
Lynn Seely, MD, brings over 20 years of drug development and biopharmaceutical company leadership to her role as the President & Chief Executive Officer of Myovant Sciences, Inc. Most recently, Dr. Seely served as Chief Medical Officer of Medivation, Inc. from its early stages in March 2005 through October 2015. She served on the Executive Committee and led the development of XTANDI for the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer from IND-enabling studies through to NDA approval and post-approval clinical studies. Dr. Seely was responsible for building the clinical organization at Medivation, as well as the regulatory, quality, project management, medical affairs and biologics manufacturing functions. Dr. Seely currently serves on the board of directors of Blueprint Medicines Corporation, and she previously served as Vice President of Clinical Development at Anesiva, Inc. (formerly Corgentech) and at Cytyc Health Corporation. Dr. Seely received a medical degree from the University of Oklahoma College of Medicine and completed her residency in internal medicine at Yale-New Haven Hospital. After serving as Chief Resident in Internal Medicine at Yale University School of Medicine, she completed her basic science and clinical fellowship in endocrinology and metabolism at the University of California, San Diego.
"I look forward to delivering on Myovant's mission to bring innovative new treatments to women suffering from diseases such as uterine fibroids and endometriosis and to men with prostate cancer," stated Dr. Lynn Seely, President & CEO of Myovant Sciences, Inc. "Relugolix and our partnership with Takeda represent an exceptional foundation on which to build this exciting new company."
About Relugolix 
Relugolix is a once-daily, orally administered, potential best-in-class gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonist for the treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and a potential best- and first-in-class treatment for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC).  Relugolix has been evaluated in over 1,300 patients to date, and has successfully demonstrated significant clinical benefit and was generally well-tolerated across multiple, large, randomized phase 2 clinical trials in three different indications. Takeda is currently enrolling two phase 3 clinical trials of relugolix for registration in Japan for the treatment of uterine fibroids.
By inhibiting GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland, relugolix rapidly reduces circulating sex hormone levels leading to suppression of estrogen and testosterone. Suppression of these sex hormones improves the symptoms of women with uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and decreases prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men with HSPC.
In a 216-patient phase 2 study for the treatment of uterine fibroids, women who received relugolix had a significant reduction in menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding during menstruation. In a 487-patient phase 2 study for the treatment of endometriosis, women who received relugolix had a significant reduction in both non-menstrual and menstrual pelvic pain. Based on these results, two phase 3 registration studies in women with uterine fibroids are underway in Japan (NCT02655237, NCT02655224). In two phase 2 studies in approximately 225 men with HSPC, which included control arms of either an injectable GnRH agonist (leuprolide acetate) or a GnRH antagonist (degarelix), respectively, oral once-daily relugolix suppressed serum testosterone to castrate levels and decreased PSA. The safety of relugolix across all phase 2 studies was generally well-tolerated, consistent with the mechanism of action. 
The clinical experience to date, supported by an extensive preclinical development program, suggests that oral relugolix, administered once-daily, could be an important advancement in the treatment options available for women suffering from endometriosis and uterine fibroids. In addition, relugolix could provide men with HSPC an important new treatment option as the first oral GnRH receptor antagonist that offers an alternative to injectable therapies.
About RVT-602 
RVT-602 (TAK-448) is a kisspeptin analog that acts to stimulate the physiologic release of GnRH and downstream hormones important in fertility such as luteinizing hormone.  Recent evidence from trials performed in women undergoing In-vitro Fertilization (IVF) revealed that the native kisspeptin peptide has the potential to act as an alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or GnRH agonists in triggering egg maturation, an essential step in every IVF cycle.

Roivant Acquires SB742457 From GlaxoSmithKline




















December 23, 2014 09:00 ET

 | Source: Roivant Sciences, Inc.






-Roivant intends to commence Phase 3 clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease in 2015-

-Development led by the developer of Alzheimer's medicine, Aricept-

	HAMILTON, Bermuda, Dec. 23, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Roivant Neurosciences Ltd. ("Roivant"), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of late-stage drug candidates for neurologic diseases, has entered into an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline ("GSK") for the acquisition of SB742457, a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist with the potential to improve cognition and function in multiple central nervous system disorders. GSK conducted thirteen clinical studies of SB742457 involving over 1,250 healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease patients. The results of these studies provide strong evidence that SB742457 holds promise for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.

	"This transaction represents a foundational late-stage clinical asset for Roivant," stated Vivek Ramaswamy, Founder and Director of Roivant Sciences Ltd. and CEO of Roivant Sciences, Inc. "Our organization is fully committed to building on the research already completed by GSK and advancing a new therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease, a debilitating and deadly disease that affects millions of patients and their families."

	Roivant intends to meet with the FDA in the first half of 2015 to confirm the regulatory requirements for the continued development of SB742457 for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Roivant may also explore the clinical development of SB742457 for other neurological disorders for which there are limited or no therapeutic options.

	"Despite the large number of clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease and related disorders during the past decade, there have been no new drugs approved in that period," stated Dr. Lawrence Friedhoff, Senior Vice President, Research & Development of Roivant Sciences, Inc. and the development team leader for Aricept® (donepezil hydrochloride), the drug most commonly used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. "As we advance SB742457 into Phase 3 pivotal studies in 2015, we hope and expect that these clinical trials will support the approval of a new therapeutic option for patients."

	About Alzheimer's disease

	Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by problems with memory, thinking and behavior that eventually become severe enough to affect daily tasks. An estimated 5.2 million people in the United States are currently living with Alzheimer's disease. Alzheimer's disease is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States among those aged 65 and older, and was reported as an underlying cause of death for more than 83,000 Americans in 2010. The cost of caring for patients with Alzheimer's disease places a significant burden on health services.

About SB742457

	SB742457 is a novel and potent 5-HT6 receptor antagonist that is being developed as an oral treatment for subjects with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. SB742457 improves cognition in preclinical models, and preliminary preclinical data suggest a potential additive or synergistic effect when 5-HT6 antagonists are added to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, one of the two classes of drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Four Phase II studies of SB742457 in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease have been completed, including three monotherapy studies and one adjunctive therapy study in patients already taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Aricept® (donepezil hydrochloride). SB742457 was generally safe and well-tolerated in all Phase II studies. The results of these studies provide strong evidence that SB742457 holds promise for patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease.

About Roivant

	Roivant Neurosciences Ltd. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Roivant Sciences Ltd., a biopharmaceutical firm focused on the late-stage clinical development and commercialization of nonstrategic, deprioritized or under-resourced drug candidates. Backed by a global multi-strategy investment firm and an international specialty pharmaceutical company, Roivant Sciences uses its capital and in-house drug development expertise to move programs forward across a variety of pharmaceutical indications.

	Roivant Sciences selectively evaluates regional or global opportunities across all therapeutic areas, mechanisms of action and routes of administration, with a special emphasis on areas of high unmet medical need, including rare diseases. Roivant will consider all levels of innovativeness while seeking to identify drug candidates whose potential may be underappreciated.

	Additional information about Roivant is available at www.roivant.com.

Forward Looking Statements

	This press release includes forward-looking statements. Because such statements deal with future events, they are subject to various risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from Roivant's current expectations. Forward-looking statements are identified by words such as "anticipates," "projects," "expects," "plans," "intends," "believes," "may," "estimates," "targets," "hopes," and other similar expressions that indicate trends and future events.

	Factors that could cause Roivant's results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements include, without limitation, delays in receiving regulatory guidance for the development of SB742457, uncertainties inherent in the initiation of future clinical trials, availability of data from previous clinical trials, satisfactory quantities of clinical drug product, availability of patients who meet the clinical trial enrollment criteria, availability of sufficient funding for foreseeable and unforeseeable operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of SB742457. Roivant undertakes no obligation to revise or update forward-looking statements as a result of new information, since these statements may no longer be accurate or timely.
