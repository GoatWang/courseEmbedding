Silicon Valley/San Jose Business Journal







 



 






 



Rembrandt Venture Partners had a strategy to ease limited partners' minds and loosen their wallets for follow-on funds when they raised their first fund in 2004.
The first-time fund focused on early-stage deals but invested in a few late-stage deals hoping for quicker returns they could show to limited partners while they nursed the investments in startups.




 


And it seems to be working for the Menlo Park fund, although mixing investment strategies is a controversial trend within the industry.





"Primarily, we deployed some capital in later stage companies -- later being series B and C -- in order to get earlier liquidity," said Rembrandt General Partner Jerry Casilli. "The obvious basis under which we raised our capital, we were going to return capital early to investors."
Over the next few months, fund managers say, they will prove the strategy worked. One later-stage company they invested in -- semiconductor provider Cavium Networks -- went public this year and three weeks before the investor lockout period expires, the stock price has doubled. Another late-stage Rembrandt portfolio company has filed initial documents to go public and an earlier-stage startup -- a venture general partners initially funded with their own money before they closed the fund -- is also nearing an exit.
Now that Rembrandt said it will be able to return capital to limited partners, it will revert to its early stage strategy for its second fund, partners say, and the fund is hoping its early returns will be enough to court some large institutional investors.
It's a strategy more early stage venture capital firms -- especially those with first-time managers -- are turning to as they try and figure out how to court large institutional investors with deep pockets and tepid interest in investing in unknowns.
Limited partners who attended the October IBF Early Stage Venture Capital Investing Conference in San Francisco say they have mixed feelings about venture capitalists investing across rounds.
Chris Loh, a vice president with GIC Special Investments, said it can work for emerging technology investors.





 


"Doing a couple later stage investments and showing some liquidity, it gives some LPs a little bit of comfort," he said.
But Robert Hofeditz, a partner with San Francisco private equity adviser Probitas Partners, said he doesn't want to see early stage emerging managers moving too far from their particular skill sets.
Early stage investors following a company through later rounds is one thing, but early stage investors moving into growth equity or buyout rounds might be going too far, he said.
"There's an LP term called style drift," Hofeditz said. "We're taught at LP school it's a bad thing. I've seen people try to do things outside of their focus area and usually it doesn't turn out well. When I see a VC doing buyout deals, I don't think that's going to turn out too well. Many early stage funds do later stage deals. But generally when I see someone really doing something outside of their specific area, they're getting lucky if it works out but most of the time it does not work out."
Limited partners say they look for track record, unique operational experience, history with partners and other factors in determining whether or not to put money into first-time, or emerging, funds.
Many say they won't invest in new firms that don't have the track record of big returns and prefer to stick with top-tier firms with long histories of investment success.
