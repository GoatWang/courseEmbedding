It is important to note that PlushCare is not a drug fulfillment warehouse. In the event a doctor does prescribe medication, he/she will limit the supply based on state regulations. Patients with chronic illnesses should visit their primary care physicians or other specialists for extended care. PlushCare doctors do not issue prescriptions for substances controlled by the DEA, non-therapeutic, and/or certain other drugs which may be harmful because of their potential for abuse. These include, but are not limited to, antidepressant drugs such as Cymbalta, Prozac and Zoloft which are drugs that are harmful due to their potential for abuse. Also, non-therapeutic drugs such as Viagra and Cialis are not prescribed by PlushCare doctors. Prescriptions are not available for international consults.

    My daughter was sick with high fever and the last thing I wanted to do was to sit in her doctors Sick side of the office - Plushcare doctors spend the time to really understand your situation and give great advice. This is the 3rd time I have used them for my family - they take insurance, call in your prescriptions - amazing doctors - and you can stay on your home in your pajamas!
  



Thank you, Plushcare!

    I recently had a painful infection and my family doctor could not see me until the next day.  I was sitting there in pain when I remembered Plushcare!  In 15 minutes I was on the phone with Dr Chideya and in another 45 minutes I had the antibiotics I needed. Thank you so much!

    Used this app a few times, so worth it.  I would have to wait until my bladder infection becomes a kidney infection before I could get in to my Kaiser doctor, this way I can take care of it before it becomes serious, 😊 thank you.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 12/11/2014
            

                BBB has determined that Plushcare, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB:

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
