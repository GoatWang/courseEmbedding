			Robert J. Coury is the Chairman of Mylan N.V. Under his visionary leadership, Mylan has transformed from the third largest generics pharmaceutical company in the U.S. into one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world in terms of revenue, earning spots in both the S&P 500 and, prior to the Company's reincorporation outside of the U.S. in 2015, the Fortune 500. Mr. Coury was first elected to the Mylan Board in February 2002, having served since 1995 as a strategic advisor to the Company. He became the Mylan Board's Vice Chairman shortly after his election and served as CEO from September 2002 until January 2012, and as Executive Chairman from 2012 until he became Chairman as a director who is not an employee of the Company or Mylan Inc. (a "Non-Employee Director", with all such directors being the "Non-Employee Directors") in June 2016.   Since 2007, Mr. Coury has led the Company through a series of transactions totaling approximately $25 billion, which transformed Mylan into a global powerhouse within the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, with a global workforce of over 35,000 and products sold in more than 165 countries. In 2007, Mylan purchased India-based Matrix Laboratories Limited, a major producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, and the generics and specialty pharmaceuticals business of Europe-based Merck KGaA. Subsequent acquisitions under Mr. Coury's leadership further expanded the Company into new therapeutic categories and greatly enhanced its geographic and commercial footprint. In 2010, Mylan acquired Bioniche Pharma, a global injectables business in Ireland; in 2013, Mylan acquired India-based Agila Specialties, a global injectables company; and in 2015, Mylan acquired the EPD Business and Famy Care Ltd.'s women's healthcare businesses. Most recently, Mylan acquired Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company that sells both prescription and over-the-counter products and the non-sterile, topicals-focused business of Renaissance Acquisition Holdings, LLC.   During this period of expansion, the Company built an unmatched, high quality foundation for the future supporting Mylan's mission of providing the world's 7 billion people with access to high quality medicine, and benefiting patients, customers, investors, and other stakeholders. Before becoming Executive Chairman in 2012, Mr. Coury also executed a successful executive leadership transition after cultivating and developing a powerful leadership team. Grooming executive talent from within and recruiting dynamic leaders from outside the Company were both key components of the Company's past, current, and future growth strategies.   Prior to joining Mylan, Mr. Coury was the principal of Coury Consulting, a boutique business advisory firm he formed in 1989, and The Coury Financial Group, a successful financial and estate planning firm, which he founded in 1984.   Mr. Coury is also the founder and president of the Robert J. Coury Family Foundation, which is a charitable organization formed to help support his philanthropic efforts and his mission of giving back. He has served as a member of the University of Southern California President's Leadership Council since 2014.   Mr. Coury's qualifications to serve on the Mylan Board include, among others, his prior business experience, his in-depth knowledge of the industry, the Company, its businesses, and management, and his leadership experience as the Company's CEO, as well as his judgment, strategic vision, and service and leadership as Vice Chairman and then Chairman of the Mylan Board for more than ten years - the most transformational and successful time in the Company's history.

Mylan’s Chairman Was Paid $97.6 Million

By Dave Bloom -   2017/05/03 




It was a year when the company’s CEO was called to testify before Congress to defend the pricing of its EpiPen. It was a year when the company’s stock price plummeted 29%. It was a year when the company’s share of the auto-injector market fell 25%.
Yet 2016 was a year when Mylan’s chairman, Robert J Coury, received over $97 million in compensation, including a $20 million bonus and over $22 million in “transition payments” for stepping down as an officer of the company.
Last year, Mylan’s CEO, Heather Bresch, was paid $13.8 million, down 27% from the year before.
The compensation figures were disclosed Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The company is currently the subject of a class-action lawsuit by consumers alleging Mylan engaged in racketeering when it colluded with pharmacy benefit managers to keep the price of EpiPen high.
Last week, Sanofi filed suit against the Mylan alleging the company illegally blocked introduction of Auvi-Q, Sanofi’s competitor to the EpiPen.

Heather Bresch will face the proverbial lash from Congress on Wednesday over the escalating cost of Mylan NV's EpiPen. Her boss won't.Robert J. Coury acquired the rights to sell the emergency allergy antidote in 2007 when he was Mylan's chief executive officer. At the time, the EpiPen cost about $50 a shot. When Coury stepped down as CEO and became the company's executive chairman in 2011, the price was about $90, according to SSR Health. Now, it's sold in a two-pack for $600 and, thanks to federal legislation, it's required in many schools.Though Coury's role has evolved — he hasn't been CEO for five years and in June had his title changed to chairman from executive chairman — he still oversees company strategy, said Nina Devlin, a Mylan spokeswoman.
"He's probably more involved than most CEOs, given his history,'' said Ronny Gal, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. "He's always been a kind of hands-on kind of guy."It's probably best for Mylan that its current CEO, rather than Coury, is the company's public face on Capitol Hill. Bresch, 47, the daughter of Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia, knows the corridors of power.Coury, on the other hand, loves to agitate. At a 2013 health-care conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, he expressed his weariness with hypothetical questions by invoking an older woman's hypothetical private parts. "I get a little tired of the 'if,' '' he said. "If your aunt had balls, she'd be your uncle, right?"Through Devlin, Coury declined to be interviewed. He has yet to comment publicly on the controversy surrounding EpiPen, which administers $1 of epinephrine and accounts for 40 percent of Mylan's profit._________Coury, 55, piloted Mylan's growth from a regional drug manufacturer to today's global generics behemoth with $9.4 billion in sales last year. As Mylan CEO, he oversaw nine acquisitions and another 11 after becoming executive chairman. Coury orchestrated the 2015 acquisition of Abbott Laboratories' generics business, which allowed Mylan to move its corporate address to the Netherlands to reduce its tax rate. When President Barack Obama questioned so-called inversions by U.S. companies, Coury fired back with a defense in a USA Today op-ed."All of our major competitors were either founded outside of the U.S. or have recently inverted, and benefit from more attractive tax structures," Coury wrote. "This significant competitive disadvantage could put our corporation, and all of our high-quality U.S. jobs, at risk."Coury is known for clashing with investors and competing executives, most notably during merger-and-acquisition battles with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries and Perrigo."He'll drop an f-bomb to a female audience in a heartbeat,'' former Mylan executive Richard Moldin said in an interview. "He'll rant and rave."Moldin said Coury was able to rally shareholders but conceded the CEO's plain-spokenness grew too frustrating, and said he quit in 2001 after the two clashed. "Robert is a very self-focused individual,'' Moldin said. "He's probably the main reason I left the company."
To appease critics of the EpiPen, Mylan has announced plans for a generic alternative and promised to increase rebates. The company also sent Bresch on a charm offensive. She's familiar to many lawmakers, and it's unclear how intense a grilling she'll receive when she testifies to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee."There is justified outrage from families and schools across the country struggling to afford the high cost of EpiPens," committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, and ranking member Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, said in a joint statement released last week._________Coury grew up in a crowded household in the blue-collar Brookline neighborhood of Pittsburgh, earning an engineering degree from the University of Pittsburgh in 1984. He sold insurance, did estate planning and opened his own consulting firm. In the mid-90s, connections on Mylan's board helped earn him a contract to improve company benefits. He became a financial adviser to the board and senior management. In 2002, he was named CEO.Three years later came his first public spat when billionaire investor Carl Icahn argued that Coury's $4 billion offer for King Pharmaceuticals was too high. Coury was forced to abandon the takeover and instead found himself fending off Icahn's unsolicited $5.4 billion bid for Mylan. King was later acquired by Pfizer, whose Meridian Medical Technologies subsidies makes the EpiPen in St. Louis County. Icahn didn't respond to requests for comment.
Mylan's 280,000-square-foot operations hub in Canonsburg, about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, is named the Robert J. Coury Global Center. Last year, Coury received $62.4 million in take-home pay, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. And he hasn't been shy about availing himself of the perks that come with the success of a company whose stock has nearly tripled since he took over in 2002. His contract allows him to use the company's jets for personal travel, and he logged $2 million in aviation expenses from 2010 to 2013. Some flights were used to shuttle to and from performances of his son, Tino, 28, whose 2010 electro-pop single, "Diary," reached No. 11 on Billboard's Dance Club chart, the Wall Street Journal reported."Mylan's contracts with Mr. Coury for more than a decade have authorized his use of the corporate aircraft for both business and personal reasons," said Devlin, the spokeswoman._________In 2007, Mylan acquired the exclusive right to distribute the EpiPen from Merck KGaA. After Bresch became CEO, it ramped up marketing, expanded its sales force by 40 percent and lobbied Congress so that school districts across the country were required to stock EpiPens. It also partnered with the Clinton Global Initiative by promising to cut prices of its HIV/AIDS treatment in developing countries. Coury stood on stage with former President Bill Clinton during the announcement. Hillary Clinton has been critical of EpiPen pricing.After acquiring EpiPen, when Coury was CEO Mylan raise the product's price by 10 percent on three occasions over a 15-month period. By 2011, the EpiPen was being sold only as a two-pack and its market share soared to 98 percent. Coury brushed off pricing concerns at a conference in 2012, telling analysts the high cost enabled the company to expand access.This year, members of Congress have been so outraged by the price increases that they're hauling Bresch into a hearing. David Maris, an analyst for Wells Fargo Securities, said he was surprised the congressional panel hasn't also asked Coury to testify. Yet even Coury's critics contend that the drugmaker isn't doing anything extraordinary."Mylan is just trying to take advantage of a situation that's purely a marketplace play," said Moldin, the former company executive. "We work in a capitalistic society. If there's an opportunity, great, but I don't think they've done anything with the EpiPen that warrants the amount of attention they're getting."With assistance from Cynthia Koons.

Heather Bresch











Chief Executive Officer 
Mylan


Executive Director





Committee Membership:
Science and Technology






                                Heather Bresch is chief executive officer of Mylan, one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies. She also serves on the company’s board of directors. As CEO, she is responsible for a workforce of more than 35,000, a powerful global research and development platform, a manufacturing footprint comprising more than 50 facilities, and a portfolio of more than 7,500 generic and branded pharmaceuticals sold in more than 165 countries and territories. 
Career at Mylan
Throughout her 25-year career with Mylan, Bresch, who started with the company as a data-entry clerk, has held roles of increasing responsibility in more than 15 functional areas. Prior to becoming CEO, Bresch served as Mylan’s president, where she was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company. Before that, she served as Mylan’s chief operating officer and chief integration officer, leading the successful integration of two international acquisitions – Matrix Laboratories and Merck KGaA’s generics business – which more than doubled the size of the company and transformed Mylan from a purely U.S. company to a global one. 
Leading the Next Chapter of Mylan’s Growth and Performance
As CEO, Bresch is leading the next chapter of Mylan’s growth and performance, and further differentiating the company from its competitors by transforming it from a pharmaceutical company into a healthcare company. This strategy includes plans to double the size of Mylan’s product portfolio, manufacturing capacity and adjusted earnings between 2012 and 2018, enhance its technologies and capabilities, expand its reach across geographies and commercial channels, and develop new services that further enhance Mylan’s relationship with customers and patients. 
In executing on this strategy and continuing to satisfy unmet needs, Mylan is developing and launching hundreds of new generic, specialty and over-the-counter products annually. Additionally, Mylan has continued to serve as a leading consolidator in the industry, with recent transactions including Abbott’s non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business and Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company that sells both prescription and over-the-counter products. Mylan also continues to focus on complex and difficult-to-manufacture products and is developing portfolios of complex products including biosimilars, insulin analog and respiratory products. 
To achieve Mylan’s goals, Bresch emphasizes a collaborative company culture focused on leading, learning, teaching and performing to inspire innovation and help set new standards in healthcare.
Providing Passionate Global Leadership on Key Issues
Mylan’s mission is to provide the world’s 7 billion people access to high quality medicine and to “do good while doing well.” Over the course of her career at the company, Bresch has been a champion of initiatives and policy changes aimed at removing barriers that hinder access. 
Among her policy priorities is ensuring that everyone living with HIV/AIDS has access to high quality, affordable drugs and advocating for treatment soon after diagnosis to produce better health outcomes, reduce HIV transmission and create long-term cost savings. Approximately 50% percent of patients being treated for HIV/AIDS in the developing world today rely on a Mylan product.
Bresch also has been a leading advocate for global competitiveness and global quality standards. For instance, driven by Mylan’s unmatched commitment to quality, Bresch was instrumental in the development of the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) which aims to hold all drugs sold in the U.S. to one quality standard. In addition, she advocated for changes to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 to arm the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the resources and authority needed to regularly inspect U.S. and foreign plants at the same rate. Both of these provisions were included in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), landmark legislation that was signed into law in July 2012.
Moreover, Bresch is actively advocating for the implementation of a viable abbreviated approval pathway for safe and effective generic versions of biologic drugs, which will provide patients with access to lower-cost versions of these life-saving products. In addition, Bresch is passionate about increasing awareness of and preparedness for life-threatening allergic reactions, called anaphylaxis, and has advocated for measures that provide people immediate access to Epinephrine auto-injectors, as the drug is considered the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. 
Earlier in her career, Bresch played a vital role in the passage of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, a congressional revision to the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, which helped to ensure consumer access to affordable pharmaceuticals. 
Bresch served as chair of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association’s board of directors in 2016, 2005, and 2004, and as vice chair in 2003 and 2006. She is a frequent speaker on issues such as affordable healthcare and global competitiveness, and has testified before the U.S. Congress and FDA on issues related to access to medicine. Heather is the pharmaceutical industry’s first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company, and has been named by Fortune magazine as one of its “50 Most Powerful Women.”
Bresch earned her undergraduate degree from West Virginia University.

Mylan
 
Non-Executive Director
                                        




Committee Membership:
Executive—Chair






Robert J. Coury is the Chairman of Mylan N.V.  Under his visionary leadership, Mylan has transformed from the third largest generics pharmaceutical company in the U.S. into one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, earning spots in both the S&P 500 and, prior to the company’s reincorporation outside of the U.S. in 2015, the Fortune 500. 
 
Mr. Coury was first elected to Mylan’s board of directors in February 2002, having served since 1995 as a strategic advisor to the company.  He became the board’s vice chairman shortly after his election and served as CEO from September 2002 until January 2012, and as executive chairman from 2012 until he became chairman in June 2016.

Since 2007, Mr. Coury has led the company through a series of transactions totaling more than $25 billion, which transformed Mylan into a global powerhouse within the highly competitive pharmaceutical industry, with more than 35,000 employees and products sold in over 165 countries.  
 
In 2007, Mylan purchased India-based Matrix Laboratories, a major producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, and the generics business of Europe-based Merck KGaA.  Subsequent acquisitions under Mr. Coury’s leadership further expanded the company into new therapeutic categories and greatly enhanced its geographic and commercial footprint.  In 2010, Mylan acquired Bioniche Pharma, a global injectables business in Ireland; in 2012, Mylan acquired India-based Agila Specialties, a global injectables company; and in 2015, Mylan acquired Abbott Laboratories’ non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business, and Famy Care’s women’s healthcare businesses.  Most recently, Mylan acquired Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company that sells both prescription and over-the-counter products.   
 
During this period of expansion, the company built an unmatched, high quality foundation for the future supporting Mylan’s mission of providing the world’s 7 billion people with access to high quality medicine, and benefiting patients, customers, investors, and other stakeholders. 
 
Before becoming executive chairman in 2012, Mr. Coury also executed a successful executive leadership transition after cultivating and developing a powerful leadership team.  Grooming executive talent from within and recruiting dynamic leaders from outside the company were both key components of the company’s past, current and future growth strategies. 
 
Prior to joining Mylan, Mr. Coury was the principal of Coury Consulting, a boutique business advisory firm he formed in 1989, and The Coury Financial Group, a successful financial and estate planning firm, which he founded in 1984.

Rajiv Malik











President
Mylan


Executive Director





Committee Membership:
Science and Technology






Rajiv Malik is president of Mylan and also serves on the company’s board of directors. He leads all global commercial and operational activities for the company, including sales and marketing in more than 165 countries and territories and operations that manage a portfolio of more than 7,500 marketed  products, a pipeline of approximately 1,200 products and 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. Mylan has a manufacturing capacity of more than 80 billion doses annually with capabilities that include oral solid doses, injectables, complex products including respiratory and biologics, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The functions managing these diverse capabilities include quality, R&D, regulatory, medical affairs, manufacturing, supply chain and sourcing. 

Malik is also responsible for the commercial and operational execution of Mylan’s growth areas, including the company’s antiretroviral (ARV)/infectious disease, biologics, dermatology, injectables, insulin analog, over-the-counter and respiratory platforms. Malik oversees business development, integration of acquired businesses and information technology with a focus on expanding and enhancing Mylan’s portfolio, product technologies and commercial capabilities.  

Malik actively promotes the importance and necessity of quality within the company and industry. With a patient-first mentality and a personal philosophy that quality is everyone’s responsibility, Malik has enhanced a long-standing commitment to and obsession with high quality standards that permeate Mylan’s unconventional corporate culture and workforce of about 35,000.  

Prior to his current role as president, Malik held other leadership positions at Mylan since January 2007, which is when Mylan acquired a controlling stake in Matrix Laboratories Limited (now Mylan Laboratories Limited), one of the world's largest suppliers of API and producers of generic finished dose ARVs used to treat HIV/AIDS, primarily for developing markets. Malik was Matrix’s CEO, and during his tenure there, he established the company as a key ARV supplier in developing markets through relationships with Gilead, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. After Mylan acquired Matrix, Malik focused on novel ARV finished doses, which today form the backbone of Mylan’s leading ARV franchise.  

Among early contributions at Mylan, Malik partnered with current CEO Heather Bresch to lead integration efforts among Mylan, Matrix and the generics business of Merck KGaA, another 2007 acquisition that catapulted Mylan onto the global stage. Simultaneously, Malik led the creation of a globalized operating platform with a supply chain and manufacturing network that could support the size and complexity of serving all markets around the world. His work also focused on significantly expanding and diversifying the company’s global product portfolio, pipeline and manufacturing footprint. Malik continued to play a key role and further expand the company’s operating footprint through the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma and Agila Specialties, two of the world’s most preeminent makers of injectables products. Most recently, Malik played a pivotal role to acquire and close on the acquisition of Abbott’s Established Products business in non-U.S. developed markets, including Europe, Australia, Japan and Canada.  Malik also played a pivotal role in the acquisitions and integrations of Renaissance and Meda which further diversified Mylan’s commercial and operations platform in dermatology and OTC.

Malik has approximately 30 years of experience in the global pharmaceutical industry. Prior to joining Matrix in 2005, Malik was head of Global Development and Regulatory at Sandoz. He started in R&D at Ranbaxy Laboratories, rising to head of Generics R&D. Malik earned his master's degree in pharmaceutical technology from Punjab University, India, and has more than 60 process patents to his credit.

Heather Bresch











Chief Executive Officer 
Mylan


Executive Director







                                Heather Bresch is chief executive officer of Mylan, one of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies. She also serves on the company’s board of directors. As CEO, she is responsible for a workforce of more than 35,000, a powerful global research and development platform, a manufacturing footprint comprising more than 50 facilities, and a portfolio of more than 7,500 generic and branded pharmaceuticals sold in more than 165 countries and territories. 
Career at Mylan
Throughout her 25-year career with Mylan, Bresch, who started with the company as a data-entry clerk, has held roles of increasing responsibility in more than 15 functional areas. Prior to becoming CEO, Bresch served as Mylan’s president, where she was responsible for the day-to-day operations of the company. Before that, she served as Mylan’s chief operating officer and chief integration officer, leading the successful integration of two international acquisitions – Matrix Laboratories and Merck KGaA’s generics business – which more than doubled the size of the company and transformed Mylan from a purely U.S. company to a global one. 
Leading the Next Chapter of Mylan’s Growth and Performance
As CEO, Bresch is leading the next chapter of Mylan’s growth and performance, and further differentiating the company from its competitors by transforming it from a pharmaceutical company into a healthcare company. This strategy includes plans to double the size of Mylan’s product portfolio, manufacturing capacity and adjusted earnings between 2012 and 2018, enhance its technologies and capabilities, expand its reach across geographies and commercial channels, and develop new services that further enhance Mylan’s relationship with customers and patients. 
In executing on this strategy and continuing to satisfy unmet needs, Mylan is developing and launching hundreds of new generic, specialty and over-the-counter products annually. Additionally, Mylan has continued to serve as a leading consolidator in the industry, with recent transactions including Abbott’s non-U.S. developed markets specialty and branded generics business and Meda, a leading international specialty pharmaceutical company that sells both prescription and over-the-counter products. Mylan also continues to focus on complex and difficult-to-manufacture products and is developing portfolios of complex products including biosimilars, insulin analog and respiratory products. 
To achieve Mylan’s goals, Bresch emphasizes a collaborative company culture focused on leading, learning, teaching and performing to inspire innovation and help set new standards in healthcare.
Providing Passionate Global Leadership on Key Issues
Mylan’s mission is to provide the world’s 7 billion people access to high quality medicine and to “do good while doing well.” Over the course of her career at the company, Bresch has been a champion of initiatives and policy changes aimed at removing barriers that hinder access. 
Among her policy priorities is ensuring that everyone living with HIV/AIDS has access to high quality, affordable drugs and advocating for treatment soon after diagnosis to produce better health outcomes, reduce HIV transmission and create long-term cost savings. Approximately 50% percent of patients being treated for HIV/AIDS in the developing world today rely on a Mylan product.
Bresch also has been a leading advocate for global competitiveness and global quality standards. For instance, driven by Mylan’s unmatched commitment to quality, Bresch was instrumental in the development of the Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) which aims to hold all drugs sold in the U.S. to one quality standard. In addition, she advocated for changes to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938 to arm the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the resources and authority needed to regularly inspect U.S. and foreign plants at the same rate. Both of these provisions were included in the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA), landmark legislation that was signed into law in July 2012.
Moreover, Bresch is actively advocating for the implementation of a viable abbreviated approval pathway for safe and effective generic versions of biologic drugs, which will provide patients with access to lower-cost versions of these life-saving products. In addition, Bresch is passionate about increasing awareness of and preparedness for life-threatening allergic reactions, called anaphylaxis, and has advocated for measures that provide people immediate access to Epinephrine auto-injectors, as the drug is considered the first-line treatment for anaphylaxis. 
Earlier in her career, Bresch played a vital role in the passage of the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act, a congressional revision to the Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, which helped to ensure consumer access to affordable pharmaceuticals. 
Bresch served as chair of the Generic Pharmaceutical Association’s board of directors in 2016, 2005, and 2004, and as vice chair in 2003 and 2006. She is a frequent speaker on issues such as affordable healthcare and global competitiveness, and has testified before the U.S. Congress and FDA on issues related to access to medicine. Heather is the pharmaceutical industry’s first female CEO of a Fortune 500 company, and has been named by Fortune magazine as one of its “50 Most Powerful Women.”
Bresch earned her undergraduate degree from West Virginia University.
















Rajiv Malik











President
Mylan


Executive Director







Rajiv Malik is president of Mylan and also serves on the company’s board of directors. He leads all global commercial and operational activities for the company, including sales and marketing in more than 165 countries and territories and operations that manage a portfolio of more than 7,500 marketed  products, a pipeline of approximately 1,200 products and 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. Mylan has a manufacturing capacity of more than 80 billion doses annually with capabilities that include oral solid doses, injectables, complex products including respiratory and biologics, and active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The functions managing these diverse capabilities include quality, R&D, regulatory, medical affairs, manufacturing, supply chain and sourcing. 

Malik is also responsible for the commercial and operational execution of Mylan’s growth areas, including the company’s antiretroviral (ARV)/infectious disease, biologics, dermatology, injectables, insulin analog, over-the-counter and respiratory platforms. Malik oversees business development, integration of acquired businesses and information technology with a focus on expanding and enhancing Mylan’s portfolio, product technologies and commercial capabilities.  

Malik actively promotes the importance and necessity of quality within the company and industry. With a patient-first mentality and a personal philosophy that quality is everyone’s responsibility, Malik has enhanced a long-standing commitment to and obsession with high quality standards that permeate Mylan’s unconventional corporate culture and workforce of about 35,000.  

Prior to his current role as president, Malik held other leadership positions at Mylan since January 2007, which is when Mylan acquired a controlling stake in Matrix Laboratories Limited (now Mylan Laboratories Limited), one of the world's largest suppliers of API and producers of generic finished dose ARVs used to treat HIV/AIDS, primarily for developing markets. Malik was Matrix’s CEO, and during his tenure there, he established the company as a key ARV supplier in developing markets through relationships with Gilead, the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. After Mylan acquired Matrix, Malik focused on novel ARV finished doses, which today form the backbone of Mylan’s leading ARV franchise.  

Among early contributions at Mylan, Malik partnered with current CEO Heather Bresch to lead integration efforts among Mylan, Matrix and the generics business of Merck KGaA, another 2007 acquisition that catapulted Mylan onto the global stage. Simultaneously, Malik led the creation of a globalized operating platform with a supply chain and manufacturing network that could support the size and complexity of serving all markets around the world. His work also focused on significantly expanding and diversifying the company’s global product portfolio, pipeline and manufacturing footprint. Malik continued to play a key role and further expand the company’s operating footprint through the acquisition of Bioniche Pharma and Agila Specialties, two of the world’s most preeminent makers of injectables products. Most recently, Malik played a pivotal role to acquire and close on the acquisition of Abbott’s Established Products business in non-U.S. developed markets, including Europe, Australia, Japan and Canada.  Malik also played a pivotal role in the acquisitions and integrations of Renaissance and Meda which further diversified Mylan’s commercial and operations platform in dermatology and OTC.

Malik has approximately 30 years of experience in the global pharmaceutical industry. Prior to joining Matrix in 2005, Malik was head of Global Development and Regulatory at Sandoz. He started in R&D at Ranbaxy Laboratories, rising to head of Generics R&D. Malik earned his master's degree in pharmaceutical technology from Punjab University, India, and has more than 60 process patents to his credit.

Career[edit]
Tino Coury is a Pittsburgh born, Los Angeles-based singer, songwriter and producer and is signed to his father, Robert J. Coury's record label Eleventh Records, [1] distributed through Universal’s Fontana.
Since the May 2010 release of his single "Diary" which charted at over fifty Top 40 and Rhythmic radio stations, and that also reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. Tino Coury has been "blowing up the pop scene," noted Usmagazine.com.[2] The music video was directed by Roman White.
In 2012 Tino Coury released his first full length album titled This One's For. Collaborations on the album included Da Internz, Sham & Motesart, Kadis & Sean and Mansur and songwriters Redd Stylez, Jackie Boyz, Lil Eddie, and Marlin "Hookman" Bonds.
Personal life[edit]
Tino is the son of Robert J. Coury, Executive Chairman and former CEO of Mylan Labs.[3] In December 2012, Tino was implicated in his father's jet-setting on Mylan Labs' dime. Tino's father was allowed personal use of the company jet per his employment agreement. Robert Coury, while he was CEO of Mylan, also had the side business of managing the fledgling music career of his son. Mark Maremont, reporting for the Wall Street Journal, matched up the larger of the company's two planes' landing with Tino's concert dates. The dates and times of the landing suggested that Robert Coury was not only attending his son's performances, but was also ferrying Tino between concert venues.[4][5]

Career[edit]
Tino Coury is a Pittsburgh born, Los Angeles-based singer, songwriter and producer and is signed to his father, Robert J. Coury's record label Eleventh Records, [1] distributed through Universal’s Fontana.
Since the May 2010 release of his single "Diary" which charted at over fifty Top 40 and Rhythmic radio stations, and that also reached number 11 on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs. Tino Coury has been "blowing up the pop scene," noted Usmagazine.com.[2] The music video was directed by Roman White.
In 2012 Tino Coury released his first full length album titled This One's For. Collaborations on the album included Da Internz, Sham & Motesart, Kadis & Sean and Mansur and songwriters Redd Stylez, Jackie Boyz, Lil Eddie, and Marlin "Hookman" Bonds.
Personal life[edit]
Tino is the son of Robert J. Coury, Executive Chairman and former CEO of Mylan Labs.[3] In December 2012, Tino was implicated in his father's jet-setting on Mylan Labs' dime. Tino's father was allowed personal use of the company jet per his employment agreement. Robert Coury, while he was CEO of Mylan, also had the side business of managing the fledgling music career of his son. Mark Maremont, reporting for the Wall Street Journal, matched up the larger of the company's two planes' landing with Tino's concert dates. The dates and times of the landing suggested that Robert Coury was not only attending his son's performances, but was also ferrying Tino between concert venues.[4][5]
