This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Savannah Business Journal Staff Report
March 13, 2015 - Citi Trends, Inc. (NASDAQ: CTRN) headquartered in Savannah today announced that Ed Anderson is retiring as CEO, effective March 21, 2015.  Jason Mazzola, currently Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer, will become President and Chief Executive Officer effective March 22, 2015 and has been appointed to the Board of Directors, effective immediately. 
Additionally, Bruce Smith, the Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will also become its Chief Operating Officer.
Mr. Anderson will continue as an employee of the Company, serving as Executive Chairman of the Board, in order to provide for an orderly transition of the Chief Executive Officer role. He will serve as advisor and counselor to Mr. Mazzola and will continue to serve as Chairman of the Company’s Real Estate Committee. 
Mr. Anderson will also provide broad oversight of the Company’s operations for the Board and Mr. Mazzola will report directly to him, according to the company. 
“When I came back to the Company at the beginning of 2012, my job was to lead a turnaround of the Company. That work is largely complete as the Company just reported a very successful 2014 and again is in strong financial condition. The successful turnaround of Citi Trends could not have been done without Jason Mazzola. He is an extraordinarily skilled merchant, leader and executive. He has earned this promotion and he will do well,” said Anderson in making the announcement. 
“Another key to our turnaround efforts has been the contribution of Bruce Smith, our CFO. Bruce has proven to be not only an outstanding CFO, but a well-respected leader. Jason and Bruce have the skills to lead our company and take it to new heights of success. The Company’s future is in great hands.”
About Citi Trends
Citi Trends, Inc. is a value-priced retailer of urban fashion apparel and accessories, and now operates 513 stores  in 29 states.
