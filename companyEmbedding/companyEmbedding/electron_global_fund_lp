Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The investment objective is to achieve absolute returns through long and short investments primarily in publicly traded equity securities in the global utility sector (including, but not limited to, electric, gas and water utilities and independent power companies), utility service and fuel providers, utility equipment manufacturers (including, but not limited to, renewable and energy technology companies) and related sectors. The investment manager believes that the fund's investment objective can be achieved by fundamental analysis and risk management in order to source attractive investment opportunities in the global utility sector. Through bottom-up fundamental analysis, the investment manager attempts to uncover both undervalued and overvalued securities and event-driven special situations. The investment manager aims to position the fund's portfolio accordingly to capitalize on such analysis. In addition, this bottom-up analysis benefits from a top-down analysis of both industry variables (e.g., market structure changes, legislative and regulatory changes, commodity prices, etc.) and macroeconomic variables (e.g., interest rates, foreign exchange rates, country risks, etc.). The investment manager anticipates using amounts of leverage (which will vary from time to time) in order to maximize the fund's returns. The investment manager also seeks to diversify the fund's holdings, although it anticipates maintaining a substantial portion of the fund's holdings in utilities-related issuers.
