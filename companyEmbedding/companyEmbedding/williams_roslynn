Meet Roslynn Williams of Roslynn’s Healing Touch

Today we’d like to introduce you to Roslynn Williams.
Thanks for sharing your story with us Roslynn. So, let’s start at the beginning and we can move on from there.
At the age of 10 or 11, I would go with my aunt and volunteer with Convoy of Hope. She had a foot ministry and we would clean and massage the feet of the homeless. I remember one year she had some of her students from Ogle come. This homeless man came to our tent and no one wanted to touch him. My aunt grabbed all her supplies and treated him like royalty. When he got up the joy in his eyes brought me to tears. I knew then at that very moment I wanted to help people with massage.
But life happens…I got pregnant, married, and then divorced 3 years later. The uncertainty of making a living in massage therapy was too great when being a single parent. I went to college for Criminal Justice instead. I played it safe to provide for my daughter.
In 2014, my daughter Kassandra started her senior year, I was just released from the City of Fort Worth due to car accident and FMLA running out. I was sitting at a friend’s house and a commercial came on for Texas Center for Massage Therapy. I’ve seen this commercial a thousand times but never heard they offered financial aid until that day. I called and scheduled a tour. I had no job nor money but I started classes a week later anyway. Found a fulltime job, left my house at 5:30am and returned after 11pm Monday thru Thursday. A year later Kassandra graduates high school and I graduate massage school. The BEST decision of my life!
We’re always bombarded by how great it is to pursue your passion, etc. – but we’ve spoken with enough people to know that it’s not always easy. Overall, would you say things have been easy for you?
It hasn’t been all sunshine and rainbows…actually still waiting for those days. Upon graduating, I went all in as an entrepreneur. I’ve lost everything to follow my purpose…my home, car, belongings, slept in my car on occasions, living with my daughter and her boyfriend. I’m looking for a building now and it’s hard without working capital. Building solid clientele has been challenging. But when asked would I change anything…NO, I absolutely love what I do and will surrender everything to do it. Things are starting to look up and my business is getting noticed.
So, as you know, we’re impressed with Roslynn’s Healing Touch – tell our readers more, for example what you’re most proud of as a company and what sets you apart from others.
Roslynn’s Healing Touch is a mobile massage company that specializes in burn scars (burn survivors), PTSD, rape survivors, sciatica, chronic pain/injury and energy work. I’m known for my calming demeanor and ability to bring peace.
I am most proud to be a burn survivor and rape survivor therapist!
What sets me apart I think is every session scheduled does not have preconceived plan of therapy. Touching people is very important and meant to be taken seriously. My spirit and wellbeing has to be in check before anyone can get on my table, my sessions are prayed over, and I follow what your body tells me. No session is the same EVER.
So, what’s next? Any big plans?
Roslynn’s Healing Touch is planning for a location by end of May. I want to hold classes for burn survivors family members that teaches them how to help relieve the pain and increase flexibility of their loved one. I want to hold spa parties, couple’s classes, and all natural product line to name a few.
Pricing:

60 minute $125
90 minute $150
120 minute $200

I met Roslynn when she participated in the leadership development training project I coordinate, Leaders in Policy Advocacy. I liked her immediately. She was warm and funny and genuine. She contributed a great deal to the class and was a terrific recruiter of new applicants for the project. I am so pleased her graduation from the training is mentioned in her obituary. She completed the class despite facing personal challenges over the course of the 6 month training.  I can't believe she is gone. My condolences to her family and everyone else who loved her.
