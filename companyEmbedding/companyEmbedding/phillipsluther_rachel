                Kelly Williams, Kelly Williams Photography            






As the newly-hired chief marketing officer of Jamba Juice (Nasdaq: JMBA), Rachel Phillips-Luther will lead the company’s brand marketing team and oversee new product innovation.
Phillips-Luther joined Jamba, which will relocate from Emeryville, California, to Frisco later this year, on Aug. 9. She previously held the same position with Plano-based restaurant chain Zoës Kitchen (NYSE: ZOES), where she contributed to the company’s initial public offering and led a brand repositioning.

She said she made the leap to the juice and smoothie brand to continue working with healthy hospitality companies.
“Hospitality has been my focus and there’s a lot of companies in that vertical, but not many are focusing on food and beverage with healthy living,” Phillips-Luther said. “Jamba has the same feel as Zoës, focusing on healthful living. So I felt it embodied my mission as a marketer.”
The Dallas Business Journal broke in May the news that Jamba Juice is relocating its headquarters to Frisco’s Hall Office Park, where it will occupy roughly 25,000 square feet, including a 6,000-square-foot test kitchen and retail store front. The move will also bring more than 100 corporate jobs to North Texas.
Phillips-Luther told the DBJ more about her new role and how she will be a part of the company’s move.
What is your first task as you start in this role?
Any time I walk into a new opportunity, the first thing I aim to do is understand the current state of the brand and partnerships that exist. Today, I’m putting my arms around our franchise partnerships and understanding the brand from the inside out.
The brand is built by the teams that deliver the experience, so I’ll be working with the team in California and visiting stores over the next few weeks so I can assess how I can help amplify what makes Jamba Juice special.
How is the role different from your previous position with Zoes?
In many ways, the role is parallel. At Zoës I had the opportunity to build (the brand) from the ground up. At Jamba, that opportunity presented itself as Jamba moves from California and rebuilds a team.

The most specific difference is that at Zoës, we were primarily company-owned. At Jamba, I’ll be working more with franchise partners. And, at Zoës, I didn’t have primary responsibility over R&D and menu innovation.




 


What strategies do you have to help Jamba differentiate from other juice and smoothie concepts?
Those are some of the things we’ll be working through in the coming months. The real opportunity is to understand the intrinsic benefits of the brand. From a functional perspective, Jamba has a superior product. When we talk about what goes into the cup, there’s no sugar added, it’s whole fruit.
Beyond that, Jamba has been at the intersection of fit and fun. So we’ll be looking at how to amplify that in a way that consumers get.
What do you hope to achieve within your first year at Jamba?
We definitely believe there’s enormous opportunity to grow same-store sales growth. The goal would be to better understand any new or lapsed users through consumer insights, and then build a plan to attract them to the brand.
How will you be part of the company’s move to North Texas?
Our CEO Dave (Pace), our leaderships team and myself share a common vision that the people who support the business every day will make or break the business. So we’re making sure there’s a knowledge transfer and culture transfer, and there are a group (of Jamba employees) that are going to be making the move with us.
On the flip side, we’re in the midst of hiring team members that can help drive the brand. The team members here will be going not only through store training, but they’ll be spending time with me and our marketing team to understand the brand and culture.

As it prepares to move to the region, Jamba Juice (Nasdaq: JMBA) has added a North Texan to its C-suite.
Rachel Phillips-Luther, formerly chief marketing officer with Plano-based Zoes Kitchen (NYSE: ZOES), is taking the same role with Jamba Juice, effective Aug. 9. She will stay in the area, working out of Jamba’s corporate office when it relocates from Emeryville, California, to Frisco this year.

The Dallas Business Journal broke the news in May that Jamba Juice is relocating its headquarters to Frisco’s Hall Office Park, where it will occupy roughly 25,000 square feet, including a 6,000-square-foot test kitchen and retail store front. The move will bring more than 100 corporate jobs to North Texas.
Jamba’s new offices, to be called the Jamba Whirl’d Center, will house the company’s operations, sales and marketing, business development, finance, supply chain, human resources and technology departments.
“Rachel brings tremendous energy and an instinctive understanding of the consumer,” said Dave Pace, president and CEO of Jamba Juice. “Coupled with a strong history of success in developing brand strategy and innovation, Rachel has proven her ability to shape brand architecture and develop consumer campaigns that consistently deliver impressive financial results. Additionally, she has a reputation of developing dynamic teams, which will play a critical role as we complete our transition to Texas and expand the marketing discipline at Jamba.”
During her time at Zoes, Phillips-Luther contributed to the restaurant chain’s initial public offering and led a repositioning of the brand.
Prior to her stint at the Mediterranean concept, she worked as vice president of Marketing with FHRG Inc. and vice president of marketing and brand innovation at Kona Grill.
