In 2006, DTE Energy's 7 major coal-fired power plants emitted 43.3 million tons of CO
2 (0.7% of all U.S. CO2 emissions) and 214,000 tons of SO
2 (1.4% of all U.S. SO
2 emissions).
In 2016, DTE Energy retired three coal-fired generating units among its plants. In June 2016, DTE Energy said that it would close eight additional coal-fired generators at three coal plants in Michigan by the year 2023.[8] The plants are located in River Rouge, St. Clair in East China Township and Trenton. In sum, the plants power around 900,000 homes. DTE Energy plans to replace them with renewable energy. The Detroit Free Press wrote that employees at the closing plants will be able to transfer to other facilities and will not lose their jobs.[9]
Many of DTE Energy's coal plants were built in the 1950s and 1960s and "are nearing retirement age."[8]
Renewable Energy[edit]
Since 2009, DTE Energy has invested over $1 billion in renewable energy according to their 2015 - 2016 Corporate Citizenship Report.[10]
Solar[edit]
As of June 2016, DTE Energy plans to build a solar arrays in Lapeer, Michigan that will be one of the largest in the eastern United States. It will do so as it retires coal-fired generators at coal plants in Michigan. According to DTE Energy, it is the largest investor in renewable energy in Michigan. It has invested over $2 billion since 2008.[8]
In May 2016, the company broke ground on a solar array project in Lapeer, MI touted as the largest utility-owned solar array east of the Mississippi River. When the project is completed, it is expected to generate enough electricity to power 9,000 homes.[11] DTE Energy also broke ground on a 10-acre solar installation in Detroit on the site of the abandoned O'Shea Park.[12]
Landfill-based gas-to-energy operations[edit]
In May 2017, DTE Energy announced it had acquired "two landfill-based gas-to-energy operations" in Texas. The company wants to expand its operations to alternative vehicle fuel. The operations it acquired were the Fort Bend Power Producers, LLC facility outside of Rosenberg, Texas and the Seabreaze landfill gas development in Angleton, Texas, which has yet to be developed.[13]
After these projects are operational, the company will have five "landfill conversion facilities which capture and convert dangerous landfill gases to pipeline-quality renewable natural gas." The gases will go to fueling transit buses.[13]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized DTE Energy for spending $4.37 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $17 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $2.5 billion.[14]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

DTE Energy Co. is an American Detroit, Michigan-based utility incorporated in 1995 involved in the development and management of energy-related businesses and services nationwide.
DTE Energy's largest operating subsidiaries are DTE Electric Company (formerly Detroit Edison), an investor-owned electric utility serving 2.1 million customers in Southeastern Michigan; and DTE Gas Company (formerly Michigan Consolidated Gas Company (MichCon)), a natural gas utility serving 1.2 million customers in Michigan. The two companies merged in 2001.[6]
The name "DTE" is taken from the stock symbol for the former Detroit Edison, DTE.[7]

As of 2005 DTE Energy has 22 coal-fired generating stations with 7,998 MW of capacity. Here is a list of DTE Energy's coal power plants with capacity over 100 MW:

In 2006, DTE Energy's 7 major coal-fired power plants emitted 43.3 million tons of CO
2 (0.7% of all U.S. CO2 emissions) and 214,000 tons of SO
2 (1.4% of all U.S. SO
2 emissions).
In 2016, DTE Energy retired three coal-fired generating units among its plants. In June 2016, DTE Energy said that it would close eight additional coal-fired generators at three coal plants in Michigan by the year 2023.[8] The plants are located in River Rouge, St. Clair in East China Township and Trenton. In sum, the plants power around 900,000 homes. DTE Energy plans to replace them with renewable energy. The Detroit Free Press wrote that employees at the closing plants will be able to transfer to other facilities and will not lose their jobs.[9]
Many of DTE Energy's coal plants were built in the 1950s and 1960s and "are nearing retirement age."[8]
Renewable Energy[edit]
Since 2009, DTE Energy has invested over $1 billion in renewable energy according to their 2015 - 2016 Corporate Citizenship Report.[10]
Solar[edit]
As of June 2016, DTE Energy plans to build a solar arrays in Lapeer, Michigan that will be one of the largest in the eastern United States. It will do so as it retires coal-fired generators at coal plants in Michigan. According to DTE Energy, it is the largest investor in renewable energy in Michigan. It has invested over $2 billion since 2008.[8]
In May 2016, the company broke ground on a solar array project in Lapeer, MI touted as the largest utility-owned solar array east of the Mississippi River. When the project is completed, it is expected to generate enough electricity to power 9,000 homes.[11] DTE Energy also broke ground on a 10-acre solar installation in Detroit on the site of the abandoned O'Shea Park.[12]
Landfill-based gas-to-energy operations[edit]
In May 2017, DTE Energy announced it had acquired "two landfill-based gas-to-energy operations" in Texas. The company wants to expand its operations to alternative vehicle fuel. The operations it acquired were the Fort Bend Power Producers, LLC facility outside of Rosenberg, Texas and the Seabreaze landfill gas development in Angleton, Texas, which has yet to be developed.[13]
After these projects are operational, the company will have five "landfill conversion facilities which capture and convert dangerous landfill gases to pipeline-quality renewable natural gas." The gases will go to fueling transit buses.[13]
Criticism[edit]
In December 2011, the non-partisan organization Public Campaign criticized DTE Energy for spending $4.37 million on lobbying and not paying any taxes during 2008-2010, instead getting $17 million in tax rebates, despite making a profit of $2.5 billion.[14]

Our Story - GURU ENERGY

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!

Payments










What is DTE Energy's bill payment policy?








We bill on a monthly basis. Bills are due 17 days after mailing. If you are mailing your payment, please allow 5-7 days for postal delivery to assure your payment arrives before the due date. Balances not paid in full by the due date will be charged a 2 percent late fee, and the account may become eligible for shutoff action at any and/or all meters attached to that account.
Any additional DTE Energy program a customer is enrolled in — such as Home Protection Plus® — is subject to the terms of that existing contract, and may be discontinued if the bill is not paid in full (or per the existing payment arrangement) each month. 
If you are having difficulty meeting your financial obligations, we offer many forms of Energy Assistance, including payment agreements, General Assistance, Low Income Programs, Shutoff Protection Plan and Low Income Self-Sufficiency Plan.














What payment methods are accepted? 








DTE Energy accepts the following methods of payment online: checking account, savings account, debit card, Visa®, MasterCard® or Discover®. Cash payments are also accepted at our DTE Energy Bill Payment Kiosks.














What does "Payment Name" mean when I add an account?








The payment method description allows you to label your different payment methods for easy identification. The only requirements are the description must contain 45 characters or less and must be unique for each payment method.














My credit card has expired. Can I change it online?








An expired credit card can be deleted only (even if the new card has the same numbers as the old card). A card which has not yet expired may be updated with a new expiration date, CVV code or ZIP code.

Sign in to your account and go to the Manage Payment Methods page. From here you can edit your existing bank accounts and charge cards in addition to adding and deleting payment methods.














How do I change the name I assigned to my payment method?








Once saved, payment method names cannot be modified. If you’d like to change the name assigned to your saved Payment Method, first delete the payment method, then re-add it.

To add, delete or edit your saved Payment Methods, sign in to your account and go to the My Payment Methods page. You will see the option to Edit or Delete a Payment Method and an option to Add Payment Method.














How many payment methods can I keep on my account?








Each user may store up to five payment methods.














What are the maximum and minimum payments accepted online? 








The credit card maximum payment limit is $99,999.99 and the ACH/bank maximum payment limit is $499,999.99. The minimum payment accepted for both is $1.00.














Why can't I pay using a bank account?








We do not accept payments from a bank account if there have been issues with multiple returned payments within the last twelve months. You may use a credit or debit card to pay online.














Can I make a same day online payment?








Payments can be scheduled to post to your DTE Energy account as early as the same business day or up to 60 days in advance. Payments made after 1:00 p.m. will automatically be applied on the next business day.














How do I know my online payment has posted?








Go to the My Billing & History page on your online account to view your payment history. Depending on the status of your payment, you will see one of following statuses.
Pending
This status will appear if you have initiated a payment for today or scheduled payments for up to 60 days in the future. Payments made for today's date cannot be cancelled or modified. Future scheduled payments can be modified or cancelled.
Received
This indicates that your payment has been processed by our billing system. If the payment was successfully processed, the amount of the payment will be reflected in your amount due. Note: A payment indicated as “processed” may not have successfully been posted to your account. We may have had difficulty taking your online payment if any of your payment information is incorrect and/or has not been updated (for example, if you have been issued a new credit card and your expiration date has changed). Always check with your financial institution to ensure that electronic payments have been successfully posted.
Cancelled
If you cancel a payment for any reason, it should be viewable here for 60 days.














How do I modify or cancel a scheduled payment?








Payments can be scheduled or canceled up to one business day before the scheduled payment date. Same day payments cannot be cancelled or modified online.
To modify a scheduled payment, sign in and go to your Billing and Payment History page. Payments that are eligible to be modified will have “Cancel” and “Edit” options. 
After the change has been successfully processed, you will receive a new confirmation number and the Billing and Payment History page will be updated. 














Why did my payment fail?








If we are unable to process your payment, most likely it was declined by your financial institution. Common reasons for declined payments include:

Your credit or debit card information has expired or is incorrect.
Your bank account information is incorrect.
Insufficient funds. Please choose another form of payment.
Your financial institution has placed a hold on your account. Please contact your bank or credit card company directly.















How do I pay multiple accounts?








If you receive multiple statements, you may pay up to five accounts in a single transaction at one time. When you have signed in, go to the My Current Bill page and use the checkboxes on the right-hand side to select up to five of your accounts. To pay more than five, you will need to initiate a second transaction.

Please note:  Each grouping of payments must be made using the same payment method and date. To initiate multiple payments using different funding sources or dates, you will need to pay each bill separately.
