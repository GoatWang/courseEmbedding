	(1) Southcross Holdings Borrower LP (Borrower) owns 26,492,074 common units representing limited
	partner interests (Common Units), 17,105,875 Class B convertible units representing limited partner interests (Class B Convertible Units) and 12,213,713 subordinated units representing limited partner interests
	(Subordinated Units) in the Issuer. Borrower is owned of record 100% by Southcross Holdings Guarantor LP (Guarantor), and its non-economic general partner interest is held by Southcross Holdings Borrower GP LLC, which is
	owned of record 100% by Guarantor. Guarantor is owned of record 99.98% by Southcross Holdings LP (Holdings), and its 0.02% general partner interest is held by Southcross Holdings Guarantor GP LLC, which is owned of record 99% by Holdings
	and 1% by Southcross Holdings Intermediary LLC, which is owned 100% by Holdings. Southcross Holdings GP LLC (Holdings GP) is the non-economic general partner of Holdings. Therefore, Holdings GP may be deemed to indirectly beneficially
	own the Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units held by Borrower. The Class B Convertible Units convert into Common Units at the Class B Conversion Rate (as defined in the Issuers Third Amended and Restated Agreement of
	Limited Partnership dated August 4, 2014 (the Partnership Agreement), which is incorporated by reference herein) on the Class B Conversion Date (as defined in the Partnership Agreement). The Subordinated Units convert into Common
	Units on a one-for-one basis on the expiration of the Subordination Period (as defined in the Partnership Agreement). Because such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units were acquired in connection with transactions having the purpose or
	effect of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer, such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units are considered converted for purposes of the calculations of the amounts noted under Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, as amended.


	(2) Based upon 48,516,567 Common Units, 17,105,875 Class B Convertible Units and 12,213,713 Subordinated Units outstanding as of
	January 12, 2017. For purposes of this calculation, the initial Class B Conversion Rate of 1.0 (i.e., one Common Unit for each Class B Convertible Unit) was used, although the Class B Conversion Rate may vary. See Item 1 of the Schedule
	13D to which this cover page relates for a description of the securities to which this Schedule 13D relates.

	(1) Southcross Holdings Borrower LP (Borrower) owns 26,492,074 common units representing limited
	partner interests (Common Units), 17,105,875 Class B convertible units representing limited partner interests (Class B Convertible Units) and 12,213,713 subordinated units representing limited partner interests
	(Subordinated Units) in the Issuer. Borrower is owned of record 100% by Southcross Holdings Guarantor LP and its non-economic general partner interest is held by Southcross Holdings Borrower GP LLC (Borrower GP). Therefore,
	Borrower GP may be deemed to indirectly beneficially own the Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units held by Borrower. The Class B Convertible Units convert into Common Units at the Class B Conversion Rate (as defined in the
	Issuers Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated August 4, 2014 (the Partnership Agreement), which is incorporated by reference herein) on the Class B Conversion Date (as defined in the Partnership
	Agreement). The Subordinated Units convert into Common Units on a one-for-one basis on the expiration of the Subordination Period (as defined in the Partnership Agreement). Because such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units were acquired
	in connection with transactions having the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer, such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units are considered converted for purposes of the calculations of the amounts noted
	under Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


	(2) Based upon 48,516,567 Common Units, 17,105,875 Class B Convertible
	Units and 12,213,713 Subordinated Units outstanding as of January 12, 2017. For purposes of this calculation, the initial Class B Conversion Rate of 1.0 (i.e., one Common Unit for each Class B Convertible Unit) was used, although the Class B
	Conversion Rate may vary. See Item 1 of the Schedule 13D to which this cover page relates for a description of the securities to which this Schedule 13D relates.

	(1) Southcross Holdings Borrower LP (Borrower) directly owns 26,492,074 common units representing
	limited partner interests (Common Units), 17,105,875 Class B convertible units representing limited partner interests (Class B Convertible Units) and 12,213,713 subordinated units representing limited partner interests
	(Subordinated Units) in the Issuer. The Class B Convertible Units convert into Common Units at the Class B Conversion Rate (as defined in the Issuers Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership dated August 4,
	2014 (the Partnership Agreement), which is incorporated by reference herein) on the Class B Conversion Date (as defined in the Partnership Agreement). The Subordinated Units convert into Common Units on a one-for-one basis on the
	expiration of the Subordination Period (as defined in the Partnership Agreement). Because such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units were acquired in connection with transactions having the purpose or effect of changing or influencing the
	control of the Issuer, such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units are considered converted for purposes of the calculations of the amounts noted under Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


	(2) Based upon 48,516,567 Common Units, 17,105,875 Class B Convertible Units and 12,213,713 Subordinated Units outstanding as of January 12, 2017. For
	purposes of this calculation, the initial Class B Conversion Rate of 1.0 (i.e., one Common Unit for each Class B Convertible Unit) was used, although the Class B Conversion Rate may vary. See Item 1 of the Schedule 13D to which this cover page
	relates for a description of the securities to which this Schedule 13D relates.





	This Amendment No. 6 (this Amendment) amends and supplements the Schedule 13D
	filed on August 14, 2014, as amended on May 21, 2015, February 18, 2016, April 6, 2016, May 4, 2016, and August 10, 2016 (as amended, the Original Schedule 13D and, as amended by this
	Amendment, this Schedule 13D), and is being jointly filed by the Reporting Persons with respect to the Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units of Southcross Energy Partners, L.P. (SXE). This Amendment
	reports and reflects the acquisition of additional Common Units. Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein shall have the meanings attributed to them in the Original Schedule 13D.



	Item 2. Identity and Background



	The ninth paragraph
	of Item 2(a) through (c) of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:


	Set forth on

	Appendix 1

	(constituting a part of this Schedule 13D) are the names, business addresses and positions of the respective executive officers and directors, as applicable, of the Reporting Persons and other persons controlling the Reporting
	Persons (collectively, the Controlling Persons).



	Item 3. Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration



	The fifth paragraph of Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated as follows:


	On November 5, 2014, February 9, 2015, May 8, 2015, August 10, 2015, November 9,
	2015, May 9, 2016, August 10, 2016 and November 14, 2016, Holdings received 256,078, 260,558, 265,118, 269,758, 274,478, 284,191, 289,165 and 294,226, respectively, Class B PIK Units from the Issuer as distributions on the
	Class B Convertible Units pursuant to the terms of the Partnership Agreement. Borrower was entitled to receive from the Issuer, within forty-five (45) days after the quarter ending December 31, 2015, a Class B Quarterly Distribution (as
	defined in the Partnership Agreement), consisting of a payment-in-kind distribution on outstanding Class B Convertible Units of additional Class B Convertible Units (the Class B PIK Units), in accordance with the terms of the Partnership
	Agreement. However, the Issuer did not timely make such Class B Quarterly Distribution. The Partnership Agreement provides that, notwithstanding the Issuers failure to make such Class B Quarterly Distribution, the holders entitled to the
	unpaid Class B PIK Units shall be entitled (i) to Class B Quarterly Distributions in subsequent quarters on such unpaid Class B PIK Units and (ii) to all other rights under the Partnership Agreement as if such unpaid Class B PIK Units had
	in fact been distributed on the date due (Unpaid Class B PIK Rights). On February 14, 2016, Borrower acquired Unpaid Class B PIK Rights equivalent to 279,303 Class B Convertible Units. The Issuer subsequently determined to issue
	such Class B Convertible Units and issued the 279,303 Class B Convertible Units on May 9, 2016. As of December 29, 2016, Holdings had received a total of 2,472,875 Class B PIK Units from the Issuer as distributions on the Class B
	Convertible Units.


	Item 3 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following paragraphs to the end of Item 3:


	On December 29, 2016, the Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent under the Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined
	below), and certain lenders party thereto entered into that certain Waiver and Fifth Amendment (the Fifth Amendment) to that certain Third Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated as of August 4, 2014, among the
	Issuer, as borrower, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as administrative agent, UBS Securities LLC and Barclays Bank PLC, as co-syndication agents, and a syndicate of lenders (as amended, the Revolving Credit Agreement). On December 29, 2016,
	in connection with the Fifth Amendment, Holdings contributed from cash on hand $17,000,000 pursuant to, and on the terms described in, the Equity Cure Agreement (as defined and described in Item 6), as amended by the First Amendment to Equity
	Cure Contribution Agreement, dated as of December 29, 2016 (as amended, the Equity Cure Agreement). As of December 29, 2016, the Equity Cure Agreement is terminated pursuant to the Investment Agreement (as defined below).


	Item 4. Purpose of Transaction.


	The second paragraph of
	Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated as follows:


	The Reporting Persons acquired 2,116,400 of the
	Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units as part of the consideration for SXE to acquire TexStars Rich Gas System through the Drop-Down Contribution and to establish a structure for common ownership and control of the
	Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units through Holdings, as a new holding company of SXE, and its general partner Holdings GP, both of which are owned by SELLC, EIG, and Aggregator. The Reporting Persons acquired an





	additional 4,500,000 Common Units as part of the consideration for SXE to acquire certain assets through the Holdings Drop-Down Contribution. The Reporting Persons acquired an additional
	2,472,875 Class B PIK Units as distributions on the Class B Convertible Units, as described in Item 3 of this Schedule 13D. The Reporting Persons acquired an additional 8,389,188 Common Units pursuant to the Equity Cure Agreement as an equity
	cure, as further described in Item 3 and Item 6. The Reporting Persons acquired an additional 11,486,486 Common Units in connection with the Fifth Amendment and pursuant to the Equity Cure Agreement, as further described in Item 3 and
	Item 6. As a result of the relationships described in Item 2 and Item 5 of this Schedule 13D, each of the Reporting Persons may be deemed to have shared power to vote, or direct the disposition of, and to dispose, or direct the
	disposition of, the Common Units, Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units held of record by Borrower.


	Item 4(a) of the Original Schedule
	13D is hereby amended by adding the following paragraphs to the end of Item 4(a):


	Pursuant to the Fifth Amendment, until such time
	as the Issuers Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Fifth Amendment) is less than 5.00 to 1.00, the Issuer is restricted from making cash distributions to the unitholders.


	On December 29, 2016, in connection with the execution of the Fifth Amendment, Holdings entered into (a) an Investment Agreement
	(the Investment Agreement) with the Issuer and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., (b) a Backstop Commitment Letter (the Backstop Agreement) with the Issuer, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and the affiliated entities of EIG Global Energy
	Partners, LLC and Tailwater Capital LLC party thereto (each a Sponsor and, collectively, the Sponsors) and (c) a First Amendment to the Equity Cure Agreement with the Issuer.


	Pursuant to entering into the Investment Agreement, the Equity Cure Agreement terminated and Holdings has agreed to contribute up to an
	additional $15.0 million in the aggregate to the Issuer (the Committed Amount) upon the earlier to occur of December 31, 2017 and notification from the Issuer of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement. In exchange
	for the amounts contributed pursuant to the Investment Agreement upon a Partial Investment Trigger or the Full Investment Trigger (as defined in the Investment Agreement), the Issuer will issue to Holdings, at Holdings election, either
	(a) a number of Common Units at an issue price equal to either (i) if the Common Units are listed on a national stock exchange, 93% of the volume weighted average price of such Common Units for the twenty day period immediately preceding
	the date of the contribution or (ii) if the Common Units are not listed on a national stock exchange, the fair market value of such Common Units as reasonably agreed by the Issuer and Holdings or (b) a senior unsecured note of the Issuer
	in an initial face amount equal to the amount of the contribution by Holdings, as described in the Investment Agreement.


	Pursuant to the
	Backstop Agreement, if Holdings is unable to satisfy its obligations under the Investment Agreement with cash on hand upon the occurrence of a Partial Investment Trigger or a Full Investment Trigger, the Sponsors have agreed to fund Holdings
	shortfall in providing the Committed Amount by contributing each Sponsors respective pro-rata portion of the shortfall to Holdings or, at the election of each Sponsor, directly to the Issuer. As consideration for any amounts contributed
	directly to the Issuer by a Sponsor pursuant to the Backstop Agreement, the Issuer will issue to such Sponsor the Common Units or Investment Note that would have otherwise been issued to Holdings under the Investment Agreement with respect to the
	amount contributed by the Sponsor.


	Item 4(d) of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph to the end of
	Item 4(d):


	As of January 1, 2017, Andrew A. Cameron was elected as a director of the Board of the General Partner of the
	Issuer. As of January 6, 2017, the Board of the General Partner of the Issuer elected Bruce A. Williamson as its Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Williamson succeeded John E. Bonn, who stepped down as President and
	Chief Executive Officer of the General Partner, and David W. Biegler, the former Chairman of the General Partner. Mr. Biegler is continuing as a director of the General Partner.



	Item 5. Interest in Securities of the Issuer.



	Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:


	(a and b) As of January 12, 2017, 48,516,567 Common Units, 17,105,875 Class B Convertible Units and 12,213,713 Subordinated Units are
	outstanding. The Class B Convertible Units convert into Common Units at the Class B Conversion Rate on the Class B Conversion Date; the initial Class B Conversion Rate is 1.0 (i.e., one Common Unit for each Class B Convertible Unit). The
	Subordinated Units convert into Common Units on a one-





	for-one basis on the expiration of the Subordination Period. Because such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units were acquired in connection with transactions having the purpose or
	effect of changing or influencing the control of SXE, such Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units are considered converted for purposes of the calculations of the amounts noted under Rule 13d-3(d)(1)(i) of the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934, as amended. As a result of the relationship of the Reporting Persons, each of the Reporting Persons is deemed to be the beneficial owner, with shared power to vote or direct the vote and shared power to dispose or direct the disposition, of
	55,811,662 Common Units, which constitutes approximately 71.7% of the outstanding Common Units (giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding Class B Convertible Units and Subordinated Units).


	Borrower was entitled to receive from the Issuer, within forty-five (45) days after the quarter ending December 31, 2015, a Class B
	Quarterly Distribution (as defined in the Partnership Agreement), consisting of a payment-in-kind distribution on outstanding Class B Convertible Units of Class B PIK Units, in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement. However, the
	Issuer did not timely make such Class B Quarterly Distribution. The Partnership Agreement provides that, notwithstanding the Issuers failure to make such Class B Quarterly Distribution, the holders entitled to the unpaid Class B PIK Units
	shall be entitled to Unpaid Class B PIK Rights. On February 14, 2016, Borrower acquired Unpaid Class B PIK Rights equivalent to 279,303 Class B Convertible Units. The Issuer subsequently determined to issue such Class B Convertible Units and
	issued the 279,303 Class B Convertible Units on May 9, 2016.

	Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer.



	Item 6 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended by adding the following paragraph after the eighth paragraph:


	In connection with the Fifth Amendment and pursuant to the Equity Cure Agreement, on December 29, 2016, Holdings contributed from cash on
	hand $17,000,000 (the Holdings Investment) to the Issuer. In exchange for the Holdings Investment and pursuant to the Equity Cure Agreement, SXE issued 11,486,486 Common Units to Borrower. The number of Common Units was based on the
	volume weighted daily average price of a Common Unit, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, for the 15 consecutive trading days ending on the second trading day prior to December 29, 2016, provided that such weighted daily average price
	would be no less than $0.89 per Common Unit and no greater than $1.48 per Common Unit.


	The last two paragraphs of the Item 6 of the Original
	Schedule 13D are hereby amended and restated in their entirety as follows:


	The descriptions of the Drop-Down Contribution Agreement, the
	Primary Contribution Agreement, the Partnership Agreement, the SXE GP Agreement, the Holdings GP Agreement, the Holdings LP Agreement, the Holdings Drop-Down Contribution Agreement, the Equity Cure Agreement, the Investment Agreement and the
	Backstop Agreement (collectively, the Transaction Agreements) do not purport to be complete descriptions of all of the terms and conditions of each agreement. The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
	full text of the Agreements, copies of which are Exhibits 1 through 6 and Exhibit 8 through 13 hereto and incorporated by reference herein.


	The Transaction Agreements are filed as exhibits to this Schedule 13D only to provide investors with information regarding the terms and
	conditions of the Transaction Agreements, and not to provide investors with any other factual information regarding SXE or its subsidiaries or their business or operations. SXEs investors should not rely on the representations and

Southcross Holdings emerges from Chapter 11 bankruptcy








April 14, 2016



































Southcross Holdings LP,an owner and operator of gathering and fractionation assets in the midstream energy sector, has consummated its pre-packaged plan of reorganization (POR) and emerged from bankruptcy protection. Holdings commenced voluntary cases under chapter 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas on March 27, 2016. The bankruptcy court confirmed the POR on April 11, 2016.
Among other things, the POR eliminated nearly $700 million of funded debt and preferred equity obligations of holdings, and provided for a new equity investment from certain of its existing equity holders.
Southcross Holdings LP, through its subsidiary Southcross Holdings Borrower LP, owns 100% of Southcross Energy Partners GP LLC, the general partner of Southcross, as well as a portion of Southcross’ common units, and all of Southcross’ subordinated units and Class B convertible units. Holdings also owns natural gas gathering and treating assets as well as NGL pipelines and fractionation facilities in South Texas.
