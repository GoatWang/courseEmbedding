Michael Wilson, M.D., M.A.S.
Neurologist
Dr. Michael Wilson is a neurologist who specializes in a variety of infectious and autoimmune syndromes of the central nervous system. These include meningitis, encephalitis and myelitis, demyelinating conditions like multiple sclerosis, and neurologic complications of microbes, including neurocysticercosis, fungi, bacteria, HIV-1 and other viruses such as West Nile virus and JC virus. 
Wilson's research involves using genomic technologies to enhance the understanding of the development of multiple sclerosis, and to identify novel and unusual causes of autoimmune and infectious meningoencephalitis.
Wilson obtained his medical degree from UCSF. He then completed an internship in internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and a neurology residency at MGH and Brigham and Women's Hospital. He then pursued a clinical and research fellowship in neuro-infectious diseases at MGH and Boston University's National Emerging Infectious Diseases Laboratories before completing a postdoctoral fellowship in metagenomics in the UCSF Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics. He earned a master's degree in clinical research methods at UCSF. 
Wilson belongs to the American Neurological Association, American Academy of Neurology, International Society for NeuroVirology and International Encephalitis Consortium. In 2016, he was awarded the Debbie and Andy Rachleff Distinguished Professorship in Neurology at UCSF, where he is an assistant professor of neurology.
