Overview
Madison Dearborn Partners, LLC (“MDP”) is a leading private equity investment firm based in Chicago, Illinois.  Since MDP’s formation in 1992, the firm has raised seven funds with aggregate capital of approximately $23 billion and has completed investments in over 130 companies. Prior to forming the firm, MDP’s founders built a $2.6 billion management buyout and venture capital portfolio at First Chicago Corporation dating back to the early 1980s.
MDP’s objective is to invest in companies in partnership with outstanding management teams to achieve significant long-term appreciation in equity value. A flexible investment approach, encompassing both management buyouts and structured minority investments, has been a key tenet to MDP’s investment philosophy for several decades.
MDP’s founders adopted an industry focused investment approach over 30 years ago, and the firm has six dedicated teams that have long and successful track records of investing in their respective sectors. The six industry verticals are:


Basic Industries


Business & Government Services


Consumer


Financial & Transaction Services


Health Care

Telecom, Media & Technology Services

MDP operates from a single office in Chicago. The firm has 41 investment professionals, consisting of 28 Principals and 13 Associates.
A strong belief in a partnership approach is at the center of our business philosophy. This approach has served us well over decades of investing, and we believe it distinguishes us as a partner of choice for many first class management teams looking to transform, grow or improve their businesses.

Industry Focus



MDP’s founders adopted an industry focused investment approach over 30 years ago.  We have six dedicated teams focusing on Basic Industries; Business & Government Services; Consumer; Financial & Transaction Services; Health Care; and Telecom, Media & Technology Services.  MDP’s industry focus and long experience in these sectors is a key competitive advantage which we believe leads to (i) unique sourcing opportunities; (ii) in-depth understanding of the key value drivers of businesses; (iii) an ability to be targeted, efficient and focused during due diligence; and (iv) a clear plan in developing and executing a value creation strategy.
The industry teams act as a value-added partner to management throughout the life of the investment.  We serve as a source of advice for business decisions in a number of areas where our investment experience can be particularly valuable, including (i) developing specific value creation strategies; (ii) long-term strategic planning; (iii) complicated financial and tax structuring; (iv) insight into the capital markets; and (v) financings, acquisitions and divestitures.  This knowledge base, coupled with broad networks of industry contacts, has proven to be critical as management and MDP work together as partners to grow and improve businesses.

Investment Strategy


MDP seeks to achieve superior returns for its investors through pursuing management buyouts and structured minority investments (structured equity investments). We focus on value-oriented mature businesses as well as growth-oriented companies with established operating track records. All investment opportunities are derived from MDP’s industry sector focus. The firm has six dedicated industry teams that have long and successful track records of investing in their respective sectors.
MDP employs an investment strategy that focuses primarily on the quality of the business enterprise, its prospects and its leadership and only secondarily on investment structure. MDP has distinguished itself as a creative provider of capital with the expertise to tailor our approach to each need or situation. Depending upon the specific attributes and business strength of a company, we may or may not deploy leverage in the capital structure. This approach allows MDP to capitalize on its deep industry expertise to pursue attractive investment opportunities whether structured as a control buyout or a structured minority investment.
Management buyouts typically involve an investment by MDP in the following situations:

Buyouts of private or publicly held companies
Buyouts of divisions or subsidiaries of large corporations
Recapitalizations of family-owned or closely held companies designed to achieve liquidity or raise equity, often allowing sellers to retain significant continuing ownership

Minority or structured equity investments typically involve an investment by MDP in the following situations:

Companies that are seeking capital to fund rapid growth
Capital for recapitalizations or balance sheet restructurings
Financings involving companies that require capital to pursue acquisitions or mergers

Partnering with strong management teams is a central element to all MDP investments.  We seek to partner with experienced managers who have a solid understanding of their businesses and track records of building shareholder value. MDP has demonstrated over three decades of investing that the combination of a talented and motivated management team with the resources of MDP is a powerful formula for success.

culture and our deep commitment to our community,” said Scott Brown, President and CEO of Sage
Products. “With MDP’s support, our business has grown domestically and we have achieved significant
initial success with our international expansion. We are grateful for MDP’s partnership over the past few
years and believe that Sage is well-positioned for continued achievement and long-term success with
Stryker, a company that understands our business, supports our goals and embraces our values.”
“We warmly welcome Vince, Scott, the exceptional leadership team and all Sage employees to the
global Stryker family,” said Kevin A. Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Stryker Corporation.
“We are fully aligned with Sage’s strategy and culture, and we see this acquisition as a very strong
addition to our existing product portfolio. Stryker looks forward to helping Sage continue its impressive
growth trajectory around the world while remaining true to its roots and local community engagement.”
The closing of the transaction is subject to expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The
