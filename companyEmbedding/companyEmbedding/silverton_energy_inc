	ITEM 1:






	BUSINESS



	 


	Silverton Energy, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 21, 2010, with fiscal year of September 30. We are currently have no operations and are a “shell company” as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We were founded with the intent of producing environmentally aware footwear, but we abandoned this business in 2013.


	 


	We are currently assessing our options as how, and if, to proceed as a business. We believe that our most likely scenario for survival is to merge with and into or to acquire an existing business. To that end, we are seeking merger candidates and intend to take steps to make us a more attractive merger candidate.


	 


	If we are unable to begin a new business or enter into a merger with or acquire an existing business, we will need to raise additional funds to continue as a business. If we cannot secure additional funds we will have to cease our business and our investors will lose their entire investment.


	 



	ITEM 1A:




	RISK FACTORS



	 


	We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

	ITEM 5:


	 






	MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES



	 


	As of September 30, 2015, the Company had thirty (30) active shareholders of record. The company has not paid cash dividends and has no outstanding options. Although, the Company’s common stock is quoted on FINRA’s Over-the-Counter Pink (the “OTCPink”), only one trade has been reported on the OTCPink, and that trade was for $0.10 in October of 2013. There is virtually no market for our common stock, and you might never be able to sell any shares of our common stock that you purchase or own.

	SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA



	 


	We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.


	 



	ITEM 7: 




	MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.


	 


	This report contains forward looking statements relating to our Company's future economic performance, plans and objectives of management for future operations, projections of revenue mix and other financial items that are based on the beliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently known to, our management. The words "expects”, “intends”, “believes”, “anticipates”, “may”, “could”, “should" and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The cautionary statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement.


	 


	Our auditor’s report on our September 30, 2015 financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business. We believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next 12 months, we may be required to suspend or cease our business.


	 


	As of September 30, 2015, we had $0 cash on hand and in the bank. Management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised. We plan to satisfy our future cash requirements - primarily legal and accounting fees - by additional equity financing. This will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock. Additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all, and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements.


	 


	If we are unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering, we will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing, which would be highly difficult for a shell company to secure. Therefore, we depend upon the success of the any private placement offering and failure thereof would result in our having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing, which may not even be available to us. However, if such financing were available, because we are a shell company, we would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate. At such time these funds are required, management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could manage the debt load. If we cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of our common stock or secure debt financing we would be required to cease as a business. As a result, investors in our common stock would lose all of their investment.

	We did not generate any revenue during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2014 and 2015. We incurred operating expenses in the amount of $138,714 in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. These operating expenses were comprised of professional fees, interest expense, and office and general expenses. Since inception we have incurred operating expenses of $435,351.


	 


	We have no current agreements to merge with any other entity.


	 


	As of the date of this Annual Report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue operations. The cost to of maintaining our reporting status for the next twelve months is estimated to be $30,000.


	 





	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



	 


	Our expenses decreased to $138,714 for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 from $235,773 in the twelve months ended September 30, 2014. This decrease was the result of a decrease in office and general expenses to $15,346 from $47,239 between the two periods as well a decrease in professional fees to $110,500 from $184,534 between the two periods. As we had no revenues or additional losses in either period, our net losses were the same as our total expenses.


	 



	OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS



	 


	As of the date of this Annual Report, the current funds available to the Company will not be sufficient to continue operations. The cost to of maintaining our reporting status for the next twelve months is estimated to be $30,000 over this same period. Management believes that if the Company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the SEC it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the Company. As such, any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety.


	 


	The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM




	 


	To the Board of Directors and


	Stockholders of Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.)


	 


	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.) ( a development stage company) as of September 30, 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.) management is responsible for these financial statements. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.


	 


	We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the combined and consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.) is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.) internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.


	 


	We were not engaged to examine management’s assertion about the effectiveness of Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015 included in the accompanying Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.) Report and, accordingly, we do not express an opinion thereon.


	 


	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Silverton Energy, Inc. (fka Meta Gold, Inc.) as of September 30, 2015 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.


	 


	The financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company’s losses from operations raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	 



	September 30, 2015



	 




	NOTE 1 –NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION




	 


	The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit Company on September 21, 2010 and established as fiscal year end of September 30. We are a shell company with no current business plan.


	 


	In March 2013, the Company approved a name change to Meta Gold, Inc. In October 2014, the Company approved a name change to Silverton Energy, Inc.


	 


	The Company is subject to significant risk relating to its operations and securities. Among the biggest risks is that the Company will be unable to generate revenue, or borrow funds, or sell equity to cover its expenses. If the Company is unable cover its expenses it will eventually be forced to cease operations.


	 




	NOTE 2 – GOING CONCERN




	 


	The Company’s financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. This contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Currently, the Company has a working capital deficit of $328,961 and net loss from operations since inception of $435,351. The Company does not have a source of revenue sufficient to cover its operation costs giving substantial doubt for it to continue as a going concern. The Company will be dependent upon the raising of additional capital through placement of our common stock in order to implement its business plan, or merge with an operating company. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in either situation in order to continue as a going concern. The Company is funding its initial operations by way of issuing Founder’s shares.


	 


	In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the Company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity and/or debt financing. However management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans.


	 


	The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company’s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the ability to raise additional funds, if the Company does not locate a source of revenue to cover operating expenses.

	NOTE 3 – SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES




	 



	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	Preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates


	 



	Income Taxes



	The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequence attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax balances. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measure using the enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the date of substantive enactment.


	 



	Net Loss per Share



	Basic loss per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing loss available to common stakeholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Dilutive loss per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the losses of the Company. Because the Company does not have any potentially dilutive securities, the accompanying presentation is only of basic loss per share.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	Pronouncements between September 30, 2015 and the date of this filing are not expected to have a significant impact on our operations, financial position, or cash flow, nor does the Company expects the adoption of recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.


	 




	NOTE 4 – FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS




	 


	The Company has determined the estimated fair value of financial instruments using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. The fair value of financial instruments classified as current assets or liabilities approximate their carrying value due to the short term maturity of the instruments.


	 




	NOTE 5 - LOAN RECEIVABLE - RELATED PARTY LOANS




	 


	The Company loaned $46,081 to a shareholder owened company. $10,000 is due on December 1, 2016. The interest is 5% per annum. The company accrued interest of $817 as of September 30, 2015. $36,081 is a demand note without interest.


	 




	NOTE 6 - LOAN PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY LOANS




	 


	The Company has received $26,154 as a loan from related parties (shareholder and shareholder owened company) as of September 30, 2015 ($18,654 as of September 30, 2014). The loan is due on demand and without interest.


	 




	NOTE 7 – RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION




	 


	The Company entered into a consulting agreement with Dr. Thomas Sawyer, president and director of the Company, on December 1, 2013 for the amount of $15,000 per month. As of June 30, 2015, $90,000 of the outstanding amount was converted into Additional Paid In Capital and $15,000 is outstanding as of September 30, 2015. The Company has also accrued outstanding expenses of $18,550 in relation to office rent and expenses, travel, accommodation and related expenses which remains outstanding.

	NOTE 8 – LOAN PAYABLE




	 


	The Company entered into loan agreement with Future Gen Holding Ltd. on January 9, 2014. The balance outstanding as at September 30, 2015 is $275,000 ($210,000 as at September 30, 2014). The interest is 5% per annum on the loan. The Company accrued interest of $17,667 as of September 30, 2015.


	 




	NOTE 9 – CAPITAL STOCK




	 


	On October 1, 2010 the Company issued 852,500,000 Founder’s shares at $0.000012 per share for net funds to the Company of $11,000.


	 


	During March and April, 2012, the Company issued 20,925,000 common shares for $0.000258 per share, for cash of $5,400


	 


	In March 2013 the Company increased its Authorized common shares to 250,000,000 shares at $0.001 per share.


	 


	In March 2013, the Company declared a 155:1 forward split and on the same day redeemed 821,000,125 common shares for $10.


	 


	In October 2014, the company increased authorized share capital from 250,000,000 shares of common stock to 500,000,000 shares of common stock. In October4 2014, the majority shareholder and the Board of Director approved a reverse stock split two to one.


	 




	NOTE 10 – INCOME TAXES




	 


	We did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because we have experienced operating losses since inception. Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes when it is more likely than not that a tax asset cannot be realized through future income the Company must allow for this future tax benefit. We provided full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset, consisting of net operating loss carry forwards, because management has determined that it is more likely than not that we will not earn income sufficient to realize the deferred tax assets during the carry forward period.


	 


	The components of the Company’s deferred tax asset and reconciliation of income taxes computed at the statutory rate to the income tax amount recorded as of September 30, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:


	 


	All the tax payer's tax returns are open for inspection by governmental bodies.

	Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, in accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15F and 15d-15F, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon and as of the date of that evaluation, he concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required. The reason we believe our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective is because:


	 







	 




	1.




	No independent Directors;






	 




	2.




	No segregation of duties;






	 




	3.




	No audit committee; and






	 




	4.




	Ineffective controls over financial reporting.





	 




	Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting




	 


	Thomas Roger Sawyer, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:


	 









	·



	pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;







	 




	 








	·



	provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and







	 




	 








	·



	provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.






	 



	Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 






	 




	6













	 




	  


	Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in 

	Internal Control — Integrated Framework.



	 


	Based on our assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer believe that, as of September 30, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is not effective based on those criteria, due to the following:


	 









	·



	We do not have an Audit Committee – While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is management’s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over our financial statements.







	 




	 








	·



	We do not maintain appropriate cash controls – Due to our very limited staff, including accounting personnel, we lack a proper segregation of functions, duties and responsibilities with respect to our cash process.






	 



	In light of this conclusion and as part of the preparation of this report, we have applied compensating procedures and processes as necessary to ensure the reliability of our financial reporting. Accordingly, management believes, based on its knowledge, that (1) this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report, and (2) the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the years and periods then ended.


	 




	Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting




	 


	There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal year or quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Thomas Roger Sawyer completed his doctorate in biological sciences at the University of Glasgow in 2000 and quickly moved into the corporate world, starting the information technology companies Weather2 Limited and Advance Weather Applications for which he served in the role of Chief Technology Officer. While helping to build and grow these companies, he also began consulting for clients in the logistics industry, providing strategy, technical architecture and business process consultancy for companies including Global Freight Solutions and Nightline. Dr. Sawyer completed an Executive MBA at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 2012, specializing in corporate finance and management science and completed his thesis on the use of data for predictive analytical tools in industry.

After completing the due diligence work on assets and carrying out the initial corporate structuring he was appointed CEO of East African Gold, a gold exploration company headquartered in Mauritius and with extensive exploration licenses in the east African country of Uganda, in late 2011.

Dr. Sawyer has experience of starting and structuring companies, raising capital, IPOs, mergers, setting up joint ventures and corporate strategy.

	PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING FEES AND SERVICES



	 


	On December 14th, 2015, PLS CPA, 4725 MERCURY STREET #210, San Diego, California, was dismissed as our principal independent registered public accounting firm. The audit reports of PLS CPA, dated January 13, 2015 and January 14, 2014, on our financial statements for the past two fiscal years did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles, except that each report contained statements indicating there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going-concern. During our two most recent fiscal years and any subsequent interim period up to and including the date of PLS CPA’s dismissal, there have been no disagreements with PLS CPA on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of PLS CPA, would have caused them to make reference thereto in their report on the financial statements for such periods.


	 


	On December 14th, 2015, we appointed the firm of Zwick & Banyai, PLLC, 20750 Civic Center Drive, Southfield, Michigan, as the principal independent registered public accounting firm of the Company for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2015. During the two most recent fiscal years or subsequent interim period, neither we, nor anyone on our behalf, consulted with Zwick & Banyai, PLLC regarding the application of accounting principles to a specific transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements, nor did the entity of Zwick & Banyai, PLLC, provide advice to the Company, either written or oral, that was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue. Further, during our two most recent fiscal years or subsequent interim period, we have not consulted the entity of Zwick & Banyai, PLLC, on any matter that was the subject of a disagreement or a reportable event.


	 


	For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $10,000 and $10,000 in fees to PLS CPA for professional services rendered in connection with the audit and review of financial statements.


	 


	For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we incurred approximately $4,100 and $0 in fees to Zwick & Banyai, PLLC for professional services rendered in connection with the audit and review of financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2015 which was incurred subsequent to year end.


	 


	During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we did not incur any other fees for professional services rendered by our principal independent accountants for all other non-audit services which may include, but not limited to, tax related services, actuarial services or valuation services.
