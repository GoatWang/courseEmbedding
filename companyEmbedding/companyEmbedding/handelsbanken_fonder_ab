What are analysts saying about Pool Corporation stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Pool Corporation stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Pool Corp.’s shares outperformed the industry in the last one year. The company’s second-quarter 2017 earnings of $2.21 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.3% but rose 11.6% year over year (y/y) on higher revenues. Net sales of $988.2 million outpaced estimates by 0.6% and surged 8% y/y, mainly driven by a 7% growth in base business sales. Moreover, ongoing recovery in the remodel and replacement sectors of its business, and consistent market share gains bolstered results. Pool is expected to continue gaining in the near term due to favorable trends in the housing market and consumer discretionary spending. Given the non-discretionary nature of majority of its Blue Business products, continued growth of the installed base and Pool’s leading market position, we expect consistent sales growth. Yet, seasonality of its business along with macroeconomic headwinds owing to its large global presence raises concern." (7/25/2017)
2. Wedbush analysts commented, "With scale, and as a value-added distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related outdoor leisure products, we view shares of Pool Corporation (POOL) as a core holding for mid-capitalization portfolios. Furthermore, POOL's market share and scale lends itself to relative advantages operationally and in purchasing efficiencies; we believe POOL can grow EPS in the range of 15-18% over the mid-term. With low cap-ex reinvestment rates, management converts over 100% of net income to cash flow from operations, thereby funding a disciplined acquisition strategy and providing consistent returns to shareholders via growing dividend and share repurchases."

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 3.00)Consensus Price Target: $129.00 (19.18% upside)
