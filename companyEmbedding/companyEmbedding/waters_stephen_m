The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Good publicity can infuriate your colleagues, as Stephen M. Waters, a Morgan  Stanley managing director who resigned this week, found out.A fast-rising star, Mr. Waters had assembled a glittering list of titles in his eight years at the investment bank. A member of the firm's operating committee since 1992, Mr. Waters had until last month headed Morgan Stanley & Company's investment banking business in Europe, and shared responsibilities for all its activities there.When Mr. Waters, 49, returned to Morgan Stanley's head office in New York last month, Investment Dealers' Digest led its Jan. 22 issue with a glowing article: "Top Morgan banker returns to bolster key client base. Waters will handle relationships; what about Perella?"The article, which quoted Mr. Waters, asserted that he would "take responsibility for the firm's investment banking clients," and said that this role seemed to overlap with that of Joseph R. Perella, the head of the firm's corporate finance business.

While Mr. Waters was expected to work as an investment banker, none of his colleagues expected him to "take responsibility" for that whole business. Both Mr. Perella and Robert Scott, who heads the firm's investment bank, were upset at the characterization of Mr. Waters's role, their colleagues said yesterday.

Describing the reaction to that article within the firm, one former colleague said yesterday: "It was absolutely the death knell for him. People went ballistic. People were out to get him." Another senior Morgan banker said, "Perhaps his view of what his job should be wasn't the same as what the firm thought it should be." And a third colleague, commenting on Mr. Waters's style,  said, "He was ignoring the system and acting very independently."

In a curt interoffice memorandum dated Tuesday, Morgan Stanley's top officers -- Richard B. Fisher, chairman; John J. Mack, president, and Mr. Scott, the head of the bank -- said, "The firm has accepted the resignation of Steve Waters." The internal announcement briefly listed Mr. Waters's assignments at the firm, said he had "made numerous contributions to the firm," and wished him "all the best in his future endeavors."Mr. Waters did not return telephone messages left yesterday at his home in Greenwich, Conn. Jean-Marie McFadden, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley & Company, said the firm had no comment beyond its internal announcement.While he had built a sterling reputation for advising companies on mergers and acquisitions, Mr. Waters had once before angered some senior colleagues with his public remarks. In December 1994, after Morgan Stanley called off its merger talks with S. G. Warburg & Company, the London merchant bank, Mr. Waters, as co-head of the firm's European business, told The Financial Times that Warburg's fund management company, Mercury Asset Management, "was the reason for us to do  this deal," implying that Warburg's other businesses were not that attractive.Reacting to Mr. Waters's remark, Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman said,  "I thought to myself, what a pity, but he presumably has his own imperatives for saying it."

History

A History of Compass Partners
 
Compass Partners was founded by Stephen M. Waters in 1996 to combine the broad experience, international reach and global relationship network of a major investment bank with the independence, agility and personalized attention of a boutique firm.
 
Waters began his investment banking career at Lehman Brothers in 1974, co-founding its Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Department in 1977, becoming a partner in 1980, and serving as co-director of the department from 1985 to 1988. He then moved to Morgan Stanley and ran its M&A Department from 1990 to 1992 before serving as co-Chief Executive Officer of Morgan Stanley Europe. He held that role from 1992 to 1996, in addition to serving on Morgan Stanley’s worldwide 12-person Operating Committee.
 
During an era of unprecedented growth of the major investment banks, Waters advised some of the largest multinational companies in the world. M&A Departments grew from fewer than 20 people to over 350 and analyst classes grew from a mere handful to over 50. The resultant institutions often became characterized by bureaucracy, internal political battles, dysfunctional management, and poor treatment of junior personnel in a relentless effort to pitch and bring in deals. Despite this growth, advisory businesses declined in importance inside the major investment banks as a result of the immense profitability generated by lending and proprietary trading. Conflicts of interest became inevitable as many major investment banks became more interested in generating fees and trading profits than providing sound, impartial advice to clients. 
 
To counter these trends and avoid the conflicts of interest inherent in large, multi-product financial institutions, Waters founded Compass with a team of exceptional and like-minded professionals from around the world. Compass is focused on only two things: providing good advice and making good investments. Our clients repeatedly return because of this focus. The Compass culture is friendly, collegial, entrepreneurial, and focused on excellence – as should be expected from an entity clients are relying on for advice.
 
Although the firm has seen many successes on both the advisory and investing sides, it has chosen to maintain a low profile.
 
In its advisory business, Compass has completed over 50 transactions representing over $100 billion in aggregate transaction value. The firm’s transactions encompass a diverse range of industries, including airlines, automotive, consumer products, energy, financial services, industrials, media, real estate, technology, and telecom.
 
On the investing side of the business, the first Compass private equity fund focused on European industrial assets, deployed $850 million in seven investments (comprising 15 transactions) and returned $1.6 billion to its investors.
