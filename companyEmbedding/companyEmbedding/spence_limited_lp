Waterloo General Office






Spence brings together years of expertise to offer you the very best in quality interior fit-out and refurbishment. 
				Our range of clients in this field include commercial, retail, bespoke residential, education, hospitality and the science 
				and technology sectors. Our remit is not to provide our clients with a makeover but more importantly to provide craftsmanship, 
				attention to detail and robust, yet wonderful interiors that truly stand the test of time.
From Cat A/B developments to individual homes, from heavy or light industrial areas to the decommissioning of vacated 
				buildings, Spence work with owners, occupiers, developers and architects to transform unproductive spaces into hardworking 
				environments, unwelcome environments into attractive settings and simply to create memorable places that people want to live, 
				work, learn and relax in.
And because our Interiors and Refurbishment team is centrally backed by the Spence name, we are not only financially 
				stable, but we have the fiscal muscle to negotiate preferential costs on our clients’ behalf. We’re also mindful of 
				business-critical deadlines and know that whether you’re in retail or education, research or hospitality, ‘business as 
				usual’ is often of paramount importance, which is why Spence always work within and actively manage a continuous operating 
				policy when carrying out interior projects.
It’s why our clients keep returning to us and why, when you work with Spence, you can rely on a highly impressive track 
				record of quality and added value in interior refurbishment.

Spence’s vast experience, together with our organisational structure means we can, at any time, call upon the 
				right team for any projects that may not necessarily fall within the remit or scope of other construction companies. 
				It means we can provide a fast response and reactive, yet high quality service completely tailored to a client’s 
				needs, no matter how specific they may be.
Quite often, because of the nature of the project, we are called upon at short notice to step in and take up 
				the reigns of an existing work-in-progress or it may be our client could just not find anyone willing or able to 
				take the work on. That’s exactly where our diverse and expert team can and does help. It has not only led to us
				helping out many clients in terms of meeting existing deadlines but also in getting highly bespoke projects off 
				the ground – as well as placing great emphasis on our own teams to produce increasingly innovative solutions.
In short, whatever your project, however specific or difficult you think it may be – talk to Spence first.
For further information, please contact us directly.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!
