Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated August 4, 2015 and Addendum dated August 5, 2015, Articles of Merger were filed on October 2, 2015 and, as a result, Clavo Rico has merged with a subsidiary of INCEPTION and has become a wholly-owned subsidiary of INCEPTION.  INCEPTION's officers will retain management control of the combined Company and INCEPTION will continue implementing operational changes and control over the Clavo Rico Operations.     
CLAVO RICO Ltd.'s principal mining operations in Honduras, Central America now operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company having positive revenue and significant resources.  Its mining concessions include several historical underground operations dating back to the early Mayan era and the Spanish occupation.  
The operating entity is engaged in processing a historical tailings ( >3gpt) body along with several open pit ( 3-6 + gpt) ore bodies, utilizing a new 650,000 ton membrane-lined leach system and ADR recovery plant.  Processing had increased to 500 oz per month prior to the last rain season at which time the company elected to install a new crushing circuit allowing for a planned increase in production of up to 1000+ oz's per month.  Expected production costs at this level are targeted at less than $500/oz.  The installation of a new Cone Crusher has allowed full production to resume.   New ore bodies associated with the purchase have been preliminarily mapped and drilled preparatory to an expanded 43-101 Reserve analysis and sufficient to begin mine planning leading to a  major expansion of operations. The acquisition includes lands and equipment of the current mining operations and primary concession along with the rights to proceed with exploration and exploitation on the additional concessions.  Our team will focus on bringing those new bodies to production within the next two years and will also embark on a comprehensive mapping of the additional concessions. 
Michael Ahlin, the Company's CEO stated, "In today's tumultuous resource market, survival requires revenue and production, cost control, and superior ore grades, coupled with very focused, well thought out exploration programs. The Clavo Rico acquisition fits that model.  We are very fortunate to be able to couple a proven operation with our existing near production operation in Idaho.  The merger of our entities provides for a synergistic coupling of assets and structure that will allow us to grow and continue our expansion goals."  CLAVO RICO executive management has agreed to board positions and to remain available as needed to effect the transition.  INCEPTION management will be retained to manage the combined operations. 
The Company also currently owns and operates The UP and Burlington patented mining claims near Salmon, Idaho.  The claims are a historically-proven operation with a surface exposed vein of high-grade ore that allowed immediate access with minimal overburden removal.  In 2014, the Company secured all necessary permitting, completed access roads and improved all onsite roads necessary to complete phase one of its bulk sampling program and opening one of the historical adits.  The Company's 2015 operations have been temporarily halted pending completion of the above-announced merger.

Inception Mining Inc. (the Company) is engaged in identifying, exploration, acquisition and development of mineral properties. Our initial focus has been directed towards precious metals, recognizing the state of the industry and the multiple opportunities that have surfaced due to the economic upheaval in the sector.
 Our first acquisition, the “Up & Burlington” patented mining claims near Salmon, Idaho is a tight vein ore body with historical production, significant ore grades, excellent metallurgy and modest permitting requirements. We have received all necessary permits to begin a bulk sampling program, summer 2014. The vein is surface-exposed, allowing for ease of extraction, while allowing for further resource confirmation via opening and assaying the existing adits, along with a drill program that will expand our 43-101 to a full resource analysis.
 The Company will capitalize on the availability of a surplus of resources in all segments, including geological, mining, equipment, and processing, making INCEPTION  one of the few operations to bring a gold mine to production this year. While others are suffering at current prices with all in costs close to spot prices, INCEPTION should realize significant net profits due to high ore values, coupled with tight cost control measures and availability of mining resources.
 The Company will continue to seek out other mining opportunities, focused on both historical operations and new resource exploration.   Management is focused on a non-operator model, utilizing existing resources, contract miners, operating toll processing facilities and independent geological consultants. Ours is a low overhead financial model with management’s primary concern on production and resultant profitability. The company intends to acquire several properties with a combination of cash and equity.

Inception Mining is well-positioned in today’s marketplace of fluctuating pricesInception Mining Inc. (“Inception”) is a producing gold mining 
company it is engaged in the identification, exploration, acquisition 
and development of mineral properties. Their initial focus has been 
directed towards precious metals, after recognizing the current state of
 the industry and the multiple opportunities that have surfaced due to 
the economic upheaval in the sector. Inception plans to capitalize on 
the availability of a surplus of resources in all segments, including 
geological, mining, equipment, and processing. While others are 
suffering, Inception may realize a significant advantage due to high 
mined material values, coupled with tight cost control measures and 
availability of mining resources.
Our first acquisition, the U.P. & Burlington patented mining 
claims near Salmon, Idaho, is a tight vein system with historical 
production, significant material grades, excellent metallurgy and modest
 permitting requirements. We have received all necessary permits and 
have begun bulk sampling program. The vein is surface-exposed, allowing 
for ease of extraction, while allowing for further resource confirmation
 via opening and assaying the existing adits.
As of 2015, Inception also owns and operates the Clavo Rico mine. 
This producing gold mine is located on the 200 hectare Clavo Rico 
Concession, located in southern Honduras. The area has been explored and
 proven to be a profitable source of gold reserves since the 16th 
century, originally by the Spanish and more recently by the local 
residents. The current operation has the capacity to process up to 1,000
 tons of material per day, with low recovery costs.

Clavo Rico MineTimelessSpanish explorers found untold wealth in the hills of Central and 
South America and made Spain a world power. Today, a company with a 
philosophy fitted to responsibly extract gold from high-grade deposits 
in those same Central American hills is equally determined to create 
abundant wealth for its shareholders.
In the Clavo Rico concession, strong geological evidence 
suggests that deep gold sulphide deposits may contain much more gold 
than the oxide deposits nearer the surface.The Clavo Rico
Inception’s producing mine is located on the 200 hectare Clavo Rico 
Concession, located in southern Honduras. This mine was 
originally explored and exploited in the 16th century by the Spanish, 
and more recently has been operated by Compania Minera Cerros del Sur, 
S. de R.L. as a small family business. In 2003, Clavo Rico’s predecessor
 purchased a 20% interest and later increased its ownership to 99.5%. Since then over five million dollars in the 
expansion and development of the mine and surrounding properties.
To grow from the small family-owned business to today’s gold recovery operation has taken millions of dollars of investment 
and the rock solid commitment of Management. Although there have been 
unforeseen obstacles ranging from record levels of rain fall to problems
 with contractors and delivery of equipment, Management has remained 
committed to bringing the mine to a successfully operating and reaching 
junior mining status.
The operations begin by crushing ore to approximately 3/8 inch size 
pebbles, which is then mixed with additives, and loaded on the recovery 
pad for processing. The material is then sprinkled with a solution that 
leaches the gold from the rock, the solution is collected and processed 
on-site at Clavo Rico’s own ADR plant. The dore bars that result from 
this process are shipped to the USA for refining.
Inception’s current recovery operation has been sized to handle up to 1,000 tons of mined material per day
	which is placed on a recovery bed that has the capacity to receive up 
to 500,000 tons of material. This represents a sizeable increase in the 
capacity and therefore the actual gold recovered is expected to increase
 as the operations adjust. The company commenced full operations on 
January 1, 2012 and believes that gold content bodies 
have been located and blocked out. To operate an operation of this magnitude, the 
management will contract with top level geologists and mine engineers to
 maximize the efficiencies of the operation to make the mine as 
profitable as possible for shareholders, and to ensure the life of the 
project for many years.
Preliminary drilling undertaken by the company and the assays of 
samples indicate that the material should have grades in the range of  
0- 5 grams of gold per ton, which makes this body equal to or greater to
 some of the highest-producing mines in Central and South America. This may mean that the gold contained in the material
 sampled could be recoverable.
GeologyThe Geology Of Southern Honduras
The southern region of Honduras lies in a rich geological zone which 
extends from El Salvador through the coastal belt of southern Honduras 
and well into Nicaragua. This belt of Matagalpa volcanics hosts numerous
 large and high-grade gold deposits. In colonial times, the area was 
called “El Tabanco.” Trachytic and rhyolitic domes pierce the entire 
sequence. The latter form the prominent “needles” in the hilly to 
moderately mountainous topography of the region and appear to play a 
role in the genesis of the gold deposits.
Exploitation – Surface Gold
Gold veins are formed when super-heated water carrying heavy 
concentrations of gold rises closer to the earth’s surface. In those 
areas where the veins reach close to the earth’s surface, the minerals 
bearing the gold are exposed to oxygen and begin to oxidize or break 
down, leaving gold deposits in oxide minerals that are easily broken 
down with chemicals, releasing the gold.
Honduras is renowned for its gold deposits, especially its abundant 
deposits of oxidized minerals containing gold. Glamis Gold reported that
 its San Martin mine in Honduras was its largest producing mine 
exceeding its projected 100,000 oz of gold in 2001.
U.P. & Burlington ProjectRegional GeologyThe U.P. & Burlington mine is one of numerous epithermal 
precious metal deposits spatially and genetically related to the 
trans-Challis fault system, a broad northeast-trending structural system
 that has been traced 270 kilometers across the center of the state of 
Idaho, from Idaho City and the Boise Basin in the southwest, to the 
Montana border beyond the city of Salmon in the northeast. Features of 
the trans-Challis fault system such as the extent and linearity of the 
system, the high-angle nature of the faults, aligned grabens, Eocene 
igneous intrusions, a caldera, and post-intrusive adjustment along the 
faults, all indicate that the regional structure is a major zone of 
Eocene rifting and crustal extension. Faults and fractures, domes, and 
grabens of the trans-Challis fault system controlled the locations for 
vein-filling precious metals and hydrothermal activity. (Bennett, 1984; 
Kilsgaard & others, 1986; Johnson & others, 1988). The Boise 
Basin, at the southwest end of the trans-Challis fault system, produced 
2.9 million ounces from 1863-1980, more gold than any other mining 
locality in Idaho. At the opposite, northeastern end of the fault 
system, there are more than a dozen epithermal gold-silver deposits of 
Tertiary age with common characteristics, including the U.P. & 
Burlington mine. They are all vein deposits with simple mineralogy (i.e.
 quartz gangue) with free gold and auriferous pyrite, and they are in 
northeast-trending shears or fissures of the trans-Challis fault system.
 Mineral deposits along the trans-Challis structural system are hosted 
by a variety of country rock types: Upper Cretaceous granitic rocks of 
the Idaho batholith, Tertiary dikes, Eocene plutonic rocks and dikes, 
Paleozoic or PreCambrian roof pendants within the Idaho batholith, 
pyroclastic rocks of the Eocene Challis volcanics, or, as in the case of
 the U.P. & Burlington mine, Precambrian meta-sedimentary and 
igneous rocks. (Kilsgaard & others, 1986).

Timeless
Spanish explorers found untold wealth in the hills of Central and South America and made Spain a world power. Today, a company with a philosophy fitted to responsibly extract gold from high-grade deposits in those same Central American hills is equally determined to create abundant wealth for its shareholders.
In the Clavo Rico concession, strong geological evidence suggests that deep gold sulphide deposits may contain much more gold than the oxide deposits nearer the surface. Such deposits are what make “world-class mines.”

 The Clavo Rico
Inception’s producing mine is located on the 200 hectare Clavo Rico Concession, located in southern Honduras. This mine was originally explored and exploited in the 16th century by the Spanish, and more recently has been operated by Compania Minera Cerros del Sur, S. de R.L. as a small family business. In 2003, Clavo Rico’s predecessor purchased a 20% interest and later increased its ownership to 99.5%. This company has since invested over five million dollars in the expansion and development of the mine and surrounding properties.
To grow from the small family-owned business to today’s state of the art gold recovery operation has taken millions of dollars of investment and the rock solid commitment of Management. Although there have been unforeseen obstacles ranging from record levels of rain fall to problems with contractors and delivery of equipment, Management has remained committed to bringing the mine to a successfully operating and reaching junior mining status.
The operations begin by crushing ore to approximately 3/8 inch size pebbles, which is then mixed with additives, and loaded on the recovery pad for processing. The material is then sprinkled with a solution that leaches the gold from the rock, the solution is collected and processed on-site at Clavo Rico’s own ADR plant. The dore bars that result from this process are shipped to the USA for refining.
Inception’s current recovery operation has been sized to handle up to 1,000 tons of mined material per day which is placed on a recovery bed that has the capacity to receive up to 500,000 tons of material. This represents a sizeable increase in the capacity and therefore the actual gold recovered is expected to increase as the operation adjust. The company commenced full operations on January 1, 2012 and believes that sufficiently high gold content bodies have been located and blocked out to load the recovery bed to capacity by the end of 2017. To operate an operation of this magnitude, the management will contract with top level geologists and mine engineers to maximize the efficiencies of the operation to make the mine as profitable as possible for shareholders, and to ensure the life of the project for many years.
Preliminary drilling undertaken by the company and the assays of samples indicate that the material should have grades in the range of  0- 5 grams of gold per ton, which makes this body equal to or greater to some of the highest-producing mines in Central and South America. This gives us every reason to believe that the gold contained in the material sampled could be recoverable.
