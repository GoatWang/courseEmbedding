Oracle Selects Apps Associates as Business Intelligence Pillar Partner



Share Article

















Apps Associates LLC, a leading IT services provider and product development company, has been selected by Oracle Corporation as Business Intelligence ("BI") Pillar Partner for the Northeast US region.






Westford, MA (PRWEB)
October 29, 2009
 Apps Associates LLC, a leading IT services and product development company, has been selected by Oracle Corporation as Business Intelligence ("BI") Pillar Partner for the Northeast US region.  This recognition is part of the "Partner Sales Readiness Verification Initiative" announced earlier this year by Oracle.  The initiative was developed to identify partners in North America with proven expertise in strategic technology areas such as Business Intelligence, Identity Management and Fusion Middleware.  Oracle will nominate and select 1 or 2 partners for each region which must then pass stringent competency requirements within the designated pillar technology.  Oracle has designed this program to further collaborate with partners and drive revenue based on specialization within the market.
"Being chosen for BI Pillar Partner status is a tremendous achievement and rewards the commitment and investment that our company has made in Oracle Business Intelligence over the past few years", said Sridhar Bogelli, President and Founder of Apps Associates.  "Most importantly, the BI Pillar Partner verification recognizes the success that our clients have realized in the adoption and deployment of BI to help them achieve their business objectives."
Key members of the Apps Associates sales team and Business Intelligence business unit have completed the necessary verification testing and are already working to support the Oracle field sales team by sharing implementation best practices and BI project successes with the Oracle user community.  Earlier this month, Apps Associates was selected to present BI case studies during sessions at Oracle OpenWorld held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco.

          Topco Cuts Costs, Boosts Private Label Penetration With WebFOCUS        























 


Food Industry Aggregator Uses Information Builders Solutions to Create Global View of Critical Information
Topco Associates LLC, a privately held grocery cooperative, provides innovative business solutions for its food industry member-owners and customers focused on developing, procuring, and delivering store-wide product and service solutions. Primarily focused around a retailer’s private label offerings, Topco leverages the collective volume, knowledge, and commitment of its 52 member-owners to create a competitive advantage in the retail marketplace and boasts annual sales in excess of $11.6 billion.
Topco recently selected Information Builders to resolve its business intelligence (BI), data integration, and information integrity challenges – the backbone of a five-year information technology modernization project. The goal of this initiative is to enhance information intelligence practices that, in turn, will speed time to market and improve results for members. Topco purchased Information Builders’ WebFOCUS BI platform to create and deliver intelligent dashboards that produce insight at a glance and reports that provide Topco management with a simpler and more effective way of answering questions without constant assistance from the IT staff.
“We wanted to standardize our data upstream so we can present it more easily and accurately downstream,” says Russell Mann, a director of Finance at Topco Associates. “After a careful evaluation, we engaged Information Builders to construct a data lifecycle management framework that helps us deliver accurate information for both operational and reporting needs.”
Exposing the Data
Topco’s business goals include reducing product costs and increasing private label penetration to help its members compete with larger national competitors. One of the project’s early objectives was to expose operational and sales data in ways the business could quickly assess and respond.
Getting to basic data was not easy, due to Topco’s diverse back-end infrastructure. The company has numerous departmental database applications along with about two dozen off-line data marts serving specific needs. For example, it stores the core operational information in an IBM DB2 database on an AS/400 computer, product information in various Microsoft SQL Server databases, and domain-specific information about certain product categories in a cloud-based solution from an application service provider (ASP). Lacking data governance standards, it wasn’t clear which department was responsible for which data.
“Our previous information management practices were labor intensive and inefficient,” admits Mann. “Over the years different groups had begun to use the data in different ways without always taking the time to coordinate their activities. According to internal estimates, the cost to maintain master data was four times higher than it should be and it took too long to develop new products, which was limiting growth.”
The grocery industry operates on extremely slim margins, averaging 1.5 percent to 2 percent. Operational expenses are always scrutinized and IT dollars must be spent carefully. While some consultants advised Topco to implement a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, the Topco team was leery of embarking on such a project.
Instead, Mann and his colleagues decided to engage Information Builders to help them improve the information systems that they already have and to create a framework of data that will support new technologies when necessary. Information Builders competed against all of the other players in the BI segment. Topco picked Information Builders because of the robust solutions for business intelligence and data governance, which are flexible enough to work with and bring together existing technologies. It is this unified data framework created by the Information Builders’ technologies that will support Topco’s business transformation into a true data-driven company.
“Now we are using data to drive our business transformation,” explains Mann. “Information Builders’ integrated suite of solutions let us expose data consistently so people can respond to changes in a fast and effective way.”
Leading With Business Intelligence
Mann and his team are approaching the modernization project with two initial phases. During phase one they created a sales data warehouse that feeds WebFOCUS dashboards branded, “TopFacts.” This dashboard has several different tabs for monitoring sales by program, customer, and brand, along with an analysis tab that lets program managers, buyers, and analysts examine the sales data. Embedded charts and graphs are dynamically updated with new data, so people don’t have to go looking for information.
TopFacts includes canned reports as well as an ad hoc reporting tab that permits detailed drilldowns. Several reports address fill rates, allowing users to analyze information about items that have been warehoused, ordered, shipped, and received from vendors. Employees across the organization use the new BI environment. About 3,000 suppliers, their member-owners, and customers will access it in the near future.
WebFOCUS can access many databases directly, alleviating the need to build and maintain multiple data warehouses. “We liked WebFOCUS because it can work across multiple platforms to combine information, both online and offline, and we look forward to utilizing this as we develop on their platform,” says Mann.
In phase two, Topco is turning its attention to data quality and data governance. By creating a single reference point for common data elements such as vendor, member, item and price, Topco is improving its fundamental processes for ensuring data accuracy, streamlining data exchange, and creating a flexible data framework for new technology applications.
“There is no point in deploying new BI technology without first standardizing the data,” explains Mann. “Otherwise you will end up with unique reporting domains that lack consistency with each other.”
Expanding the Scope of Analysis
On the BI front, Topco is adding customer service data to the warehouse and creating new dashboards for products, customer service, labeling, and other domains. The company plans to use InfoAssist to replace Microsoft Access and Excel applications with a more cohesive end-user reporting environment. “Creating reporting objects from the data warehouse, then pointing InfoAssist at those objects, will improve consistency by eliminating private applications and data sources that don’t always agree with each other,” explains Mann.
Mann also looks forward to the new analytic capabilities in the most recent release of WebFOCUS. For example, he wants to use maps to frame results, and a tag/word cloud to visualize call center data so customer service personnel can more easily spot common SKUs and vendors in support threads. Similar to sentiment analysis, this type of pattern-matching could help customer service personnel to detect recurring problems quickly.
Topco is eliminating several third-party reporting environments as it standardizes on the Information Builders product set, including an Oracle Hyperion environment for operational sales and purchasing reporting that it plans to enhance and replace with WebFOCUS Performance Management Framework (PMF). Analysts are defining key performance indicators and cascading scorecards that extend from corporate-level goals to departmental directives. PMF facilitates this process with pre-defined templates for dashboards, analytics, and user management, along with multi-level scorecards to help managers monitor performance against stated targets.
“Instead of measuring progress year over year, we will be able to roll out a granular performance management environment that lets us set interim goals and extend accountability throughout the business,” says Mann.
While Topco is just beginning to see the fruits of its extensive modernization efforts, Mann believes that their early success with WebFOCUS proves that they are on the right path. “The tools are all in place,” he sums up. “As we improve the quality and consistency of our data, the potential impact on the business will be tremendous.”
