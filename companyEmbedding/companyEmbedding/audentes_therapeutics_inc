X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy (XLMTM)
The goal of gene therapy for XLMTM is long-term expression of myotubularin in muscle cells after administration of a vector carrying the MTM1 gene. Increased levels of myotubularin are expected to produce improvement in the profound muscle weakness and respiratory impairment in XLMTM.
AT342
Crigler-Najjar Syndrome
The goal of gene therapy for Crigler-Najjar Syndrome is the long-term expression of the UGT1A1 enzyme in the liver after administration of a vector carrying the UGT1A1 gene. Increased levels of UGT1A1 are expected to lower serum bilirubin levels and reduce the risk of irreversible neurological damage and death.
AT982
Pompe DiseaseThe goal of gene therapy for Pompe disease is long-term expression of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) in muscle and nerve tissue after administration of a vector carrying the GAA gene. Increased levels of GAA are expected to produce improvement in the muscular weakness and respiratory impairment evident in Pompe Disease.AT307
CASQ2-related CPVT
The goal of gene therapy for CASQ2-CPVT is long-term expression of calsequestrin 2 in cardiac muscle cells. Increased levels of calsequestrin 2 are expected to enable the heart to maintain a normal rhythm and reduce the risk of life threatening arrythmias.

AT132X-Linked Myotubular Myopathy (XLMTM)
The goal of gene therapy for XLMTM is long-term expression of myotubularin in muscle cells after administration of a vector carrying the MTM1 gene. Increased levels of myotubularin are expected to produce improvement in the profound muscle weakness and respiratory impairment in XLMTM.
AT342Crigler-Najjar Syndrome
The goal of gene therapy for Crigler-Najjar Syndrome is the long-term expression of the UGT1A1 enzyme in the liver after administration of a vector carrying the UGT1A1 gene. Increased levels of UGT1A1 are expected to lower serum bilirubin levels and reduce the risk of irreversible neurological damage and death.
AT982Pompe Disease
The goal of gene therapy for Pompe disease is long-term expression of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) in muscle and nerve tissue after administration of a vector carrying the GAA gene. Increased levels of GAA are expected to produce improvement in the muscular weakness and respiratory impairment evident in Pompe Disease.
AT307CASQ2-related CPVT
The goal of gene therapy for CASQ2-CPVT is long-term expression of calsequestrin 2 in cardiac muscle cells. Increased levels of calsequestrin 2 are expected to enable the heart to maintain a normal rhythm and reduce the risk of life threatening arrythmias.

Our Approach









			Our Approach		


admin 


			2017-06-15T12:30:56+00:00		



Our vision is to become a fully integrated and industry-leading biotechnology company.







Highly Focused Selection Criteria for Development ProgramsWe use a focused set of criteria to select product candidates that we believe have the best chance of success. We believe the application of our selection criteria enables the efficient, cost-effective and successful development of our product candidates. These criteria include:

Serious, life-threatening rare diseases;
Monogenic diseases with well-understood biology;
Disease characteristics well-suited for treatment with AAV gene therapy technology;
High potential for meaningful clinical benefit;
Compelling preclinical data;
Clear measures for evaluation in clinical trials; and
Opportunities for expedited development through established regulatory pathways.





Proprietary Know-how and CapabilitiesWe believe the quality, reliability and scalability of our gene therapy manufacturing approach is critical to our long-term success.
Our proprietary manufacturing capabilities provide better control over the cost and timelines of developing our product candidates, superior protection of novel inventions and intellectual property, and expanded possibilities for new programs and partnerships.












Broadening and Leveraging Our Collaborative NetworkWe believe our strong relationships with key opinion leaders, leading academic institutions, other rare disease companies and patient advocacy groups will support our product development efforts and our potential for future commercial success.
Leveraging our collaborations with these parties allows us to better understand the diseases we target and optimize our research, clinical development and commercial plans.

As a clinical researcher, Dr. Dimmock has developed an international reputation for bringing innovative diagnostic testing strategies into the clinic. He is passionate about improving the standard of care for children and adults with inborn errors of metabolism. His research laboratory focuses on improving the diagnosis of mitochondrial and single gene disorders that affect the liver. He has published scientific articles on improved diagnostic testing for these disorders as well as small molecule and gene therapy approaches. Dr. Dimmock has been an invited advisor to the FDA and the Institute of Medicine, and has been involved in more than 15 trials for novel therapeutics in rare disorders, serving as the site primary investigator for 13 trials. He is excited at the opportunities that gene therapy through Audentes can afford his patients with rare disorders.

WelcomeThe role of Patient Advocacy at Audentes is to bring the voices of the patient community to Audentes and the voice of Audentes to the patient community.
Our commitment to patient advocacy is one of our core corporate values. The individuals and families affected by the rare and devastating diseases we serve are our partners, collaborators and teachers.
We believe patients, families and patient advocacy groups should have an integral role in all aspects of our drug development process, from the initiation of a clinical program to its completion and beyond.
We accomplish this through activities such as patient focus groups, attendance at patient advocacy meetings, our patient focused website, and one on one meetings with patients and their advocates.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
