	This website does not represent a prospectus or an offering memorandum under the laws of any jurisdiction. Please refer to the applicable prospectus or offering documents for further details of the risks, fees, and expenses involved in connection with an investment in any particular Superfund fund.

The performance results shown on this website are reported net of fees and expenses, with the exception of subscription and redemption fees (if any).

	The information contained herein has been compiled from sources deemed reliable and is accurate to the best of the publisher’s knowledge. However, its complete accuracy, completeness and reliability cannot be guaranteed. Estimations are based on opinions at the time of analysis. Changes of these estimations are not required to be published. Any liability for possible mistakes is hereby expressly disclaimed and excluded. Past performance of the financial products contained in this website, especially performance figures of Superfund Q-AG (closed fund), Superfund GCT USD/EUR (closed funds) and Superfund Cayman Master Class A (closed fund), are not indicative of future results for these or any other products. They exclusively serve as a historical presentation of the performance of their respective trading managers and of certain members of the Superfund Group. Every capital investment contains risks. The value of an investment may fall as well as rise.

	No subscriptions or follow-up subscriptions from existing investors are possible or will be accepted in closed funds. Superfund funds may be subject to certain conflicts of interests.

All financial products managed by members of the Superfund Group are speculative investments and a total loss of the principal invested cannot be excluded.

	Fluctuations in the USD/EUR exchange rate may substantially decrease the net asset value in products traded in US Dollars.

Important notice to Superfund Green products: There is a substantial risk of loss in trading futures and options. Drawdowns may occur due to market conditions and may range approximately from 20% to 30% from the respective all-time-high of Green strategy A, from 30% to 40% of the respective all–time high of Green strategy B and from 40% to 50% of the respective all–time high of Green strategy C. Decreases in value exceeding these figures are also possible at anytime, and the possibility of a complete loss of the principal invested cannot be excluded.

Important Notice to Superfund Red, Superfund Red Gold and Superfund Red Silver: There is a substantial risk of loss in trading futures and options. Drawdowns may occur regularly due to market conditions and may range approximately from 30% to 50% from the respective all-time-high. Decreases in value exceeding these figures are also possible at anytime, and the possibility of a complete loss of the principal invested cannot be excluded. Superfund Red USD, Superfund Red Gold and Superfund Red Silver are traded in USD. Fluctuations in the USD/EUR exchange rate may substantially decrease the net asset value.

Special Risk Considerations for Investments in Superfund Blue
	Superfund Blue SPC Class A (EUR) and Class A (Gold) may not involve the direct purchase and sale of equity securities, but rather may trade synthetically through total return swaps on such securities utilizing a leverage of up to four times of the funds assets. Swap investments through a prime broker bear the issuer risk of the respective broker. Drawdowns may occur regularly due to market conditions and may range approximately from 10% to 15% from the respective all-time-high. Decreases in value exceeding these figures are also possible at anytime, and the possibility of a complete loss of the principal invested cannot be excluded.

Special Risk Considerations for Investments in Superfund Green/Blue Gold: In addition to the trading results of the respective Superfund trading strategy, the value of shares of Superfund Green/Blue Gold will be directly affected by movements in the U.S. dollar price of gold. DEPRECIATION OF THE GOLD PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND GREEN/Blue GOLD. If general trading restrictions of the offering documents make it impossible to fully hedge the assets of Superfund Green/Blue Gold against the gold price, then the gold hedge position will be held as close as possible to the desired full hedge, without blocking assets that are necessary for the generally applied Superfund trading strategy, which will always retain priority within the trading process. NO GUARANTEE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PROCEEDS OF SUPERFUND GREEN/BLUE GOLD ARE ALWAYS FULLY HEDGED TO THE CURRENT GOLD PRICE. Since the price of gold may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, Superfund Green/Blue Gold may be more volatile than other types of investments.

	A decrease in the USD price of futures and forwards linked to gold, due to these risk factors or other potential factors that may directly affect the price of gold, will have a direct effect on the NAV of Superfund Green/Blue Gold.

Special Risk Considerations for Investments in Superfund Red Gold/Silver: In addition to the trading results of the Superfund Red trading strategy, the value of shares of Superfund Red Gold/Silver will be directly affected by movements in the U.S. dollar price of gold or silver. DEPRECIATION OF THE GOLD/SILVER PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND RED GOLD/SILVER. If general trading restrictions of the offering documents make it impossible to fully hedge the assets of Superfund Red Gold/Silver against the gold/silver price, then the gold/silver hedge position will be held as close as possible to the desired full hedge, without blocking assets that are necessary for the generally applied Superfund Red trading strategy, which will always retain priority within the trading process. NO GUARANTEE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE TOTAL INVESTMENT PROCEEDS OF SUPERFUND RED GOLD/SILVER ARE ALWAYS FULLY HEDGED TO THE CURRENT GOLD/SILVER PRICE. Since the price of gold/silver may fluctuate substantially over short periods of time, Superfund Red Gold/Silver may be more volatile than other types of investments. A decrease in the USD price of futures and forwards linked to gold/silver, due to these risk factors or other potential factors that may directly affect the price of gold/silver, will have a direct effect on the NAV of Superfund Red Gold/Silver.

	DEPRECIATION OF THE GOLD PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND RED GOLD. DEPRECIATION OF THE SILVER PRICE WILL DIRECTLY DECREASE THE NET ASSET VALUE (IN USD AND OTHER CURRENCIES) OF SUPERFUND RED SILVER.

IMPORTANT NOTICE REGARDING SIMULATED PERFORMANCE FOR SUPERFUND RED:

	The simulated performance results for Superfund Red are provided for informational purposes only to indicate historical performance had a comparable Superfund product strategy been available over the relevant period. No representation is being made that any investment in Superfund Red EUR, USD, Gold or Silver will or is likely to achieve results similar to those shown. Past and simulated performance is not indicative of future results. Although the simulation includes adjustments for certain fees payable by the new strategies, the simulated performance results may vary once actual fees are taken into account. Your attention is specifically drawn to the fact that the simulated performance of Superfund Red, Red Gold and Red Silver is based in USD and on the price of gold and silver based in USD and that fluctuations during this time in the USD/EUR exchange rate have not been considered or included in the simulated performance. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. No representation is being made that any investment will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those shown. In fact, there are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and the actual results subsequently achieved by any particular fund.

	There is no single entity or legal body that constitutes the “Superfund Group”. Rather, the Superfund group of investment companies is a consortium of affiliated entities that collectively provide the management, trading advisory, sales and marketing services for the managed futures funds which utilize the same Superfund brand systematic trend-following strategy. Absent valid express written authorization by the company to be bound, no entity within the Superfund group of investment companies shall be liable or incur responsibility for any act or omission of any other entity within the Superfund group of investment companies.

	SUPERFUND MARKETING & SPORT SPONSORING, INC. CREATED THIS WEBSITE FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY INACCURACIES CONTAINED IN THIS WEBSITE, AND SHALL NOT BE HELD LIABLE FOR THE SAME.

Composition







SummaryAll Superfund products are based on fully automated computer trading systems, designed primarily to profit from price trends. The Superfund trading systems are able to choose from more than 100 futures markets worldwide - bonds, stock indices, currencies, commodities.Investment StrategyThe Company's objective is to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in derivative instruments - such as forward contracts or futures on commodities, currencies, interest rates-, in units or shares of other undertakings for collective investment, primarily Hedge Funds, or directly in transferable securities or other assets and financial instruments authorized by the Law, or a combination of the investments mentioned above. All Superfund products are based on fully automated computer trading systems. Diversification: Superfund funds trade futures in many financial centers around the globe. Bonds, stock indices and currencies are traded as well as commodites like crude oil, gold, wheat, coffee, cattle and cotton. The Superfund trading systems are able to choose from more than 100 futures markets worldwide and are constantly on the lookout for attractive investment opportunities. Diversification is also achieved by a low correlation between the individual traded contracts. Technical Analysis: The Superfund trading strategy uses self-developed, fully-automated computerized trading systems. The systems use a wide array of technical indicators to identify price patterns offering a high probability of success. Based on these price patterns, the trading systems automatically issue real time buy and sell orders. Trend Following Strategies: The Superfund trading systems were designed primarily to profit from price trends. The lifespan of these trends varies; some last for a few days, others for several months. The key to success lies in limiting draw downs through the continual updating of stop-loss orders. In this way, if a trend reverses, losses can be limited; if a trend continues, profits can accumulate. Money Management: Consistent risk management represents the most important element of the Superfund trading strategy. It limits initial risk per trade to a pre-determined maximum of 2.0 percent of the fund's total assets. In addition, the trading systems continuously screen volatility and adjust portfolio exposure accordingly.

We collect this information from a variety of sources including:- Information we receive from you on this web site, if any; Subscription Agreements; or other forms, whether written or electronic. This information may include, but is not limited to, your name, address, social security number, and information about your level of income, net worth and investment experience.- Information about your transactions with us and our affiliates or others. This information could include your use of various products or services that we and our affiliates provide.- Information we receive from our affiliates.- Information we receive from other third parties such as demographic firms. This information could include investment preferences.- Information we receive from you online, such as "cookies" (small pieces of data stored by your Internet browser on your computer) or other technology that may be used to, among other things, remember passwords for you, help us track your web site usage, or provide you with customized content.Information we discloseSuperfund Capital Management, Inc. or its affiliates does not disclose any information on current or former clients or investors to any nonaffiliated third party except as permitted or required by law. For example, we may:- share information with regulatory authorities and law enforcement officials who have jurisdiction over us or if we are required to do so by United States or other applicable law;- provide information to protect against fraud;- share information with your prior consent; and- share information with service providers that perform administrative or marketing services on our behalf or to our accountants, attorneys and auditors.In addition, we may share information about you with our affiliates as permitted by law such as information about your transactions or experiences with us, our affiliates or others.

Series A and B involve substantial risk and may result in the complete loss of principal invested.- Each series is speculative and is leveraged from time to time. As a result of leveraging a small movement in the price of a contract can cause major losses. We will monitor the leverage of each Series regularly but it is not limited by the amount of leverage it may employ.- There is no secondary market for the investment offering and redemptions are only limited to certain periods.- Cash foreign currency markets which are subject to high volatility which can be caused by many unpredictable factors including general economic and financial conditions, governmental politics, national and international political and economic events, and changes in interest rates.- Substantial expenses must be offset by trading profits and interest income for each series to be profitable.- Performance is expected to be volatile; the net asset value per unit may fluctuate significantly in a single month.- Superfund Capital Management, Inc. is the sole trading advisor for the fund. The use of a single advisor could mean a lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk.- A fund's trading operations may be successful, yet the fund may still sustain losses if the value of the gold position declines by more than the amount of profits generated by the fund's trading operations. Likewise, a fund's gains, if any, from its gold position may be offset by losses incurred in its futures and forward trading.- A fund may fail to achieve its objective of maintaining a dollar for dollar investment in gold if gold futures margins increase substantially, in which case the fund may reduce its gold position and continue its futures and forward trading.You should carefully consider whether your financial condition permits you to participate in a commodity pool. In so doing, you should be aware that Futures and Option Trading can quickly lead to large losses as well as gains. Such trading losses can sharply reduce the Net Asset Value of the pool and consequently the value of you interest in the pool. In addition, restrictions on redemptions may affect your ability to withdraw your participation in the pool. Further, commodity pools may be subject to substantial charges for Management and Advisory and Brokerage Fees. It may be necessary for those pools that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. The Disclosure Document contains a complete description of these principal risk factors, each expense to be charged this pool and a statement of the amount, as a percentage return and dollar amount, necessary to break even, that is, to recover the amount of you initial investment.The Regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading Commision ('CFTC') require that prospective investors receive a Disclosure Document when they are solicited to Invest Funds in a commodity pool and that certain risk factors be highlighted. This document is readily accessible at this site. This brief statement cannot disclose all of the risks and other factors necessary to evaluate your participation in this commodity pool. Therefore, you should proceed directly to the Disclosure Document and study it carefully to determine wheter such trading is appropriate for you in light of your financial condition. You are encouraged to access the Disclosure Document by clicking below. You will not incur any additional charges by accessing the Disclosure Document. You may also request delivery of a hardcopy of the Disclosure Document, which also will be provided to you at no cost. The CFTC has not passed upon the merits of participating in this pool nor on the adequacy or accuracy of the Disclosure Document.Before proceeding please download theProspectus for Superfund Green L.P.Prospectus for Superfund Gold L.P. .(You can either open the link as a PDF file and save or print it from there, or use the right mouse button to save target as onto your computer.If you do not have Adobe Acrobat please click here to download the software.)Residents of Massachusetts and Ohio: Please note that Superfund Green L.P. and Superfund Gold L.P. are not available to residents of your state.I have already downloaded the Prospectus for Superfund Green, L.P. and would like to proceed.

SUPERFUND GREEN,
L.P.



FORM OF FIFTH AMENDED AND
RESTATED LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT


     This Fifth Amended
and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement (the
“Agreement”) is made as of December 1, 2009, by
and among Superfund Capital Management, Inc. (formerly, Quadriga
Capital Management, Inc.), a Grenada corporation (the
“General Partner”) and each other party who becomes a
party to this Limited Partnership Agreement, whether by execution
of a counterpart hereof pursuant to a power of attorney or
otherwise agrees to be bound hereto by separate instrument, as an
owner of a unit (“Unit”) of beneficial interest in a
series (“Series”) created hereunder and who is shown on
the books and records of such Series as a Limited Partner
(individually, a “Limited Partner” and collectively,
the “Limited Partners”).


     1. 
Formation; Name. The parties to this Agreement have formed a
limited partnership under the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited
Partnership Act, as amended and in effect on the date of this
Agreement (the “Act”). The name of the limited
partnership is Superfund Green, L.P. (the
“Partnership”). The General Partner has executed and
filed a Certificate of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the
“Certificate of Limited Partnership”) in accordance
with the Act, and has executed, filed, recorded and published as
appropriate such amendments, assumed name certificates and other
documents as are or become necessary or advisable in connection
with the operation of the Partnership, as determined by the General
Partner, and will take all steps which the General Partner may deem
necessary or advisable to allow the Partnership to conduct business
as a limited partnership where the Partnership conducts business in
any jurisdiction, and to otherwise provide that Limited Partners
will have limited liability with respect to the activities of the
Partnership in all such jurisdictions, and to comply with the law
of any jurisdiction. Each Limited Partner hereby undertakes to
furnish to the General Partner a power of attorney and such
additional information as the General Partner may request to
complete such documents and to execute and cooperate in the filing,
recording or publishing of such documents as the General Partner
determines appropriate.


     2. (a)
Units of Limited Partnership. The beneficial interest in the
Partnership shall be divided into an unlimited number of Units. The
General Partner may, from time to time, authorize the division of
the Units into one or more Series as provided in Section 2(b)
below. All Units issued hereunder shall be fully paid and
nonassessable. The General Partner in its discretion may, from time
to time, without vote of the Limited Partners, issue Units, in
addition to the then issued and outstanding Units, to such party or
parties and for such amount and type of consideration, subject to
applicable law, including cash or securities, at such time or times
and on such terms as the General Partner may deem appropriate, and
may in such manner acquire other assets (including the acquisition
of assets subject to, and in connection with, the assumption of
liabilities) and businesses. In connection with any issuance of
Units, the General Partner may issue fractional Units. The General
Partner may from time to time divide or combine the Units into a
greater or lesser number without thereby changing the proportionate
beneficial interests in a particular Series. Contributions to a
Series of the Partnership may be accepted for, and Units of such
Series shall be redeemed as, whole Units and/or 1/1,000 of a Unit
or integral multiples thereof.


     (b) Creation of
Series. The Partnership shall consist of one or more separate
and distinct Series as contemplated by Section 17-218 of the
Act. The General Partner hereby establishes and designates the
following Series: “Superfund Green, L.P. Series A”
(“Series A”) and “Superfund Green, L.P.
Series B” (“Series B”) (each, a
“Series”). Any additional Series created hereunder
shall be established by the adoption of a resolution by the General
Partner and shall be effective upon the date stated therein (or, if
no such date is stated, upon the date of such adoption). The Units
of each Series shall have the relative rights and preferences
provided for herein and such rights as may be designated by the
General Partner. The General Partner shall cause separate and
distinct records for each Series to be maintained and the
Partnership shall hold and account for the assets belonging thereto
separately from the other Partnership property and the assets
belonging to any other Series. Each Unit of a Series shall
represent an equal beneficial interest in the net assets belonging
to that Series. Unless the establishing resolution or any other
resolution adopted pursuant to this Section 2(b) otherwise
provides, Units of each Series established hereunder shall have the
following relative rights and preferences:


     (i) Limited
Partners of a Series shall have no preemptive or other right to
subscribe to any additional Units in such Series or other
securities issued by the Partnership.


     (ii) All
consideration received by the Partnership for the issue or sale of
the Units within a Series, together with all assets in which such
consideration is invested or reinvested, all income, earnings,
profits, and proceeds thereof, including any proceeds derived form
the sale, exchange, or liquidation of such assets, and any funds or
payments derived from any reinvestment of such proceeds in whatever
form the same may be, shall be held and accounted for separately
from the other assets of the Partnership and of every other Series
and may be referred to herein as “assets belonging to”
that Series or the “Series Estate”. The assets
belonging to a particular Series shall belong to that Series for
all purposes, and to no other Series, subject only to the rights of
creditors of that Series. In addition, any assets, income,
earnings, profits, or payments and proceeds with respect thereto,
which are not readily identifiable as belonging to any particular
Series shall be allocated by the General Partner

1



 


between and
among one or more of the Series for all purposes and such assets,
income, earnings, profits, or funds, or payments and proceeds with
respect thereto, shall be assets belonging to that
Series.


     (iii) A
particular Series shall be charged with the liabilities of that
Series, and all expenses, costs, charges and reserves attributable
to any particular Series shall be borne by such Series. Any general
liabilities, expenses, costs, charges or reserves of the
Partnership (or any Series) that are not readily identifiable as
chargeable to or bearable by any particular Series shall be
allocated and charged by the General Partner between or among any
one or more of the Series in such manner as the General Partner in
its sole discretion deems fair and equitable. Each such allocation
shall be conclusive and binding upon the Limited Partners for all
purposes. Without limitation of the foregoing provisions of this
subsection, the debts, liabilities, obligations and expenses
incurred, contracted for or otherwise existing with respect to a
particular Series shall be enforceable against the assets of such
Series only, and not against the assets of the Partnership
generally or the assets belonging to any other Series. Notice of
this contractual limitation on inter-Series liabilities is set
forth in the Certificate of Limited Partnership and upon the giving
of such notice in the Certificate of Limited Partnership, the
statutory provisions of Section 17-218 of the Act relating to
limitations on inter-Series liabilities (and the statutory effect
under Section 17-218 setting forth such notice in the Certificate
of Limited Partnership) shall become applicable to the Partnership
and each Series.


     (c) Creation of
Accounts. For the benefit of the Series A Limited
Partners, the General Partner shall establish and maintain a
segregated account entitled “Superfund Green, L.P. Series A
Account” (the “Series A Account”). For the
benefit of the Series B Limited Partners, the General Partner
shall establish and maintain a segregated account entitled
“Superfund Green, L.P. Series B Account” (the
“Series B Account”). The General Partner hereby
acknowledges that it has deposited the sum of $1,000 in the
Series A Account and that it has deposited the sum of $1,000
in the Series B Account. The sums held in the Series A
Account shall be held for the benefit of the Series A Limited
Partners and the sums held in the Series B Account shall be
held for the benefit of Series B Limited Partners and such
accounts shall be segregated and separate records with respect
thereto shall be kept for purposes of Section 17-218 of the
Act. The General Partner shall hold, invest and disburse the funds
held in the accounts at its discretion.


     (d) Creation of
Additional Accounts. The General Partner is authorized to
establish and maintain one or more separate accounts for each
Series (the “Additional Accounts”) with such
institutions as the General Partner shall select for the following
purposes:


     (i) to receive and
deposit subscriptions for such Series; and


     (ii) to pay
Limited Partners for such Series for redemptions of all or a
portion of their Units.


     The General
Partner acknowledges that the funds held in any such Additional
Accounts of a Series will be held for that Series only and that
such Additional Accounts should be segregated from other Additional
Accounts and that separate records shall be maintained with respect
to each Additional Account.


     (e) Limited
Liability of Limited Partners. Each Unit, when purchased by a
Limited Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,
will be fully paid and nonassessable. No Limited Partner will be
liable for the Partnership’s obligations in excess of that
Partner’s unredeemed capital contribution, undistributed
profits, if any, and any distributions and amounts received upon
redemption of Units. The Partnership will not make a claim against
a Limited Partner with respect to amounts distributed to that
Partner or amounts received by that Partner upon redemption of
Units unless the Net Assets of the Partnership (which will not
include any right of contribution from the General Partner except
to the extent previously made by it under this Agreement) are
insufficient to discharge the liabilities of the Partnership which
have arisen before the payment of these amounts.


     3. 
Principal Office. The address of the principal office of
each Series shall be Superfund Capital Management, Inc., Superfund
Office Building, P.O. Box 1479, Grand Anse, St. George’s,
Grenada, West Indies; telephone (473) 439-2418. The General
Partner is located at the same address. Registered Agents Legal
Services, LLC shall receive service of process on each Series of
the Partnership in the State of Delaware at 1220 North Market
Street, Suite 606, Wilmington, Delaware 19801.


     4. 
Business. Each Series’ business and purpose is to
trade, buy, sell, swap or otherwise acquire, hold or dispose of
commodities (including, but not limited to, foreign currencies,
mortgage-backed securities, money market instruments, financial
instruments, and any other securities or items which are now, or
may hereafter be, the subject of futures contract trading),
domestic and foreign commodity futures contracts, commodity forward
contracts, foreign exchange commitments, options on physical
commodities and on futures contracts, spot (cash) commodities
and currencies, securities (such as United States Treasury
securities) approved by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) for investment of customer funds and other
securities on a limited basis, and any rights pertaining thereto
and any options thereon, whether traded on an organized exchange or
otherwise, and to engage in all activities necessary, convenient or
incidental thereto. Each Series may also engage in
“hedge,” arbitrage and cash trading of any of the
foregoing instruments. Each Series may engage in such business and
purpose either directly or through joint ventures, entities or
partnerships, provided that each Series’ participation in any
of the foregoing has no adverse economic or liability consequences
for the Limited Partners, which consequences would not be present
had each Series engaged in that same business or purpose directly.
The objective of

2



 


each
Series’ business is appreciation of its assets through
speculative trading by the General Partner and independent
professional trading advisors (“Advisors”) selected
from time to time by the General Partner.


     5. Term,
Dissolution, Fiscal Year.


     (a) Term.
The term of Series A and Series B commenced on the day on
which the Certificate of Limited Partnership was filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware pursuant to the
provisions of the Act and the term of any Series shall end upon the
first to occur of the following:


     (1)
December 31, 2050;


     (2) receipt by the
General Partner of an approval to dissolve such Series at a
specified time by Limited Partners owning Units representing more
than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding Units of such Series
then owned by Limited Partners of such Series, notice of which is
sent by certified mail return receipt requested to the General
Partner not less than 90 days prior to the effective date of
such dissolution;


     (3) withdrawal,
insolvency or dissolution of the General Partner or any other event
that causes the General Partner to cease to be the General Partner
of such Series, unless (i) at the time of such event there is
at least one remaining general partner of such Series who carries
on the business of each Series (and each remaining general partner
of such Series is hereby authorized to carry on the business of
general partner of such Series in such an event), or
(ii) within 120 days after such event Limited Partners of
such Series holding a majority of Units of such Series agree in
writing to continue the business of such Series and to the
appointment, effective as of the date of such event, of one or more
general partners of such Series;


     (4) a decline in
the aggregate Net Assets of such Series to less than $500,000 at
any time following commencement of trading in such
Series;


     (5) dissolution of
such Series pursuant hereto; or


     (6) any other
event which shall make it unlawful for the existence of such Series
to be continued or require termination of such Series.


     (b)
Dissolution. Upon the occurrence of an event causing the
dissolution of such Series, such Series shall be dissolved and its
affairs wound up. Upon dissolution of a Series, the General
Partner, or another person approved by Limited Partners of a
majority of the Units of such Series, shall act as liquidator
trustee.


     (c) Fiscal
Year. The fiscal year of each Series shall begin on January 1
of each year and end on the following December 31.


     (d) Net Asset
Value; Net Asset Value per Unit. The “Net Assets”
of each Series are such Series’ assets less such
Series’ liabilities determined in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. If a contract
cannot be liquidated on the day with respect to which Net Assets
are being determined, the settlement price on the first subsequent
day on which the contract can be liquidated shall be the basis for
determining the liquidating value of such contract for such day, or
such other value as the General Partner may deem fair and
reasonable. The liquidating value of a commodity futures or option
contract not traded on a commodity exchange shall mean its
liquidating value as determined by the General Partner on a basis
consistently applied for each different variety of contract.
Accrued Performance Fees (as described in the Prospectus defined in
Section 9 hereof) shall reduce Net Asset Value, even though
such Performance Fees may never, in fact, be paid. The “Net
Asset Value per Unit” of a Series is the Net Assets of such
Series divided by the number of Units outstanding within such
Series as of the date of determination. Each Series may issue an
unlimited number of Units at the Net Asset Value per
Unit.


     6.  Net
Worth of the General Partner. The General Partner agrees that
at all times so long as it remains general partner of a Series, it
will maintain its net worth at an amount not less than 5% of the
total contributions to the Partnership by all Partners and to any
other limited partnership for which it acts as a general partner by
all partners; provided, however, that in no event may the General
Partner’s net worth be less than $50,000 nor will it be
required to be more than $1,000,000. The requirements of the
preceding sentence may be modified if the General Partner obtains
an opinion of counsel for each Series that a proposed modification
will not adversely affect the treatment of such Series as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes and if such
modification will reflect or exceed applicable state securities and
Blue Sky laws limitations and qualify under any guidelines or
statements of policy promulgated by any body or agency constituted
by the various state securities administrators having jurisdiction
in the premises.


     7. 
Capital Contributions; Units. The Limited Partners’
respective capital contributions to each Series shall be as shown
on the books and records of the applicable Series. The General
Partner, so long as it is general partner of a Series and so long
as it is required to characterize such Series as a partnership for
federal income tax purposes, shall invest in such Series,
sufficient capital so that the General

3



 


Partner will
have at all times a capital account equal to at least 1% of the
total capital accounts of such Series (including the General
Partner’s). The General Partner may withdraw any interest it
may have in such Series in excess of such requirement, and may
redeem as of any month-end any interest which it may acquire on the
same terms as any Limited Partner of such Series, provided that it
must maintain the minimum interest in such Series described in the
preceding sentence. The requirements of this Section 7 may be
modified if the General Partner obtains an opinion of counsel for
such Series that a proposed modification will not adversely affect
the classification of such Series as a partnership for federal
income tax purposes and if such modification will reflect or exceed
applicable state securities and Blue Sky laws limitations and
qualify under any guidelines or statements of policy promulgated by
any body or agency constituted by the various state securities
administrators having jurisdiction in the premises. The General
Partner may, without the consent of any Limited Partners of a
Series, admit to such Series purchasers of Units as Limited
Partners of each Series. All Units subscribed for in a Series upon
receipt of a check or draft of the Limited Partner are issued
subject to the collection of the funds represented by such check or
draft. In the event a check or draft of a Limited Partner for Units
representing payment for Units in a Series is returned unpaid, such
Series shall cancel the Units issued to such Limited Partner
represented by such returned check or draft. Any losses or profits
sustained by a Series in connection with such Series’
commodity trading allocable to such cancelled Units of such Series
shall be deemed an increase or decrease in Net Assets of such
Series and allocated among the remaining Limited Partners within
such Series as described in Section 8. Each Series may require
a Limited Partner to reimburse such Series for any expense or loss
(including any trading loss) incurred in connection with the
issuance and cancellation of any Units issued to him or her. Any
Units acquired by the General Partner or any of its affiliates will
be non-voting, and will not be considered “outstanding”
for purposes of determining whether the majority approval of the
outstanding Units of a Series has been obtained. Each Limited
Partner of a Unit in a Series shall be deemed a beneficial owner of
such Series within the meaning of the Act. The General Partner and
each person selling Units on behalf of the Partnership may not
complete a sale of the Units to prospective investors until at
least five (5) business days after the date the prospective
investor receives a final prospectus.


     8. 
Allocation of Profits and Losses.


     (a) Capital
Accounts and Allocations. A capital account will be established
for each Partner. The initial balance of each Partner’s
capital account will be the amount of a Partner’s initial
capital contribution to a Series less, in the case of a Limited
Partner, the amount of offering expenses and selling commissions
initially allocable to the Limited Partner’s Units, if any.
As of the close of business (as determined by the General Partner)
on the last day of each calendar month (“Determination
Date”) during each fiscal year of a Series, the following
determinations and allocations will be made subsequently with
respect to each Series:


     (i) Net Assets
will be determined.


     (ii) Accrued
monthly management, ongoing offering, operating fees and selling
commissions will then be charged against Net Assets; provided that
in respect of Net Assets attributable to Units which are not
subject to selling commissions because (a) such Units were
sold by Superfund USA, Inc., or an affiliated broker, to Limited
Partners whose investment in the Partnership was recommended by a
registered investment adviser with which such Limited Partner
maintains an asset-based or fee-based advisory relationship
(b) such Units were sold on or after February 28, 2005
and have been charged and have paid selling commissions of 10% of
such Unit’s initial offering price, or (c) such units
were sold by Superfund USA, Inc., or an affiliated broker, to
commodity pools operated by commodity pool operators registered as
such with the NFA, the selling commissions charged as of the end of
each month shall not be paid out to any selling agent but shall
instead be credited to a suspense account (the “Suspense
Account”) which shall be used solely as a means of
efficiently accounting for the inapplicability of selling
commissions to such Limited Partners while maintaining a uniform
Net Asset Value per Unit.


     (iii) Accrued
monthly performance fees, if any, will then be charged against Net
Assets, and the amounts credited to the Suspense Account as
provided above as of the end of any month shall be charged the
performance fee if there is an accrued performance fee in respect
of the Net Assets as of the month-end that such amounts are so
credited.


     (iv) Any increase
or decrease in Net Assets (after the adjustments in subparagraphs
(ii) and (iii) above and excluding the amount credited in the
Suspense Account), over those of the immediately preceding
Determination Date (or, in the case of the first Determination
Date, the first closing of the sale of Units to the public), will
then be credited or charged to the capital account of each Partner
in the ratio that the balance of each account bears to the balance
of all accounts.


     (v) Any accrued
interest will be credited to the capital account of each Partner on
a pro rata basis.


     (vi) The remainder
of the Suspense Account (after reduction by the performance fee, if
any) shall then be reinvested in Units as of such month-end, at Net
Asset Value, for the benefit of the appropriate Limited
Partners.


     (vii) The amount
of any distribution to a Partner, any amount paid to a Partner on
redemption of Units and any redemption fee paid to the General
Partner upon the redemption of Units will be charged to that
Partner’s capital account.

4



 


     (b) Allocation
of Profit and Loss for Federal Income Tax Purposes. As of the
end of each fiscal year of a Series, the Partnership’s
realized profit or loss attributable to that Series will be
allocated among the Partners under the following subparagraphs for
federal income tax purposes. These allocations of profit and loss
will be pro rata from net capital gain or loss and net operating
income or loss realized by such Series. For United States federal
income tax purposes, a distinction will be made between net
short-term gain or loss and net long-term gain or loss.


     (i) Items of
ordinary income (such as interest or credits in lieu of interest)
and expense (such as the management fees, performance fees,
brokerage fees and extraordinary expenses) will be allocated pro
rata among the Partners based on their capital accounts (exclusive
of these items of ordinary income or expense) as of the end of each
month in which the items of ordinary income or expense
accrued.


     (ii) Net realized
capital gain or loss from the Series’ trading activities will
be allocated as follows:


     (A) For the
purpose of allocating the Series’ net realized capital gain
or loss among the Partners, the General Partner will establish an
allocation account with respect to each outstanding Unit. The
initial balance of each allocation account will be the amount paid
by the Partner for the Unit. Amounts reinvested in Units from the
Suspense Account, as described in Section 8(a) above, shall not
increase the aggregate tax basis of the affected Limited Partners
in their Units; rather the Units acquired upon reinvestment will
have an initial tax basis of $0. Allocation accounts will be
adjusted as of the end of each fiscal year and as of the date a
Partner completely redeems his Units as follows:


     (1) Each
allocation account will be increased by the amount of income
allocated to the holder of the Unit under subparagraph (b)(i) above
and subparagraph (b)(ii)(C) below.


     (2) Each
allocation account will be decreased by the amount of expense or
loss allocated to the holder of the Unit under subparagraph (b)(i)
above and subparagraph (b)(ii)(E) below and by the amount of any
distribution the holder of the Unit has received with respect to
the Unit (other than on redemption of the Unit).


     (3) When a Unit is
redeemed, the allocation account with respect to that Unit will be
eliminated.


     (B) Net realized
capital gain will be allocated first to each Partner who has
partially redeemed his Units during the fiscal year up to the
excess, if any, of the amount received upon redemption of the Units
over the allocation account attributable to the redeemed
Units.


     (C) Net realized
capital gain remaining after the allocation of that capital gain
under subparagraph (b)(ii)(B) above will be allocated next among
all Partners whose capital accounts are in excess of their
Units’ allocation accounts (after the adjustments in
subparagraph (b)(ii)(B) above) in the ratio that each such
Partner’s excess bears to all such Partners’ excesses.
If gain to be allocated under this subparagraph (b)(ii)(C) is
greater than the excess of all such Partners’ capital
accounts over all such allocation accounts, the excess will be
allocated among all Partners in the ratio that each Partner’s
capital account bears to all Partners’ capital
accounts.


     (D) Net realized
capital loss will be allocated first to each Partner who has
partially redeemed his Units during the fiscal year up to the
excess, if any, of the allocation account attributable to the
redeemed Units over the amount received upon redemption of the
Units.


     (E) Net realized
capital loss remaining after the allocation of such capital loss
under subparagraph (b)(ii)(D) above will be allocated next among
all Partners whose Units’ allocation accounts are in excess
of their capital accounts (after the adjustments in subparagraph
(b)(ii)(D) above) in the ratio that each such Partner’s
excess bears to all such Partners’ excesses. If loss to be
allocated under this subparagraph (b)(ii)(E) is greater than the
excess of all of these allocation accounts over all such
Partners’ capital accounts, the excess loss will be allocated
among all Partners in the ratio that each Partner’s capital
account bears to all Partners’ capital accounts.


     (iii) The tax
allocations prescribed by this Section 8(b) will be made to each
holder of a Unit whether or not the holder is a substituted Limited
Partner. If a Unit has been transferred or assigned, the
allocations prescribed by this Section 8(b) will be made with
respect to such Unit without regard to the transfer or assignment,
except that in the year of transfer or assignment the allocations
prescribed by this Section 8(b) will be divided between the
transferor or assignor and the transferee or assignee based on the
number of months each held the transferred or assigned Unit. For
purposes of this Section 8(b), tax allocations will be made to
the General Partner’s Units of General Partnership Interest
in a Series on a Unit-equivalent basis.


     (iv) The
allocation of profit and loss for federal income tax purposes set
forth in this Agreement is intended to allocate taxable profits and
losses among Partners in a Series generally in the ratio and to the
extent that net profit and net loss are allocated to the Partners
under Section 8(a) of this Agreement so as to eliminate, to the
extent possible, any disparity between a

5



 


Partner’s
capital account and his allocation account with respect to each
Unit then outstanding, consistent with the principles set forth in
Section 704(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”).


     (c) Performance
Fees. Performance Fees shall be payable by a Series to the
General Partner as of the end of each month and upon redemption of
Units within such Series. Performance Fees shall equal a
percentage, as specified in the current prospectus in respect of
the Units of a Series of New Appreciation (if any) calculated as of
the end of each month and upon redemption of Units within such
Series. “New Appreciation” shall be the total increase,
if any, in Net Asset Value of a series from the end of the last
period for which a performance fee was earned by the Managing
Partner, net of all fees and expenses paid or accrued by such
Series other than the Performance Fee itself and after subtraction
of all interest income received by such Series. Performance Fees
shall be paid by each Series as a whole, irrespective of whether
the Net Asset Value of such Series has declined below the purchase
price of a Unit of such Series. Accrued Performance Fees payable by
a Series shall reduce the redemption price of Units of such Series
and shall be paid to the General Partner by such Series upon
redemptions within such Series. The amount (if any) of the accrued
Performance Fee that shall be paid to the General Partner upon the
redemption of any Unit within a Series shall be determined by
dividing the total Performance Fee as of such redemption date
payable by such Series by the number of Units within such Series
then outstanding (including Units within such Series redeemed as of
such date); the remainder of the accrued Performance Fee payable by
such Series shall be paid to the General Partner on the last day of
each month. In the event assets are withdrawn from a Limited
Partner’s account or a Series as a whole (other than to pay
expenses), any loss carry forward shall be proportionally reduced
for purposes of calculating subsequent Performance Fees. Loss carry
forward reductions shall not be restored as a result of subsequent
additions of capital. The General Partner may adjust the payments
set forth in this Section 8(c), in the General Partner’s
discretion, if the General Partner believes that doing so will
achieve more equitable payments or payments more consistent with
the Code.


     (d)
Expenses.


     (1) The General
Partner shall advance the ongoing offering expenses of the initial
and continuous offerings of the Units of each Series, and no such
expenses shall be deducted from the proceeds of the offering. The
General Partner shall be reimbursed such amounts advanced on behalf
of a Series by such Series via payments equal to
1/12 of 1% per month (1% per annum) of such
Series’ month-end Net Asset Value, not to exceed the amount
of actual expenses incurred. The General Partner shall have
discretion to adopt reasonable procedures to implement the
authorization of such expenses, including grouping expenses related
to the same offering period and expensing de minimus amounts as
they are incurred. In the event a Series terminates prior to
completion of its reimbursement of advanced expenses, the General
Partner will not be entitled to receive additional reimbursement
from such Series and such Series will have no obligation to make
further reimbursement payments to the General Partner. For purposes
of this Agreement, ongoing offering expenses shall mean all costs
paid or incurred by the General Partner or a Series in organizing
such Series and offering the Units of such Series, including legal
and accounting fees incurred, bank account charges, all Blue Sky
filing fees, filing fees payable upon formation and activation of
such Series, and expenses of preparing, printing and distributing
the prospectus and registration statement, but in no event shall
exceed limits set forth in Section 9 herein or guidelines
imposed by appropriate regulatory bodies.


     (2) Each Series
shall be obligated to pay all liabilities incurred by such Series,
including without limitation, (i) brokerage fees (up to 5%
(Series A) and 7% (Series B) annually of the average
annual net assets of the Series); (ii) operating expenses
(whether direct or indirect) in an amount equal to
1/12 of 0.15% of such Series’ month-end Net
Asset Value (0.15% per annum), not to exceed the amount of actual
expenses incurred, management fees equal to
1/12 of 1.85% of such Series’ month-end Net
Asset Value (1.85% per annum), and performance fees;
(iii) subject to a maximum cumulative selling commission of
10% of the gross offering proceeds of a Unit, monthly selling
commissions of 1/12 of 4% (4% per annum), provided, however, that
the selling commission expense charged against a Series in respect
of (a) Units sold by Superfund USA, Inc., or an affiliated
broker, attributable to Limited Partners whose investments in the
Partnership were recommended by registered investment advisers with
whom such persons maintain asset-based fee or fixed fee investment
advisory relationships (b) Units sold by Superfund USA, Inc., or an
affiliated broker, to investors who are commodity pools operated by
commodity pool operators registered as such with the NFA; and
(c) Limited Partners’ Units purchased on or after
February 28, 2005, which Units have been charged and have paid
selling commissions of 10% of the initial offering price of such
Units, shall be reversed in respect of such Limited Partners as
described above in Section 8(a); (iv) legal and
accounting fees; and (v) taxes and other extraordinary
expenses incurred by such Series. During any year of operations,
the General Partner shall be responsible for payment of operating
expenses of a Series in excess of 0.15% of such Series’
month-end Net Asset Value during that year. Indirect expenses of
the General Partner, such as indirect salaries, rent and other
overhead expenses shall not be liabilities of a Series. Each Series
shall receive all interest earned on its assets.


     (3) Compensation
to any party, including the General Partner (or any Advisor which
may be retained in the future), shall not exceed the limitations,
if any, imposed by the North American Securities Administrators
Association (“NASAA”) currently in effect. In the event
the compensation exceeds such limitations, the General Partner
shall promptly reimburse each Series for such excess.

6



 


     (4) Each Series
shall also be obligated to pay any costs of indemnification payable
by such Series to the extent permitted under Section 17 of
this Agreement.


     (e) Limited
Liability of Limited Partners. Each Unit, when purchased in
accordance with this Agreement, shall, except as otherwise provided
by law, be fully paid and nonassessable. Any provisions of this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, except as otherwise
provided by law, no Limited Partner of a Series shall be liable for
such Series’ obligations in excess of the capital contributed
by such Limited Partner, plus his share of undistributed profits
and assets of such Series. Each Limited Partner will be entitled to
the same limitation of personal liability extended to stockholders
of private corporations for profit, except as otherwise provided by
the Act.


     (f) Return of
Capital Contributions. No Limited Partner or subsequent
assignee shall have any right to demand the return of his capital

1 Superfund Green, L.P.2 The use of this brochure is authorized only when preceded or accompanied by a current Prospectus of Superfund Green, L.P. (the Fund ). This brochure does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy Units in the Fund. The offering of Fund Units can only be made by the Prospectus which contains important information regarding certain risks associated with the Fund and should be read carefully and retained by anyone considering an investment in the Fund. The Units have not been approved or disapproved by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or any state securities commission nor has the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or any state securities commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the Prospectus or this brochure. Managed futures can generally be defined as a globally diversified basket of futures contracts which are listed on worldwide exchanges. Futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. Risk Factors: There can be no assurance that the investment objective of Series A or Series B of Superfund Green, L.P. will be achieved. Investing in Series A or Series B of Superfund Green, L.P. is speculative and investors must be prepared to lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. Both Series A and Series B of Superfund Green, L.P. are highly leveraged, which may potentially provide higher returns, but also increase the overall risk and volatility of the investment. Costs and expenses of managed futures funds are significantly higher than mutual funds and other investment vehicles. Investors in both Series A and Series B of Superfund Green, L.P. will realize taxable gains and losses in the year in which they occur, and proper consideration should be given to the tax implications of an investment. The profitability of funds that use trading systems that only analyze technical market data and not any economic factors external to market prices may be negatively affected when sustained price trends fail to develop. Superfund Capital Management, the general partner of the Fund, has total trading authority over each Series. The use of a single advisor could mean lack of diversification and, consequently, higher risk. The Fund s charges are substantial and must be offset by trading gains and/ or gold investment profits and interest income in order to avoid depletion of each Series assets. There is no secondary market for the Units and none is expected to develop. You may redeem your Units only as of a month-end. Transfers of Units are subject to limitations. There is no guarantee that these methods will be successful.3 Dear Investor As an alternative investment strategy, managed futures have attracted much attention in recent years. Why? Managed futures offer the potential for high absolute returns, and their performance is historically independent of traditional portfolio components, such as stocks, bonds, commodities and other alternative investment strategies. Discipline is the key to long-term investment success. Investing is a complex and often emotional topic for most investors. As soon as greed for increased profits gains the upper hand, healthy common sense disappears whether you are an individual investor or institutional fund manager. Therefore, at Christian Baha Superfund, we have crystallized our investment discipline into an automated, systematic approach to markets. Our system ensures that human emotions will not interfere with our approach to trading markets. Clear rules for market diversification, trend analysis and risk management are applied consistently. Our fully automated trading systems perpetually screen about 120 financial and commodity markets around the world for investment possibilities. The broad diversification of the traded markets improves the potential to find strong trends. We attain this diversity not only by investing in stocks, bonds or currencies, but also by trading daily necessities, such as energy, metals and various agricultural products. Sincerely, Christian Baha Founder 34 What are Futures? How do the goods we buy on a daily basis make their way onto the supermarket shelves? How are their prices determined? One way is through global commodity futures exchanges. These are important financial centers which provide buyers and sellers with a competitive marketplace and a forum to control price and risk at the same time. A futures contract is a financial agreement to buy or sell a certain product for a fixed price at a predetermined date in the future. In this way, farmers can sell their wheat months before they even harvest it at a fixed price, regardless of bad weather or crop disease. The buyer bears the initial risk, but is rewarded if the futures price comes in under the contract price for the commodity. As the futures contract delivery date approaches, the distance between the contract price and the final price will lessen. An investment strategy in managed futures generally should be planned for a minimum of at least five years. The growth of the managed futures industry in Billion USD (01/1987 through 12/2012) Source: BarclayHedge Alternative Investment Database (Barclay Hedge, Ltd.), Time Period: 01/ /2012 While managed futures offer such potential to profit, this type of investment is highly volatile and speculative. Thus, an investor must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of an investment.5 What are Managed Futures? Managed futures are becoming an increasingly significant asset class, distinct from stocks, bonds and other alternative investment strategies. Managed futures can generally be defined as a globally diversified basket of futures contracts which are listed on worldwide exchanges. Managed futures funds have the ability to go both long and short, and thus have the potential to profit in rising or falling markets. Moreover, managed futures funds historically have had a low correlation to stocks, bonds and other investments, and therefore have the potential to improve returns and lower the overall volatility of a portfolio. At the end of 2012, institutional and private investors had approximately $330 billion invested in this asset class. Benefits of Managed Futures Why investors are drawn to managed futures High performance potential The potential for high performance over a long-term investment period. Correlation The historically low correlation of managed futures performance to other asset classes, including stocks and bonds. Portfolio diversification Managed futures provide access to multiple markets. Enhanced portfolio efficiency Managed futures, when added to a traditional portfolio of equities and bonds, have the potential to reduce volatility and enhance returns for the entire portfolio. High Performance Potential Potential to outperform traditional indices Managed futures have the ability to go both long and short and thus have the potential to profit in rising or falling markets. They have the potential over a long-term period to outperform traditional indices. The graph below illustrates the performance of the CISDM CTA Equal Weighted Index* vs. the S&P 500 Total Return Index, the MSCI World Index and the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index. Over the past 30 years, the cumulative return on an initial investment would have been significantly higher for managed futures than for these other asset classes. There can be no assurance that the investment objectives of a managed futures fund will be achieved. Investing in managed futures is speculative and investors must be prepared to lose all or a substantial amount of their investment. Futures and forward contracts have a high degree of price variability and are subject to occasional rapid and substantial changes. *an index of approximately 300 CTAs who voluntarily report their performance Comparison of Asset Classes (01/1980 through 12/2012) Managed Futures¹) S&P 500 Total Return MSCI World Bonds 2) +3,500% +1,500% +500% 0% ) Managed Futures: CISDM CTA Equal Weighted Index; 2) Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index ee Comparison of Asset Classes (01/1980 through 12/2012) The CISDM CTA Equal Weighted Index and the MSCI World Index do not include reinvested dividends.

Information regarding Superfund s managed futures funds performance can be obtained at  Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index: The Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index is a broad base index that is often used to represent investment grade bonds being traded in the United States. CISDM CTA Equal Weighted Index: The CISDM CTA equal weighted index is a hedge fund index that reflects the average performance of Commodity Trading Advisors (CTAs). To be included included in the equally weighted index, a CTA must have at least $500,000 under management and at least a 12 month track record. MSCI World Index: The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets. S&P 500 Total Return: The S&P 500 is one of the most commonly used benchmarks for the overall U.S. stock market. It is an index consisting of 500 stocks chosen for market size, liquidity and industry grouping, among other factors. The S&P 500 Index represents the price trend movements of the common stock of major U.S. public companies. The Total Return refers to the version of the index that reflects the effects of dividend reinvestment. 56 Superfund Story Christian Baha is the founder of Superfund. In January 1992, he launched a company that developed and marketed financial software applications to institutions in Austria. From this platform, he launched Teletrader Software AG, which is currently a publicly held company offering financial software products to institutions, and which has been listed on the Austrian Stock Exchange since March In March 1996, Mr. Baha founded the first member of what is now the Superfund group of companies, launched one of the world s first retail managed futures funds and continued to develop the Superfund trend following trading systems. By 1997, the proprietary software and trading systems were further refined, resulting in a fully automated approach to trading. During the past decade, the Superfund trading systems have been further developed, tested and continually improved using 30 years of historical data. The trading systems monitor and trade about 120 futures markets in eight core areas. Entry Trading Stop-Loss position Exit Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb eesuperfund Trading Chart As shown in the chart to the left, the Superfund trading systems limit losses by using stop-loss orders. The investment decisions are not dependent on fundamental data. The trading systems constantly monitor all associated micro and macro risk factors and systematically determine buy and sell orders through technical analysis. Should there be a major trend reversal, the program reacts immediately to adjust to the new environment. In this manner, the trading systems attempt to minimize losses and increase profit potential.7 Superfund Strategy Superfund USA, LLC, and additional selling agents, have offered an SEC registered managed futures fund to private investors since November 2002: Superfund Green L.P. - Series A and Series B. The two series of the fund follow a similar investment strategy but vary according to level of risk and reward with Series B having a risk and reward level that is approximately 1.5 times greater than that of Series A. Market Diversification Superfund funds use proprietary trading systems that strive to produce minimal correlation to traditional investments. Futures contracts are traded in about 120 different financial and commodity markets around the world. Fundamental to the Superfund trading style are low correlation between the different instruments and high liquidity for order execution. Technical Trading Systems Positions are initiated using a proprietary technical algorithm that works to detect price trends in advance. Many systematic trend following systems employ technical indicators, such as moving averages or Bollinger bands, to identify trading conditions. The key to using such indicators successfully lies in the way they are interrelated and applied in combination. Trend Following The Superfund trading strategy is based on short-, medium- and long-term trend following. Key to the past success of Superfund funds is the ability to limit drawdowns by the daily maintenance of stop orders. If a trend reverses, loss is theoretically limited. If a trend continues, profits are theoretically protected. In this way, the Superfund trading strategy seeks to optimize winning trades. Money Management Risk management plays a vital role in the Superfund investment strategy. Consistent money management is the most important element of the Superfund trading strategy. Trading risk is controlled by strictly limiting the size of individual trading positions and cutting losses early. The total risk is continuously screened and drawdowns are limited by daily maintenance of stop orders. In this way, if a trend reverses, losses are theoretically limited, while if a trend continues profits are theoretically protected. Financial Futures Stock Indices Currencies Bonds Interest Rates Commodity Futures Metals Energy Grains Agricultural Markets eetraded Markets The chart is only an indication of the variety of markets traded or that may be traded by Superfund and is not indicative of relative allocations among these markets. The actual allocations among these markets change over time due to liquidity, volatility and risk considerations. The profitability of Series A or Series B of Superfund Green, L.P. could be materially diminished during periods when factors external to the market itself have an important impact on market prices. During such periods, Superfund trading system could establish positions on the wrong side of the price movements caused by such external factors. 78 Correlation A relationship between two variables Many investors are drawn to managed futures because of the low correlation to other major asset classes. Including managed futures as part of a diversified portfolio is seen as a risk management tool that can help investors not only when the stock market suffers losses, but also when other portfolio components suffer losses.

By broadly diversifying across many global markets, managed futures have the potential to simultaneously profit from price changes in stock, bond, currency and interest rates as well as from many commodity markets with historically low correlation to traditional asset classes. A managed futures fund allows investors to participate in many different asset classes with one single investment. Portfolio Diversification Ease of global diversification Managed futures are often used by investors as a way to diversify a portfolio from reliance on traditional stocks and bonds. Since managed futures typically trade in a wide variety of futures markets on many global exchanges, they can provide investors with exposure to commodities, currencies, and a wide variety of international indexes and interest rates.

Professor Harry Markowitz pioneered the concept of the modern portfolio theory over 50 years ago. A cornerstone of Professor Markowitz s Nobel prize-winning research was the efficient frontier of investments, where he proved that adding a mix of diverse asset classes into an investment portfolio would lower the overall volatility of the entire portfolio while potentially enhancing investment return. Harvard professor Dr. John Lintner enhanced our understanding of the modern portfolio theory with a seminal study in 1983 that concluded that portfolios including judicious investments in managed futures accounts show substantially less risk at every possible level of expected return than portfolios of stocks (or stocks and bonds) alone. With the addition of a managed futures fund to a traditional portfolio, there is the potential for a higher return at a reduced risk.

During the 32-year period covered in this graph, the addition of a 20% share of managed futures into the portfolio would have lowered the volatility and increased returns. As used in this chart, Risk represents standard deviation, which is a measurement of an investment s historical volatility. The higher the percentage, the more likely an investment will deviate from an expected normal return. The Increased Return uses performance p.a., which is the percentage of performance per annum, or per year.

Markowitz is an acclaimed economist and Nobel Laureate who received the Nobel prize in economics in 1990 for his work in modern portfolio theory. His extraordinary theory provided proof that a diversified portfolio utilizing various investment products can achieve overall higher return while lowering risk at the same time. DIVERSIFICATION Optimum portfolio mix One of the core points of modern portfolio theory is don t put all your eggs in one basket. Professor Markowitz proved that adding a non-correlated asset class to traditional investments like stocks and bonds not only can reduce risk, but can also improve performance.

Maximum drawdown is the greatest cumulative percentage decline in month-end net asset value due to losses sustained by the portfolio during any period in which the initial month-end net asset value is not equaled or exceeded by a subsequent month-end net asset value. 1) Managed Futures: CISDM CTA Equal Weighted Index 2) Stocks: MSCI World, S&P 500 Total Return 3)Bonds: Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index; Source: TeleTrader THERE IS NO ASSURANCE OR GUARANTEE THAT DIVERSIFICATION CAN ENHANCE RETURNS OR LOWER RISK. 9.6% 10% 0% Correlation Statistical Measure of two investments Correlation is one of the most common and most useful statistics when measuring how the returns of two investments move in relation to each other. A measure of 1.0 indicates returns that move perfectly together; 0 indicates movements that have no relationship to each other; and 1.0 indicates perfect opposite movement. Managed futures have historically displayed low or even zero-correlation with other asset classes, which make them an attractive and efficient portfolio diversification tool.
