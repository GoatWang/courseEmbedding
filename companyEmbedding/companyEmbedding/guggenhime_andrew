CardioDx, Inc. Nixes IPO, Cites Unfavorable Market Conditions
11/15/2013 10:31:01 AM
 
CardioDx postpones its initial public offering, citing ‘unfavorable market conditions.’ California molecular diagnostics company CardioDx spiked its initial public offering, citing “unfavorable market conditions,” according to news reports. The 5.8-million-share offering by Palo Alto-based CardioDx was slated to raise $92 million at a share price of $14-$16 apiece. The IPO, originally scheduled for yesterday, would have seen CardioDx shares trade under the “CDX” symbol.

CardioDx had planned to use some of the funds to expand its commercial efforts, including its sales and marketing workforce; to fund operations as the company pursues more insurance coverage and reimbursement; to “conduct additional clinical and marketing activities” for the company’s Corus CAD blood-based gene expression test; to fund R&D activity; and for “general corporate purposes.” CardioDx will later specify just the how much it plans to put toward each of those activities.
Investors in the company include V-Sciences Investments, Longitude Venture Partners, Artiman Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, JP Morgan and Mohr Davidow Ventures.

CardioDX pulls IPO, citing poor market conditions







CardioDX, led by David Levison, was one of three medical technology companies to postpone their IPOs on Thursday due to poor market conditions.







Cromwell Schubarth
Senior Technology Reporter-Silicon Valley Business Journal

CardioDX postponed an IPO on Thursday after deciding that the market is unfavorable at this time.

 
The Palo Alto company led by CEO David Levison was one of three planned medical tech companies that postponed going public on Thursday. San Diego-basedCelladon and Monrovia-based Xencor also decided to hold off due to poor market conditions.
Redwood City pharmaceutical developer Relypsa, meanwhile, went ahead with a drastically reduced IPO that raised about half of what it had been projected for it.
CardioDX, which sells diagnostic tests for cardiovascular disease, reported total revenue in in 2012 of $2.5 million and a net loss of $25.6 million. The company expects to continue to show losses for the next several years and has an accumulated deficit through June totaling $165.9 million. As of June 30, it had $46.8 million in cash, equivalents and investments.
The company’s biggest existing stakeholder is V-Sciences Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of Temasek Life Sciences Private Ltd., which holds 19.9 percent of outstanding shares.
Other big stakeholders are Longitude Venture Partners, with a 17.9 percent stake; Artiman Ventures, 13.9 percent; Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, 9.5 percent; JP Morgan, 6.4 percent; and Mohr Davidow Ventures, 5.8 percent.

Cardiovascular MDx Firm CardioDx Files to Go Public
UPDATED on 10/14/2013

October 14, 2013
 By a GenomeWeb staff reporter

NEW YORK (GenomeWeb News) – Cardiovascular molecular diagnostics firm CardioDx has filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to go public with an intended offering of up to $86.3 million of common stock.
The Palo Alto, Calif.-based firm has not priced its offering yet or said how many shares it plans on offering. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Jefferies are listed as joint book-running managers on the offering, while Piper Jaffray and William Blair are co-managers.
The company plans on listing on the Nasdaq Global Market under ticker symbol “CDX.”
In its Form S-1, CardioDx said that its tests provide healthcare professionals with “critical, actionable information to improve patient care and management,” with an initial focus on coronary artery diseases (CAD), arrhythmia, and heart failure.
Its flagship product is the Corus CAD, a gene expression-based test for assessing non-diabetic patients who display symptoms suggestive of obstructive CAD. The test was launched in 2009 and through June 30, CardioDx delivered results for more than 40,000 tests, it said.
Corus CAD received Medicare Part B coverage in August 2012, making it a covered benefit for about 48 million Medicare beneficiaries, the company added.
In 2012, CardioDx posted $2.5 million in revenues with a net loss of $25.6 million. Through the first six months of 2013, the firm had revenues $2.9 million and a net loss of $18.4 million.
It had $46.8 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of June 30, it said.
In August 2012, CardioDx raised $58 million in private financing. Before that, it raised $60 million in a financing round. In 2010, GE Healthcare invested $5 million in the company as part of a Series D financing round.
David Levison heads the firm as President and CEO. Other members of the management team include CFO Andrew Guggenhime; Chief Scientific Officer Steven Rosenberg; Chief Medical Officer Mark Monane; and Chief Commercial Officer Deborah Kilpatrick.
CardioDx is the latest in a recent string of omics-related companies who have gone public or have filed to go public in the US. Cancer Genetics, NanoString Technologies, and Foundation Medicine launched their IPOs earlier this year. Meanwhile, Veracyte, Biocept, and Evogene have filed to float.

CardioDx Announces Publication of COMPASS Study Demonstrating the Corus CAD Test Outperforms Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in Overall Diagnostic Accuracy for Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease


Tue Feb 19, 2013 8:30am EST
– Study Highlights the Validity of Corus CAD as a First-Line Test to Help Clinicians Exclude Obstructive CAD as a Cause of the Patient’s Symptoms – PALO ALTO, Calif.,  Feb. 19, 2013
/PRNewswire/ — CardioDx, Inc., a pioneer in the field of  cardiovascular genomic diagnostics, today announced the publication of the COMPASS (Coronary  Obstruction Detection by  Molecular
Personalized Gene Expression) study in  Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics,  a journal of the American Heart Association. 
Results of the prospective, multi-center U.S. study showed that  Corus®  CAD, a blood-based  gene expression test, demonstrated high accuracy with both a high negative predictive value (96 percent) and high sensitivity (89 percent) for assessing  obstructive coronary artery disease  (CAD) in a population of patients referred for stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).  The study’s authors conclude that using Corus CAD earlier in the diagnostic algorithm could reduce the number of invasive cardiac tests by more accurately evaluating the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease compared to the traditional algorithm of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) in these patients.
COMPASS enrolled stable patients with symptoms suggestive of CAD who had been referred for MPI at 19 U.S. sites.  A blood sample was obtained in all 431 patients prior to MPI and Corus CAD gene expression testing was performed with study investigators blinded to Corus CAD test results. Following MPI, patients underwent either invasive coronary angiography or coronary CT angiography, gold-standard anatomical tests for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. 
The study was designed to provide additional independent validation of the Corus CAD test in a real-world intended use patient population of patients presenting for MPI, a common noninvasive test for CAD, and builds on the results of the previous PREDICT validation study. Corus CAD requires only a simple blood draw for testing, making it safe, convenient, and easy to administer. The study evaluated results in stable non-diabetic patients with typical or atypical symptoms suggestive of CAD and found that Corus CAD surpassed the accuracy of MPI, a test that was administered more 10 million times in the U.S. in 2010.[1]
“The evaluation of stable patients with chest pain and other symptoms suggestive of CAD is a common challenge for clinicians, accounting for as many as 10,000 outpatient visits each day,” said the publication’s lead author,  Gregory S. Thomas, M.D., M.P.H., Medical Director of the MemorialCare Heart & Vascular Institute at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center and Clinical Professor of Medicine and Director of Nuclear Cardiology Education at the  University of California-Irvine  School of Medicine. “In the U.S., MPI testing is often performed in these patients and is followed by referral to invasive coronary angiography. Based on the results of this study of the Corus CAD gene expression test, we now have a reliable diagnostic approach for evaluating patients with symptoms of obstructive CAD.  With its high sensitivity and negative predictive value, Corus CAD may help clinicians accurately and efficiently exclude the diagnosis of obstructive CAD early in the diagnostic pathway, so they can assess for other causes of their patients’ symptoms.”
The pre-specified primary endpoint of the COMPASS study was the receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) analysis to evaluate the ability of Corus CAD to identify coronary arterial blockages of 50 percent or greater by quantitative coronary angiography.  Corus CAD outperformed MPI in overall diagnostic accuracy for assessing obstructive CAD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79 for the Corus CAD test compared to MPI site and core-lab read AUCs of 0.59 and 0.63 respectively (p<0.001).  In addition, Corus CAD performed better than MPI in sensitivity (89 percent vs. 27 percent, p<0.001) and negative predictive value (96 percent vs. 88 percent, p<0.001) parameters, thus demonstrating excellent performance for excluding obstructive CAD as the cause of a patient’s symptoms.  The COMPASS results corroborated earlier findings from the PREDICT multicenter U.S. validation study[2] demonstrating that the Corus CAD score is proportional to coronary artery stenosis severity.
“Corus CAD can help solve an enormous unmet need in healthcare by providing clinicians with a safe, convenient and reliable tool to help evaluate common patient symptoms and triage them more appropriately for subsequent therapy or additional testing,” said  David Levison, President and CEO of CardioDx.  “In addition to its higher diagnostic accuracy, Corus CAD holds potential to reduce a major healthcare expense category – unnecessary noninvasive imaging and/or invasive coronary angiography procedures and their associated risks and side effects. We have worked closely with leading clinicians to build a solid clinical and economic foundation for Corus CAD, leading to its growing acceptance in the medical and payer communities as evidenced by the more than 35,000 tests performed to date and Medicare’s decision to cover the test.”

CardioDx is promoting yet another post-marketing study whose data may help the company’s gene expression test for obstructive coronary artery disease reach more patients, better compete with the standard of care and also build vital market share.
Executives at the California-based 2012 Fierce 15 company say they wanted more data on Corus CAD‘s real-world use, building on its previous PREDICT validation trial as a result. The test has been on sale commercially since 2009 and won crucial Medicare reimbursement last fall. Chief Scientific Officer Steven Rosenberg told FierceMedicalDevices via email that the results from the latest study pointed in a number of positive directions.
“It demonstrates performance at least as good as that seen in the PREDICT study, but in the population the Corus CAD is indicated for,” Rosenberg said, “It shows significantly higher performance for obstructive CAD than MPI, which is the most common non-invasive imaging test used in this regard.”
A 431-patient clinical study of the blood diagnostic rated the test with a 96% negative predictive value and 89% high sensitivity, in assessing the condition in patients who were referred for stress testing with myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). (Last November, CardioDx heralded similar results from another study using Corus CAD on 98 geriatric patients.) Details are published in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Genetics.
The blood test, conducted at 19 U.S. sites through multiple academic institutions, determined that using Corus CAD earlier in the diagnostic process better assessed the presence of coronary artery disease versus MPI. This might encourage doctors to cut back on invasive, more expensive cardiac tests by ruling out obstructive CAD sooner. In other words, determining a patient doesn’t have obstructive CAD eliminates the need for diagnostic procedures such as coronary angiography or coronary CT angiography, the company explains.
Post-marketing studies are increasingly important in today’s health care market, with the need to demonstrate the utility of a device or diagnostic in as most detailed a way possible. And it’s not just boosting the standard of care; the Affordable Care Act means value matters, too, more than ever before. Success with this mission can help broaden market share and also increase the chance of private as well as government insurance coverage. Additionally, new post-marketing trials can also set the stage for expanded indications down the line.

Abstract
Background—Obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis in symptomatic patients often involves non-invasive testing before invasive coronary angiography (ICA). A blood-based gene expression score (GES) was previously validated in non-diabetic patients referred for ICA but not in symptomatic patients referred for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI).

Methods and Results—This prospective multi-center study obtained peripheral blood samples for GES before MPI in 537 consecutive patients. Patients with abnormal MPI usually underwent ICA; all others had research coronary CT-angiography (CTA), with core laboratories defining coronary anatomy. A total of 431 patients completed GES, coronary imaging (ICA or CTA), and MPI. Mean age was 56±10 (48% women). The pre-specified primary endpoint was GES receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) analysis to discriminate ≥50% stenosis (15% prevalence by core laboratory analysis). ROC curve area (AUC) for GES was 0.79 (95% CI 0.73-0.84, p<.001), with sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89%, 52%, and 96%, respectively, at a pre-specified threshold of ≤15 with 46% of patients below this score. The GES outperformed clinical factors by ROC and reclassification analysis and also showed significant correlation with maximum percent stenosis. Six-month follow-up on 97% of patients showed that 27/28 patients with adverse cardiovascular events or revascularization had GES >15. Site and core-lab MPI had AUCs of 0.59 and 0.63, respectively, significantly less than GES.
Conclusions—A GES has high sensitivity and NPV for obstructive CAD. In this population clinically referred for MPI, the GES outperformed clinical factors and MPI.

CardioDx’s test for obstructive heart disease will be covered by Medicare retroactive to Jan. 1.

A key national Medicare contractor will cover the cost of a coronary artery disease test developed by CardioDx Inc.
The move is important for Palo Alto-based CardioDx because private insurers tend to follow the federal government’s Medicare health insurance program. The company has had to seek reimbursement on a case-by-case basis with those private insurers since its Corus CAD gene expression test hit the market in June 2009.
The decision disclosed Tuesday by Palmetto GBA, a national contractor that administers Medicare benefits in Columbia, S.C., means that Medicare will cover the test for as many as 40 million enrollees. Coverage is retroactive to Jan. 1.
Corus CAD is a shoebox-size kit that uses a simple blood draw to measure the RNA levels of 23 genes. Using an algorithm, it then creates a score that determines the likelihood that a patient has obstructive coronary artery disease.
“By providing Medicare beneficiaries access to Corus CAD, this coverage decision enables patients to avoid unnecessary procedures and risks associated with cardiac imaging and elective invasive angiography, while helping payers address an area of significant healthcare spending,” CardioDx President and CEO David Levison said in a press release.
The decision represents the latest Medicare-coverage win for Bay Area diagnostic test makers. Palmetto earlier this year opted to cover the Afirma gene expression test from South San Francisco’s Veracyte Inc. to diagnosis thyroid nodules, and last summer Palmetto said it would cover Redwood City-based Genomic Health Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GHDX)colon cancer recurrence test.

CardioDx Appoints Andrew Guggenhime as Chief Financial Officer and Mark Monane, M.D., as Chief Medical Officer
Two Key Hires Position Company for Continued GrowthPALO ALTO, Calif. – September 19, 2011 – CardioDx, a pioneer in the field of cardiovascular genomic diagnostics, today announced the hires of Andrew L. Guggenhime as the company’s chief financial officer and Mark Monane, M.D., as chief medical officer.“We are thrilled to welcome these two extremely accomplished individuals to the CardioDx team,” said David Levison, chief executive officer of CardioDx. “Andrew’s considerable experience with both public and private companies and Mark’s clinical and industry expertise will serve us well as we execute our vision for improving patient management in primary care and cardiology through genomic diagnostics.”Corus® CAD, the company’s gene expression test, has now been used in nearly 20,000 patients to assess whether or not their symptoms are due to obstructive coronary artery disease. With a simple blood draw, the Corus CAD test provides actionable information that helps clinicians make better decisions, helps patients avoid unnecessary procedures and radiation exposure, and helps payers address a major expense category.Andrew Guggenhime Takes Role of Chief Financial Officer “I am excited to join CardioDx during this important time in the company’s evolution,” said Mr. Guggenhime. “With the pioneering market leadership of Corus CAD, a strong track record of execution, a healthy financial position and the backing of blue chip investors, CardioDx is poised extremely well for growth.”Mr. Guggenhime has more than 10 years of CFO experience, including nine years as a public company CFO. Most recently he served as CFO for Calistoga Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company acquired in April 2011 by Gilead Sciences. Prior to Calistoga, Guggenhime served as senior vice president and chief financial officer for Facet Biotech Corporation, a publicly held company acquired by Abbott Laboratories in April 2010, and CFO for publicly held PDL BioPharma, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, and Neoforma, Inc., a provider of supply chain management solutions for the health care industry. He began his career in financial services at Merrill Lynch & Co. and Wells Fargo & Company. Guggenhime holds a B.A. from Middlebury College and an M.M. from the J.L. Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University.Dr. Mark Monane, M.D., M.S., Joins CardioDx as Chief Medical Officer “CardioDx has pioneered the application of genomics to cardiovascular disease, helping us better understand patient signs and symptoms at a molecular level,” said Dr. Monane. “The clinical utility of Corus CAD holds the potential to considerably improve the management of patients within both cardiology and primary care.”Dr. Monane was managing director of equity research for Needham & Company for 11 years, focusing on analyses of emerging biotechnology companies in the cardiovascular and cancer areas. Prior to joining Needham, Monane was senior director of medical policy and practices at Medco Health Solutions. Prior to Medco, Monane was assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health, where he completed fellowship training in geriatrics, clinical pharmacology, and clinical effectiveness. He holds an A.B. and an M.B.A. from Columbia University, an M.S. degree in Health Policy from Harvard University, and an M.D. from New York University.
About Corus CAD Corus CAD is the first and only clinically validated blood-based test for obstructive coronary artery disease. The test involves a routine blood draw conveniently administered in the clinician’s office and does not expose patients to risks of radiation or imaging agent intolerance. Corus CAD is a decision-making tool that can help primary care clinicians and cardiologists evaluate whether a nondiabetic patient's symptoms are due to obstructive coronary artery disease. It is the first sex-specific test for obstructive coronary artery disease, accounting for critical biological differences between men and women.Findings from the PREDICT validation study of the Corus CAD gene expression test were published in 2010 in the Annals of Internal Medicine, the journal of the American College of Physicians. The test has been honored as a winner of The Wall Street Journal’s prestigious Technology Innovation Awards and one of TIME’s Top Ten Medical Breakthroughs for 2010.The Corus CAD test measures the RNA levels of 23 genes from a whole blood sample. Because these RNA levels are increased or decreased when obstructive coronary artery disease is present, the Corus CAD score indicates the likelihood that an individual patient has obstructive coronary artery disease.Corus CAD is commercially available through an innovative patient sample kit that includes everything needed for blood collection and express delivery to the company’s CLIA-certified Palo Alto, Calif. laboratory. Test results are delivered promptly to the clinician’s office. Corus CAD is currently available in the United States.For more information please visit http://www.cardiodx.com/media-kit/.About Gene Expression Testing Gene expression testing provides valuable tissue and cell-specific information about the molecular mechanisms involved in disease processes, enabling evaluation of an individual patient’s disease state, activity, and/or progression at a given point in time. Unlike genetic tests, which measure genetic variations, mutations, traits and predispositions—factors that are constant over a person’s lifetime—gene expression testing assesses a dynamic process, integrating both genetic predisposition and additional behavioral and environmental influences on current disease state.About CardioDx CardioDx, Inc., a pioneer in the field of cardiovascular genomic diagnostics, is committed to developing clinically validated tests that empower clinicians to better tailor care to each individual patient. Strategically focused on coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure, CardioDx is poised to expand patient access and improve healthcare quality and efficiency through the commercialization of genomic technologies.

Organization[edit]
Guggenheim Partners provides services across insurance services, investment banking, capital markets, strategic direction, investment management, merchant banking, and asset management. Guggenheim Investment Advisors oversees about $50 billion in assets.[4][5]
In June 2009, Guggenheim hired former Bear Stearns CEO Alan Schwartz as Executive Chairman to "focus on transforming Guggenheim's existing broker-dealer, which is focused on sales and trading of fixed income securities, into a full-service investment banking enterprise".[6]
In September 2009, Guggenheim hired former Goldman Sachs partner Peter Comisar as Vice Chairman and Head of West Coast Investment Banking.[7] The West Coast Advisory team is also headed by Managing Directors from Bear Stearns, Moelis & Co and Credit Suisse. The West Coast team focuses on Consumer Retail and Digital E-Commerce advisory while the NY office houses the remaining industry verticals and product groups with the except of oil & gas, which is based out of Houston.
In October 2009, Guggenheim hired former J.P. Morgan head of Media Investment Banking Mark Van Lith as Senior Managing Director and Head of Investment Banking.[8]
In March 2012, Guggenheim hired former Apollo Global Management director and vice chairman Henry Silverman as vice chairman of asset management.[9]
In January 2013, Guggenheim named former Yahoo! interim CEO Ross Levinsohn as CEO of private equity unit Guggenheim Digital Media.[10]
In May & June 2013, the firm also hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s co-head of U.S. leveraged finance capital markets Tom Stein, former Barclays head of retail investment banking and vice chairman Andrew Taussig, as well as managing directors Spencer Hart, Matthew Pilla, Ken Harada and Ryan Mash.[11]
In September 2013, Guggenheim Securities was named a financial adviser to Verizon in connection with its $130 billion acquisition of Vodafone's 45% stake in Verizon Wireless.[12]
Guggenheim Partners Investment Management, the investment arm of Guggenheim Partners, was charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with failure to disclose a $50 million loan made in 2010 to a senior executive from a client. The firm paid $20 million in 2015 to settle the charges.[13] The government agency also found that Guggenheim's compliance program did not prevent violations of federal securities laws. According to the SEC, the firm's employees did not report dozens of trips on clients' private airplanes and had overbilled a client $6.5 million in fees, taking nearly two years to reimburse them.[13]
On December 17, 2015, it was reported that in response to losses across Guggenheim Partners, the company would spin out its media properties into a new holding company owned by an investment group led by Guggenheim president Todd Boehly, consisting of Mediabistro, Billboard and The Hollywood Reporter, and Dick Clark Productions.[14][15]
Investments[edit]
In May 2009, Guggenheim Partners acquired a controlling interest in financial services firm Transparent Value LLC.[16] In July 2009, it acquired Claymore Group, a firm known for its Exchange-traded funds "Guggenheim ETFs".  and unit investment trusts "Guggenheim UITs". .[17] In December 2009, Guggenheim acquired a division of Wellmark and renamed it Guggenheim Life & Annuity.[18] In February 2010, Guggenheim Partners acquired Security Benefit Corp, parent company of Rydex Funds.[19] In October 2011, it acquired the life insurance company EquiTrust from FBL Financial Group.[20] In 2012, Guggenheim affiliates acquired the US annuities business of Canadian insurers Industrial Alliance and Sun Life Financial.[21][22]
In March 2012, Guggenheim Baseball Management acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers team for $2.15 billion in cash.[23] The consortium consisted of Guggenheim controlling partner Mark Walter, former Los Angeles Laker Magic Johnson and partners Peter Guber, Stan Kasten, Bobby Patton and Todd Boehly.[24] The acquisition includes the surrounding land and parking lot of Dodger Stadium.[25] Mark Walter said of the acquisition: "It's a lot of money, but if we do our jobs right...the long-term point of view is that people will see that the value was there."[26]
That September, Guggenheim bought a stake in the entertainment production company Dick Clark Productions,[27] which produces specials such as the American Music Awards and the Golden Globe Awards and other television programming.
In January 2013, the company bought out the remainder of the business-to-business media company Prometheus Global Media[28][29] and acquired CardCash in November of the same year.[30] In February 2014, Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Sparks of the WNBA.[31]
