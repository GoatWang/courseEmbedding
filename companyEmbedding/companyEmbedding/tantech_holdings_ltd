Tantech Holdings Ltd Key Developments

Tantech Holdings Ltd Obtains Official Approval for Two Updated EV Models
Jul 25 17
Tantech Holdings Ltd. announced that the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of the People's Republic of China (MIIT) has included two of its updated electric vehicle models in the 'Announcement of Road Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Enterprises and Products'. The two vehicles are produced by the company's subsidiary Suzhou E Motors Buses Co. Ltd. So far, together with previous approvals from the MIIT, the Company has recognized approvals in a total of 11 electric vehicles models. The new updated electric bus ZQK6810EV6, one of the two latest models approved by the MIIT, has much higher quality energy intensity and durability compared to previous model ZQK6810EV. It is driven by an updated lithium iron phosphate battery. With a range of more than 300 km (186 miles), the 8.1-meter-long bus can travel as fast as 120 km/h (75mph) and carry as many as 34 passengers.

Needle Tilting Mid-Session For Tantech Holdings Ltd (TANH)

Rai Favela |
Sábado, Julio 15, 2017







Since it is time and price based it is not adept at measuring the actual strength of a trend, merely its direction and duration. A favorite tool among technical stock analysts is the moving average. The 14-day ADX for Banco Santander S.A. (BNC.L) is now at 16.94. The Average True Range is an investor tool used to gauge stock volatility. RSI measures the magnitude and velocity of directional price movements.The Aroon indicator was developed by Tushar Chande in 1995. Wilder has developed multiple indicators that are still quite popular in today's investing landscape. The general interpretation of the ATR is the higher the ATR value, the higher the volatility. The Williams %R fluctuates between 0 and -100 measuring whether a security is overbought or oversold. The Williams %R is similar to the Stochastic Oscillator except it is plotted upside-down. The latest reading places the stock above the Ichimoku cloud which indicates positive momentum and a potential buy signal for the equity. The CCI technical indicator can be employed to help figure out if a stock is entering overbought or oversold territory. A CCI closer to +100 may provide an overbought signal, and a CCI near -100 may provide an oversold signal. When combined with the Plus Directional Indicator (+DI) and Minus Directional Indicator (-DI), it can help decipher the trend direction as well. The ADX alone measures trend strength but not direction. As a momentum indicator, the Williams R% may be used with other technicals to help define a specific trend. Many investors will use the CCI in conjunction with other indicators when evaluating a trade.
The 14-day ADX for Allstate Corp (ALL) is now 23.46. A level under 20 would indicate no trend, and a reading from 20-25 would suggest that there is no clear trend signal. Some analysts believe that the ADX is one of the best trend strength indicators available. A value of 50-75 would signal a very strong trend, and a value of 75-100 would indicate an extremely strong trend.Looking further at additional technical indicators we can see that the 14-day Commodity Channel Index (CCI) for Spok Holdings Inc (SPOK) is sitting at -82.18. The CCI was created to typically stay within the reading of -100 to +100. Investors and traders may be looking to figure out if a stock is trending before employing a specific trading strategy.Investors have placed FIAMMA HOLDINGS BERHAD (6939.KL) shares on watch as the Aroon Up indicator has moved above 70, indicating that there is strong upward momentum building for the shares. On the other hand, a reading of -100 would imply that the stock is oversold and possibly set for a rally.Traders are paying renewed attention to shares of Beyond Commerce Inc (BYOC). After a recent check, the 14-day RSIfor Tantech Holdings Ltd (TANH) is now at 53.81, the 7-day stands at 53.96, and the 3-day is sitting at 50.38. The RSI, or Relative Strength Index is a popular oscillating indicator among traders and investors. Normal oscillations tend to stay in the range of -100 to +100. Conducting thorough fundamental research on stocks even after they have broken out may help the investor understand the reason behind the move, and whether it is likely to continue or if it is just a temporary spike. The opposite is the case when the RSI line is heading lower. Over time, many may gain back the ground they lost and return to previous levels. The ADX is a technical indicator developed by J. Welles Wilder used to determine the strength of a trend.

LISHUI, China, July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Tantech Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:   TANH), ("Tantech" or the "Company"), a leading alternative energy company through the use of bamboo-based charcoal products today announced it completed the acquisition of 70% equity interest in Suzhou E Motors Co., Ltd. ("Suzhou E Motors"), a specialty electric vehicles and power batteries manufacturer based in Zhangjiagang City, Jiangsu Province.
Merger Highlights 









Acquiring 70% equity interest in Suzhou E Motors from Mr. Henglong Chen 
Broadening customer base and cross-selling opportunities 
Accelerating revenue and earnings growth 
Establishing Tantech Holdings as leader in environmental-friendly technology

Mr. Zhengyu Wang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tantech, commented, "We are pleased to complete this acquisition today, by acquiring 70% equity interest in Suzhou E Motors which will make us a leader in specialty EVs in China," 
Mr. Wang continued, "As discussed in our letter to shareholders on February 2017, improving the environment is the Company's core mission. The acquisition brings economic synergies, new advanced technologies and accelerates our research and development efforts – resulting in what we believe will be tremendous value for the Company and its shareholders."
Terms of Merger
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement executed on May 2, 2016, Supplemental Agreement I signed on December 22, 2016 and Supplemental Agreement II signed on July 12, 2017, the Company shall acquire 70% equity interest of Suzhou E Motors directly from Mr. Henglong Chen with total cash consideration of RMB 103,200,000 (approximately $14.7 million) and a share consideration of 2,500,000 restricted shares of the Company's common stock. 
The Company had originally negotiated to acquire 100% of Suzhou E Motors'; however, following Suzhou E Motors' minority shareholder, Zhangjiagang Jinke Venture Capital Co., Ltd. (Jinke Venture Capital), a local government-led VC fund, opted to retain its 30% interest as it believes the synergy between Tantech Holdings and Suzhou E Motors to be extremely promising.
The Company exercised such terms with the belief that it is in the best interests of its shareholders.
Suzhou E Motors – a leader in specialized electric vehicles
Since its inception in 2011, Suzhou E Motors has produced consecutive annual revenue growth of greater than 350%, reaching revenues of $12 million in 2015 compared to $2.7 million in 2014 and $0.85 million in 2013.  Suzhou E Motors designs, assembles and distributes three types of electric vehicles: 

Urban sanitary vehicles: Suzhou's urban sanitary vehicles work at high efficiencies with low operating expenses.  Cleaning surfaces at speeds up to 15 miles per hour, the vehicles are equipped with professional sanitary vehicle chassis, front axle drives and steering, which improve operational ease and reliability. The vehicle is made of strengthened steel plates and pipes, making it more durable and corrosion resistant.  
Electric logistics vehicles: Electric logistics vehicles are designed exclusively for logistics/delivery companies. The vehicles are six meters in length and 100% powered by electricity. The vehicles are built with an eye to quality and efficiency with long-lasting, heavy-duty steel construction; spacious interiors and ingenious door designs made specifically for the deliverers' convenience. 
Mini tourist buses:  Suzhou's lithium battery-powered tourist buses come in two sizes – 7 meters and 12 meters. The buses reduce emissions by up to 75% and cut fuel consumption by as much as half. The buses are also designed with noise pollution in mind.  Interior noise is less than 76 dBs and acceleration noise is less than 82 dBs. 

Growing revenue and cost synergies expected
The combination of both companies will bring strong revenue synergies. Access to Suzhou Motors technology will offer new, incremental revenue streams in addition to cross-selling opportunities to Suzhou's large diversified customer base.
Growth and diversification through acquisition and new product development 
"This is the first of many attractive eco-friendly assets that we intend to acquire as a way of strengthening our position as a leader in environmentally-friendly technology and further diversifying our revenue base," notes Tantech's CEO, Zhengyu Wang. 
"As Tantech Holdings becomes a larger player in the EV market, we are looking at investing in related businesses, such as vehicle financing, both to build a competitive edge in China's rapidly growing demand for automobiles as well as a way of further diversifying Tantech Holdings' revenue and profit streams," commented CEO Wang.  According to Bank of China, the car financing market was between US$116 -131 billion in 2015. Within this market, the auto financial leasing sector is estimated to exhibit the strongest growth, at compounded annual growth rate of at least 60% during the next five years.
Continuing the journey to support the environment 
Tantech has a track record and capabilities in the past in contributing to a more environmental responsible world. After providing a series of products that proved fully replaceable to traditional coal, Tantech moved on to the provision of cleaner energy sources by entering the electric vehicle industry with this new acquisition. 
The addition of Suzhou E Motors will further reduce Tantech's reliance on the consumer market. Along with expansion into new businesses, Tantech's revenue and profits are increasingly insulated by rising demand for household hygiene products. As disposable income rises, so does interest in environmental protection and cleanliness. Rising disposable leads to higher demand for household hygiene items such as antibacterial products and disinfectants.
With solid technologies and R&D foundation, along with previous successes, Tantech plans to continue expanding and diversifying their products by developing and acquiring more eco-friendly assets in the future.

"As Tantech Holdings becomes a larger player in the EV market, we are looking at investing in related businesses, such as vehicle financing, both to build a competitive edge in China's rapidly growing demand for automobiles as well as a way of further diversifying Tantech Holdings' (TANH) revenue and profit streams," commented CEO Wang.  According to Bank of China, the car financing market was between US$116 -131 billion in 2015. Within this market, the auto financial leasing sector is estimated to exhibit the strongest growth, at compounded annual growth rate of at least 60% during the next five years.
Continuing the journey to support the environment 
Tantech (TANH) has a track record and capabilities in the past in contributing to a more environmental responsible world. After providing a series of products that proved fully replaceable to traditional coal, Tantech (TANH) moved on to the provision of cleaner energy sources by entering the electric vehicle industry with this new acquisition. 
The addition of Suzhou E Motors will further reduce Tantech's (TANH) reliance on the consumer market. Along with expansion into new businesses, Tantech's (TANH) revenue and profits are increasingly insulated by rising demand for household hygiene products. As disposable income rises, so does interest in environmental protection and cleanliness. Rising disposable leads to higher demand for household hygiene items such as antibacterial products and disinfectants.
With solid technologies and R&D foundation, along with previous successes, Tantech (TANH) plans to continue expanding and diversifying their products by developing and acquiring more eco-friendly assets in the future.

How is performance calculated?







 





U.S. Sectors & Industries Performance is represented by the S&P 500 GICS® (Global Industry Classification Standard) indices. Last % change is the nominal change in the price of the index from the previous trading day's close expressed as a percentage as of the index value at the time noted in the Date & Time field.  All dates and times are reported in ET.
Last % change is the nominal change in the price of the index from the previous trading day's close expressed as a percentage as of the index value at the time noted in the Date & Time field. All dates and times are reported in ET. Chart Performance figures may vary slightly from 1 Year % Change due to different timeframes used in chart calculations.
GICS is an industry classification system developed by Standard & Poor's in collaboration with Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI). S&P uses GICS to determine the market segment to which a company is assigned. A company is assigned to a single GICS industry according to the definition of its principal business activity as determined by Standard & Poor's and MSCI. Revenues are a significant factor in defining principal business activity; however, earnings analysis and market perception are also important criteria for classification. There are currently 10 sectors and 68 industries.  Three of the 68 industries do not have companies represented in the S&P 500 Index; therefore, performance is not available for Marine, Transportation and Infrastructure, and Water Utilities.
Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index is an unmanaged market-weighted index of 500 of the nation's largest stocks from a broad variety of industries. The S&P 500 represents about 80% of the total market value of all stocks on the New York Stock Exchange. Market-weighted means that component stocks are weighted according to the total value of their outstanding shares.
Indexes are unmanaged, statistical composites and their returns do not include payment of any sales charges or fees an investor would pay to purchase the securities they represent. Such costs would lower performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.










*Due to contract expiration dates, there may be instances where the last-traded price for an expiring contract may be blended with the first price traded for a new contract in order to show one continuous price without expiration.News, commentary, market data and research reports are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity and are provided for informational purposes only.

Our technology truly reaches across the spectrum by being able to do almost anything from replacing coal charcoals, which are used in heaters and cookstoves, with a cleaner energy approach that would consist of bamboo charcoal that is more sustainable to produce and burns significantly cleaner than traditional coal.In addition, we also produce carbon related products with absorption function for the usage of indoor and automobile interior. All of these can reduce indoor air pollution.As you may recall, Tantech made its debut on the Nasdaq under the symbol "TANH" in March 2015. At that time, over 80% of our sales were generated by a price insensitive and highly competitive global consumer base. However, due to management's efforts to improve the merchandise mix, consumer sales accounted for less than 74% of our total revenues in the ensuing years Now we are preparing to reap the benefits of our work over the next several years.Our key achievements include:Growth and Diversification: On January 27, 2016, we entered into a framework agreement to acquire Suzhou E Motors Co., Ltd., a specialty electric vehicles and power batteries manufacturer. This potential acquisition is the first of many attractive eco-friendly assets that we will be acquiring. We are currently looking into the purchase of a number of eco-friendly brands that are well established in 2nd and 3rd tier cities within China, where pollution is more severe and where more opportunities lie.Investing in Innovation: Continuous technological advantages and ongoing innovation is at the core of Tantech's business strategy. To this end, we have doubled our R&D spending from $700,000 in 2014 to $1.5m in 2016. In 2017, we plan to further increase R&D spending as economies of scale are expected to free up additional investment funds. In addition to the continuing R&D efforts in our consumer Charcoal Doctor products. Tantech will gradually move our R&D focus to capacitors and batteries as well as special vehicle for sanitary use. Recently we received government funding in lieu of the green manufacturing technology of barbecue charcoal.Streamline distribution channels: Previous distribution strategy involved negotiating directly with supermarkets which resulted in lower gross margins - to improve our bargaining powers in the market, we have decided to restructure our distribution network in an effort to cut both overall time and costs relating to the sales cycle, thereby positively impacting our gross margins.Company Sees Growth in 2017Our goal for 2017 is to grow our client base and capture additional market share. Our business development efforts are focused on the following three primary areas: Barbecue charcoal, bamboo charcoal products, new energy vehicles.Over the next few years, the Company expects to grow revenues on an annual basis. While as we gain economies of scale, our expenses will grow more modestly going forward. Operating profits are expected to grow substantially faster as the company expands its profitability.Addressing Share Price VolatilityAs an emerging growth enterprise, Tantech's share price is often affected by macroeconomic forces that have little to no impact on our fundamental business. For example, the shares of many companies doing business in China have come under pressure as economic growth slows from the low-double digit range earlier in this decade to a range of 6-7%. Industrial and infrastructure companies, in particular, have been hard hit by these changes; however, Tantech's industrial business revenues grew 27% from 2014 to 2015 and revenue slowed in 2016. A more recent development is investor concern over the intermediate term prospects for clean and alternative energy companies as low oil prices make alternative fuel sources less economically attractive and as the Trump administration seeks to cut support and regulation supporting the development of clean alternative energy in the US.Telling the Story to the Investor CommunityFinally, a few words about our investor outreach efforts.  As noted, the past two years have been about establishing and positioning the business for sustainable growth.  We understand the importance of building and maintaining trust with the investment community and purposefully waited until the pieces were in place to bring our story to the markets. We believe we have reached that juncture in the next stage of our business plan and, accordingly, will be significantly increasing our shareholder communications efforts this year to ensure our progress and key achievements are effectively communicated to both existing as well as new potential investors. I personally believe the latest series of developments will make our growth prospects more clear and should make the investing public stand up and take notice of Tantech Holdings and its investment merits.Kind Regards,/s/Wang Zhengyu Chairman and Chief Executive Officer"About Tantech Holdings LimitedEstablished in 2001 and headquartered in Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, China, Tantech Holdings Ltd.

(TANH), ("Tantech" or the "Company"), a leading manufacturer of bamboo-based charcoal products, today announced its financial results for the six months ended June 30, 2016.Six-Month 2016 Financial Highlights   For the Six Months Ended June 30,     ($ millions, expect per share data)   2016    2015    % Change     Revenues   $22.8    $30.4    -25%     Consumer product   $18.7    $21.1    -11.4%     Trading   $0.2    $3.3    -93.3%     Energy   $3.8    $6.0    -36.7%     Gross profit   $6.0    $9.8    -38.8%     Gross margin   26.3%    32.1%    -18.7%     Operating margin   10.8%    18.8%    -42.6%     Net income attributable to stockholders   $1.5    $4.9    -69.4%     Basic/ Diluted earnings per share   $0.07    $0.23    -69.6%  Total revenues decreased by 25% to $22.8 million with impact on strong dollar appreciation against Chinese yuan (20% total revenue decline in terms of RMB) and significant decline for trading and energy segments, partially by decrease in sale for trading charcoal related productsRevenues for energy segment decreased by 36.7% to $3.8 million, or 16.7% of total revenues, on weak EDLC carbon demand.Gross profit decreased by 38.8% to $6.0 million and gross margin decreased by 18.7 percentage points to 26.3%.Net income attributable to stockholders decreased by 69.4% to $1.5 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to $4.9 million, or $0.23 per share for the same period of last year."Although the overall revenue declined, our traditional core businesses, in particular the sales of household products, still recorded strong growth. The Company maintained stable operations in the first half of this year. During the reporting period we reached an agreement to acquire Suzhou E-Motors Co. Ltd. Currently we are in the midst of transformation, and have taken a series of measures to lay a solid ground for future development," said Mr. Wang Zhengyu, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Tantech. "First, we have gradually increased the share of wholesalers in our distribution network while reducing the share of supermarkets to improve our bargaining power. Before, the company mainly sold its products through supermarkets, and the high reliance on supermarkets undermined our bargaining power. Second, China has shut down a large number of small manufacturers of charcoal kilns in recent years amid its fight against air pollution. The massive closure has had a negative impact on our upstream suppliers. To fend off the impact, the company has been exploring a variety of ways to ensure the supply of raw materials. Finally, the company is working closely with Suzhou E –Motors towards completion of the transaction. However, the delay in ownership transfer has slowed our acquisition of Suzhou E-Motors. "Looking ahead, Mr. Wang said: "In the future, the company will continue to reduce the share of supermarkets in our distribution network and increase the share of wholesalers. In particular, we will ramp up marketing efforts in third- and fourth-tier small Chinese cities. Meanwhile, we will quicken the buildup of E-commerce platform to improve the company's brand image. Just weeks ago the company released upgraded bamboo charcoal bedding articles, which have stronger absorption capacities compared to the predecessors. In the future we will keep spending on research to develop more high-value added products. In addition, we will seek opportunities to cooperate with other consumer product manufacturers, and may acquire some of them to expand our business." Mr. Jing Jin, Chief Financial Officer of Tantech, added: "In the first half of this year, intensifying competition between traditional supermarkets and E-commerce platforms like Taobao.com and 360buy.com drove down the company's gross margin and slowed cash inflow. However, in the second half, a traditional high season for consumer products, we expect our cash inflow and financial performance to improve by the end of 2016."  Six-Month 2016 Financial ResultsRevenues Total revenues decreased by $7.6 million, or 25%, to $22.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $30.4 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decreased sales from our trading segment and energy segment and partially a few specific types of products will discuss in below.   For the Six Months Ended June 30,      2016    2015      Revenues ($'000)    Gross Profit ($'000)    Gross Margin (%)    Revenues ($'000)    Gross Profit ($'000)    Gross Margin (%)     Consumer product   18,748    5,507    29.4%    21,121    8,060    38.2%     Trading   221    42    19.1%    3,290    52    1.6%     Energy   3,820    450    11.8%    5,984    1,657    27.7%     Total   22,789    5,999    26.3%    30,395    9,769    32.1%  Revenues for consumer product segment decreased by $2.4 million, or 11.4%, to $18.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $21.1 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales for our quick burning charcoal products. There was no sale on quick burning charcoal product in the first half of 2016 compared to $5.3 million for the same period of last year, due to close down of one major supplier for local environmental control. However, it showed 25.8% of increasing sale on household products. We sold approximately 2.5 million pieces of air purification products and 3.7 million pieces of deodorization products for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to approximately 1.6 million and 3.2 million pieces, respectively, for the same period of last year. The average selling prices of air purification and deodorization products decreased by 8.2% and 2.5%, respectively for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to the same period of last year. Revenues for trading segment decreased by $3.1 million, or 93.3%, to $0.22 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $3.3 million for the same period of last year.  This decrease was attributable to company sale strategy change to drop off in trading sales for third party produced charcoal products which does not generate profits. Therefore, the gross margin in trading segment increased sharply from 1.6% to 19.1% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.Read MoreRevenues for energy segment decreased by $2.2 million, or 36.7%, to $3.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $6.0 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreased sales of EDLC carbon in the six months ended June 30, 2016. We sold 127 tons of EDLC carbon for the six months ended June 30, 2016, compared to 175 tons for the same period of last year.

The increase was primarily attributable to higher shipping expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of last year.General and administrative expenses decreased by $0.03 million, or 1.2%, to $2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $2.9 million for the same period of last year.Research and development expenses decreased by $0.4 million, or 61.3%, to $0.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 from $0.7 million for the same period of last year.
