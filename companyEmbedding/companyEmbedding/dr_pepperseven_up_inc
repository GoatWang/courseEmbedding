History of Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.








Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. (DPSU) is the number three soft drink maker in the world, trailing only the two industry giants: Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo, Inc. It is also the U.S. leader in noncola soft drinks, with its two flagship brands holding top ten positions among all soft drinks--Dr Pepper at number six and 7 Up at number nine. Wholly owned by U.K. confectionery and drink maker Cadbury Schweppes plc since 1995, DPSU also produces a number of other drink brands, including Welch's, IBC Root Beer and Cream Soda, Canada Dry, Schweppes, A & W, Crush, Sunkist, Squirt, Mott's, Hires, Sun-drop, Vernors, and Country Time.

Early Development of Dr Pepper

Dr Pepper, the elder brand of the two flagship brands, was invented in Waco, Texas, at Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store. In 1885 a young pharmacist who worked for Morrison's, Charles C. Alderton, experimented on his own soft drink. He mixed phosphorescent water, fruit juice, sugar, and other ingredients to produce a new soft drink unlike any tasted before. With Morrison's approval, Alderton offered the drink to the store's customers. One of these jokingly called the concoction 'Dr. Pepper's drink'--for Dr. Charles Pepper, the disapproving father of a woman Morrison had been courting, suggesting that Pepper might be flattered.
The name and the soft drink, with its tart, yet sweet flavor, became popular locally, and in 1887 Morrison offered beverage chemist Robert S. Lazenby the opportunity to participate in the marketing and development of this new product. After sampling 'Dr Pepper's drink,' Lazenby agreed to go into partnership with Morrison to produce the beverage at his Circle A Ginger Ale Company, also in Waco. Alderton, the drink's inventor, dissociated himself from Dr Pepper, opting instead to turn his talents to the pharmaceutical trade.
The new product, 'Dr Pepper's Phos-Ferrates,' was available only in soda fountains until 1891, when the manufacturers began bottling the beverage. With Lazenby handling the business end, Dr Pepper became a top seller in and around Texas. Expansion was inevitable, and Lazenby sought a marketing opportunity to introduce Dr Pepper to the world.
The ideal forum was the 1904 World's Fair, held in St. Louis. Lazenby and his son-in-law, J.B. O'Hara, demonstrated their product there, providing samples of Dr Pepper to some of the approximately 20 million World's Fair visitors. Incidentally, the 1904 exhibition also showcased other innovations, including the ice-cream cone and buns for hot dogs and hamburgers. Dr Pepper's success encouraged Lazenby and Morrison, who founded the Artesian Manufacturing and Bottling Company, which would eventually be renamed the Dr Pepper Company; by 1923, headquarters were moved from Waco to Dallas, Texas.

Early Development of 7 Up

Around 1920, while Dr Pepper was growing in favor, C.L. Grigg, an advertising veteran of 30 years, had formed the Howdy Company in St. Louis, Missouri. The company was named for the Howdy orange-flavored soft drink Grigg had developed, but the CEO had other ideas--specifically, to invent a new flavor of beverage. For two years, Grigg tested different combinations of lemon and other flavors. By the mid-1920s he had settled on a distinctive lemon-lime formula and in 1929 the Howdy Company introduced the soda to the general public.
Grigg and company were confident of their invention's appeal. As an early sales bulletin noted, consumers 'are tired of the insipid flavors, and the aftertaste of the heavy synthetic flavors is more objectionable. ... So in our beverage we have provided seven natural flavors so blended and in such proportions that, when bottled, it produces a big natural flavor with a real taste that makes people remember it.'
The only thing that might have stood in the way of the drink's early success was its name, 'Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda.' Griggs derived the new and much simpler name, 7 Up, from the beverage's 'seven natural flavors.' The new name first appeared on the bottle later in 1929. The beverage sold well, and the new name made it easy for consumers to remember. In 1936, the Howdy Company became the Seven-Up Company, and by the 1940s its product became the world's third largest selling soft drink.









Marketing Developments: 1930s-80s

Although what distinguished both drinks from the rest of the market was unique flavor, neither beverage was marketed simply as a refreshment. Indeed, both Dr Pepper, whose name still retained the period at this time, and 7 Up were promoted as health drinks in their first decades. In the 1930s, Dr Pepper's famous slogan 'Drink a bite to eat at 10, 2 & 4' capitalized on the idea that one typically experienced an energy slump during those hours; a serving of Dr. Pepper would presumably provide the energy boost needed to make it through the day. At the same time, 7 Up boasted in ads that it 'energizes ... sets you up, dispels brain cobwebs and muscular fatigue.'
The fortunes of both companies grew during World War II, with Dr Pepper able to go public in 1946, while the postwar period saw the Baby Boom, which produced an unprecedented number of soft drink consumers. In their marketing efforts, both beverage companies sought to appeal to this lucrative market. Dr Pepper, for instance, became a regular sponsor of the hit teen show 'American Bandstand,' while 7 Up became noted for its 'uncola' campaign of the late 1960s, which capitalized on the individualistic tendencies of young people by distancing 7 Up from the cola market. In the 1970s Dr Pepper was marketed through the long-running 'Be a Pepper' campaign.
Later advertising efforts avoided the so-called 'cola wars' of the 1980s, focusing instead on what made Dr Pepper and 7 Up different. Dr Pepper ads declared the soft drink was 'just what the Dr ordered,' while Diet Dr Pepper was 'the taste you've been looking for.' 7 Up introduced an animated character, 'Spot,' derived from the its long-used logo, a large 7 with a red spot in the middle, that revitalized the 'uncola' theme that worked so well in the 1970s. Both companies also spent years testing and introducing new products while refining existing ones. Both Dr Pepper and 7 Up brought out 'diet' versions by the early 1970s. In 1981 Dr Pepper purchased the rights to Welch's soft drinks.

1984-95: Ownership Changes, Then Dr Pepper/Seven Up

Dr Pepper was traded on the New York Stock Exchange until 1984, when it was taken private in a $615 million leveraged buyout by Forstmann Little & Co. Some of the company's assets were stripped to pay down debt, overhead was cut, and a new promotional campaign was launched. Meantime, Seven-Up was a privately owned family business that did not avail itself of public trading until 1967. In 1978 cigarette maker Philip Morris bought Seven-Up, which soon went into a profit slide. By 1986 Philip Morris was set to sell the struggling Seven-Up Company to PepsiCo while Coca-Cola was seeking to buy Dr Pepper. The Federal Trade Commission, however, blocked both proposed acquisitions for antitrust reasons, although Philip Morris was allowed to sell Seven-Up's international operations to PepsiCo. Dallas-based investment bank Hicks & Haas then entered the picture, purchasing Dr Pepper in another leveraged buyout for $406 million in August 1986. Participating in the buyout was Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, which gained a minority stake in Dr Pepper. Later in 1986, Hicks & Haas struck again, purchasing the U.S. operations of Seven-Up for $240 million. Two years later, Hicks & Haas merged Dr Pepper and Seven-Up, forming the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Companies, Inc. on May 19, 1988. The combined market strength of the two companies created a stronger contender in the soft drink market, against Coke and Pepsi. The new company began with a brand portfolio that included Dr Pepper and 7 Up (both in regular and diet versions), caffeine-free Dr Pepper and diet Dr Pepper, Cherry 7 Up (introduced in 1987), Welch's, and IBC Root Beer and Cream Soda.
In 1990 Dr Pepper/Seven Up entered the sport drink field with Nautilus Thirst Quencher. Like rival Gatorade, Nautilus was promoted as a high-electrolyte, energy-producing beverage to revive athletes. But Nautilus also stood out in its debut as the only major brand sport drink sweetened entirely by aspartame (the artificial sweetener marketed under the name NutraSweet).
In January 1993 Dr Pepper/Seven Up went public through an initial public offering. The $15 per share IPO raised $283.5 million, which was used to redeem the company's preferred stock and to retire debt. During the early 1990s DPSU enjoyed vigorous growth, with sales increasing from $658.7 million to $769 million from 1992 to 1994 alone. These gains came despite the continuing struggles of the 7 Up brand, which by this time had been surpassed by rival brand Sprite, owned by Coca-Cola. Dr Pepper's popularity, however, was on the increase; it was in fact the fastest-growing U.S. carbonated beverage, garnering a compound average growth of 8.5 percent a year from 1989 through 1993. Overall, DPSU's share of the domestic soft drink market increased from 9.8 percent in 1991 to 11.4 percent in 1994.
As of mid-1993 Cadbury Schweppes held a 5.7 percent stake in Dr Pepper/Seven Up, the holding stemming from its minority interest in Dr Pepper. Prudential Insurance Co. held a 22.2 percent stake in DPSU, which it sold to Cadbury in August 1993 for $231.8 million, raising Cadbury's stake in DPSU to 25.9 percent. Under the leadership of John Albers, DPSU quickly adopted a poison pill measure which discouraged Cadbury from making any immediate moves to further raise its stake or initiate a complete takeover. Albers also refused to grant its suitor a seat on the board as it had requested. Meantime, Cadbury in October 1993 further increased its presence in the U.S. market through the acquisition of A & W Brands Inc., thereby gaining U.S. ownership or rights to the flagship A & W root beer brand, the citrus-flavored Squirt, Vernors ginger ale, and Country Time lemonades. Cadbury already controlled the Schweppes, Canada Dry, Crush, Mott's, and Sunkist brands.

Subsidiary of Cadbury Schweppes Starting in 1995

The addition of A & W Brands increased Cadbury's share of the U.S. soft drink market to 5.6 percent. But the U.K. company aimed to become the leading producer of noncola soft drinks in the world; the emphasis on the noncola sector made particular sense in the U.S. market, where noncola sales were increasing at a ten percent per year clip while cola sales were merely edging ahead at four percent a year. The quickest path to achieving this goal was the acquisition of DPSU, particularly since Cadbury believed the Dr Pepper brand had untapped potential outside the United States, as it held a mere one percent of the world market. In March 1995, then, Cadbury Schweppes acquired the 74 percent of Dr Pepper/Seven Up stock it did not already own for $33 per share, or $1.7 billion. Leading the newly named Dr Pepper/Cadbury of North America, Inc. was John F. Brock, a Cadbury veteran. Although it still lagged far behind industry behemoths Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Dr Pepper/Cadbury was a much stronger number three player in the United States, with a market share of 17 percent and a strong roster of brands, including: Dr Pepper, 7 Up, Welch's, IBC, Canada Dry, Schweppes, A & W, Crush, Sunkist, Squirt, Mott's, Hires, Sun-drop, Vernors, and Country Time. During 1997 the name of the company was changed to Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. and Todd Stitzer, another Cadbury veteran, was named president and CEO of the new DPSU.
During the late 1990s DPSU made several moves to solidify the bottling and distribution of its brands in the United States. In May 1996 Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest soft drink distributor, agreed to manufacture and distribute Dr Pepper brand products until at least year-end 2000 and several other DPSU brands-including Schweppes, Canada Dry, and Squirt--through the end of 1998. In January 1998 this licensing agreement was extended, with the above dates changed to year-end 2005 and year-end 2001, respectively. In December 1998 DPSU reached another multiyear agreement with the Pepsi Bottling Group, whereby the latter would continue bottling DPSU soft drink brands. Perhaps most importantly, Cadbury Schweppes and the Carlyle Group of Washington, D.C., in early 1998 formed a joint venture named the American Bottling Company, which was initially comprised of the merger of two leading independent bottling groups in the Midwest--Beverage American and Select Beverages. A year later American Bottling was combined with another independent bottler, Dr Pepper Bottling Company of Texas. The creation of American Bottling--whereby the company gained ownership of at least part of its bottling system--was designed to give Dr Pepper/Seven Up greater control over the distribution of its brands.
As it headed into a new century, Dr Pepper/Seven Up faced a number of challenges, perhaps most importantly the continuing need to revitalize the 7 Up brand. By the end of the 1990s, the brand had fallen to the number nine position in the U.S. soft drink market. A series of ad campaigns in the 1990s, a 1998 formula change--the first ever for the brand--and such packaging changes as the dropping of the 'Uncola' slogan all failed to stem the brand's decline. Cadbury Schweppes had also attempted in 1999 to sell its soft drink brands&mdash&prime;incipally Schweppes, Dr Pepper, Canada Dry, and Crush--outside the United States, France, and South Africa to Coca-Cola for $1.85 billion. A number of nations raised antitrust concerns about the deal, however, and its fate was uncertain. Despite such question marks, Dr Pepper/Seven Up was the clear number three soft drink maker in the United States and appeared headed for a bright future based on the increasing popularity of the Dr Pepper brand and the company's emphasis on the hot noncola sector.

Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) Q2 Earnings: A Beat in the Cards?


July 25, 2017, 09:45:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. DPS  is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.    Last quarter, this Texas-based beverage company posted a positive surprise of 5.2%. The company also surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, resulting in an average positive surprise of 3.44%.    Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.   Why a Likely Positive Surprise?    Our proven model shows that Dr Pepper Snapple is likely to beat earnings because it has the perfect combination of two key ingredients.   Zacks ESP  : Dr Pepper Snapple's Earnings ESP  is +2.36% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.30, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at $1.27. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter  .   Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise        Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS   Surprise    |   Dr   Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Quote   Zacks Rank:  Dr Pepper Snapple currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.    Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.    The combination of Dr Pepper Snapple's Zacks Rank #3 and +2.36% ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.   Factors to Consider    A look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company's earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share declined by a penny in the past 30 days to $1.27. However, this reflects a year-over-year increase of 1.8%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.77 billion for the said quarter, reflecting a 4.4% increase from a year ago.    We are optimistic about Dr Pepper Snapple's focus on forming distribution agreements with emerging, high-growth third-party brands. These allied brand partnerships allow the company to participate in adjacent and growing categories while also fully tapping into its manufacturing and distribution network. Allied brands have been an important driver of revenues and profits over the past few quarters. The acquisition of Bai Brands is the evidence of its diversification efforts toward lessening its exposure to carbonated soft drinks ("CSD").    Also, the company's aggressive marketing campaigns, pricing gains, innovation and productivity improvements are expected to boost sales. We are also encouraged by the company's Rapid Continuous Improvement program through which it has been able to reduce inventory and storage costs and improve cash flows.    The company earlier notified that marketing expenses, excluding Bai Brands, is expected to increase by about $20 million in the second quarter. Also, it expected about a $5-million increase in health, welfare and risk insurance in the second quarter.    We are concerned about the week carbonated beverages volume trends and persistent pressure from adverse foreign currency movement. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting CSD category growth. Foreign currency headwind is expected to impact core EPS by 7 cents in 2017, primarily because of the Mexican peso. Again, foreign currency translation is likely to dent overall 2017 revenue growth by approximately 1%.

Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. (DPSU) was a Plano, Texas-based[1] soft-drink manufacturing company created by the merger of Dr Pepper, Inc. and The 7 Up Company on May 19, 1986. The merger was a result of the independent bailouts of both companies[2] and the subsequent FTC blockage of a Dr Pepper merger with Coca-Cola.[3] The DPSU merger resulted in the breakup of international branding rights held by the two independent companies.
Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. was purchased by Cadbury Schweppes plc and the Carlyle Group on March 2, 1995 after the conglomerate became debt-ridden and insolvent. It sold for about US$1.7 billion, plus about US$870 million of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up debt. This made Cadbury Schweppes the largest soft drink company in the world not to be named after a cola beverage.
In early 2006, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the remainder of Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. and Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group from The Carlyle Group. All Dr Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. assets were absorbed into Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, which included Mott's Beverages and Snapple Beverages. Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group was merged with other Cadbury-acquired bottlers and renamed Cadbury Schweppes Bottling Group.
In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes spun off Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages into an independent company called the Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and renamed itself to Cadbury plc Dr Pepper/Seven Up only exist as a trademark as of 2016..[4]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. is an American soft drink company, based in Plano, Texas. Formerly called Cadbury Schweppes Americas Beverages, on May 5, 2008, it was spun off from Britain's Cadbury Schweppes, with trading in its shares starting on May 7, 2008. Cadbury Schweppes plc went on to become Cadbury plc on May 5, 2008.[4][5]

History[edit]
Beverage America and Select Beverages bottlers were purchased from the Carlyle Group in February 1998.[6] Snapple, Mistic and Stewart's (formerly Cable Car Beverage) were sold by Triarc Companies, Inc. to Cadbury Schweppes in 2000 for $1.45 billion.[7] In October of that same year, Cadbury Schweppes purchased Royal Crown from Triarc.[8]
In 2006 and 2007, Cadbury Schweppes purchased the Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, along with several other regional bottlers. This allowed DPS to bottle many of its own beverages and combat the recent decision by many Pepsi and Coke bottlers who had dropped their Dr Pepper and Snapple products to promote new product additions from Pepsi and Coke. Some of the Dr Pepper/Seven Up brands are still licensed to Pepsi, Coke and independent bottlers in various regions of the United States and Canada.
In November 2007, Cadbury Schweppes announced it would take the beverages unit public. In May 2008, Cadbury Schweppes demerged its beverage holdings forming the Dr Pepper Snapple Group.
Dr Pepper Snapple Group holds naming rights to Dr Pepper Ballpark and the Dallas Stars' practice facility, the Dr Pepper Star Center, both of which are located in Frisco, Texas. It also retains non-alcoholic beverage rights to each facility's concessions as a result of the deals as well as sponsorships with the NHL franchise.
In 2008, Dr Pepper Snapple Group purchased minority interest in Big Red, Inc, makers of Big Red, NuGrape, Nesbitt's and other flavored drinks.[9]
In 2014, the company announced that it accomplished its goal of reducing use of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in its plastic bottles. Dr Pepper Snapple lowered the amount of PET in its bottles by over 60 million pounds between 2007 and 2014.[10]
On November 22, 2016 it was announced that Dr Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group had made a cash purchase of Bai Brands for the price of $1.7 billion. It had previously purchased a minority stake in the company for $15 million in 2015.[11]

7UP
The Seven-Up Company's roots go back to 1920, when C. L. Grigg set himself to create a distinctive soft drink that would prove irresistible to the nation's consumers.

EARLY ADVERTISING
The earliest 7UP advertising featured a winged 7UP logo and described the soft drink as "a glorified drink in bottles only. Seven natural flavors blended into a savory, flavory drink with a real wallop."







THE UNCOLA
In 1967, 7UP introduced the UNCOLA advertising campaign, which sent 7UP sales rocketing nationwide. The tag immediately joined the nation's vernacular and remained synonymous with 7UP, despite subsequent new slogans.







NO CAFFEINE
The 7UP "No Caffeine" campaign garnered national attention for the company in 1982, as it appealed to growing consumer concern and confusion about caffeine in soft drinks. It launched 7UP sales into an unprecedented period of growth.







SEE SPOT GO
In 1987, 7UP introduced Spot, a character derived from the red dot in the 7UP trademark. Spot rapidly developed into a popular character represented on licensed items throughout the nation.







MAKE 7UP YOURS
New advertising featuring actor/comedian Orlando Jones and the slogan "Make 7UP Yours" was launched in late 1999. The popular campaign continued in 2000, introducing comedian/actor Godfrey as the bumbling 7UP guy.






History
Banking on his 30 years of experience in advertising and merchandising, Grigg formed The Howdy Corporation, named for the Howdy Orange drink he pioneered.

Grigg spent more than two years testing 11 different formulas of lemon-flavored drinks. He settled on one that fulfilled the characteristics he sought: refreshing and thirst-quenching. Grigg introduced his new soft drink two weeks before the stock market crashed in October 1929. It was a caramel-colored lemon-lime soda, which he positioned as a drink with a "flavor wallop" to market alongside the already-successful Howdy Orange drink.

It cost more than its competition. It also carried the burden of an unwieldy name, "Bib-Label Lithiated Lemon-Lime Soda," and it competed against more than 600 lemon-lime soft drinks already in the marketplace. In spite of all the obstacles, the new brand sold well. Shortly afterwards, Grigg changed the brand's name to 7UP.

Acknowledging the success of the 7UP trademark in 1936, Grigg changed the name of The Howdy Corporation to The Seven-Up Company. By the late 1940s, 7UP had become the third best-selling soft drink in the world.

In 1970, The Seven-Up Company introduced sugar-free 7UP, which was an immediate success among the growing number of calorie-conscious Americans. It was named Diet 7UP in 1979.

In June 1978, Philip Morris acquired The Seven-Up Company, then sold the domestic operations to a private investment group in 1986. The company was merged with Dr Pepper Company, and the new management team consolidated administrative functions of The Seven-Up Company at the Dallas headquarters of Dr Pepper Company. Manufacturing of 7UP products remained at the company's St. Louis facility.

In early 1987, Cherry 7UP and Diet Cherry 7UP were introduced. Marketed to young people, the new products were designed as light, refreshing additions to the prestigious family of 7UP brand products and met with instant success across the country.

With the March 1995 acquisition of Dr Pepper/Seven-Up Companies, Inc. by Cadbury Schweppes, 7UP became part of Cadbury Beverages North America.

In 2010, 7UP was reformulated with a crisper, cleaner taste and given a "ridiculously bubbly" new look.

Today, 7UP is part of Dr Pepper Snapple Group, an integrated refreshment beverage business marketing more than 50 beverage brands throughout North America.

28 Jul 2017 --- Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. has reported second quarter 2017 EPS of US$1.02, which included a US$0.18 per diluted share loss on early extinguishment of debt, compared to US$1.39 in the prior year period. For the quarter, sales volumes increased 4 percent, including the Bai acquisition. Reported net sales increased 6 percent, including the Bai acquisition, which accounted for just over 1 percentage point of net sales growth.  

Total Bai brand sales growth contributed just over 2 percentage points of net sales growth. Organic net sales growth was driven by an increase in organic sales volumes and favorable product and package mix, which were partially offset by the termination of the Rockstar distribution agreement.  DPS President and CEO Larry Young said: “I'm proud of our teams for delivering strong top-line results for the quarter. We remain committed to our priority brand strategy, as demonstrated by our increased marketing investment. We also invested further in activities to deliver increased trial of Bai and are encouraged by the results so far. Our CSD portfolio once again outperformed the category, growing both dollar and volume share in measured markets. Our allied brands continue to contribute strong growth to our business, and we're driving growth and productivity with Rapid Continuous Improvement.” In CSDs, Dr Pepper increased 2 percent, driven by growth in both regular and diet. Canada Dry grew by 6 percent, and Schweppes grew by 4 percent, both on continued growth in the ginger ale and sparkling water categories. Peñafiel increased 8 percent and Squirt grew 7 percent. 7UP increased 5 percent, growing in both the US and the Caribbean. A&W was flat, and other CSDs declined 1 percent. Fountain foodservice volume was flat in the quarter, as 2 percent growth in Dr Pepper was offset by an account specific limited-time offering a year ago. Beverage Concentrates Net sales for Beverage Concentrates increased 4 percent in the quarter on a 2 percent increase in concentrate shipments and concentrate price increases taken earlier in the year. Lower discounts further increased net sales as the result of favorable trade accrual adjustments in the quarter that were partially offset by unfavorable product mix. SOP increased 3 percent driven by net sales growth, which was partially offset by increases in marketing investments due to marketing accrual adjustments. Packaged Beverages Net sales for Packaged Beverages increased 6 percent in the quarter on favorable product and package mix, mostly due to growth in NCBs, including continued growth in the company's allied brands, a 4 percent increase in organic sales volume and growth from the Bai acquisition, net of the loss of Rockstar. SOP decreased 6 percent as results of the acquired Bai business, excluding the distribution profits within the company’s distribution system, were a loss of US$10 million, including US$20 million of marketing investments, US$2 million of amortization of intangibles and US$1 million of transaction expenses.  Latin America Beverages Net sales of Latin American Beverages increased 11 percent in the quarter on a 6 percent increase in sales volumes and higher pricing, which was partially offset by unfavorable product and package mix. SOP was flat in the quarter, as sales growth was entirely offset by higher commodity costs, unfavorable foreign currency transaction effects, inflationary increases in certain operating expenses and increased planned marketing investments. In the quarter, the segment incurred US$4 million of higher US dollar denominated input costs, which caused a 17 percent decline in SOP.

Dr Pepper / Seven Up, Inc GSM 5200: MARKETING MANAGEMENT

 Nowadays, marketplace is fundamentally different as a result of major societal forces thathave resulted in many new consumer and organization capabilities. These forces have created newopportunities and challenges and marketing management has changed significantly in recent years asorganization seeks new ways to achieve marketing excellence. Furthermore, to maintain the product’s reputation in the market, organization focuses on branding the product internally andexternally through market targeting and product positioning in order to increase organization salesvolume and gaining trust from their respective consumers on their products.

2.0CASE SUMMARY

The case is about three companies with 90% of the market share control the carbonated softdrink industry in the United States. These companies include in order of market share size, Coca-Cola, Pepsi Co, and Dr. Pepper/7Up. These three companies also represent the top ten selling brandsin the United States market. In the United States, people consume more carbonated drinks than tapwater. Research has shown that the average American drinks about 53 gallons of soft drinks per year.However, soft drink consumption has declined over the past few years (Kerin & Peterson, 2004). Thesoft drink industry has three major participants in the production and distribution; concentrate producers, bottlers, and retail outlets. Concentrate producers are responsible for consumer advertising and promotion programs, product development and planning and market research. The bottler’s responsibility is to set up local and retail trade promotions. Among this is selling andservicing retail outlets, placements and maintenance of advertisements, and the restocking of retailer’s shelves and vending machines. Competition in the soft drink industry is mostly relevantamong the top three companies; Coca-cola, Pepsi-Cola, and Dr. Pepper/Seven Up. Each of thesecompanies offers a product similar to Squirt, but each has their own variation.2

3.0PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION3.1Primary

The market targeting and product positioning require lots of attention for advertising and promotion plan development, thus, do:a.) Squirt really has to reinforce their marketing strategy to be able to sustain their existingreputation of the product and gaining profit? or  b.) Following the strategy planning recommended by Food, Cone & Belding to produce acompetitive soft carbonated drink in the market with comparison towards Coca-Cola brand and Pepsi-Cola brand? or c.) Completely develop another market targeting and positioning strategy which may or maynot include the elements of the currents and recommended strategy that able to secure areputable and profitable Squirt brand in near future?

3.2Secondary

The owner of Squirt company plan to spend their budget wisely, thus, the amount of budgetshould be allocated correspond toa.) Running bilingual media advertising and bottler promotion campaign for U.S Hispanicnationalities? or  b.) Food, Cone & Belding estimation of Hispanic Squirt consumption on a Spanish-only program for selected markets? or c.) Taking risky moves by expending their Squirt soft carbonated drink market across other countries, however with a limited budget spend on it?

4.0CASE ANALYSIS4.1Target Market and Positioning

Food, Cone, & Belding recommended, and brand management agreed, that Squirt’s uniquethirst-quenching attribute should be dominant positioning dimension upon which to build the brand.Squirt was targeted at adults, 18-44 years old. Squirt is currently positioned as a, "spunky, lively,everyday, on the go, sociable, colourful, and music driven" beverage. The current tag line is, "Squirtyour thirst." The position has been revisited in 1999 and 2000, however no changes were made.Food, Cone & Belding made a full review of positioning strategy and made a few recommendationsin mid 2001. They concluded that Squirt was more thirst quenching than refreshing, and that, it was3

                                Report abuseTranscript of Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Inc.Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. & The Squirt Brand The brand manager of Dr. Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. (DPSU) responsible for the 'Squirt' brand, needs to draft the company's new advertising and promotion plan. Before proceeding, she needs to first redevelop the company's positioning and identify what target markets to pursue. She considered these 3 factors to be the most important in developing the advertising & promotion plan: Competitor activity by Coca-Cola & Pepsi-Cola Implications of a growing Hispanic community Squirt's decreased sales volume Dr. Pepper/Seven Up is the largest division of Cadbury Schweppes PLC.World’s third largest soft drink company. Squirt is DPSU's ninth largest brand after Dr. Pepper, Seven Up, Canada Dry, A&W and othersSquirt is the best selling brand in the grapefruit carbonated soda category.It also competes in the citrus carbonated soft drink category with Mountain Dew and Coca-Cola citrus brands Overview of DPSU Key Industry Facts The whole carbonated soft drink industry (CSD) sales figure in 2000 was $60.3 billion, however, in recent years sales growth has slowed.The production and distribution of CSD's is simplified as follows: The concentrate producer, such as Squirt, manufacture the basic flavor (in this case grapefruit) The bottler adds a sweetener (sugar or artificial sugar) to carbonated water and package the mixture in bottles and cans The bottlers are responsible for distributing the units to retailers and are also responsible for some local marketing activities The major retail channels for CSD's are supermarkets, convenience stores, vending machines, fountain services, mass merchandisers and small retail outlets. Restaurants buy a syrup and they add to it carbonated water, so they do the 'bottling' process.Flavored soft drinks have grown in popularity Introduction to Dr.Pepper/Seven Up, Inc. & Squirt Situational Analysis LA alone accounted for 30% of case sales volume CA accounted for 38% of case sales volumes NY is the largest market without a Squirt bottler 75% of Hispanics live in Western and Southern US 32.8% 43.5% 55.3% of Mexicans 31.7% of Mexicans 11 million Hispanics in CA 6.7 million Hispanics in TX San Antonio El Paso San Diego Squirt's Current Marketing Tactics Squirt's Positioning Squirt's Product Line Squirt's Distribution Squirt's Advertising & Promotion Our Recommendation Coca-Cola launched Fresca and Citra. Fresca is targeted at adults while Citra at the young generation. Squirt outsells both brands combinedHowever, Coca-Cola's advertising & promotion budget is a future indicator of worry because it is higher than Pepsi Cola's; $18.6 million and $16 million respectively.Pepsi' Mountain Dew should be given the most attention: it is the leading brand in the citrus CSD category and its growth rate surpasses all competitors by far.Mountain Dew is the 4th top soft drink brand in the US Strengths Weaknesses Opportunities Threats SWOT Analysis •Squirt is the bestselling carbonated grapefruit soft drink brand in the US•DPSU has a 14.7% market share of $60.3 billion  = $8.86 billion•Squirt available in 83% of bottler markets•FCB  research showed that Squirt was the most thirst quenching brand •Flavored soft drinks growing in popularity•Hispanic communities, who favor non-cola flavors are fastest growing population segment•Squirt is the 8th largest carbonated soft drink brand in Mexico and 58.5% of Hispanics in the US are Mexican •Soft drink consumption in general has slowed•Coca-Cola taking advantage of changing soft drink trends: Tab & Manzana Mía•Pepsi’s Mountain Dew controls about 82% of the citrus flavored CSD market and spends $50 million in advertising •Media advertising for Squirt less than competitors•Consumer research showed that consumers considered Squirt advertising to be too juvenile •Perceptual map of citrus flavored CSD's showed Squirt neither young nor not-so-young•73% of consumers of Squirt are Caucasian Five Forces Analysis Buyer Bargaining Power - High Consumers control the bargaining power when it comes to the soft drink industry because soft drinks are not a necessity for every day life. However, they don’t purchase large quantities and they favor such drinks to be placed in locations that are convenient to them. This means that Squirt can be priced at a higher premium due to it being placed in convenient locations. Supplier Bargaining Power - Low Soft drink manufacturers has an advantage over its suppliers because they only have to produce the flavored syrup, the rest of the processes are delegated to distributors. As a result, Squirt can more easily switch from one supplier to another. Competitive Rivalry - High Squirt faces a number of competitors that includes Coca-Cola’s grapefruit soft drink brands which are Fresca and Citra. It also competes with Mello Yello, Surge, Pepsi Cola’s Mountain Dew, and Sundrop. These competitors are trying to obtain Squirts market share by focusing more on their advertising. Threat of Substitutes - High Coca-Cola introduced its international brand, Fanta, with with different flavors to Southern California. Other flavors are a dangerous substituteSquirt is free of caffeine, consumers might substitute non-caffeinated beverages with caffeinated ones (such as Mountain Dew) Threat of New Entrants - Low  The market in which Squirt is in is 90% controlled by Dr. Pepper/Seven Up inc, Pepsi-Cola Company, and The Coca-Cola Company. These companies also manage the top 10 soft drink brands in the US. This indicates that trying to gain a large market share is not feasible but trying to enter the market is not impossible as well. History In 1938, the Squirt beverage was created by Herb Bishop from Arizona who recreated a non carbonated drink called Citrus Club. He used less sugar and fruit to create the carbonated version of it 1975 The international expansion of Squirt was in the 1970's and it happened that the first international markets were Central & South America (a foreshadowing perhaps) Squirt joined A&W which was eventually bought over by Cadbury Schweppes 1986 1995 1938 After Cadbury Schweppes bought DPSU, it assigned to it the responsibility of the Squirt brand in 1995 in the United States Even though Mountain Dew poses a threat with its enormous control of the citrus flavored CSD (carbonated soft drink) market share, the perceptual map plots Mountain Dew only hallway through the thirst-quenching & refreshing paradigm. This means that if Squirt positions itself as young and hip, it has an upper hand in not only reaching Mountain Dew’s position, but reaching its position armed with the additional attribute of being thirst-quenching. How Squirt can overcome these threats using its strengths How Squirt can overcome its weaknesses to capitalize on opportunities Squirt’s weakness of failing to appeal to the young can be countered by a new double barreled campaign that is aimed at young Hispanics. Hispanics have a median age of 25 and 35% of them are below the age of 18. So by targeting the Hispanic market, Squirt automatically has to simultaneously modify and redevelop its brand image to also appeal to the younger market segment. The effects of this targeting might even cause a spillover on the non-Hispanic youth market. 1996: 55.8 million cases out of a total of 768.41997: 55.7 million cases out of a total of 900.81998: 54.8 million cases out of a total of 964.41999: 56 million cases out of a total of 989.12000: 54.6 million cases out of a total of 981.8 Hispanic population size grew by 57.9% from 1990 to 2000 (35 million)58.5% of Hispanics in the US are MexicanHispanics represent 12.5% of total US population75% of Hispanics live in the western and southern United StatesMore than 50% of Hispanics live in California and TexasFrom the top 9 Hispanic cities, 7 cities are in the west and south Squirt has the regular 'Squirt' grapefruit flavored soft drink and a diet version of thatSquirt also introduced a berry flavored extension called Ruby Red in both regular and diet versions There are 500 bottlers in the US, 250 of them bottle and sell Squirt beveragesThese bottlers have access to 83% of the US bottler market that represents 85% of the total soft drink volume, which is $1.2 billionThe Los Angeles bottler market alone represented 30% of Squirt SalesThere are 100 Squirt in the western US and accounted for half of Squirt's SalesCalifornia alone represented 38% of Squirt sales Squirt's media advertising include inserts in newspapers, spot & cable television and radioPromotions are used with retail channels, consumers, trade channels and cooperative ads with bottlersHighest brand awareness in the grapefruit category due to advertisingSquirt spends more on promotions than on media advertisingTotal advertising and promotion expenditure was 25% of sales, which is $390,000 Initially, Squirt was positioned as a 'cool, experiential, and incredibly exciting'. This was considered too intense and was toned downThe current positioning became related to 'everyday, on the go experiences' that put emphasis individualistic and sociable young adults. Target market narrowed down to 18-34 year oldsThe original thirst quenching attribute was not changed in the new positioning schemeResearch, however, showed that Squirt's messages were too 'juvenile' for both young and older consumers Their sales volume grew from 605 million in 1996 to 809 cases in 2000 Mountain Dew also spent $28.9 million in 1996 Adopt FCB's Recommendation A Mix of East & West Maintain the Current Strategy What Can Squirt Do? According to Foote, Cone & Belding (FCB) the 18-24 age group is the heaviest consumer of soft drinksThe thirst quenching attribute is to be reemphasized, but advertising would focus solely on 21-24 year olds to position the brand as an individualistic, exciting and spontaneousFCB believes that such positioning is relevant to the CSD industry, emphasizes instant gratification, freedom that young adults like and it matches Squirt's product feelThe positive side of their recommendation is that currently, the 20-29 age group is the least segment that consumes SquirtTheir emphasis on a multicultural young segment is of great significance The 'Mexican Connection' Mexico is the 2nd largest CSD market in the world, and Squirt is 8th largest CSD brand in MexicoThe grapefruit CSD category is the second largest in Mexico, after the cola category, and within that category Squirt comes secondMore than half of America's Hispanics are Mexican and 77% of California's Hispanics are Mexican which also happens to be Squirt's largest marketFCB's recommendation, as a result, is aligned with geographic opportunities and conditions 77% of Hispanics are Mexican FCB's recommendation is very relevant to market, demographic and cultural conditionsIt capitalizes on the key and opportunistic growth of the Hispanic community as well as the association that exists between the younger generation and the consumption of soft drinksOne major aspect that FCB did not take into account was the eastern United States; even though 75% of Hispanics live in the west & south, New York is the most populous Hispanic city in the US with 2.1 million Hispanics. Chicago (in the Midwest) is the 3rd most populous Hispanic city with 753,000 Hispanics Squirt has the least access to the New York market and New York has the largest Hispanic population. This is a gold mine for Squirt Most of Squirt's consumers are Caucasian, so why should they risk losing this large customer base by modifying their ad and promotion campaign to suit Hispanic and African American tastes?  Squirt is doing better than Coca-Cola's Citra; consumers think that it does not appeal to them and that Squirt effectively communicated to them the intended thirst quenching messageSales only went down from 55.8 million cases to 54.6 million cases, which is not a large decrease compared to Coca-Cola's sales decrease Changing the current marketing strategy might risk Squirt's advantage over Citra and in terms of sales and brand awareness, Squirt has good footing in the citrus and grapefruit category "Squirt should target the multicultural 18-24 age group in western, southern and eastern United States" Squirt should now spend more on media advertising than on promotions because in order to effectively target the Hispanic community, a message must be clearly communicated55% of Hispanics prefer ads in Spanish which means that Squirt should create Spanish language ads, but at the same time, create English language ads that appeal to Hispanic culture because 30% of them prefer English adsThe nature of brands should reflect Hispanic people's preference for authenticity and clarity in messages and adsHispanics like shopping close to home, Squirt can easily capitalize because of the extensive distribution network it has in the west (100 bottlers in CA)This also means that contracts need to be made with bottlers in the New York area in order to satisfy their preference for proximityIn addition to creating a campaign to satisfy Hispanic preferences, the 18-24 age group must also be effectively targetedSquirt must now position itself not only as a thirst quenching brand (which young people like), but also as young, hip and individualistic This dual targeting and positioning scheme will definitely require a higher advertising budget, but the truth is, Squirt's sales volume does not reflect the potential that both the Hispanic and 18-24 segments have Thank YouFull transcriptMore presentations by
