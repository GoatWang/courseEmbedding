Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan
of Operation:
 
Sino-American was organized on February 9, 2009, as a blank check
or shell company under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company does not currently engage in any business activities that
provide cash flow. From inception, the primary activity of the Company has been directed towards organizational efforts, compliance
matters and locating potential merger or acquisition candidates.
 

 
 

The Company has registered its Common Stock on a Form 10 registration
statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission periodic reports under Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, including quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K.
 
The Company was formed to engage in a merger with or acquisition
of an unidentified private company, which desires to become a reporting (public) company whose securities are qualified for trading
in the United States secondary market. The Company meets the definition of a blank check company contained in Section 7(b)(3) of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
 
The Company believes that there are perceived benefits to being
a reporting company with a class of publicly-traded securities which may be attractive to foreign and domestic private companies.
 
These benefits are commonly thought to include:
 
1. the ability to use registered shares to make acquisition of
assets or businesses;
  
2. increased visibility in the financial community;
 
3. the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions;
 
4. improved trading efficiency;
 
5. shareholder liquidity;
 
6. greater ease in subsequently raising capital;
 
7. compensation of key employees through options for stock for
which there is a public market;
 
8. enhanced corporate image; and,
 
9. a presence in the United States capital market.
 
A private company, which may be interested in a business combination
with the Company, may include the following:
 
1. a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is
the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses;
 
2. a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities
or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it;

 
 

 
3. a company which wishes to become public with less dilution
of its Common Stock than would occur normally upon an underwriting;
 
4. a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment
capital on more favorable terms after it has become public;
 
5. a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the
United States securities market;
 
6. a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public
market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified Employee Stock Option Plan; and,
 
7. a company seeking one or more of the other benefits believed
to attach to a public company.
 
The Company is authorized to enter into a definitive agreement
with a wide variety of private businesses without limitation as to their industry or revenues. It is not possible at this time
to predict with which private company, if any, the Company will enter into a definitive agreement or what will be the industry,
operating history, revenues, future prospects or other characteristics of that company.
 
As of the date hereof, management of the Company has not made
any final decision for a business combination with any private corporations, partnerships or sole proprietorships. When any such
agreement is reached or other material fact occurs, the Company will file notice of such agreement or fact with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K. Persons reading this Financial Statement are advised to see if the Company has subsequently
filed a Form 8-K.
 
There is presently no trading market for the Company's common
stock and no market may ever exist for the Company's common stock. The Company plans to apply for a corporate CUSIP # for its common
stock and to assist broker-dealers in complying with Rule 15c2-11 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that such
brokers can quote the price of the Company's common stock in the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (the "OTC Bulletin Board"
or “OTCBB”) after the Company is no longer classified as a "blank check" or shell company, as defined by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance to investors that any broker-dealer will actually file the
materials required in order for such OTC Bulletin Board trading to proceed.
 
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a rule
(Rule 419) which defines a blank-check company as (i) a development stage company, that is (ii) offering penny stock, as defined
by Rule 3a51-1, and (iii) that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is engage in a
merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies.
 
BUSINESS COMBINATION
 

 
 

The Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business
entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. The combination will normally take the form of a merger, stock-for-stock
exchange or stock-for-assets exchange (the "business combination"). In most instances the target company will wish to
structure the business combination to be within the definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in locating or negotiating
with any target business.
 
The Company has not restricted its search for any specific kind
of businesses, and it may acquire a business, which is in its preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation,
or in essentially any stage of its business life. It is impossible to predict the status of any business in which the Company may
become engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital, may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may
seek other perceived advantages which the Company may offer.
 
In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition,
the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation
or entity.
 
It is anticipated that any securities issued in any such business
combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In
some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its transaction, the Company may agree to register all or a part of such
securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will
be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated
a business combination. The issuance of additional securities and their potential sale into any trading market which may develop
in the Company's securities may depress the market value of the Company's securities in the future if such a market develops, of
which there is no assurance.
 
The Company will participate in a business combination only after
the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Negotiations with a target company will likely focus on the percentage
of the combined Company's shares, which the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings.
 
Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally
such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default,
will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and
will include miscellaneous other terms. Any merger or acquisition effected by the Company can be expected to have a significant
dilution effect on the percentage of shares held by the Company's shareholders at such time.
 
OPERATIONAL RESULTS
 

 
 

The Company has no current operating history and does not have
any revenues or earnings from operations. The Company has no assets or financial resources. We will, in all likelihood, sustain
operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in
the Company incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until the Company can consummate a business combination
with a profitable business opportunity. There is no assurance that we can identify such a business opportunity and consummate such
a business combination.
 
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
On December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash and no other assets.
We are dependent upon our officers to meet any minimum costs that may occur. Mr. Zhong Fang, President of the Company, has agreed
to provide the necessary funds, without interest, for the Company to comply with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;
provided that he is President of the Company when the obligation is incurred. All advances are interest-free.

                      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                                  DECEMBER 31, 2015
 
1. ORGANIZATIONS AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Sino-American Net Media Corp (the "Company") was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 9, 2009 and has been inactive since inception. The Company intends to serve
as a vehicle to effect an asset acquisition, merger, exchange of capital stock or other business combination with a domestic or
foreign business.
 
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Accounting
 
The accompanying audited financial statements and related
notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”) for annual financial information, and with the rules and regulations of SEC to Form 10-K and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X.
 
The Company selected its year-end on December 31.
 
Development Stage Company
 
The Company is a development stage company as defined by section
915-10-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  The Company has recognized no revenue since inception, and is still
devoting substantially all of its efforts on establishing the business and its planned principal operations have not commenced.
All losses accumulated since inception, have been considered as part of the Company’s development stage activities.
 
Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements

 
 

and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
 
Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
 
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph
820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair
value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs
to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority
to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:
 

Level 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
as of the reporting date.

 

Level 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1,
which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.

 

Level 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by
market data.

 
The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for financial
assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2015, nor gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations
that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting
date for the period from February 9, 2009 (inception) through December 31, 2015.
 

 
 

Revenue Recognition
 
The Company will apply paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and
earned.  The Company will consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i)
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv)collectability is reasonably assured.  
 
Income Taxes
 
The Company will account for income taxes under Section 740-10-30
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that
will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the
extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are
expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.
 
The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification (“Section 740-10-25”). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits
claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements.  Under Section 740-10-25,
the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  The tax benefits
recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater
than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance
on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased
disclosures.  The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to
the provisions of Section 740-10-25.
 
Net Loss Per Common Share
 
Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to
section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by
the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common
stock during each period.  There were no potentially 

 
 

dilutive shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015.
 
 
3. GOING CONCERN
 
The accompanying financial statements are presented on a going
concern basis. The Company had minimal operations during the period from February 9, 2010(date of inception) to December 31, 2015
and has not established any source of revenue to cover its operating costs. The Company will engage in very limited activities
without incurring any liabilities that must be satisfied in cash until a source of funding is secured. The Company will offer no
cash consideration and seek equity lines as a means of financing its operations. If the Company is unable to obtain revenue producing
contracts or financing or if the revenue or financing it does obtain is insufficient to cover any operating losses it may incur,
it may substantially curtail or terminate its operations or seek other business opportunities through strategic alliances, acquisitions
or other arrangements that may dilute the interests of existing stockholders.
 
4. WARRANTS AND OPTIONS
 
There are no warrants or options outstanding to acquire any additional
shares of common stocks.
 
5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
 
None
 
6. INCOME TAXES
                                              As
of December 31, 2015
Deferred tax assets:
     Net operating
losses carry forwards           $ 3,134
     Other                                           
0
 
     Valuation allowance
                            3,134
     Net deferred
tax assets                     
$    0
 
Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient
future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to
reduce taxable income. As the achievement of required future taxable income is uncertain, the Company recorded a valuation allowance.

 
 

 
7. NET OPERATING LOSSES
 
As of December 31, 2015, the Company has a net operating loss
carryforward of $ 3,134 including $0 generated in this year. Net operating loss carryforward expires twenty years from the date
the loss was incurred.
 
8. STOCK TRANSACTIONS
 
Upon formation, the Board of Directors issued 31,340,000 shares
of common stock for $3,134 in services to the founding shareholder of the Company to fund organizational start-up costs.
 
On August 13, 2010, Zhong Fang purchased 99 % of the Company's
shares of common stock from the founder in a private sale at the price of $59,990.
 
The aggregate number of shares issued and outstanding has been
unchanged since the company’s inception.
 
9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY
 
The stockholders' equity section of the Company contains the following
classes of capital stock as of this date of reporting:
 
Common stock, $ 0.0001 par value: 250,000,000 shares authorized;
31,340,000 shares issued and outstanding.
 
 
Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting
and
Financial Disclosures
 
None
 
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
 
An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange act of
1934, as amended) as of the end of period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There has been no change in
our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

NETBRANDS WOULD LIKE CONSUMERS TO KNOW THE FOLLOWING:



Production time: All production timelines reflect business days. Production time does not include any shipping time; therefore shipping time must also be added to production time in order to get an accurate delivery time frame. You have a choice of turnaround timelines in most cases. Your choice should reflect your "in hands" date, and we will do our utmost to stay within the given time frame. Please note that we are not responsible for late receipt of any order due to any unforeseeable circumstances, for example a lengthier proofing time, an out-of-stock product, printing, weather-related issues or delays on behalf of the shipping company. 

Standard Production time – Our Standard Production time is typically 7 business days. Standard Production time is "estimated" and your order will not be considered late if production has exceeded 7 business days. If for any reason, the order was placed during one of our Chinese Holiday Production breaks, Standard Production can be delayed up to an additional 7 business days. 

Rush Production - Rushing an order's production is the only way we guarantee a production time. If an "in hands" date needs to be met this option should be selected. When you request a digital proof, the production time will only begin upon approval of the sample or proof. Therefore the timeline may be delayed several days past the original estimate.   

RETURN & REFUND POLICY If for some reason you receive merchandise that you believe is defective or the print quality is unacceptable, simply send us a picture of the product. We will have a Claim Representative review the issue and upon verification of the mistake we'll remake the product for you. If you placed a rush order with us and we miss the guaranteed delivery time, simply send the product back to our facilities for a refund. Standard orders have an estimated scheduling period and are not guaranteed to meet deadlines.   

Promotional Free wristbands:   ** 200 Free Wristbands are available with a handling fee applies ($15 for regular half inch wristbands / $20 for one inch wristbands) and will be produced with Standard Production and Regular Shipping only. The Free Wristbands must have identical size and messages (including fonts and artworks) with the original order. Additional colors, options and rush services cost extra. Offer valid while supplies last.

Composite Score:





                        Netbrands Media Corporation has received 1.09 out of 5 stars based on 29 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of F.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Item 7.
Management’s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of
Operation:

 

Sino-American
was organized on February 9, 2009, as a blank check or shell
company under the Laws of the State of Delaware. The Company does
not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash
flow. From inception, the primary activity of the Company has been
directed towards organizational efforts, compliance matters and
locating potential merger or acquisition candidates.

 

The
Company has registered its Common Stock on a Form 10 registration
statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(the Exchange Act) and Rule 12(g) thereof. The Company files with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission periodic reports under
Rule 13(a) of the Exchange Act, including quarterly reports on Form
10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K.

 

The
Company was formed to engage in a merger with or acquisition of an
unidentified private company, which desires to become a reporting
(public) company whose securities are qualified for trading in the
United States secondary market. The Company meets the definition of
a blank check company contained in Section 7(b)(3) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

 

The
Company believes that there are perceived benefits to being a
reporting company with a class of publicly-traded securities which
may be attractive to foreign and domestic private
companies.

 

These
benefits are commonly thought to include:

 

1. the
ability to use registered shares to make acquisition of assets or
businesses;

  

2.
increased visibility in the financial community;

 

3. the
facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions;

 

4.
improved trading efficiency;

 

5.
shareholder liquidity;

 

6. greater
ease in subsequently raising capital;

 

7.
compensation of key employees through options for stock for which
there is a public market;

 

8.
enhanced corporate image; and,

 

9. a
presence in the United States capital market.

 

A private
company, which may be interested in a business combination with the
Company, may include the following:

 

1. a
company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use
of its securities for the acquisition of assets or
businesses;

 

2. a
company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or
is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable
to it;

 

3. a
company which wishes to become public with less dilution of its
Common Stock than would occur normally upon an
underwriting;

 

4. a
company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment
capital on more favorable terms after it has become
public;

 

5. a
foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United
States securities market;

 

6. a
special situation company, such as a company seeking a public
market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified
Employee Stock Option Plan; and,

 

7. a
company seeking one or more of the other benefits believed to
attach to a public company.

 

The
Company is authorized to enter into a definitive agreement with a
wide variety of private businesses without limitation as to their
industry or revenues. It is not possible at this time to predict
with which private company, if any, the Company will enter into a
definitive agreement or what will be the industry, operating
history, revenues, future prospects or other characteristics of
that company.

 

As of the
date hereof, management of the Company has not made any final
decision for a business combination with any private corporations,
partnerships or sole proprietorships. When any such agreement is
reached or other material fact occurs, the Company will file notice
of such agreement or fact with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on Form 8-K. Persons reading this Financial Statement
are advised to see if the Company has subsequently filed a Form
8-K.

 

There is
presently no trading market for the Company's common stock and no
market may ever exist for the Company's common stock. The Company
plans to apply for a corporate CUSIP # for its common stock and to
assist broker-dealers in complying with Rule 15c2-11 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, so that such brokers
can quote the price of the Company's common stock in the
Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (the "OTC Bulletin Board" or
“OTCBB”) after the Company is no longer classified as a
"blank check" or shell company, as defined by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. There can be no assurance to investors
that any broker-dealer will actually file the materials required in
order for such OTC Bulletin Board trading to proceed.

 

The U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a rule (Rule 419)
which defines a blank-check company as (i) a development stage
company, that is (ii) offering penny stock, as defined by Rule
3a51-1, and (iii) that has no specific business plan or purpose or
has indicated that its business plan is engage in a merger or
acquisition with an unidentified company or companies.

 

BUSINESS
COMBINATION

 

The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with the Company. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger,
stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange (the
"business combination"). In most instances the target company will
wish to structure the business combination to be within the
definition of a tax-free reorganization under Section 351 or
Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. No
assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in
locating or negotiating with any target business.

 

The
Company has not restricted its search for any specific kind of
businesses, and it may acquire a business, which is in its
preliminary or development stage, which is already in operation, or
in essentially any stage of its business life. It is impossible to
predict the status of any business in which the Company may become
engaged, in that such business may need to seek additional capital,
may desire to have its shares publicly traded, or may seek other
perceived advantages which the Company may offer.

 

In
implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition, the
Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation,
reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another
corporation or entity.

 

It is
anticipated that any securities issued in any such business
combination would be issued in reliance upon exemption from
registration under applicable federal and state securities laws. In
some circumstances, however, as a negotiated element of its
transaction, the Company may agree to register all or a part of
such securities immediately after the transaction is consummated or
at specified times thereafter. If such registration occurs, it will
be undertaken by the surviving entity after the Company has entered
into an agreement for a business combination or has consummated a
business combination. The issuance of additional securities and
their potential sale into any trading market which may develop in
the Company's securities may depress the market value of the
Company's securities in the future if such a market develops, of
which there is no assurance.

 

The
Company will participate in a business combination only after the
negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Negotiations
with a target company will likely focus on the percentage of the
combined Company's shares, which the target company shareholders
would acquire in exchange for their shareholdings.

 

Although
the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such
agreements will require certain representations and warranties of
the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will
detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be
satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing and will
include miscellaneous other terms. Any merger or acquisition
effected by the Company can be expected to have a significant
dilution effect on the percentage of shares held by the Company's
shareholders at such time.

 

OPERATIONAL
RESULTS

 

The
Company has no current operating history and does not have any
revenues or earnings from operations. The Company has no assets or
financial resources. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating
expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the
consummation of a business combination. This may result in the
Company incurring a net operating loss that will increase
continuously until the Company can consummate a business
combination with a profitable business opportunity. There is no
assurance that we can identify such a business opportunity and
consummate such a business combination.

 


LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

On
December 31, 2014, the Company had no cash and no other assets. We
are dependent upon our officers to meet any minimum costs that may
occur. Mr. Zhong Fang, President of the Company, has agreed to
provide the necessary funds, without interest, for the Company to
comply with the Securities Exchan
