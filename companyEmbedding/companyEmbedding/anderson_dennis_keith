How the BuildZoom Score works








Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Anderson Dennis Keith carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 
Anderson Dennis Keith currently holds license 2101188360 (Builder Individual), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Anderson Dennis Keith



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

								 Dear Captain Dennis Keith Anderson, sirAs an American, I would like to thank you for your service and for your sacrifice made on behalf of our wonderful country. The youth of today could gain much by learning of heroes such as yourself, men and women whose courage and heart can never be questioned.May God allow you to read this, and may He allow me to someday shake your hand when I get to Heaven to personally thank you. May he also allow my father to find you and shake your hand now to say thank you; for America, and for those who love you.With respect, SirCurt Carter

Remembering A High School Classmate
Posted on 5/23/15 - by Roger Reese holymoly@paulbunyan.net
								

								 
								 Memories of Dennis still brings on raw emotions while remembering our school lives in Crookston.   Like everyone back then, we had some great times while participating in activities like football, hockey, glee club and the picnics his mother and dad sponsored at their Maple Lake cabin.   As a 1967/1968 Vietnam Veteran, I will never forget the emotions and pain erupting while discussing Dennis's death with his dad at his insurance business.  Oh, I still "visit" with Dennis's every time I make a trip to Crookston!

Silver Star Citation
Posted on 6/25/14 - by A Grateful Vietnam Vet 
								

								 
								 Silver StarAwarded for actions during the Vietnam WarThe President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress July 9, 1918 (amended by an act of July 25, 1963), takes pride in presenting the Silver Star (Posthumously) to Captain (Infantry) Dennis Keith Anderson (ASN: 0-99540), United States Army, for gallantry in action in the Republic of Vietnam while serving with Company C, 2d Battalion (Airborne), 502d Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division on 31 March 1968. Captain Anderson distinguished himself while on a combat operation in the vicinity of Phu Bai, Republic of Vietnam. Captain Anderson's company was moving through thick jungle to reach a landing zone for a vital re-supply when the lead platoon came under heavy automatic weapons fire from an entrenched enemy force of estimated platoon size. In the initial contact four casualties were sustained by the lead platoon. Captain Anderson, who was moving with the trail platoon, immediately moved to the front of the column and made a rapid appraisal of the situation. Controlling the movement of the Fourth Platoon to the right flank of the enemy positions, Captain Anderson, with complete disregard for his own personal safety, moved through the vicious hail of enemy fire to an exposed position where he effectively directed the armed helicopters towards the enemy positions and then called in the artillery. Once fire superiority was established, Captain Anderson moved with the Fourth Platoon and swept the entire area surrounding the landing zone. He then moved his command post to the landing zone and directed the evacuation of the wounded personnel. Captain Anderson's outstanding display of gallantry in action and his devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit and the United States Army.General Orders: Headquarters, 101st Airborne Division, General Orders (September 13, 1968)Action Date: March 31, 1968Service: ArmyRank: CaptainCompany: Company CBattalion: 2d Battalion (Airborne)Regiment: 502d Infantry RegimentDivision: 101st Airborne Division
