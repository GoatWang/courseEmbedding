John R. Ackerman, Principal Engineer and Geologist, has provided consulting services to public and private clients for over 39 years both on his own and with consulting engineering firms.  On the environmental site, his projects ranged from complete design of municipal and industrial wastewater, including AMD treatment systems, and hazardous waste treatment plants to process design for improved aeration systems, pumping systems, water treatment systems and odor control, both within the plant and within the collection systems. He also has considerable experience managing private and public infrastructure development projects as Director of Operations for CAN DO, Inc. and as City Engineer for the City of Hazleton and large scale site development projects, such as the 1.6 million square foot manufacturing/warehouse complex for the Arm and Hammer Project Independence project in York County, Pennsylvania.
Alfred G.

Twin Oaks Consulting’s philosophy is to look beyond the surface to evaluate all aspects of a proposed project.  By looking for alternative methodologies we can provide the client with the most cost effective alternative in both terms of design and construction costs.  Twin Oaks values the relationship with our clients and always strives to provide you the most cost effective consultant services available.

Twin Oaks’ President John R. Ackerman, PE, PG, BCEE, F.NSPE, M.ASCE of Hazle Township, and Director of Operations Al Handy, PE, of Blairstown, NJ, received their award certificates at a recent event at ASCE’s world headquarters in Reston, Virginia, where Ackerman presented a paper entitled "Water Harvesting from Unconventional, Non-Potable Sources.”
The annual ASCE Innovation Contest is part of the ASCE Grand Challenge, where civil engineers from around the world are taking a pledge to meet the Grand Challenge goal of cutting infrastructure life-cycle costs in half by 2025. ASCE Innovation Contest solutions revolved around four key elements: life-cycle cost analysis, performance-based standards, resilience, and innovation.
“Innovation is interesting because one of the things is it sometimes takes a little bit longer to consider. Innovation doesn’t happen in that fast framework of things you’re familiar with in your routine,” said Kristie Dunkin, a managing director for the Chambers Group in Santa Ana, CA. “It happens in the times when you can sit back and think about something. One of the fundamental approaches is to give people some time to think about things.”
The American Society of Civil Engineers represents more than 150,000 members of the civil engineering profession in 177 countries. Founded in 1852, ASCE is the nation’s oldest engineering society. ASCE stands at the forefront of a profession that plans, designs, constructs, and operates society’s economic and social engine – the built environment – while protecting and restoring the natural environment.
Through the expertise of its active membership, ASCE is a leading provider of technical and professional conferences and continuing education, the world’s largest publisher of civil engineering content, and an authoritative source for codes and standards that protect the public.
The Society advances civil engineering technical specialties through nine dynamic Institutes and leads with its many professional- and public-focused programs.

						Twin Oaks Attends U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum









 

 






John Ackerman, PE, PG, President of Twin Oaks Research Centre, Inc., was invited to attend the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum  - 2015 on September 4th.  The Forum was held at the Ritz-Carleton in Washington, DC.  Over 700 attendees were present.

Irbrahim Al-Assaf, Minister of Finance; H.E. Tawfig Alrabiah, Minister of Commerce and Industry; H.E. Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Health; and H.E.

						"Jeepin' Al" Shows His Heart









 

 






The line of Jeeps that would carry the Veterans on a 2 hour trail ride.
On August 29, 2014, Twin Oaks Principal in Charge of Civil Engineering attended the "Wheelers for the Wounded" event in northern New Jersey.
Volunteers provide the opportunity for local veterans to experience a much deserved day of adventure and relaxation in the outdoors. The day starts with a continental breakfast followed by a JEEP ride through the woods of northern New Jersey. They ended their ride with a hot lunch of pulled pork, BBQ ribs, chicken and all the fixin's.
Wheelers for the Wounded-NJ was formed seven years ago and this year had 167 Veterans/families, drivers and volunteers attend.
Wheelers for the Wounded is a nation-wide event that provides a weekend of off-roading for both wounded and non-wounded military veterans.  This excellent multi-state program was conceived by Jason Havlik, a Gulf War veteran.
