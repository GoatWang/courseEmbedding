THE FUEL OF TRIATHLETES
While racing an Ironman in Mont Tremblant, Quebec, we discovered one of nature’s masterpieces: pure maple water. It’s refreshing, hydrating and naturally nutritious with a subtle hint of maple. Created in a tree and not in a lab, it is proof of our philosophy that “Mother Nature is the best chemist”.

 Kate & Jeff













KATE
Kate Weiler is an Ironman triathlete and passionate advocate for nutrition and holistic wellness. A native of Boston, she holds a Master of Science in Nutrition from Northeastern University and is a Certified Holistic Health Coach from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. When not swimming, bicycling, running or doing asanas on her yoga mat, she can be found making a mess in her test kitchen and documenting her concoctions on Instagram.










JEFF
Jeff Rose is an Ironman triathlete and technical specialist, bringing to DRINKmaple nearly 20 years with logistics and supply management experience working in the construction industry. A native of New Hampshire, he combines his respect for science and technology with the firm conviction that they have no part in creating the food that we eat.





















THE DRINK OF ACTIVE AMERICANS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

 









HISTORY











Maple water just may be the un-trendiest beverage you’ll find on the shelf. Native Americans and North American explorers began tapping maple water hundreds of years ago. The explorers even called it “the wholesomest drink in the world.” We consider those explorers the first in a long line of active, energetic folks who find refreshment, replenishment and hydration in cool, clear maple water.

Our Story | DRINKmaple
























































































 



 



































menu






























THE FUEL OF TRIATHLETES
While racing an Ironman in Mont Tremblant, Quebec, we discovered one of nature’s masterpieces: pure maple water. It’s refreshing, hydrating and naturally nutritious with a subtle hint of maple. Created in a tree and not in a lab, it is proof of our philosophy that “Mother Nature is the best chemist”.

 Kate & Jeff













KATE
Kate Weiler is an Ironman triathlete and passionate advocate for nutrition and holistic wellness. A native of Boston, she holds a Master of Science in Nutrition from Northeastern University and is a Certified Holistic Health Coach from the Institute for Integrative Nutrition. When not swimming, bicycling, running or doing asanas on her yoga mat, she can be found making a mess in her test kitchen and documenting her concoctions on Instagram.










JEFF
Jeff Rose is an Ironman triathlete and technical specialist, bringing to DRINKmaple nearly 20 years with logistics and supply management experience working in the construction industry. A native of New Hampshire, he combines his respect for science and technology with the firm conviction that they have no part in creating the food that we eat.





















THE DRINK OF ACTIVE AMERICANS FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

 









HISTORY











Maple water just may be the un-trendiest beverage you’ll find on the shelf. Native Americans and North American explorers began tapping maple water hundreds of years ago. The explorers even called it “the wholesomest drink in the world.” We consider those explorers the first in a long line of active, energetic folks who find refreshment, replenishment and hydration in cool, clear maple water.

ONE INGREDIENT
46 NUTRIENTS
Maple trees awaken in the spring and the sap begins to run, carrying with it many healthy nutrients – 46 in all.


















































WE THINK THE GREATEST LABORATORY ON EARTH IS A TREE.

Untouched. Unspoiled. Unboiled. Only a tree could manufacture water this pure and this hydrating. Maple water is low calorie, gluten-free, dairy-free and non-GMO. It contains 46 naturally occurring polyphenols, antioxidants, prebiotics, minerals and electrolytes. It also has just half the sugar of coconut water and more manganese than a cup of kale. And oh yes, it is the only water with that little hint of maple flavor.










HEALTHY FOR YOU.
HARMLESS TO THE TREE.

During the long winter, the sap in maple trees collects nutrients from the soil. When spring comes to Vermont and the days grow warm, the sap starts to run, delivering nutrients and vitality to the tree. That’s when we collect the sap straight from maple trees. In the process, no trees are harmed. On the farms where the maples grow, the trees are sustainably tapped to allow for many years of sustainable water supply.
