Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional, contact Nationwide or click links to product information below.

Annuities May Be a Smart Fit for Your Investment Plan

Are you worried about outliving your income? That’s a risk that you may be able to do something about. When you invest in an annuity, you set the stage to receive income in the future, subject to the terms, conditions and or limitations of the insurance contract.
An annuity is a long-term contract you purchase from an insurance company. It is designed to help accumulate assets to provide income for retirement. Annuities do have limitations. If early withdrawals occur penalties may apply and earnings are taxable as ordinary income and may be subject to a 10% federal tax penalty if withdrawn prior to age 59½.
How do annuities work?
An annuity is a long term investment that is issued by an insurance company designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
Nationwide's annuities are flexible so you can choose one that enables you to:

Invest a lump sum or invest over a period of time 
Start receiving payments immediately or at some later date
Select a fixed, variable or indexed rate of return

Investing involves risk and may lose value. All guarantees and protections are subject to the claims paying ability of the issuing company, but the guarantees do not apply to any variable accounts which involve investment risk and possible loss of principal.
What type of annuity could fit into your investment plan?
Whether your needs are immediate or long-term, you can choose the type of annuity whose features work for your situation:

Variable – With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus. Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying investment options contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional or the insurance company.
Immediate – An immediate annuity is usually purchased with a lump-sum and guaranteed income starts almost immediately. Your investment converts into a guaranteed stream of income that is irrevocable once payments begin. In some situations, funds can be accessed, but some restrictions apply.
Fixed – With fixed annuities, the principal investment and earnings are both guaranteed and fixed payments are made for the term of the contract.
Fixed Indexed – This special class of annuities yields returns on contributions based on a specified equity-based index, such as the S&P 500.


A fixed indexed annuity offers returns based on the changes in a securities index, such as the S&P 500® Composite Stock Price Index. Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement that will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization and also provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments.
But, as with most things in life, an annuity does have limitations. If you decide to take your money out early, you may face fees called surrender charges. Plus, if you're not yet age 59½, you may also have to pay an additional 10% tax penalty on top of ordinary income taxes. Naturally, if you do take an early withdrawal, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced. 
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal. 
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company and it’s sold by prospectus. While it may take some time, you should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you.  Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees, and the expense of the underlying investment options.  
Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options. The product prospectus and underlying fund prospectus contain this and other important information. Click on any of the prospectus links to obtain a product prospectus. Underlying fund prospectuses can be obtained from your investment professional or by contacting Nationwide. Read the prospectus carefully before you make a purchase. 
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.

Indexed annuity contracts also offer a specified minimum which the contract value will not fall below, regardless of index performance. After a period of time, the insurance company will make payments to you under the terms of your contract.


A fixed indexed annuity is not a stock market investment and does not directly participate in any stock or equity investment.

Variable Annuities Offer Investment Choices

With a variable annuity, you choose investments and earn returns based on how those investments perform. You can choose investments that offer different levels of risk and potential growth, depending on your investment goals and tolerance for risk.
Watch this video to learn how variable annuities can offer unique benefits for unique characters like you. 










Variable immediate annuity features
With an immediate annuity, you begin receiving income payments immediately. Immediate annuities are usually purchased with a lump-sum payment.

Variable deferred annuity features
Some of the advantages of variable deferred annuities include:

Tax-deferred growth potential in the accumulation phase (Earnings are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn. There may be a 10% federal tax penalty on withdrawals before age 59½. Naturally, your death benefit and the cash value of the annuity contract will be reduced if you take any early withdrawals.)
Death benefits for your beneficiaries
Tax-free/penalty-free transfers among underlying investment options
A variety of payout options, including systematic withdrawals and annuitization (You may face surrender charges if you withdraw your money early.)
 


Read this important information

Keep in mind that investing involves market risk and your investment return, principal value and periodic payments will fluctuate over time. You could end up with more or less than the amount you invested.
An annuity is a long-term, tax-deferred investment designed for retirement. It will fluctuate in value. It allows you to create a fixed or variable stream of income through a process called annuitization. It provides a variable rate of return based on the performance of the underlying investments. An annuity isn’t intended to replace emergency funds or to fund short-term savings goal.
You should also know that an annuity contains guarantees and protections that are subject to the issuing insurance company’s ability to pay for them. But these guarantees don’t apply to any variable accounts that are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of your principal.
An annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company, and it’s sold by prospectus. You should read these documents. They describe risk factors, fees and charges that may apply to you. Variable annuities have fees and charges that include mortality and expense, administrative fees, contract fees and the expense of the underlying investment options.
Neither Nationwide nor our representatives give legal or tax advice. Please consult your attorney or tax advisor for answers to specific questions.
Investment products offered are not FDIC-insured, may lose value, have no bank guarantee.
Annuities issued by Nationwide Life Insurance Company or Nationwide Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Columbus, Ohio. 

Before you invest, please read the prospectus carefully and consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the annuity and its underlying investment options before you invest. Prospectuses for products and underlying funds contain this and other important information. To obtain prospectuses, call your investment professional, contact Nationwide or click links to product information below.

Product Ratings and Reviews 





 Simple Interest and Inflation 
 Rating: 
4
Average: 4 (1 vote)

 
  Both of the reviewers who talk about simple interest have reasonable points.
However, one thing that Nationwide does mention with this rider is the potential to beat inflation.
To support the point of the reviewer who brought-up the whole simple interest issue, inflation works on a compound basis.
Crediting a simple level of interest in an attempt to offset the damaging impact of inflation will result in a mismatch.
Unless the inflation level is very high (many feel that this is a real possibility), the positive impact of the 7 percent simple interest will stay ahead of any damage caused by inflation.
Anyway, the overall point is that inflation compounds while simple interest does not, so using simple interest to guard against inflation may not make sense.

 They are all Simple Interest... 
 Rating: 
5
Average: 5 (1 vote)

 
  Why the rant about simple interest?
These things are all based on simple interest.
Also, the benefit is there to serve as a floor in the event that overall stock and bond market performance is lousy and less than 7 percent.
The guaranteed minimum is not the only option that can increase the income benefit base.
Over the course of 10 years, it is likely that the minimum 7 percent guarantee will come into play less often than a market return adjustment to the contract value.
Who wouldn't want to invest with a floor of guaranteed return in this environment?
The upside is there if things are all rosy in the market, but the protection is also there if things don't turn-out as well as expected.
Simple interest is sure better than no interest.

 Simple Interest 
 Rating: 
4
Average: 4 (1 vote)

 
  The 7 percent minimum guarantee that is referenced by the other reviewer is simple interest - not compound interest.
For someone who invests $100,000 in this variable annuity, the minimum guaranteed increase in the income benefit would be $7,000 per year.  
If this person holds onto the VA and does not take any withdrawals for 10 years, the income base would have a guaranteed minimum of $170,000.
If the benefit were based on compound interest rather than simple interest, that same income base would be $196,715.
A $26,715 difference is pretty meaningful.
Now assume that the actual income withdrawal benefit is 5 percent.  
5 percent of the $170,000 is $8,500 per year.
5 percent of $196,715 is $9,835.

 7 Percent Lifetime Income Rider 
 Rating: 
5
Average: 5 (1 vote)

 
  The living benefit rider that comes with Nationwide's Destination B variable annuity is pretty competitive when compared to similar options from competing companies.
The lifetime income rider is currently at 7 percent.  Pretty interesting return in our current low interest rate world.
For the person who owns the annuity, this means that their income benefit base is guaranteed to increase a minimum of 7 percent per year for the first 10 years that they own the contract.
This would be affected if the owner chooses to start taking withdrawals prior to the end of the first 10 years.
This also means that stock markets could go completey haywire (like they have been over the past couple of years), and the owner would still have the minimum 7 percent increase to their benefit base.
If, on the other hand, markets happen to be great, then the income benefit base will increase will reflect contract value and market increase.

Independent, Objective review of the Nationwide Destination B Annuity with Lifetime Income Rider

Thursday, April 26, 2012 | 6 Comments


I’m back at this week with another annuity review.  This one again was at the request of a blog reader who has yet to purchase but is contemplating the Nationwide Destination B Annuity with Lifetime Income Rider.
One of my business partners was doing some research this week and found a really interesting fact about variable annuities.  In the 4th quarter of 2011 over 90% of variable annuities sold had some type of guaranteed income rider.  Wow, talk about market share!
It comes as no surprise to me now why so many people ask me about various annuities with income guarantees.  Given the portion of population in our country rapidly reaching their retirement years, the stock market being anything but predictable, and interest rates at record lows – it’s know wonder so many companies and advisors are marketing retirement income as their go-to specialty.
In the case of this annuity it is no different.  Someone concerned about the market/economy/interest rates who’s getting close to retirement and wants to protect their nest egg was suggested it would be wise to put almost 70% of their investment assets into the Nationwide Destination B.  The reasoning makes perfect sense and I completely understand the desire to keep a good portion of the nest egg safe (as well as future retirement income), but now it’s time to test the product and see if the actual results are close to the marketed results.
Here’s the quick facts about the Nationwide Destination B Annuity (with Lifetime Income Rider – or L.INC as it’s referred to)

This is a variable annuity which means the money invested gets allocated to multiple funds called “sub-accounts.”  Sub-accounts look much like mutual funds and most are managed by mutual fund companies.  Because these funds can go up or down is why the annuity is Variable instead of Fixed (where it cannot go down).
Like most variable annuities Destination B has multiple “riders” that can be added on to the base annuity.  The two riders most common are for enhanced death benefit and for guaranteed income.  In the case of this annuity the Lifetime Income Guarantee was a primary driver of interest to the potential investor.  *note – I didn’t recommend this – I’m just the guy doing the review*
The Lifetime Income Rider (L.INC) grows an “income base” by 10% simple interest per year for up to 10 years or until the account owner turns 81 years old – whichever happens sooner.  So if you started with $100,000 after 10 years there would be an income base worth $200,000.  It’s important to note that you can never actually take the entire income base at once.  Rather you can take an income from that amount based on your age when you begin income and whether or not it is on one life or two lives.  That table is below:

L.INC rider by Nationwide
To translate this rider into plain english – if you start by investing $100,000 at age 60 and let the money grow for 10 years, at age 70 you’ll be able to to take 4.75% of $200,000 – or $9,500 per year.  That is the worst case scenario, you could do better (though I highly doubt it – see the video below to learn why).
If you have a spouse younger than you though it would be very un-wise (if there’s such a word) to opt for single life guarantees.  I say this because the cost of this annuity is very high and there is a high probability there wouldn’t be much left when you pass – maybe even nothing at all.
With that being the case for guaranteed joint life income you’d be looking at 4.25% if you and your spouse are the same age.
A word of Caution Regarding L.INC
In the fine print it says that the Lifetime Income (L.INC) guaranteed lifetime payout percentage is based on the younger of the two people on the account.  So if your spouse is, say 51 when issued and only 61 when you decide to take income, then the guaranteed lifetime income would only be 3.25%.  This is significant as it would drop the $9,500 from my example above to just $6,250 with spousal continuation.
Fees of the Nationwide Destination B Annuity
Like many other variable annuities the costs of Destination B can be quite high.  Here’s a rundown directly from their prospectus of the potential fees:
 
Nationwide Destination B Expenses
That’s a lot of potential expenses!
For simplicity sake I reviewed this annuity as it was explained to me from the blog reader who asked for the review.  In their case they would have the base charges (mortality and expense as well as administrative), the Lifetime Income 10% option, and the average of sub accounts.  The average of sub accounts (funds) is 1.12% – though some funds cost as much as 1.85%.
All told this annuity is easily in the 3.5% and higher camp with the potential of being over 5% PER YEAR.  That is not cheap and greatly impacts performance.
You can read about these fees and their meanings either in the Prospectus or on the Nationwide Website Here.
Destination B with Lifetime Income Rider Video Review
To help illustrate the real return potential of the annuity I broke it down via video.  I do this for all my reviews as it is helpful for blog readers to see how I arrive at my return conclusions and be as transparent about it as possible.  You can watch that video below:

 
In the video you’ll see me struggling a bit to find a website that helps people see what their life expectancy is.  As promised, here’s a link to that site so you can see where I was going with that:
Vanguard Life Expectancy Calculator
Nationwide Destination B Variable Annuity (with Lifetime Income Rider) Conclusions
Overall I’m finding most variable annuities with income guarantees to be awfully similar.  They all sound great, but fail to deliver at the rates commonly referred to in their advertising.
In the case of Destination B the guarantee is not even close to the 10% or 4.75% return promises.  On most life expectancies it delivers closer to 3%.  In order to make a middle single digit return you’d need to live about 15 years beyond your life expectancy – which is only 12% probable.
As a pure long term growth investment the annuity struggles a bit too due to the impact of expenses.  In the video you see that pretty clearly as the 50 year return of the S&P 500 (with dividends) is about 7.5% and the expenses of this annuity are nearly 1/2 of that.  The 50 year average for bonds is about 6% so the expenses take an even bigger portion of assets allocated to income funds.
All told this annuity is neither much better or much worse than other variable annuities I’ve reviewed.  Just meh as they say on the web.
So if you’re looking for guaranteed income for life there are certainly better paying alternatives and if you’re looking for long term growth the same is true.
What if the Market Crashes?  Wouldn’t this be a Good Alternative?
This is a common response I get from investors and professionals when I break down annuities.  The answer is “yes!”  Having some type of guarantee is better than none at all.  But there are better guarantees out there and there are also plenty of strategies for the “non-guaranteed money” investors might have too.  It just takes a lot of research to find them.  If you have questions in this regard I’ve got good news for you – I do this type of research all the time and am always happy to share the best in both the guaranteed and non-guaranteed worlds.  Just use the contact form on the site and I’ll do my best to help you out.
Why am I spending so much time on annuity reviews?
Many blog readers and clients have asked me this lately – so I figured I’d just put it here on the blog in case you were wondering the same.  As a fiduciary who is looking out for my clients best interests it’s my resonsibility to make sure I’m constantly vetting out all potential investments to ensure we’re using the best ones.  Often times I’m asked to take a look at annuities because their advertisements make them sound too good to be true.
Sales agents eager for commission often don’t do the type of analysis I do – perhaps because of their conflict of interest.  After all, making 5% to 10% commission on an annuity can add up pretty fast if you’re selling them hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time.
So I try to be the voice of reason that looks under the hood, reads and understands the 100+ page prospectuses, and makes sure my clients only invest in what’s truly best for them.  In an effort to help non-clients I started putting this same information on my blog and so far it’s been a huge hit.  I get hundreds of emails and many words of thanks from good people all over the US just trying to do their best and letting me know this research is helping them greatly.
Everybody wins.
I hope you enjoyed this review.  As always, if you have questions, see items that need clarification, or if you’re an investment professional and you noticed something I overlooked – just let me know.
Best,
Jason Wenk

Jason, great review.  What are the drawbacks if you want to surrender this annuity before the 10 year simple interest roll-up?

Hi Ken,

You’ll want to look at your contract for the exact terms, but generally you’ll pay a surrender penalty between 2% and 7% depending on how many years you’ve had the product.  The longer you’ve had it the lower the penalty.  You may also have to pay back the “bonus” if your contract had one.

Thanks for writing!

I think you forget one thing, that is after you and your spouse pass away, your children can take remainings, that is also accountable. Is that right ?

That’s possible, but not very likely unless the annuity older dies well before their normal life expectancy. In a nutshell, the distributions and fees would likely be more than the earnings so once income is triggered the value would drop pretty quickly. This is why for many people there won’t be anything left for children after both spouses pass away.
Thanks for dropping by and adding your comment/question.
– Jason
