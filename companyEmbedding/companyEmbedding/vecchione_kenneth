PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE: WAL), one of the country’s 
      top-performing banking companies, today announced that effective July 
      10, 2017, Kenneth Vecchione will return to the Company as President. 
      Kenneth Vecchione will join Robert Sarver, Chairman and CEO, along with 
      Dale Gibbons, CFO, and Jim Haught, COO, in the executive suite at 
      Western Alliance.
    


      “This is an exciting time in the growth of our company,” said Sarver. 
      “Having worked with Ken as a member of our Board of Directors for the 
      last 10 years, and as the Company’s President from 2010 to 2013, I am 
      confident that Ken will be a key addition to our team. He is experienced 
      and capable of eventually transitioning into the role of CEO.”
    

      “I am truly looking forward to rejoining the management team at Western 
      Alliance,” said Vecchione. “During the last 10 years, I have developed 
      many relationships in the Company and have a great deal of respect for 
      the management team. Robert and I have a good working relationship and I 
      am excited about the future for Western Alliance.”
    

      “In discussions with our Board about succession planning, we all agreed 
      bringing Ken back was the right move, and, that my eventual transition 
      from CEO would be to the role of Executive Chairman, where I would 
      continue to generate new business opportunities and provide leadership 
      and strategic direction,” added Sarver.
    

      Vecchione was the Company’s President and Chief Operating Officer from 
      2010 to 2013, when he left to become CEO at Encore Capital Group. Prior 
      to 2010, Vecchione served as Chief Financial Officer of Apollo Global 
      Management, LLC, one of the country’s largest private equity firms, and 
      prior to Apollo he was Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer of MBNA 
      Corporation. Vecchione has been a Director of Western Alliance since 
      2007.

Financial Services Veteran Ken Vecchione to Become President and CEO of Encore Capital Group

		  - Planned Transition to Take Place as Encore Drives Next Phase of Industry Maturity -

SAN DIEGO, April 8, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Encore Capital Group (Nasdaq:   ECPG) today announced that its board of directors has elected Ken Vecchione, 58, to succeed Brandon Black as chief executive officer.  To effect the transition, Vecchione will serve as president while Black will continue serving as chief executive officer up through May 31, 2013, after which Black will remain available to the board and management on a consulting basis.
"Encore is very well positioned and on a clear upward trajectory to continue delivering strong results for shareholders," said George Lund, executive chairman of Encore's board of directors.  "Ken Vecchione is a leader with more than 35 years of experience and relationships in senior management roles at large, publicly traded banking and credit card companies. With Ken's deep and diverse background in operations, corporate strategy, risk management and regulatory affairs, we found the ideal chief executive officer to drive Encore's future success."
"I'm thrilled to be joining Encore at a time when the company is clearly leading the industry into its next phase of maturity," said Vecchione.  "Thanks to the depth and strength of the current management team and outstanding employees around the world, the company is performing better than it ever has.  Encore is well positioned to continue delivering shareholder value, given its efficient operating platform, low-cost capital and emphasis on analytics in understanding financially distressed consumer behavior." 
Vecchione has held a number of senior positions at large financial services companies, including chief operating officer of Western Alliance Bancorporation, chief financial officer of Apollo Global Management, LLC and chief financial officer of AT&T Universal Card Services.  Perhaps most notably, Vecchione served for three years as vice chairman and chief financial officer of MBNA Corporation.  At the time, MBNA was the world's largest independent credit card lender. 
Last year, Black shared with the board of directors his desire to explore a new phase in his career.  After more than 15 years with Encore, he felt the timing was right for a leadership change that would help take the company to the next level.  Shortly thereafter, the board engaged a consulting firm to identify and evaluate potential successors.  After a thoughtful and thorough search process, a final agreement was reached between the board and Vecchione for the financial services industry veteran to join Encore.
"Encore has been incredibly fortunate to have had Brandon Black at the helm for the last eight years," Lund said.  "During his tenure, the company built significant cost and operational advantages, expanded into new asset classes and made acquisitions that established Encore as the leading debt management and recovery solutions provider.  Just as important, through the industry's first Consumer Bill of Rights, Encore made bold and meaningful commitments to treat consumers with the respect they deserve."
"I'm proud of everything we've accomplished together as a team at Encore," said Black.  "We have the people, capital, credibility and a world of possibilities ahead of us.  As a leader, the greatest compliment is for the company to succeed after you have gone.  As I've come to know Ken and his vision, I'm confident that he'll be able to take Encore into the future."
