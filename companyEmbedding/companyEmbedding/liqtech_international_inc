Source: LiqTech International A/S

BALLERUP, Denmark, Feb. 21, 2013 /PR Newswire/ -- LiqTech International, Inc. (OTCQX: LIQT) ('LiqTech') is pleased to announce the newest product to the Company's portfolio, SiC membrane discs.
The membrane disc system is based on a principle of creating cross-flow by rotating the membrane as an alternative to pumping the liquid across the membrane in the traditional tubular setup. Energy consumption is only 17% compared to regular cross-flow.
The membrane disc system can handle liquids with high solid content and will therefore be used in applications such as wastewater treatment, manure concentration and pharmaceuticals. The application is also suitable in algae dewatering before final extraction of Omega 3 and other high-value content for production of feed or bio ethanol. These applications are growing markets, and all face a continuous challenge in finding energy-effective treatment solutions. LiqTech believes that its SiC membrane discs will set the standard for requirements in future system design, due to higher flux and better chemical resistance at a comparable price to other solutions. The market for membrane discs has strong potential alongside LiqTech's other tubular and flat sheet membranes.
The product was developed with funding from the Danish foundation for Green Development and Demonstration Program (GUDP – Groen udvikling og demonstrations program). The foundation has partially funded the development of the SiC membrane discs for concentration of manure, however, LiqTech retains full ownership of the intellectual property. Concentration of manure will enhance the production of biogas compared to gasification on raw manure, and will limit the CO2 emission from transportation of the untreated manure prior to the gasification.
The membrane disc product will be marketed through a strategic partnership with an experienced system integrator. The system integrator has a long history in designing membrane disc equipment and believes that LiqTech SiC discs can reduce the system cost, efficiency and footprint, which are the key parameters in most filtration applications.
The total market size for sludge treatment is estimated to reach US $5.8 billion in 2013, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. The membrane technology portion of this market is approximately 5% of the total market, or approximately $290 million.
In addition to the above, the IFIF (International Feed Industry Federation) states that the feed production market reached 873 million metric tons in 2012, representing a market worth US$ 350 billion. It is further estimated that membranes could account for $350-$700 million of the total market.
ABOUT LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC.LiqTech International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a clean technology company that for more than a decade has developed and provided state-of-the-art technologies for gas and liquid purification using ceramic silicon carbide filters, particularly highly specialized filters for the control of soot exhaust particles from diesel engines and for liquid filtration. It also manufactures ceramic silicon carbide kiln furniture. Using nanotechnology, LiqTech develops products using proprietary silicon carbide technology. LiqTech's products are based on unique silicon carbide membranes which facilitate new applications and improve existing technologies. For more information, please visit www.liqtech.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

LiqTech International, Inc.  Announces A New Product To Its Portfolio, SiC Membrane Discs

Feb 21, 2013, 08:30 ET
		  		  									
						 from   LiqTech International, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


BALLERUP, Denmark, Feb. 21, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- LiqTech International, Inc. (OTCQX: LIQT) ("LiqTech") is pleased to announce the newest product to the Company's portfolio, SiC membrane discs.
The membrane disc system is based on a principle of creating cross-flow by rotating the membrane as an alternative to pumping the liquid across the membrane in the traditional tubular setup. Energy consumption is only 17% compared to regular cross-flow. 
The membrane disc system can handle liquids with high solid content and will therefore be used in applications such as wastewater treatment, manure concentration and pharmaceuticals. The application is also suitable in algae dewatering before final extraction of Omega 3 and other high-value content for production of feed or bio ethanol. These applications are growing markets, and all face a continuous challenge in finding energy-effective treatment solutions. LiqTech believes that its SiC membrane discs will set the standard for requirements in future system design, due to higher flux and better chemical resistance at a comparable price to other solutions. The market for membrane discs has strong potential alongside LiqTech's other tubular and flat sheet membranes.
The product was developed with funding from the Danish foundation for Green Development and Demonstration Program (GUDP – Groen udvikling og demonstrations program). The foundation has partially funded the development of the SiC membrane discs for concentration of manure, however, LiqTech retains full ownership of the intellectual property. Concentration of manure will enhance the production of biogas compared to gasification on raw manure, and will limit the CO2 emission from transportation of the untreated manure prior to the gasification.
The membrane disc product will be marketed through a strategic partnership with an experienced system integrator. The system integrator has a long history in designing membrane disc equipment and believes that LiqTech SiC discs can reduce the system cost, efficiency and footprint, which are the key parameters in most filtration applications.
The total market size for sludge treatment is estimated to reach US $5.8 billion in 2013, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. The membrane technology portion of this market is approximately 5% of the total market, or approximately $290 million.
In addition to the above, the IFIF (International Feed Industry Federation) states that the feed production market reached 873 million metric tons in 2012, representing a market worth US$ 350 billion. It is further estimated that membranes could account for $350-$700 million of the total market.
ABOUT LIQTECH INTERNATIONAL, INC.LiqTech International, Inc., a Nevada corporation, is a clean technology company that for more than a decade has developed and provided state-of-the-art technologies for gas and liquid purification using ceramic silicon carbide filters, particularly highly specialized filters for the control of soot exhaust particles from diesel engines and for liquid filtration.
