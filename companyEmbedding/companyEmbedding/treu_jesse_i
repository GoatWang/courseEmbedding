Jesse Treu, Ph.D., Partner




	Jesse has been a partner of Domain since its inception in 1985. He has been a director of 38 early-stage healthcare companies, 23 of which have so far become successful public companies.


	As a former scientist, I get tremendous fulfillment from bringing new technologies into practice. It is a great pleasure working with entrepreneurs and the management teams of young companies to help with their creative process.



	Present board memberships include Aldeyra Pharmaceuticals, Sebacia, Veracyte and Xagenic. He has served as a founder, president and chairman of numerous venture stage companies.


	I think people enjoy working with us at Domain because we make it feel like we are all part of the same team, working together to build substantial companies. We have always worked very hard to be entrepreneur friendly and act like company builders not just investors.



	Prior to the formation of Domain, Jesse was vice president of the predecessor organization to The Wilkerson Group, and its venture capital arm, CW Ventures. While at CW Ventures, he served as president and CEO of Microsonics, a pioneer in computer image processing for cardiology. Previous to that, Jesse held executive positions at Technicon Instruments Corporation (now Siemens Medical Solutions Diagnostics) and at GE. He received his B.S. in physics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and his M.A. and Ph.D. in physics from Princeton University.
