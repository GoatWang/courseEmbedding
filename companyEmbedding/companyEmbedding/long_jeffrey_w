When opacities develop in the lens and the lens gets too hazy, vision will be impaired. Our office can diagnose and manage cataract care. When the cataract affects the vision to the extent that you cannot read or see distant objects comfortably, we will recommend cataract surgery. Our office co-manages with cataract specialists that are proven experts in cataract surgery. Cataract surgery can provide you with a bright new world of vision.GlaucomaGlaucoma: Glaucoma gradually destroys the optic nerve tissue in the back of the eye. The greatest danger of glaucoma stems from the fact that the disease is painless and without obvious symptoms until significant damage has occurred. The most common cause is from pressure being too high inside the eye, but vascular disease and other diseases can also cause glaucoma. We always monitor for glaucoma during routine eye examinations. Tests include checking the pressure of the eye, screening for peripheral vision defects and analyzing the appearance of the optic nerve. If you are diagnosed with glaucoma, we typically prescribe medications that lower the eye pressure. Most forms of glaucoma are successfully treated with eye drops. Laser treatments and eye surgery are secondary treatments that offer alternative ways to treat more advanced glaucoma.Laser Eye SurgeryMost people with vision correction issues are wanting to know more about LASIK and whether it is right for them. Here is a brief description of the procedure;CataractsAn after-cataract, or secondary cataract, is one that forms following cataract removal surgery. Typically it occurs when a piece of the cataract remains or when scar tissue has formed an opacity.EndocrinologistDiabetes CareGeneral PractitionersAllergiesEmergency CareYou may ask us to restrict our uses and disclosures for purposes of treatment (except in emergency care), payment, or business operations.

Stock Market Cycles: How To Use Them for Short and Long Term Profits

Jeffrey A. Hirsch 
ISBN: 978-1-118-69261-5
September 2013






















Description
Run time: 1 hr 2 min. Today's top expert on stock market cycles presents his short- and long-term market forecasts and how he uses cycles to help time the market
In Stock Market Cycles, Jeff Hirsch, Editor of the venerable Stock Trader's Almanac, reveals how to interpret stock market history to forecast future movements. He identifies major cycles, including: war and peace; secular bull and bear markets; presidential term cycles; and shorter-term seasonal cycles.
Given the confluence of cycles, Hirsch forecasts that the Dow Jones average will likely drop below 10,000 through late 2014. After a major rally and then another decline, he believes a secular bull market will emerge around 2018, which could drive the market up five-fold by 2025. Several factors will converge to create this stock market boom later in the decade. While this forecast may seem extreme, Hirsch shows that it is consistent with past stock market behavior following World War II and the Vietnam War. Hirsch also discusses shorter term cycles, including the "Best Six Months Strategy," which has massively outperformed the overall market for many years as well as what to expect each year of the new presidential term.

Reveals the hottest sectors to trade in during the next several years
Examines how the stock market performs each year of the presidential cycle
Discusses which are the best months to be in and the best months to be out of the stock market
Traces the likely path of the stock market through 2025

The Hirsch Organization has a long history of accurate forecasts and market-beating returns. In this software course, Jeff Hirsch succinctly summarizes his approach and provides a road map to profiting in the market during the years ahead.

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Jeffrey Long has the following 7 areas of expertise and  1 specialty.                     Family Medicine
    A family practitioner is a doctor who specializes in caring for people of all ages, at all stages of life. Rather than focusing on the treatment of one disease or patient population, family practitioners are often the doctors that people see for their everyday ailments, like cold and flu or respiratory infections, and health screenings. When necessary, family practitioners will provide referrals for conditions that require the expertise of another specialist.


    The doctors may also provide physicals, inoculations, prenatal care, treat chronic diseases, like diabetes and asthma, and provide advice on disease prevention.
