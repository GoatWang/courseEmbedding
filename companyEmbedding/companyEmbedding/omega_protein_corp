My Turn: Ben Landry: Have honest discussion on fishing

				By Ben Landry
			
In his July 7 column (“Opinions on changes to menhaden quota are divided"), Capt. Dave Monti makes multiple inaccurate claims about the biology and management of menhaden — claims that someone who advises menhaden regulators at the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission should know do not conform to the latest menhaden science.Mr. Monti mischaracterizes the health of the Atlantic menhaden stock when he says it is “on the rebound, due to the first-ever catch quota put into place in 2012.” As an ASMFC advisor, Mr. Monti should know that the 2012 catch quota was based on a stock assessment, later determined to be faulty, that showed menhaden was being overfished. That later-disproven science led the commission to unnecessarily slash menhaden catch rates by 20 percent, hurting those who make their living in the fishery.In 2015, following extensive improvements to its menhaden stock assessment model, the ASMFC found that menhaden was not overfished, not experiencing overfishing, and has actually not been overfished in decades. The science doesn’t show the Atlantic menhaden stock to be “on the rebound,” it shows it has had a clean bill of health all along.Despite these developments, the current quota remains below 2012 levels. This is the result of politics, not science, and makes little sense, as the ASMFC itself found that the previous cuts were unwarranted.In addition to misrepresenting the health of the menhaden stock, Mr. Monti incorrectly describes menhaden as “roving filters, converting algae into energy” and reducing nutrients that lead to algal blooms. But a 2010 study by the Virginia Institute of Marine Science concluded that menhaden probably have little net impact on overall water quality. This has been confirmed by several other studies that have examined the issue, and has even been acknowledged by the ASMFC itself.Mr. Monti takes this point further, stating that an adult menhaden is able to process up to four gallons of water per minute, supposedly filtering algae from massive amounts of water. Once again, the science doesn’t support his claim. The same 2010 VIMS study found that it is primarily younger menhaden, under age one, that feed on the algae that leads to algal blooms. Fishermen do not target these juvenile fish, which are left in the water to serve their ecological role.What’s perhaps most telling in Mr. Monti’s column is his description of commercial fishing interests on one side of the menhaden issue, and “conservationists and fishermen who see the importance of Atlantic menhaden for environmental reasons” on the other. This disappointing opinion is offered by someone who advises the ASMFC.If anyone sees and understands the importance of a healthy menhaden population, it’s the fishermen and fish processors who depend on a sustainable stock to maintain their livelihoods. That’s why we support the ASMFC’s efforts to establish ecological reference points to determine how menhaden catch levels affect the marine ecosystem. We believe science should guide fisheries management decisions, not the uninformed position of people like Mr. Monti.As a member of the ASMFC’s Atlantic menhaden advisory panel, Mr. Monti should know better than to spread misinformation and insult the hardworking men and women who depend on menhaden. There is no doubt that menhaden is an important species, one that is well-worth discussing to ensure we manage it properly today and for the future. But an honest conversation starts with the facts, and Mr. Monti failed to provide them in his column.Ben Landry is director of public affairs at Omega Protein, in Reedville, Va. Capt. Dave Monti responds: Fish stocks are assessed on a regular basis — biomass, spawning stock, etc., go up and down. There's no doubt the biomass was down, according to the science. After the catch reductions were made, there were more Atlantic menhaden in Rhode Island and Massachusetts.

How can you tell if a stock is a bargain? One test is the price/sales ratio – a stock’s price divided by the company’s sales per share.Take Coca-Cola Co. It has roughly 4.2 billion shares of stock outstanding. Its annual revenue is about $42 billion. So it has roughly $10 of revenue per share (actually, $9.70 because I rounded off the figures). Divide Coke’s stock price of $44.68 by $9.70 and you get a ratio of 4.7.That ratio is above average because Coca-Cola is a highly regarded stock. The average today is about 3.8. Historically, a normal average is between 1.5 and 2.0. Today’s market is pricey.
But the stocks I want to talk about today aren’t pricey. They sell for 1.0 times revenue or less, and might be bargains.Track recordFrom 2000 through 2016 I’ve written 14 columns recommending stocks with low price/sales ratios.The average 12-month gain has been 38.5 percent, compared to 7.8 percent for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. That’s better than I usually do, in this column or in actual investing. The high return owes a lot to fortunate choices I made in 2000, 2002 and 2012.My low price/sales picks have been profitable 13 times out of 14, and beaten the S&P 500 nine times.Bear in mind that my column recommendations are theoretical and don’t reflect actual trades, trading costs or taxes. Their results shouldn’t be confused with the performance of portfolios I manage for clients. And past performance doesn’t predict future results.Here are five stocks that look attractive to me now, based on the price/sales ratio and on other attributes:CVS HealthCVS Health Corp. is, in my judgment, the most successful of the major drug store chains. Its stock sells for 0.5 times revenue, in line with its own past multiples. Yet the company has grown its sales at a 12 percent clip the past decade, and that accelerated to 17 percent last year.Drug stores depend on their prescription business to lure customers to pass through their retail aisles. If prescriptions start being filled mostly via the Internet, there goes their edge. That’s a risk, but I don’t think it’s imminent.





ValeroPeter Lynch, a famed money manager, used the term “10-bagger” for a stock that increases to 10 times its initial value. Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) was better than a 10-bagger from 1999 through 2015, rising from under $5 to $70. It has eased off since, trading now at $68 to $69.Valero is the largest independent refinery in the U.S. A gasoline glut depressed refining shares last year and this year. But inventories seem to be normalizing now. At 14 times earnings and 0.4 times sales, I think Valero is attractively priced. It also offers a dividend yield of better than 4 percent.America’s Car-MartSales of cars have slowed , but I still think shares of America’s Car-Mart Inc. (CRMT) might be a bargain. The shares go for about $37, which is 0.6 times revenue. They have bounced between $25 and $50 in recent years.

Selling cars mainly in the rural South, the company provides credit to almost all its buyers, and many of its buyers have bad credit. But it prices its car loans accordingly, and has been profitable in every one of the past 15 years, a claim not many companies can make.Omega ProteinA little stock I like is Omega Protein Corp. (OME) of Houston. It produces fish meal, used mostly for animal feed, and fish oil, often used in nutritional supplements. Many of its products are made from menhaden, a fish that isn’t sold for human food.I particularly like Omega’s balance sheet, with debt less than 1 percent of stockholders’ equity. Profitability is decent but not great, and profits are down in 2017. At 0.9 times sales and 8 times earnings, though, I think the benefits outweigh the risks.Met LifeI’ve predicted for a long time that interest rates would rise, and I was premature. However, I believe they are beginning to rise now, which will probably benefit insurance companies (because they often invest premium money into fixed-income securities).One possible beneficiary is MetLife Inc. (MET) of New York. Its shares go for 1.0 times revenue, 12 times earnings, and 0.9 times book value (corporate net worth per share).Disclosure: I own Omega Protein for one client, and MetLife for a couple of clients.

Omega Protein Corporation is a publicly traded US company founded in 1913 as a fishing operation. As of 2015 it still operated a fishing fleet, and produced food ingredients, dietary supplements and animal feed. Their products included fish oil, fish meal, and proteins.[1] In the 2000s it expanded via acquisitions into ingredients produced from milk and plants.[1]

Activities[edit]
Omega Protein's fishing fleet takes about 90% of the menhaden harvested in US waters; the extent of its harvest has been a subject of controversy.[2] In December 2012, in the face of the depletion of Atlantic menhaden, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission imposed a limit on Omega's operations, "capping the total annual commercial catch at 170,800 metric tons, about 80 percent of the average harvest from the last three years."[3]
Environmental Record[edit]
Awards[edit]
In 2008 and 2009 Omega Protein received certification from Friend of the Sea, an international non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to the conservation of marine resources.[4][5] Omega Protein’s operations in both the Gulf and along the Atlantic have been regularly recertified since their first certification, with the Gulf of Mexico fishery most recently being recertified in the fall of 2014.[6]
Wisconsin Specialty Protein is a subsidiary of Omega Protein; its Reedsburg, WI facility received the Gold Medal Award in the Green Building category as an Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin 2009 Project of Distinction.[7] and received the Annual Innovation Zone Award from the Dairy Business Innovation Center.[8]
Fishery Issues[edit]
2010 BP Oil Spill
The oil slick resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had an adverse effect on Omega Protein’s ability to operate in the fishing grounds east of the Mississippi River Delta, near its Moss Point, Mississippi facility. Regulators closed areas there to commercial fishing.[9] The company developed additional contingency response plans to move its vessels from Morgan City, Louisiana farther west to its Abbeville and Cameron facilities should regulators close a greater portion of the fishing grounds. Following the spill, Omega Protein filed a claim with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (“GCCF”) to be reimbursed for costs and lost profits resulting from the incident.[10] The GCCF administers funds paid by BP in connection with reimbursements for claims caused by the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
2011 Collision and Sinking
Omega Protein reported that late in the evening on May 18, 2011, an Omega Protein vessel, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’, was involved in a collision with a commercial cargo vessel, the ‘’Eurus London’’, in Mississippi waters approximately eight miles south of Gulfport, Mississippi near Ship Island. As a result of the collision, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’ took on water and sank. At the time of the collision, 16 crew members were aboard Omega Protein’s vessel. Authorities accounted for 13 of Omega Protein’s crew members. A search and rescue effort was immediately deployed for the remaining 3 crew members. Joseph von Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the time of the incident, stated “We are assisting the United States Coast Guard and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources in the search for our remaining crew members. Our main concern at this time is for our missing 3 crew members and their families.” [11] The three missing crew members’ bodies were found May 20 and 21. The cause for the collision remains unknown pending a lengthy investigation.[12]
2013 Clean Water Act Violation
Omega Protein was charged with two counts of discharging pollutants and harmful amounts of oil from its Reedville, VA-based fishing vessels into U.S. waters in violation of the Clean Water Act for violations between May 2008 and December 2010.[13] The company was later sentenced for both violations in United States District Court in Norfolk, VA with 3 years of probation and financial penalties totaling $7.5 million.[14] The company has since paid the fines in full and conducted additional community service to clean regional waterways.[15]
2014 Explosion
On July 28, 2014, an explosion occurred at the company’s fish processing plant in Moss Point, Mississippi. Four men were repairing a fish oil storage tank when the top blew off, killing one contract employee and injuring three others.

Omega Protein Corporation is a publicly traded US company founded in 1913 as a fishing operation.

Their products included fish oil, fish meal, and proteins.[1] In the 2000s it expanded via acquisitions into ingredients produced from milk and plants.[1]

Activities[edit]
Omega Protein's fishing fleet takes about 90% of the menhaden harvested in US waters; the extent of its harvest has been a subject of controversy.[2] In December 2012, in the face of the depletion of Atlantic menhaden, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission imposed a limit on Omega's operations, "capping the total annual commercial catch at 170,800 metric tons, about 80 percent of the average harvest from the last three years."[3]
Environmental Record[edit]
Awards[edit]
In 2008 and 2009 Omega Protein received certification from Friend of the Sea, an international non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to the conservation of marine resources.[4][5] Omega Protein’s operations in both the Gulf and along the Atlantic have been regularly recertified since their first certification, with the Gulf of Mexico fishery most recently being recertified in the fall of 2014.[6]
Wisconsin Specialty Protein is a subsidiary of Omega Protein; its Reedsburg, WI facility received the Gold Medal Award in the Green Building category as an Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin 2009 Project of Distinction.[7] and received the Annual Innovation Zone Award from the Dairy Business Innovation Center.[8]
Fishery Issues[edit]
2010 BP Oil Spill
The oil slick resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had an adverse effect on Omega Protein’s ability to operate in the fishing grounds east of the Mississippi River Delta, near its Moss Point, Mississippi facility. Regulators closed areas there to commercial fishing.[9] The company developed additional contingency response plans to move its vessels from Morgan City, Louisiana farther west to its Abbeville and Cameron facilities should regulators close a greater portion of the fishing grounds. Following the spill, Omega Protein filed a claim with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (“GCCF”) to be reimbursed for costs and lost profits resulting from the incident.[10] The GCCF administers funds paid by BP in connection with reimbursements for claims caused by the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
2011 Collision and Sinking
Omega Protein reported that late in the evening on May 18, 2011, an Omega Protein vessel, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’, was involved in a collision with a commercial cargo vessel, the ‘’Eurus London’’, in Mississippi waters approximately eight miles south of Gulfport, Mississippi near Ship Island. As a result of the collision, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’ took on water and sank. At the time of the collision, 16 crew members were aboard Omega Protein’s vessel. Authorities accounted for 13 of Omega Protein’s crew members. A search and rescue effort was immediately deployed for the remaining 3 crew members. Joseph von Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the time of the incident, stated “We are assisting the United States Coast Guard and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources in the search for our remaining crew members. Our main concern at this time is for our missing 3 crew members and their families.” [11] The three missing crew members’ bodies were found May 20 and 21.

Omega Protein Announces Acquisition Of Bioriginal Food & Science Corp., Expanding Depth In Human Nutrition
Diversifies Human Nutrition Product Offerings and Broadens Global Customer ReachTransformational Acquisition Will Add Significant Human Nutrition Size and ScaleHighly Complementary Transaction Expected to be Accretive to Fiscal Year 2015 Adjusted Earnings


HOUSTON, Sept. 8, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- Omega Protein Corporation (NYSE: OME), a nutritional product company and a leading integrated producer of omega-3 fish oil and specialty protein products, today announced that it has acquired all of the stock of Bioriginal Food & Science Corp. ("Bioriginal").  Bioriginal is a leading supplier of plant and marine based specialty oils and essential fatty acids to the food and nutraceutical industries across North America, Europe and Asia.

The strategic addition of Bioriginal is a key step towards fulfilling Omega Protein's mission to help people lead healthier lives with better nutrition such as specialty oils, essential fatty acids, specialty proteins and nutraceuticals. The acquisition advances Omega Protein's business strategy by uniting two highly complementary businesses, adding immediate size and scale to the overall business through more diversified human nutrition product offerings and expanding Omega Protein's global customer reach. 
For its fiscal year ended March 31, 2014, Bioriginal generated approximately $98 million (USD) in net revenues. Bioriginal will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Omega Protein, and the transaction is expected to be accretive to Omega Protein's adjusted earnings in its fiscal year 2015.
"Increased sales of nutritional products for direct human consumption is a key component of Omega Protein's business strategy to diversify our business model and increase growth, while decreasing our exposure to commodity based earnings volatility," commented Bret Scholtes, Omega Protein's President and Chief Executive Officer. "We look forward to working with the entire Bioriginal team to grow our company and create a more balanced business portfolio across animal and human nutrition."
Joe Vidal, Bioriginal's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Bioriginal has a consistent track record of sourcing ingredients from across the world to formulate unique products for our customers.  We are excited to become part of Omega Protein, a leading integrated producer of essential fatty acids, specialty proteins and nutraceuticals, while maintaining our manufacturing and distribution network. We believe together, Bioriginal and Omega Protein will deepen our relationships with existing customers and broaden our reach to new customers across all of our markets."
The total purchase price for the acquisition of Bioriginal is expected to be approximately $70.5 million, plus $0.7 million for estimated working capital adjustments, and will consist of approximately $46.5 million in cash, assumption of $21.5 million of Bioriginal's indebtedness and approximately 0.2 million restricted shares of Omega Protein's common stock issued to Bioriginal's executive shareholders valued at $3.2 million based on the average closing price of Omega Protein's shares for a 30-day period. Bioriginal's executive shareholders are also eligible to receive additional cash consideration if Bioriginal achieves certain financial targets over the next three years. The Company will fund the cash portion of the 
purchase price with a combination of available cash and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Further details regarding the acquisition will be set forth in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Omega Protein and Bioriginal do not expect any immediate changes in their independent, existing operations, including customer service and product availability. 
D‎.A. Davidson & Co. acted as exclusive financial advisor and Aspect Consumer Partners acted as exclusive strategic advisor to Omega Protein in the transaction.

Omega Protein Corporation is a publicly traded US company founded in 1913 as a fishing operation. As of 2015 it still operated a fishing fleet, and produced food ingredients, dietary supplements and animal feed. Their products included fish oil, fish meal, and proteins.[1] In the 2000s it expanded via acquisitions into ingredients produced from milk and plants.[1]

Activities[edit]
Omega Protein's fishing fleet takes about 90% of the menhaden harvested in US waters; the extent of its harvest has been a subject of controversy.[2] In December 2012, in the face of the depletion of Atlantic menhaden, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission imposed a limit on Omega's operations, "capping the total annual commercial catch at 170,800 metric tons, about 80 percent of the average harvest from the last three years."[3]
Environmental Record[edit]
Awards[edit]
In 2008 and 2009 Omega Protein received certification from Friend of the Sea, an international non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to the conservation of marine resources.[4][5] Omega Protein’s operations in both the Gulf and along the Atlantic have been regularly recertified since their first certification, with the Gulf of Mexico fishery most recently being recertified in the fall of 2014.[6]
Wisconsin Specialty Protein is a subsidiary of Omega Protein; its Reedsburg, WI facility received the Gold Medal Award in the Green Building category as an Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin 2009 Project of Distinction.[7] and received the Annual Innovation Zone Award from the Dairy Business Innovation Center.[8]
Fishery Issues[edit]
2010 BP Oil Spill
The oil slick resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had an adverse effect on Omega Protein’s ability to operate in the fishing grounds east of the Mississippi River Delta, near its Moss Point, Mississippi facility. Regulators closed areas there to commercial fishing.[9] The company developed additional contingency response plans to move its vessels from Morgan City, Louisiana farther west to its Abbeville and Cameron facilities should regulators close a greater portion of the fishing grounds. Following the spill, Omega Protein filed a claim with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (“GCCF”) to be reimbursed for costs and lost profits resulting from the incident.[10] The GCCF administers funds paid by BP in connection with reimbursements for claims caused by the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
2011 Collision and Sinking
Omega Protein reported that late in the evening on May 18, 2011, an Omega Protein vessel, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’, was involved in a collision with a commercial cargo vessel, the ‘’Eurus London’’, in Mississippi waters approximately eight miles south of Gulfport, Mississippi near Ship Island. As a result of the collision, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’ took on water and sank. At the time of the collision, 16 crew members were aboard Omega Protein’s vessel. Authorities accounted for 13 of Omega Protein’s crew members. A search and rescue effort was immediately deployed for the remaining 3 crew members. Joseph von Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the time of the incident, stated “We are assisting the United States Coast Guard and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources in the search for our remaining crew members. Our main concern at this time is for our missing 3 crew members and their families.” [11] The three missing crew members’ bodies were found May 20 and 21. The cause for the collision remains unknown pending a lengthy investigation.[12]
2013 Clean Water Act Violation
Omega Protein was charged with two counts of discharging pollutants and harmful amounts of oil from its Reedville, VA-based fishing vessels into U.S. waters in violation of the Clean Water Act for violations between May 2008 and December 2010.[13] The company was later sentenced for both violations in United States District Court in Norfolk, VA with 3 years of probation and financial penalties totaling $7.5 million.[14] The company has since paid the fines in full and conducted additional community service to clean regional waterways.[15]
2014 Explosion
On July 28, 2014, an explosion occurred at the company’s fish processing plant in Moss Point, Mississippi. Four men were repairing a fish oil storage tank when the top blew off, killing one contract employee and injuring three others. The incident involved employees of a subcontractor who were working on two tanks.[16]

Omega Protein Corporation is a publicly traded US company founded in 1913 as a fishing operation. As of 2015 it still operated a fishing fleet, and produced food ingredients, dietary supplements and animal feed. Their products included fish oil, fish meal, and proteins.[1] In the 2000s it expanded via acquisitions into ingredients produced from milk and plants.[1]

Activities[edit]
Omega Protein's fishing fleet takes about 90% of the menhaden harvested in US waters; the extent of its harvest has been a subject of controversy.[2] In December 2012, in the face of the depletion of Atlantic menhaden, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission imposed a limit on Omega's operations, "capping the total annual commercial catch at 170,800 metric tons, about 80 percent of the average harvest from the last three years."[3]
Environmental Record[edit]
Awards[edit]
In 2008 and 2009 Omega Protein received certification from Friend of the Sea, an international non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to the conservation of marine resources.[4][5] Omega Protein’s operations in both the Gulf and along the Atlantic have been regularly recertified since their first certification, with the Gulf of Mexico fishery most recently being recertified in the fall of 2014.[6]
Wisconsin Specialty Protein is a subsidiary of Omega Protein; its Reedsburg, WI facility received the Gold Medal Award in the Green Building category as an Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin 2009 Project of Distinction.[7] and received the Annual Innovation Zone Award from the Dairy Business Innovation Center.[8]
Fishery Issues[edit]
2010 BP Oil Spill
The oil slick resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had an adverse effect on Omega Protein’s ability to operate in the fishing grounds east of the Mississippi River Delta, near its Moss Point, Mississippi facility. Regulators closed areas there to commercial fishing.[9] The company developed additional contingency response plans to move its vessels from Morgan City, Louisiana farther west to its Abbeville and Cameron facilities should regulators close a greater portion of the fishing grounds. Following the spill, Omega Protein filed a claim with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (“GCCF”) to be reimbursed for costs and lost profits resulting from the incident.[10] The GCCF administers funds paid by BP in connection with reimbursements for claims caused by the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
2011 Collision and Sinking
Omega Protein reported that late in the evening on May 18, 2011, an Omega Protein vessel, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’, was involved in a collision with a commercial cargo vessel, the ‘’Eurus London’’, in Mississippi waters approximately eight miles south of Gulfport, Mississippi near Ship Island. As a result of the collision, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’ took on water and sank. At the time of the collision, 16 crew members were aboard Omega Protein’s vessel. Authorities accounted for 13 of Omega Protein’s crew members. A search and rescue effort was immediately deployed for the remaining 3 crew members. Joseph von Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the time of the incident, stated “We are assisting the United States Coast Guard and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources in the search for our remaining crew members. Our main concern at this time is for our missing 3 crew members and their families.” [11] The three missing crew members’ bodies were found May 20 and 21. The cause for the collision remains unknown pending a lengthy investigation.[12]
2013 Clean Water Act Violation
Omega Protein was charged with two counts of discharging pollutants and harmful amounts of oil from its Reedville, VA-based fishing vessels into U.S. waters in violation of the Clean Water Act for violations between May 2008 and December 2010.[13] The company was later sentenced for both violations in United States District Court in Norfolk, VA with 3 years of probation and financial penalties totaling $7.5 million.[14] The company has since paid the fines in full and conducted additional community service to clean regional waterways.[15]
2014 Explosion
On July 28, 2014, an explosion occurred at the company’s fish processing plant in Moss Point, Mississippi. Four men were repairing a fish oil storage tank when the top blew off, killing one contract employee and injuring three others. The incident involved employees of a subcontractor who were working on two tanks.[16]

Omega Protein Corporation is a publicly traded US company founded in 1913 as a fishing operation. As of 2015 it still operated a fishing fleet, and produced food ingredients, dietary supplements and animal feed. Their products included fish oil, fish meal, and proteins.[1] In the 2000s it expanded via acquisitions into ingredients produced from milk and plants.[1]

Activities[edit]
Omega Protein's fishing fleet takes about 90% of the menhaden harvested in US waters; the extent of its harvest has been a subject of controversy.[2] In December 2012, in the face of the depletion of Atlantic menhaden, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission imposed a limit on Omega's operations, "capping the total annual commercial catch at 170,800 metric tons, about 80 percent of the average harvest from the last three years."[3]
Environmental Record[edit]
Awards[edit]
In 2008 and 2009 Omega Protein received certification from Friend of the Sea, an international non-profit, non-governmental organization dedicated to the conservation of marine resources.[4][5] Omega Protein’s operations in both the Gulf and along the Atlantic have been regularly recertified since their first certification, with the Gulf of Mexico fishery most recently being recertified in the fall of 2014.[6]
Wisconsin Specialty Protein is a subsidiary of Omega Protein; its Reedsburg, WI facility received the Gold Medal Award in the Green Building category as an Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin 2009 Project of Distinction.[7] and received the Annual Innovation Zone Award from the Dairy Business Innovation Center.[8]
Fishery Issues[edit]
2010 BP Oil Spill
The oil slick resulting from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill had an adverse effect on Omega Protein’s ability to operate in the fishing grounds east of the Mississippi River Delta, near its Moss Point, Mississippi facility. Regulators closed areas there to commercial fishing.[9] The company developed additional contingency response plans to move its vessels from Morgan City, Louisiana farther west to its Abbeville and Cameron facilities should regulators close a greater portion of the fishing grounds. Following the spill, Omega Protein filed a claim with the Gulf Coast Claims Facility (“GCCF”) to be reimbursed for costs and lost profits resulting from the incident.[10] The GCCF administers funds paid by BP in connection with reimbursements for claims caused by the Deepwater Horizon disaster.
2011 Collision and Sinking
Omega Protein reported that late in the evening on May 18, 2011, an Omega Protein vessel, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’, was involved in a collision with a commercial cargo vessel, the ‘’Eurus London’’, in Mississippi waters approximately eight miles south of Gulfport, Mississippi near Ship Island. As a result of the collision, the ‘’F/V Sandy Point’’ took on water and sank. At the time of the collision, 16 crew members were aboard Omega Protein’s vessel. Authorities accounted for 13 of Omega Protein’s crew members. A search and rescue effort was immediately deployed for the remaining 3 crew members. Joseph von Rosenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at the time of the incident, stated “We are assisting the United States Coast Guard and the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources in the search for our remaining crew members. Our main concern at this time is for our missing 3 crew members and their families.” [11] The three missing crew members’ bodies were found May 20 and 21. The cause for the collision remains unknown pending a lengthy investigation.[12]
2013 Clean Water Act Violation
Omega Protein was charged with two counts of discharging pollutants and harmful amounts of oil from its Reedville, VA-based fishing vessels into U.S. waters in violation of the Clean Water Act for violations between May 2008 and December 2010.[13] The company was later sentenced for both violations in United States District Court in Norfolk, VA with 3 years of probation and financial penalties totaling $7.5 million.[14] The company has since paid the fines in full and conducted additional community service to clean regional waterways.[15]
2014 Explosion
On July 28, 2014, an explosion occurred at the company’s fish processing plant in Moss Point, Mississippi. Four men were repairing a fish oil storage tank when the top blew off, killing one contract employee and injuring three others. The incident involved employees of a subcontractor who were working on two tanks.[16]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Is Your Omega-3 Effective?
How To Pick An Omega-3 Supplement That Works
And Get It At A Great Price

ConsumerReview doesn’t often review health care supplements, but with all the media craze surrounding Omega-3, we decided it was time to write a no-holds-barred exclusive Omega-3 supplement review.
Since Omega-3 was popularized due to over 8,000 clinical studies, supplement manufacturers have been crawling out of the woodwork to create their ‘version’ of Omega-3, with wild claims as to its actual benefits. As each new company bursts into the market with their own ‘proprietary formula’, it becomes harder to separate fact from fiction, premium product from worthless imitation.
We decided it was time to analyze them ourselves to find out which products were sub-par, which were flat-out lying about what was even in their pills, and which, if any, might actually be worth a try.
As we rounded up all of the big brands in the industry for our Omega-3 supplement review, we could see straight off the bat which companies were only there to make a quick buck.

One thing we found was that many manufacturers exceeded the recommended 1,500mg dosage and did not have enough EPA and DHA, which will greatly affect your health improvement goals.
Secondly, we found that many manufactures were using farm raised fish, not deep sea fish. It is always better to buy a product that uses high quality, all natural ingredients, not compounds created in the lab.

It’s hard to believe, but most companies slap on a label that says ‘Omega-3’, often without even mentioning how much Omega-3 is in each pill or without actually including the amount they claim.

What Did We Research?
With hundreds of manufacturers out there, we wanted to figure out what to look for and how to overcome our concerns regarding health care products. We started the process by making a list of the main concerns we have over buying a good Omega-3 product.

It’s not going to be effective. The truth is, there are a lot of products that don’t work at all. Typically, this is because they don’t contain the right ingredients or the right proportions. A lot of interested consumers don’t realize how exact a science creating an effective supplement really is.


It’s going to be too expensive to afford. As we conducted our research, we found that a lot of companies sell Omega-3 for $100 or more! Who wants to risk that kind of money on what could just be snake oil salesmanship?


The company I buy from might just be exploiting another diet fad. How can you tell when a manufacturer is just trying to cash in on the latest health care craze? Most of those companies are all gimmick and no substance. How do you know that the company you choose to buy from is giving you the real deal?

Finding A High Quality Omega-3 Supplement
So, how can you identify the legitimate products through all the smoke? There are a few key factors we looked for in our Omega-3 supplement review that can all but guarantee the product is genuine.
1. Third Party Monitoring: Independent monitoring companies track each company’s reputation and customer satisfaction. One of the most important qualities for a supplement manufacturer is their reputation. Look for a company with a solid reputation backed by third party monitoring.
2. Risk Free Money Back Guarantee: Go with a company that guarantees their product and offers your money back if you aren’t satisfied. If the company is not willing to put their money where their mouth is, that means they don’t believe in their own product.
3. Third Party Testing: Different than third party monitoring, third party testing verifies the quality of each company’s products. Third party testing is really expensive for manufacturers, since it can actually disqualify entire shipments of pills. But when companies don’t have independent quality control, there is no guarantee that their products are what they claim to be.
Omega-3 Brands Research
Your time and money is valuable and we don’t want you to waste either one. So we did the Omega-3 supplement review on most of the top Omega-3 products available.
We studied each product to determine which consistently had not only the right ingredients, but also the right proportions. We disqualified the ones with unnecessary, synthetic fillers and those whose contents differed drastically from pill to pill.
But we didn’t stop there. After all, numbers and percentages are only part of the story. We went on to seek out real customers who had used the products we tested. We asked them for testimonials and compared them with our notes, and then compiled this information to give you a list of the best products on the market.
What our Research Uncovered
A good Omega-3 supplement should contain at least 1500mg daily dose of Omega-3’s, which includes 800mg EPA and 600mg of DHA, and no additional ingredients.
Most brands did not pass the above criteria.
Some of the Omega-3 companies included the right ingredients, but had too little of Omega-3 fish oil, which is the key compound in Omega-3. They use much less than what was used in the clinical studies that led to improved health. Other companies filled their supplements with cheap fillers, binders, and other synthetic ingredients. Almost all of them avoided quality control testing.
The brands we did pick, we stand by. We are confident that these products can help you achieve your goals.
Our Omega-3 Top Pick:
We are excited about our final pick and we think you’ll agree. This company has a solid reputation, a high quality product, third party monitoring and testing. It also has a solid return policy and stands by its products.

#1 Top Pick
Research Verified Omega-3

If you want to try Omega-3, then Research Verified should be your first choice. If any Omega-3 supplement is going to work for you, this is it.

It has the highest quality Omega-3 fish oil, in the right dose, doesn’t have any binders or fillers, and is 100% safe to use.
Quality: They have the recommended daily dose of 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil, which includes 800mg EPA and 600mg DHA.  They only use cold-water oily fish, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines. Oils from these fish have a profile of around seven times as much omega-3 oils than other fish.
Reputation: Their reputation is top notch. They have several third party monitoring services, including buySAFE, Norton, and Trustee, as well as an A+ rating from the quality monitoring company QualityTrusted.
Guarantee: All purchases of Research Verified Omega-3 are backed by a 365 day Risk Free 100% Money Back Guarantee. That is the best guarantee that we have seen from any manufacturer. This 1 year guarantee shows how confident they are in their product.
Perhaps most importantly, they’re an established company that offers excellent customer service, safe checkout and on-time delivery.
They clearly have a commitment to quality as well, and guarantee that their supplements are made in an FDA registered laboratory that is cGMP certified.
So, if you’re looking for the best Omega-3 product available from a reputable company with a rock solid 365 day money back guarantee, I’d say this is the product to try.
The only issue with Research Verified is that due to the demand they are often sold out. To avoid having to put yourself on a waiting list, take advantage of the benefits while they’re in stock.

#2 Pick
Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA

This product is made by a company called Life Extension, and they are offering an Omega 3 product with deep sea fish, not farm raised fish. However, there is one very important category in which they fall short – the active ingredient. With this product, you will receive only 1200mg of Omega-3 fish oil, as opposed to the recommended dosage of 1500mg.
There are also many negative and positive reviews for this product. The bottle itself will definitely catch your eye, but without consistent positive consumer reviews on the website, purchasing this product might be a bit risky.
Our own tests showed that it was a good product, but we all know that supplements don’t always work the same way for everyone. We would recommend choosing a product that offers you the full recommended daily amount of 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil.
Even though Life Extension Super Omega-3 EPA/DHA seems to have a very good formula, the fact that it does not contain 1500mg Omega-3 fish oil as its active ingredient dosage, and relatively few positive customer reviews knocked it down to the #2 spot. That said, if you don’t mind taking a chance, this product might work for you.
Take a closer look and decide for yourself…

#3 Pick
Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega

Falling just short of our number two selection is Nordic Naturals Ultimate Omega. This product contains deep sea fish oil, which was the recommended active ingredient in clinical studies. However, it does not have the recommended dosage of 1500mg Omega-3.
In addition, this product does not have a 365 day money back guarantee. Since the company itself has a good track record and most consumers I spoke to were pretty satisfied with it, I still consider this to be a solid product. Just remember that it has a few slight disadvantages.
Its capsules do not contain the recommended daily dosage of 1500mg of Omega-3 fish oil. Anything less than the recommended daily dosage of Omega-3 fish oil will greatly affect your health improvement goals.
If you don’t mind taking a pill containing a lower dosage than what was recommended in clinical studies, then this product could be right for you. Keep in mind that their website often shows that they are in short supply or out of stock.
Take a better look at the actual product…

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
