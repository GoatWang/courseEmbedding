Managing Product Lifecycle

    By Pharmaceutical Executive Editors

Everyone from equity analysts to the popular press smells blood in the water, thanks to the looming "shark fin" curve of generic competition facing many blockbuster drugs. The impending patent revenue cliff of the next five years puts more than $267 billion of branded drug sales at risk. 
As the C-suite attempts to fill the revenue gap, it's timely to revisit the armamentarium of loss of exclusivity (LOE) tactics—particularly for "sub-blockbusters" that often fly under the radar of senior leadership's attention. Companies have historically withdrawn support from products as LOE approaches, backing into strategies dictated by their overall portfolio strategy. However, our analysis of US drugs that have recently lost patent protection suggests that many brands facing generic competition may be leaving money on the table by failing to consider a range of cost-effective options.    





Traditional strategies may be too costly or risky for some sub-blockbuster agents. Still, depending on initial market size, brand loyalty, and perceived switching costs, brands can successfully employ a portfolio of tactics to bolster unit sales or, alternatively, increase profitability in the face of declining unit sales. Importantly, brand teams should explore their strategic options three to five years before LOE, as some tactics need to be implemented "ahead of the curve." 
The first generic typically enters with a 20 percent to 30 percent discount below branded counterparts, and savings may reach 80 percent by 24 months. Surprisingly, there is a wide range of sales retention post-LOE, from zero to 30 percent, and, by extension, a wide range of revenues are "in play" post-LOE. Our analysis suggests brand teams can diagnose whether a brand is likely to retain sales toward the higher or lower end of this range, based on attributes of the product and market.  Armed with this information, brand teams can—and should—decide which strategic levers merit deployment to maximize post-LOE sales. 

Diagnosing the Market



 
We identified two main attributes leading to higher post-LOE sales retention. First, smaller markets today typically mean larger post-LOE opportunities tomorrow. Unsurprisingly, drugs with over $500 million in US sales tend to face twice as many competitors as drugs with smaller market sizes. Additionally, high-utilization, high-cost drugs sit top of mind for payers, attracting active formulary management and restrictions, while lower-utilization drugs often fly below the radar. Accordingly, sub-blockbuster drugs are particularly well-poised to deploy strategies aimed at retaining post-LOE sales. 
			
Second, among all brands, those with higher perceived clinical switching costs stand well-positioned to carve out brand-loyal niches among prescribers, especially specialists, and patients.  This played out most recently and dramatically with the anti-epileptic drug class. Patient advocacy groups and specialists battled to pass "substitution carveouts" blocking pharmacy-level generic substitution for epilepsy drugs such as Keppra but leaving drugs used primarily for migraine, such as Imitrex and Topamax, floundering. Whereas Keppra maintained 21 percent of unit sales after 12 months, Topamax and Imitrex shrank to 11 percent and 14 percent of their unit sales after only six months. Ultimately, research capturing physician, patient, and payer perspectives on switching costs can help prospectively identify which core or adjacent indications offer the greatest opportunity.  Hindsight is often too costly.

LoĒ³-366 Glass



 


























The durable IG design with an unparalleled 20-year warranty.

    










Super low 0.2% failure rate over 20 years
       Endur’s superior materials and construction have created the lowest failure rate in the industry.
       

Primary Seal
       Polyisobutylene (PIB) minimizes moisture permeation, is UV resistant and provides an outstanding argon barrier.
       

Secondary Seal
      Specially formulated silicone for IG units provides long-term adhesion, is unaffected by UV exposure and provides excellent durability when exposed to moisture. Silicone also provides structural integrity.
       

Spacer
       Stainless steel spacer features a roll form design to provide maximum area for primary and secondary sealant coverage. It provides increased resistance to condensation and less stress on IG seal system. No polymer content eliminates the risk of chemical fogging.
       

Desiccants
     Beaded molecular sieve provides initial frost points below -65°F. Desiccant assures optimum moisture adsorption while minimizing the effects of temperature-related pressure changes.
       

Passive solar control for cold climates Great insulating value while accepting high solar heat gain.
       

Ultimate performance glass
        LoĒ³-366 is a perfect fit for any climate, in any season.
       

Solar and Glare Control Glass
        The glass for the sunniest of climates. Lowest solar gain, cool and comfortable inside.
       
Enhanced PerformanceEnhanced insulation for cold climates. LoĒ-i89 paired with regular LoĒ gives triple pane performance in 2-pane glass.
       
Reflects HeatNot only does LoĒ-i89 provide insulating value, its special coating reflects heat back into the room.
       

GLEAMING
            The specialized coating on Neat glass makes nature do window cleaning for you. A perfect complement to any high performance window.
       

SUN BREAKS DOWN DIRT
          Neat’s photoactive coating breaks down organic materials, making them easy to remove.
       
RAIN
     Neat’s hydrophilic surface forces rain to sheet off, driving away grime and water spots.
       

Sea-Storm Glass
      Sea-Storm laminated glass is built for safety and security. It is created with a polyvinyl interlayer and provides multiple benefits, including hurricane protection.
       

Non-impact Glass
        Non-impact glass is the most common glass in windows. Its advantages include being low cost and fast to manufacture.
       

Non-impact Glass: Breakage Effect
        Ordinary non-impact glass breaks easily. Winds and rain enter the cavity, threatening the building’s structure and causing internal damage.
       

Impact Effect
        Sea-Storm glass resists breakage. And if shattered, the glass remains in the frame, protecting the interior from rain and gusting winds.

LoĒ³-366 Glass




            Cardinal LoĒ³-366® glass is the ultimate performance glass. It just might make all other low-e glass obsolete. LoĒ³-366 delivers the ideal balance of solar control and high visibility. And it provides the highest levels of year-round comfort and energy savings. It’s also the one glass you can use to be compliant in every ENERGY STAR zone – in a double-pane window. Couple it with LoĒ-i89®, and you’re compliant in the North. Its low SHGC makes it compliant throughout the rest of the country as well. It’s the perfect glass wherever you live.



Beats the heat. Keeps the view.

When the temperature soars, ordinary window glass just can’t handle the heat. And tinted glass spoils the view. Cardinal LoĒ³-366, however, has been specially formulated to reject the sun’s heat without affecting the view. It lets more light in and keeps more heat out. So your home stays cool and comfortable. Our patented LoĒ³-366 coating provides the ultimate in performance of all our LoĒ products.
What’s more, LoĒ³-366 provides exceptional fading protection as well. It blocks 95% of the sun’s damaging ultraviolet rays (a leading cause of fading), so it will help your furniture, carpets, curtains and wall coverings stay beautiful for years to come.






It’s the perfect cold remedy, too.

During cold weather, the insulating effect of your windows has a direct impact on how your rooms feel. Typically, 75% of the exposed surface of a window is glass, and the temperature of the room-side of the glass directly affects the air temperature in the room. The better insulated the window glass, the warmer your room will be.
In fact, the Efficient Windows Collaborative (www.efficientwindows.org) suggests that when glass surface temperatures fall below 52°F, there is a risk of thermal discomfort. To maintain the best comfort during the winter, select a glass product that produces surface temperatures that will stay above this point during the coldest outdoor conditions.






The ideal solution for all climates.

The table below compares the room-side center of glass temperatures of different glass types against two different winter conditions.

           The superior insulating capability of Cardinal LoĒ³-366 is a key factor in the construction of comfortable windows for cold climates. The dramatic comfort improvement from windows with warm glass surfaces also means the relative humidity of the indoor air can be controlled and maintained properly. Proper humidity levels (not too much, not too little) will improve comfort and promote a healthier living environment.
            







A unique triple-layer coating.
For years, Cardinal has been setting the standard for energy efficient glass. Top-of-the-line residential window and door manufacturers all rely on our high quality. Our patented state-of-the-art sputter coating processes are unmatched by any other glass manufacturer.
Now we’ve raised the bar. LoĒ³-366 adds a third layer of silver coating. Result: a clear coating that blocks even more solar gain, reflects heat, and lets the light stream in. LoĒ³-366 actually outperforms the tinted glass often used in warm climates.










ENERGY STAR, everywhere.

   The goal of the ENERGY STAR Windows program is to be better than code. LoĒ³-366 is the one low-E product that can qualify in all 4 climate zones: superior insulating value in the north, and clear solar control for everywhere else in the country.

Definitions

Note:All values calculated using Window 7.4. (See http://windows.lbl.gov/software/default.htm  and http://windows.lbl.gov/materials/optical_data/default.htm for more information on glass optical data and the Window 7.4 program.)  Emittance of ordinary (pyrolitic) low-E is 0.16.

Solar Heat Gain Coefficient – (SHGC):The amount of solar radiation that enters a building as heat.  The lower the number, the better the glazing is at preventing solar gain.

Fading Transmission:The portion of energy transmitted in a spectral region from 300 to 600 nanometers.  This region includes all of the ultraviolet energy and part of the visible spectrum, and will give the best representation of relative fading rates.  The lower the number, the better the glass is for reducing fading potential of carpets and interior furnishings.

U-Factor:This represents the heat flow rate through a window expressed in BTU/hr·ft²·°F, using winter night weather conditions of 0°F outside and 70°F inside.  The smaller the number, the better the window system is at reducing heat loss.

Cardinal actively supports and participates in the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC).  Windows with LoĒ³-366 that are rated and certified by the NFRC can comply with Energy Star™ requirements in all regions of the country.  Northern zone will likely require the addition of LoĒ-i89 on the 4th surface to comply with U-Factor requirements.
(See https://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=find_a_product.showProductGroup&pgw_code=WI for more information on the Energy Star windows program.)









LoĒ³-366 - Your choice for all seasons.

LoĒ³-366 is the ultimate performance glass, with energy savings throughout the year, in every part of the country. All with exceptional visibility. It’s the perfect glass wherever you live.
LoĒ³-366 can be purchased in hurricane-resistant laminated glass, as well as in a variety of shapes and sizes.

 To learn more about LoĒ³-366 and other Cardinal glass products, ask your window manufacturer, contractor or architect.
