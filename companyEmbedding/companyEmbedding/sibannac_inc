Home | Naprodis is a company based in San Diego California. Founded in 2000 By Dr. Paul F. Petit. Naprodis is a Contract Manufacturer specialized in natural cosmetic products and natural remedies. Dr. Paul F. Petit was a former family care physician in France, specializing in Naturopathy. All of his life he has been involved in natural health care -- as a physician himself, caring for patients in a family practice in France. Dr. Petit is also a Chiropractic Doctor, Clinical Psychologist and the only Pelotherapist that we know of in the United States. In 2000 he founded Naprodis to offer his services to customers with a strong will to create and develop exceptional products and brands. To formulate any product Dr. Petit is committed to using only the finest natural and organic ingredients and essential oils that he has sourced from all over the world. These sources go back as far as 40 years ago, when his father, a pioneer of natural health care, first started to locate the suppliers of raw materials for ingredients. All of our products are hand-made and Dr. Petit develops, formulates and creates every product himself, giving the assurance that the products he manufactures are effective, safe and of the highest quality | Premium Facial Fluid Moisturizer On Beauty Huile

 | Why Do most of Obligé by Nature s product contain Rosehip seed oil? 
 
 





The certified USDA NOP organic Rosehip seed oil we use in our products comes directly from the grower/producer in Chile. The Rosehip Seed Oil is a cold pressed oil, which is extracted and filtered from the seeds of rose bushes, mostly Rosa rubiginosa (also known as Sweet Briar Rose) and Rosa muscatta (also known as Musk Rose) which grow wild in the south region of Chile.
 
Characteristics:
Our Rosehip seed oil contains the following fatty acids (including high amounts of the two essential omega fatty acids):
C 18:2w6 Linoleic acid 41 – 51 % (Omega 6 essential fatty acid)
C 18:3w3 Linolenic acid 28 – 38 % (Omega 3 essential fatty acid)
C 18:1 Oleic acid 13 – 15 %
C 16:0 Palmitic acid 3 - 8 %
C 18:0 Stearic acid 1 – 3 %
Omega fatty acids are called "essential" because our body is not able to produce them from other sources. They are known to be necessary as constituents of cell membranes, in the synthesis of the hormone-like prostaglandins, and in the regeneration of the skin cells and during the repair of tissues.
It is valuable for skin conditions and also moisturizes dry or very dry skin.
Rosehip seed oil also contains retinol (Vitamin A), and vitamin C which assist the production of collagen & elastin, which make the skin look smooth, firm and supple. The natural process of removing old skin cells and cleaning hair follicles is enhanced giving a cleaner youthful appearance.




Read more... | Marseille Soap
 
The traditional Marseille soap as its name suggests it, comes originally from the town of MARSEILLE,  FRANCE
It is still crafted today using the same strict traditional methods of the seventeenth century.
It is the result of a saponification process involving a delicate mixture of olive oil, alkaline ashes from sea plants and Mediterranean Sea salt.
The mixture is heated for 10 days in huge antique cauldrons, stirred constantly then poured into open pits and allowed to cure. After settling slightly, it is cut into bars and left to harden the most natural way.
It is then exposed for 10 days in the sun and mistral winds, the whole process requiring no less than a month from start to ready finish. The fine white powder on the surface of the soap is a bit of sea salt, it disappears when the soap is wet .This characteristic affirms the authenticity of genuine SAVON DE MARSEILLE.  It is traditionally green or white; the white is made from palm oil, the green from olive oil.
The Marseille soap is recommended by dermatologists throughout the world for its incredible purity and low alkalinity showing moisturizing properties for dry skin and other ailments and is also known to be an ideal allied for sensitive skin. It is highly recommended for babies or the elderly.
