Brian Kane Biography





      
  Brian Kane graduated from the University 
of Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1970 with a 
Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial 
Design. He worked for several New York 
City design studios and spent a year in
Milan, Italy, working for Architect Silvio 
Coppola. His projects included the 
design of seating and casegoods for 
such companies as Mobil Italia Spa. and 
Bernini Spa. After returning to the U.S. he
worked in New York for atelier international (ai). Work involved special contract 
furniture design projects, showroom design, 
and the startup of U.S. production of the 
innovative Italian designs of Cassina, 
B&B and Tecno.


Kane joined the design staff at Metropolitan 
Furniture Corporation (Metro) in 1977. 
Less than three years later, he became 
one of four partners assuming ownership 
of the firm, and took on the responsibilities 
of Vice President of Design and Product 
Development. In 1987 Metro was acquired 
by Steelcase. Kane maintained his 
position as Vice President and was 
responsible for all aspects of Metro's 
design including products, showrooms 
and graphics. 


In March of 1989 Kane established 
Kane Design Studio in San Francisco. 
The firm has been involved in the design 
and development of products for Metro, 
Steelcase, Carnegie, 
Landscapeforms, Bernhardt Furniture Co., 
Martin/Brattrud Inc, 
Falcon, Halcon, Tuohy, 
HBF, Coalesse, Decca, Nemscoff, Summit, Hon, and Herman Miller. 


If you have been to an airport or a bank 
or a hotel - or to Manhattan midtown or 
to the Embarcadero in San Francisco - 
chances are you've sat on one of his 
chairs or benches. Kane's designs have 
won over 80 design awards and have 
been exhibited at the Whitney and 
Brooklyn Museums in New York and 
the Museum of Modern Art 
in San Francisco.

Brian Kane



		Brian Kane graduated from the University of Bridgeport, Connecticut, in 1970 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Design. He worked for several New York City design studios and spent a year in Milan, Italy. After returning to the U.S., he worked in New York for Atelier International (A.I.), and joined Metropolitan Furniture Corporation (Metro) in January 1977. 
	

		Less than three years later, he became one of four partners assuming ownership of the company and took on the responsibilities of Vice President of Design and Product Development. In 1987, Metropolitan was acquired by Steelcase. For the next two years, Kane maintained his position as Vice President and was responsible for all aspects of Metro's design, including products, showrooms and graphics.
	

		In March of 1989, Kane established Kane Design Studio in San Francisco. The firm has been involved in the design and development of products for many global companies. 
	

		Kane's designs have won over 80 design awards and have been exhibited at the Whitney and Brooklyn Museums in New York and the Museum of Modern Art in San Francisco.
	

		Kane believes that less is more - he calls himself a minimalist - or even a reductionist. His work strives for simplification in both form and manufacturing processes and seeks to achieve craft through technology. His products are well designed, highly functional and intelligently engineered for mass production.
	

		Brian Kane collaborated with Coalesse to design the Bindu Chair  and Bindu Conference Seating.

Straight outta’ kinkos


Found in the moldy old noteboks from the 80′s.  Here’s a sketch I did one day for a kid’s toy concept.  Rikki Rikki Rapp’r.
Idea was to have a physical scratching device inside a bright colored plastic housing – kid safe 2 years old and up.  Sort of like the way we used to put baseball cards on our bike wheels to make a clicking sound.  There’s a dirth of “hip hop” toys out there now, but this seemed pretty silly back in 1988.  Now it’s mainstream.
