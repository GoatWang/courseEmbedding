 Retirees

Wayne Withrow
Wayne Withrow and his wife depend on Medicare and Social Security every day. After spending nearly three decades in public service, Wayne was able to retire when he was eligible for Medicare benefits. Both Wayne and his wife have medical conditions that require support from Medicare and Social Security.
Wayne’s need for the guaranteed benefits of Medicare and Social Security in order to retire is a common theme among older workers. “Without these two programs, we would have to work until the day we die,” he said.
