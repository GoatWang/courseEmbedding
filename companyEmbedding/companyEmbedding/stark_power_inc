WATER CHANGES ARE NOT REQUIRED!!! 
The Stark Lobster system is no ordinary lobster tank. The filtration system was originally designed to maintain water quality for delicate warm water fish, such as Queen Angels, Parrot Fish, and even Lemon Sharks. This same system that will sustain these marine fish for years, in natural high density bio loadings (with no water changes), is the exact filtration used in each Stark Lobster System.
The Stark Lobster System has more filtration power and water cleaning capability than you ever thought you needed. If you want to be able to hold more lobsters, in cleaner water, so they really do taste better, and look more attractively displayed in a lighted environment, then the dividends from a Stark Lobster System will be yours to recoup for years to come.

StarkPower’s internal microprocessor is a controlled cell balancer for added performance and longevity.
World Class Safety
StarkPower prides themselves on being at the forefront of safety innovations in the portable power category. StarkPower Smart Cables have a built in sensor that protects them from overheating and sparking by reversing the polarity. StarkPower’s internal microprocessor regulates internal temperatures and controls cell balancing for added safety. The JumpBox functions in a wider range of temperatures than any other jump starter (from -4˚F to +140˚F.)
Product Specifications
The JumpBox V8 Pro 1000 is smaller, more powerful and lasts longer than any other jump starter on the market. At 6.9”(L) x 3.4”(W) x 1.4”(H) and weighing only 1.25 lb., the JumpBox V8 Pro 1000 has the best size to power ratio of any lithium-ion jump starter on the market. Its 54,000mWh power bank ensures longer lasting power for when you need it most. The JumpBox has an expected battery life of 8-10 years as opposed to the industry average of 3 years.

5 out of 5


May 16, 2017 

All I can say is “Wow!!!” I own the JumpBox 400 and the JumpBox 1000.  Both of them are incredible products.  Period.  This little thing is remarkable.  The JumpBox V8 Pro 1000 is one of the coolest “must-haves” I’ve seen.  It redefines the term “two-for” device.  
This little thing will jump up to a V8 engine with ease. I have consistently jumped off my, or another’s patrol car, including several of the old Crown Vic’s still in the fleet.  This little thing packs an amazing amount of starting power into a package the size of an old VHS video cassette.  On top of that, I’m able to to charge two devices at the same time, thanks to two USB output ports.  
It comes in nice, solid carry case, complete with detachable Smart jumper cables, USB charging cable with multiple device inputs (USB, Micro USB, Lightening/ iPhone 6 and up, old iPhone 5 and down/ iPad, etc.), various circular charging adaptors for laptops, a wall charger for the unit and a 12v/ cigarette outlet charger for the unit.  
Do yourself, or a loved one, a favor.  Pick one of these up, because the safety (ability to jump a dead vehicle battery) and utility (charge a gamut of devices) are unmatched.

Discharge Rate
 
 

Terminology
What’s C-rate?
The C-rate is a unit to declare a current value which is used for estimating and/or designating the expected effective time of battery under variable charge/discharge condition. The charge and discharge current of a battery is measured in C-rate. Most of portable batteries are rated at 1C. This means that a 1000mAh battery would provide 1000mA for one hour if discharged at 1C rate. The same battery discharged at 0.5C would provide 500mA for two hours. At 2C, the 1000mAh battery would deliver 2000mA for 30 minutes. 1C is often referred to as a one-hour discharge; a 0.5C would be a two-hour, and a 0.1C a 10-hour discharge. 
The capacity of a battery is commonly measured with a battery analyzer. If the analyzer’s capacity readout is displayed in percentage of the nominal rating, 100% is shown if a 1000mAh battery can provide this current for one hour. If the battery only lasts for 30 minutes before cut-off, 50% will be displayed. A new battery sometimes provides more than 100% capacity. When discharging a battery with a battery analyzer that allows the setting of different discharge C-rates, a higher capacity reading is observed if the battery is discharged at a lower C-rate and vice versa. By discharging the 1000mAh battery at 2C, or 2000mA, the analyzer is scaled to derive the full capacity in 30 minutes. 
Theoretically, the capacity reading should be the same as with a slower discharge, since the identical amount of energy is dispensed, only over a shorter time. Due to internal energy losses and a voltage drop that causes the battery to reach the low-end voltage cut-off sooner, the capacity reading may be lowered to 95%. Discharging the same battery at 0.5C, or 500mA over two hours may increase the capacity reading to about 105%. The discrepancy in capacity readings with different C-rates is related to the internal resistance of the battery.
To calculate of load current value with charge/discharge rate, it can be obtained by;
∴ C-Rate (C) = Charge or Discharge Current (A) / Rated Capacity of Battery
Also, expected available time of the battery on given discharge capacity can be obtained by;
∴ Used hour of the battery = Discharge capacity (Ah) / Discharge current (A)
Discharge Capability of high power Lithium cell.
[Example] In High Power products, rated capacity of SLPB11043140H model is 4.8Ah. A Lithium-ion NMC cell.
1) What is 1C discharge current condition at this model?
∴ Charge (or discharge) Current (A) = Rated capacity of the battery * C-rate
 = 4.8 * 1(C) = 4.8 A
It’s means the battery is available for 1 hour by this current discharge condition.
2) The discharge current value under 20C discharge condition is 4.8(A)*20(C)=96A This battery reveals the excellent performance even if the battery discharges 20C discharge condition. The following is the available time of the battery when the capacity of battery shows 4.15Ah
∴ Used hours (h) = Discharged capacity(Ah) / Applied current(A)
 = 4.15(Ah) / 96(A) ≒ 0.043hours ≒ 2.6 minutes with 96A
 It means the battery can be use for 2.6minute (0.043h) with load current of 96A
