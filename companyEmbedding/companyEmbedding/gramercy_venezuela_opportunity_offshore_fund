                    highlights of operations
                
Chevron’s legacy in Venezuela dates back to the Boscan Field discovery in the 1920s. Today we participate in five onshore and offshore production projects in the country. Chevron works in partnership with affiliates of Petróleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela’s national oil company, in four joint-venture operations in western and eastern Venezuela, three of which are heavy or extra-heavy crude oil. We also have interests in two offshore blocks.
Our operations are accompanied by social investment programs that support economic development, education and health initiatives that strengthen the communities in the areas where we work.

exploration and production
Chevron is one of the leading private oil companies in Venezuela, where we partner with PDVSA affiliates in exploration and production projects.
In 2016, net daily production averaged 28,000 barrels of crude oil, 19 million cubic feet of natural gas and 28,000 barrels of synthetic oil upgraded from heavy oil.

The Boscan Field in the state of Zulia in western Venezuela is operated by Petroboscan, S.A., a joint venture with PDVSA in which Chevron holds a 39.2 percent interest. During 2016, net daily production averaged 26,000 barrels of liquids and 2 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2016, 33 development wells were drilled.
Chevron owns 25.2 percent of Petroindependiente, S.A., which operates the LL-652 Field in Lake Maracaibo.
Chevron has a 30 percent interest in Petropiar, S.A., a nonoperated joint venture with PDVSA in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. This vertically integrated project produces extra-heavy crude oil and refines it to a lighter, high-quality synthetic crude oil. Net daily production in 2016 averaged 28,000 barrels of synthetic crude oil, 2,000 barrels of extra-heavy crude oil and 15 million cubic feet of natural gas. In 2016, 67 development wells were drilled.

Chevron also has an important presence offshore Venezuela. Chevron operates and holds a 60 percent interest in Block 1 and a 50 percent interest in the Manatee Area of Block 6(d) offshore Trinidad and Tobago. The Loran Field in Block 2 and the Manatee Field in Trinidad and Tobago, in which Chevron holds a 50 percent interest, form a single cross-border field along the maritime border of Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. The two countries have signed cross-border agreements, and in 2016, work continued on maturing commercial development.
Chevron has a 34 percent interest in Petroindependencia, S.A., which includes the Carabobo 3 Project. This heavy oil project is in three blocks within the Carabobo area of the Orinoco Belt.

                    in the community
                
Our social investment strategy aims to strengthen local communities with programs that deliver measurable and sustainable results. Our efforts are focused on three core areas: economic development, education and health. From 2006 to 2016, Chevron invested more than $94 million in areas where we operate in Venezuela as well as on cultural programs nationwide. 
economic development
Chevron partners with local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) to build capacity and self-sufficiency while promoting economic development in the communities where we have operations.
Supporting entrepreneurship

Chevron worked with Banauge, an NGO that provides microloans to small businesses, to create Emprered. This program has trained more than 7,000 people in planning, marketing, finance and other skills needed to create a successful business. Chevron also provides loans and training through Empremujer, the country’s first network for women entrepreneurs.
Cultural heritage
In partnership with Fundación Tierra Viva, Chevron created Weaving Hopes, a program that provides marketing training for women from the Warao ethnic group to help them sell their handicrafts.
Business innovation 
For more than 11 years, we have sponsored the Ideas Contest, a competition that recognizes innovative ideas. In 2016, the Chevron Award for Women Entrepreneurs was presented to the chemical laboratory at Simón Bolívar University that created a system to preserve corneas for transplants. Female researchers run this world-class laboratory.
Dressed With Dreams
Our Dressed With Dreams program provides training in sewing, clothing design and clothing manufacturing – including recycling standards – to women in vulnerable situations due to violence or harsh economic conditions. The program also teaches marketing and business development skills and provides job placement opportunities.
education for growth
Education is the foundation for sustainable development. Since 2005, Chevron has worked with Venezuela’s Ministry of Education to expand resources and opportunities. 
Teacher training 
Chevron sponsors Aula 20 (Top of the Class), a training program that supports about 1,000 teachers and nearly 10,000 children from schools in Caracas, Anzoátegui and Zulia states. The program teaches modern math and reading instruction techniques.
K–12 education
In 2005, we built and have continued to support the Santo Domingo de la Calzada High School near the Boscan Field area of the Petroboscan project. We also built the Suürula WakuaIpa Elementary School, which serves 500 students from the Wayúu indigenous community.
Vocational training 
To promote vocational training in computers, electricity and facility maintenance, Chevron built and supports the San Francisco Professional Training Center, which trains about 300 low-income participants per year. The center also helps find work for those who complete the training. 
Talent for the future 
Chevron works with two top Venezuelan universities to help develop the workforce required for the nation’s energy future. In 2017, the Natural Gas Business Management Specialization program at Simón Bolívar University in Caracas marked its 14th anniversary by graduating 12 more students. Since its inception, the program has educated more than 320 graduates from across the country in the technical, management, environmental, legal and regulatory aspects of the natural gas business. Through our University Partnerships and Association Relations program, we support the University of Zulia in Maracaibo through scholarships and classroom technology upgrades.
health
Chevron promotes health care programs in the communities where we operate.
Drawing smiles and bringing hope
We have partnered with seven organizations to treat more than 3,000 children and adults with cleft lip, cleft palate and similar conditions. Chevron employees also provide a range of services to patients and their families throughout the treatment process. Volunteers help parents fill out medical forms, take children to recreational activities, and donate toys and clothes. 
In partnership with the Fundación Amigos del Niños con Cáncer (Friends of Children With Cancer Foundation), Chevron has upgraded cancer treatment facilities in Zulia and Anzoátegui states. 
Improving resources and addressing HIV prevention 
In western Venezuela, we work with the Innocens Foundation, an NGO dedicated to preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV/AIDS and to providing treatment to those who are affected. This partnership also sponsors workshops to reduce sexually transmitted diseases and unplanned pregnancies among adolescents. 
We also support the Healthy Communities Program in eastern Venezuela, which provides medical supplies, equipment and care in the areas of dentistry, general medicine and pediatrics. More than 5,900 patients have received care. 
cultural programs 
For four years, Chevron has sponsored the National Orchestra System – commonly known as El Sistema – which provides free classical music education to hundreds of children. The Youth and Children Orchestras in Anzoátegui and Sucre states have provided musical education to more than 11,000 low-income children. Partnering with the Foundation for the Academy of the Gaita Ricardo Aguirre of Zulia State and the Secretariat of Culture of Zulia State, Chevron supports the preservation and dissemination of gaita zuliana, a folk music genre recently declared a national cultural heritage.

Chevron’s relationship with Venezuela started in the early 1920s when the company began exploring for oil in the country. In 1946, the giant Boscan oil field was discovered west of Lake Maracaibo, in the state of Zulia. Following the nationalization of the Venezuelan oil industry in the mid-1970s, Chevron returned to Venezuela in 1996 to assume operation of the same field. That same year, we established our Latin American headquarters in Caracas. In 2006, under a new contract, operatorship of Boscan shifted to Petroboscan, a joint-venture company in which Chevron holds a 39.2 percent interest.
In 1997, Chevron was named operator of the LL-652 Field, an offshore field in the northeastern portion of Lake Maracaibo. In 2006, under a new contract, operatorship of the LL-652 shifted to Petroindependiente, a joint-venture company in which Chevron holds a 25.2 percent interest.
Also in 1997, Chevron partnered with an affiliate of PDVSA to develop what is currently known as the Huyapari Field. Under a 2007 contract, Petropiar became the operator. Chevron has a 30 percent interest in this joint venture. The project extracts and upgrades extra-heavy crude oil from the Orinoco Belt, the world’s largest known hydrocarbon deposit, in southern Venezuela.
Chevron also has made several significant natural gas discoveries in Plataforma Deltana Blocks 2 and 3. Plataforma Deltana is an extensive offshore area close to the estuary of the Orinoco River, in eastern Venezuela.
economy
Chevron and its partners have made significant capital investments in Venezuela, helped develop the national workforce and promoted the use of local resources.
Petropiar’s crude oil upgrader and Upstream facilities employed about 12,000 people during peak construction. 
Chevron makes important technological contributions by bringing our most effective methods to the Venezuelan oil industry. We also share knowledge about offshore engineering design, heavy oil production and upgrading, and enhanced oil recovery through thermal and water injection.

 The BMR Saga: Built On Talent, Beaten By It 
























 






















(Bloomberg) -- Since entering the world of emerging markets nearly three decades ago, Robert Koenigsberger has seen more than his share of changes.






One of the most consequential is the migration of allocators from hedge funds to exchange-traded and mutual funds in recent years. That’s effectively made them one-day liquidity vehicles, versus the 90-day instruments leveraged funds typically offer.






"We’re potentially sitting on one of the most illiquid market conditions in emerging markets that I’ve ever seen," said Koenigsberger, who oversees $6 billion as chief investment officer at Greenwich, Connecticut-based Gramercy Funds Management. "This market isn’t well set up for outflows. It showed its stripes in the taper tantrum, and I think this will challenge the taper tantrum, if not 2008."
















Since the global financial crisis, the amount of emerging-market high-yield debt has quadrupled to about $763 billion, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. At the same time, dealer inventories have been scaled back to about a fifth of what they were in 2009 due to regulations, Koenigsberger said, meaning many banks no longer participate in emerging markets as intermediaries or proprietary traders.






"The question is: Is this a market or a bazaar?" Koenigsberger said. "In 2017, with the absence of banks providing liquidity, who will facilitate the flows for the one-day ETFs and mutual funds?"






Here’s what Koenigsberger had to say about the state of developing-nation debt trading:






Where does an emerging-market investor make money today?






"In today’s illiquid environment, one of our favorite instruments is cash. When bonds prove to be illiquid, the relative value will make private credit less attractive."Up to half of Gramercy’s portfolio is focused on direct lending, particularly in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.The firm favors long-lock credit vehicles, which are usually over five to seven years and allow the fund to underwrite illiquidity and get compensated for it.With banks no longer lending, "there’s a vacuum to be filled."About two-thirds of their investments are in Latin America, whereas Asia offers the least value and most crowded trades, Koenigsberger said.The firm also have favors distressed opportunities. It bought bonds from the Australian miner Consolidated Minerals Ltd. last year at a distressed level and tendered them at 101 cents on the dollar. Gramercy no longer holds the notes.






Will Venezuela continue to pay on its debt?






"We don’t want to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller. Looking at the numbers, they’ve run out of money. These guys are scraping the barrel. They had to sell ‘hunger bonds’ and do a repo transaction with Fintech Advisory Inc. That’s not a sustainable debt model."Although the fund has no exposure to Venezuela, Koenigsberger says he expects the recovery value on the nation’s bonds to eventually exceed 65 cents on the dollar. He compares it to Peruvian bonds, which traded in the low single digits in 1990, yet eventually were worth 125 cents through a consensual restructuring in 1996. "In 30 years, I can’t recall human conditions being so bad beneath a debt stock. When President Nicolas Maduro is gone, some people think there might be a ‘Macri of Venezuela’ that will quickly solve the problem. That’s a bit crazy because the issues are so much more dire."






Which high-yield debt do you prefer?






"There aren’t a lot of high-yield sovereigns left. Argentina is pretty well played out. I’m definitely not a believer in Ecuador. Even without oil, Ecuador has shown itself to have a very challenged credit culture with multiple defaults. Greece played itself out and Ukraine doesn’t offer much at 7.5 percent yield now."






How can traders leverage with credit-default swaps?






"We run beta hedges on our portfolio -- we’re willing to buy CDS or short sovereign credit to isolate risk and protect against risk we don’t want, such as gap risk."Koenigsberger says Peru and Mexico’s sovereign swaps contracts have biggest asymmetries as there’s about 750 basis points for them to trade at their post-crisis historical wide values.

                Koenigsberger warns that fund inflows raise liquidity threat
            



                Venezuela is ‘scraping the barrel’ to pay, fund manager says
            



Since entering the world of emerging markets nearly three decades ago, Robert Koenigsberger has seen more than his share of changes.One of the most consequential is the migration of allocators from hedge funds to exchange-traded and mutual funds in recent years. That’s effectively made them one-day liquidity vehicles, versus the 90-day instruments leveraged funds typically offer."We’re potentially sitting on one of the most illiquid market conditions in emerging markets that I’ve ever seen," said Koenigsberger, who oversees $6 billion as chief investment officer at Greenwich, Connecticut-based Gramercy Funds Management. "This market isn’t well set up for outflows. It showed its stripes in the taper tantrum, and I think this will challenge the taper tantrum, if not 2008."




Since the global financial crisis, the amount of emerging-market high-yield debt has quadrupled to about $763 billion, according to data compiled by JPMorgan Chase & Co. At the same time, dealer inventories have been scaled back to about a fifth of what they were in 2009 due to regulations, Koenigsberger said, meaning many banks no longer participate in emerging markets as intermediaries or proprietary traders."The question is: Is this a market or a bazaar?" Koenigsberger said. "In 2017, with the absence of banks providing liquidity, who will facilitate the flows for the one-day ETFs and mutual funds?"Here’s what Koenigsberger had to say about the state of developing-nation debt trading:Where does an emerging-market investor make money today?"In today’s illiquid environment, one of our favorite instruments is cash. When bonds prove to be illiquid, the relative value will make private credit less attractive."Up to half of Gramercy’s portfolio is focused on direct lending, particularly in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.The firm favors long-lock credit vehicles, which are usually over five to seven years and allow the fund to underwrite illiquidity and get compensated for it.With banks no longer lending, "there’s a vacuum to be filled."About two-thirds of their investments are in Latin America, whereas Asia offers the least value and most crowded trades, Koenigsberger said.The firm also have favors distressed opportunities. It bought bonds from the Australian miner Consolidated Minerals Ltd. last year at a distressed level and tendered them at 101 cents on the dollar. Gramercy no longer holds the notes.Will Venezuela continue to pay on its debt?"We don’t want to pick up pennies in front of a steamroller. Looking at the numbers, they’ve run out of money. These guys are scraping the barrel. They had to sell ‘hunger bonds’ and do a repo transaction with Fintech Advisory Inc. That’s not a sustainable debt model."Although the fund has no exposure to Venezuela, Koenigsberger says he expects the recovery value on the nation’s bonds to eventually exceed 65 cents on the dollar. He compares it to Peruvian bonds, which traded in the low single digits in 1990, yet eventually were worth 125 cents through a consensual restructuring in 1996. "In 30 years, I can’t recall human conditions being so bad beneath a debt stock. When President Nicolas Maduro is gone, some people think there might be a ‘Macri of Venezuela’ that will quickly solve the problem. That’s a bit crazy because the issues are so much more dire."Which high-yield debt do you prefer?"There aren’t a lot of high-yield sovereigns left. Argentina is pretty well played out. I’m definitely not a believer in Ecuador. Even without oil, Ecuador has shown itself to have a very challenged credit culture with multiple defaults. Greece played itself out and Ukraine doesn’t offer much at 7.5 percent yield now."How can traders leverage with credit-default swaps?"We run beta hedges on our portfolio -- we’re willing to buy CDS or short sovereign credit to isolate risk and protect against risk we don’t want, such as gap risk."Koenigsberger says Peru and Mexico’s sovereign swaps contracts have biggest asymmetries as there’s about 750 basis points for them to trade at their post-crisis historical wide values.

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                By Francisco Toro  By Francisco Toro   December 29, 2016       A youth uses his pillow as a bag to collect rice from the pavement that shook loose from a food cargo truck waiting to enter the port in Puerto Cabello, Venezuela, on Nov. 14. As millions of Venezuelans go hungry this year, food trafficking has become one of the most lucrative businesses in the country. (Ariana Cubillos/Associated Press)  “Why doesn’t the army rebel?” It’s a question those of us who write about Venezuela hear all the time. And I can understand why: Formerly a stable, sophisticated, middle-income country awash in oil wealth, Venezuela has experienced a dizzying downward spiral over the past two years. Today, Venezuela’s is arguably the world’s worst-run economy. Food shortages are pervasive, and food prices are rising fast — a deadly combination that has left millions unable to find enough to eat. In a recent Venebarometro survey, a shocking 78 percent of respondents said they or someone they knew had lost weight because they’re no longer able to buy as much food. As this once-prosperous country faces the unsettling new reality of mass-scale hunger, it really is hard not to wonder: Why doesn’t the army rebel? Now, thanks to a landmark investigation by the Associated Press, we have the genuinely shocking answer: Far from rebelling, Venezuela’s armed forces actively profit from their countrymen’s hunger. This year, President Nicolás Maduro granted the armed forces virtually unlimited authority over the nation’s food imports and distribution. Domestic food production is down sharply in the wake of a botched land reform program, meaning imports now account for most of the nation’s food. But putting the military in charge of this delicate domain has led to an explosion of corruption, as well-connected officers mercilessly prey on every part of the distribution chain, from the initial contracts and the foreign currency needed to fund them to storage, transportation and distribution. In dozens of interviews, the AP’s Hannah Dreier and Joshua Goodman document a shocking web of military bribery, graft and kickback schemes, noting that some insiders now consider food more profitable than drug smuggling — another business the Venezuelan military has considerable expertise in. The graft Dreier and Goodman found is pervasive. First, the military systematically overpays for imported food. This year, to take just one example, it budgeted $118 million for one recent shipment of yellow corn that could be bought for less than $68 million on the open market. Much of the excess makes its way into kickbacks to high-ranking officers with the power to approve the contracts. But that’s just the beginning. Once the food is shipped to Venezuela, opportunities for graft multiply, with one businessman describing the onshoring process as “an unbroken chain of bribery from when your ship comes in until the food is driven out in trucks.” Importers have to bribe one army officer to allow the ship to dock, another to get the food unloaded, another to produce a sanitary-inspection certificate (just the paperwork, you understand; no one really inspects anything), another to allow it to be taken out of storage at the port and shipped to market. The process is cumbersome, and no one seems to care that while they work out the shakedowns, the food itself often simply rots. Some of Venezuela’s most powerful men are directly implicated in the scandal, including Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres, the food minister who used to serve as finance minister, as well as Gen. Carlos Osorio, inspector general of the armed forces and himself once food minister. These are people who sit at the top table: political operatives with a direct line to the president. Neither replied to the AP’s insistent requests for comment. This in itself is a telling sign of the rot at the top of the Venezuelan regime. Faced with serious, specific, documented allegations that they personally profit from their countrymen’s hardship, top officials are perfectly comfortable to simply stonewall. And why shouldn’t they? In Venezuela, high officials are effectively above the law, and they know it. Why would they bother with reporters’ questions? The result is a grotesque paradox: A government that bills itself as radically pro-poor in fact drips with contempt for the poor. Today, with only a third of Venezuelans eating three meals a day, the officers who profit from mass hunger won’t even answer questions about it. As a matter of tactics, there’s a ruthless, Machiavellian genius to the Venezuelan setup. Instead of fearing destabilization from Venezuelans’ descent into mass hunger, the regime is bolstered by it. As foreigners wonder why the army doesn’t rebel at the scale of destitution, the generals quietly ferret away the millions earmarked for feeding the people into discreet offshore accounts. In Puerto Cabello, Venezuela’s biggest port, the poor are no longer under any illusions. They know much of the food that goes through the port will rot in warehouses while the generals shake down suppliers. They know that when that happens, raw recruits will be ordered to furtively bury the spoiled food in the town dump. And so they watch the dump for military vehicles so that, when the men in olive green leave, they can go dig up the rotting food to see what they can salvage to feed their children.        opinions global-opinions global-opinions Orlando Shooting Updates News and analysis on the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. post_newsletter348 follow-orlando true after3th false          Please provide a valid email address.
