The inclusion of any Products on the SportsLife X Site at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these Products will be available at all times.  We may refuse an order for any reason or for no reason at all.
 
All Product prices are shown in U.S. dollars, and are valid and effective for all Products ordered through the SportsLife X Site on the day they are ordered.  All prices are subject to change without notice.  With respect to Products sold by SportsLife X, we cannot confirm the price of such Product until you place an order and we calculate shipping charges. 
 
To correct, repair or replace defective products not produced by SportsLife X, you must communicate with the specific manufacturer, licensor or distributor of the products.

Our creation or transmission of an order confirmation does not signify acceptance of your order, nor constitute a binding confirmation of an offer to sell any Product and we reserve the right to accept or decline your order for any reason up until the time the Product is actually delivered to you.  We reserve the right at any time, without prior notice, to limit or reduce the quantity you ordered of any Product and we will notify you if we do so.  All orders must obtain pre-approval with an acceptable method of payment, as established by our credit and authorization policies and practices in effect at the time of your order.

You and your organization hereby agree that SportsLife X has sole and unilateral discretion over which posts will be published when and for how long.  SportsLife X may refuse any announcement, or remove it once posted for any reason or no reason whatsoever.  Although we post general guidelines for eligibility of organizations and individual events, SportsLife X may choose to follow them or not to in any given instance and/or to amend them from time to time.  These provisions are for general guidance purposes and are not binding. 
 
Caution: Any attempt by an individual to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of SportsLife X’s Community Events Posts is a violation of criminal and civil laws and should such an attempt be made, SportsLife X reserves the right to notify the authorities and to seek damages from any such individual to the fullest extent of the law.

1.                 TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED.
 
In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using the SportsLife X Site and facilitating your athletic activities at the Facility and other places you may play.
 
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”):  This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.  When you engage in certain activities on the SportsLife X Site, such as registering, paying a playing fee, or Posting material, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.  It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities.  We may ask, however, that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, date of birth, the facility you play at and other information.  In addition, we also may collect a person’s education level; alma mater; athletic history and achievements, employment; hobbies; sports interests; and any other aspect our users want to volunteer about their lives.  If you pay any playing fees or purchase anything through our SportsLife X Site, our gateway merchant services company also will collect your credit card information.  We do NOT store credit card information on our servers or other computers.  We may also collect information from you at other points on the SportsLife X Site such as an your playing statistics.  However, this policy is subject to change without notice and we encourage you to periodically check our Policy statement.
 
One of the great benefits most SportsLife X users obtain is to have his/her own personal player or fan home page.  This contains some PII like your name, Facility you play at, sports you play or follow as a fan, athletic statistical performance.  It also may contain photos of you that you or others post.  It does not contain your street address, telephone number, or e-mail address however.  When you send messages to other players or fans, playing facility staff or any other user of SportsLife X, the message will reach them, but you will not be able to see their e-mail address—nor can they see yours.
 
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”):  This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.  We may gather certain general information about you based upon where and how you visit the SportsLife X Site in several ways.  This information may be compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregated basis.  This information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") the web address that you just came from when you visited the SportsLife X Site, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.  A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web (“Web”).  An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the Web.  Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.  In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web or allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer.  Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
 
We use your PII to provide our services to you and for other purposes.  Specifically, we collect such information and use it to help provide our services to our users, allow our users to relate to each other through Communities and provide us with concise demographic information to help us garner and target advertising on SportsLife X ONLY..  We or the Facilities will use your PII, specifically your e-mail, to provide notifications of scheduling changes and other announcements that are deemed very important.  We or the Facilities may use PII to deliver information to you,  to contact you regarding administrative notices or to display targeted advertisements.  We may also use PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you.  Please note that many transactions and interactions on our SportsLife X Site are being done on behalf of the sports Facility or arena where you and/or your children play.  As such, we will provide your PII to these sports facilities and arenas.  Rest assured that we will not share your credit card information with the sports Facility or arena as we do not even keep that information ourselves.  These sports Facilities and arenas may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do.  We encourage you to check these sports Facilities and arenas for their specific privacy policies and business practices.  We DO NOT share your PII in a form that could identify you with anyone other than the Facility in which you play or follow. 
 
We will use Non-PII in a general, aggregated form to help us demographically target customers, other customer communications or for any potential sponsors.  We also reveal certain Non-PII demographic information about individuals to advertiser researchers, but when we do so enough PII is stripped out so that you can never be identified..  For example, we will disclose general types of people who click on third party advertisements or play in-line hockey, i.e., gender, age, Zip Code, sports preferences, education level, etc., but such disclosure will never identify any names, street addresses, phone numbers or e-mail addresses that could identify the particular individual.  We will also use both PII and Non-PII to enhance the smooth operation of the SportsLife X Site, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze the SportsLife X Site’s use, improve our service offerings, and customize the SportsLife X Site’s Content, layout, and services. 
 
2.                 ONLINE SERVICES.
 
When you register with SportsLife X, we collect your name, e-mail address, and other information necessary to provide services to you.  You acknowledge that by signing up for online services you are also opting in for e-mail announcements or alerts.  SportsLife X and your playing Facility will use your e-mail address to send you updates and alerts on SportsLife X’s online services.  This helps us keep you informed of our online services and better serve you.  Except for your Facilities and in some cases your team Captain/Coach or other players on your team, you will NOT receive any electronic or other correspondence from third parties.
 
3.                 COMPELLED DISCLOSURE.
 
If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited by law) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure.  We will attempt to provide this notice by e-mail, if you have given us an e-mail address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address.  We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of the SportsLife X Site.  If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information to law enforcement agencies or a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
4.                 COOKIES.
 
When you use the SportsLife X Site, we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of the SportsLife X Site by, for example, allowing you to return to the SportsLife X Site without having to sign in each time.  A cookie is a small data text file, which is stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits).  Cookies contain information that can be read later by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Our cookies (i) make your use of the SportsLife X Site easier and (ii) make the SportsLife X Site run more smoothly.  You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of the SportsLife X Site may not work properly in that case.  Once you leave the SportsLife X Site, the “cookie” remains on your hard drive in case you choose to visit the SportsLife X Site again or perform other functions.  Rest assured that at no time will our “cookie” collect your PII or any other information from your computer.
 
We specifically do no use cookies to help track your web activity on the Internet or on any other sites on the Internet, nor do we cooperate with others who attempt to do so.  Further, we do not allow any of our advertisers to do so on our site although if you go to their website they may engage in such a practice.
 
5.                 UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION.
 
We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to us.  You may access your account and change any of your PII yourself at any time.
 
We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it ever changes.  You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed.  While we will comply to the best of our ability, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information remaining because of backups and historical archives.  Nonetheless, if you do delete most of your PII, understand that you will not be able to use the SportLife X Site any longer as our computer does not know where to start you when you sign in and what you may see and not see.
 
6.                 SECURITY OF INFORMATION.
 
At the SportsLife X Site, you can be assured that your PII security is consistent with current industry standards.  The importance of security for all PII associated with our users is of utmost concern to us.  We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  For example, we may store your personal information on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.  When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 256-bit encryption protocol or newer technology, which is the industry standard and prevents unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is intercepted.
 
In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions are directly handled by established third-party banking and processing agents who receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information. 
 
Unfortunately on today’s Internet, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network or in any server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we conscientiously strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet and computer server technology that are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the SportsLife X Site cannot be guaranteed and as with any other website on the Internet, it is possible that any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with while in transit by a third party.
 
7.                 PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD-PARTY SITES.
 
As a public service, we may maintain links to other Web sites.  Except as otherwise discussed in this Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.  Other sites accessible through the SportsLife X Site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices.  For more information on this topic, please consult each specific site’s privacy policy.  You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.
 
8.                 MISCELLANEOUS PRIVACY ISSUES.
 
While the SportsLife X Site is directed to athletes of all ages including to children 13 years old or younger, our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII about users that are 13 years of age or younger without a parent or guardian’s permission.  If you have any questions about this Policy, the practices of the SportsLife X Site, or your dealings with SportsLife X, please communicate with us by using the “Contact Us” component of the SportsLife X Site

Although we post general guidelines for eligibility of organizations and individual events, SportsLife X may choose to follow them or not to in any given instance and/or to amend them from time to time.  These provisions are for general guidance purposes and are not binding. 
 
Caution: Any attempt by an individual to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of SportsLife X’s Community Events Posts is a violation of criminal and civil laws and should such an attempt be made, SportsLife X reserves the right to notify the authorities and to seek damages from any such individual to the fullest extent of the law.

These exclusions apply regardless of the theory of liability, or whether related to your use or inability to use the SportsLife X Site, or otherwise. These exclusions apply even if either party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  To the extent allowed by law, the maximum liability of SportsLife X (which includes, collectively, its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers and licensors) to you shall not exceed the fees paid by you to SportsLife X or any Facility during the 12 months before the last event that gave rise to your claim. This limitation of liability applies whether the claims are contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise.  This limitation of liability for the SportsLife X Site is in the aggregate and not per incident.  Neither party may bring a claim under this Agreement more than 18 months after the event that creates the action or claim.
 
Notwithstanding any claim that a sole or exclusive remedy which is provided in this Agreement may or does fail of its essential purpose, you specifically acknowledge and agree that your sole and exclusive remedy for any loss or damage shall be to have the entity responsible for such loss or damage, (either SportsLife X, or its Affiliates (i.e., Facilities or Leagues, or their commercial stores or manufacturers) upon written notice from you to the responsible entity, attempt to repair, correct or replace any deficient Product under this Agreement and, if repair, correction or replacement is not reasonably commercially practicable then the responsible entity shall refund any monies actually paid by you for the Product involved and to terminate and discontinue your use of the SportsLife X Site.  You further understand and acknowledge the capacity of the SportsLife X Site, in the aggregate and for each user, is limited.  Some jurisdictions do not allow for the exclusion of certain warranties or certain limitations on damages and remedies, accordingly some of the exclusions and limitations described in this Agreement may not apply to you.
 
14.           ADS AND MALWARE.
 
We take great care and pride in creating the SportsLife X Site.  We are always on the lookout for technical glitches that effect how the SportsLife X Site works.  When we find them on our end, we will make reasonable efforts to fix them.  Unfortunately, your home computer may cause some glitches that effect how you see the SportsLife X Site -- and that is totally beyond our control.
 
If you experience any unusual behavior, content or ads on the SportsLife X Site, it may be the result of Malware on your computer.  Malware -- short for MALicious softWARE -- is a term used to broadly classify a form of software which is installed in a computer system with malicious intentions, usually without the owner's knowledge or permission.  Malware includes computer viruses, key loggers, malicious active content, rogue programs and dialers, among others.  While we continuously work closely with our partners to ensure that everything on the SportsLife X Site is working properly, sometimes Malware programs on your personal computer may interfere with your experience on the SportsLife X Site and on other sites that you visit.  If you do discover any Malware on your system, we suggest you speak with a qualified computer technician. If you even suspect that there is any kind of Malware on the SportsLife X Site or servers, please use the Contact Us and notify us immediately.
 
15.           INTERNATIONAL USE.

Those who choose to access the SportsLife X Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with all local laws.  Any offer for any Product, service, and/or information made in connection with the SportsLife X Site is void where prohibited.
 
16.           CONTESTS, SWEEPSTAKES AND PROMOTIONS.
 
From time to time, SportsLife X or its affiliates or its operational service providers, suppliers, and advertisers, may conduct promotions on or through the SportsLife X Site, including, without limitation, contests and sweepstakes (collectively "Promotions").  Each Promotion may have additional terms and/or rules (“Rules”) which will be posted on the SportsLife X Site or otherwise made available to you and, for purposes of each Promotion, will be deemed incorporated into and form a part of this Agreement.

PRIVACY POLICY
 
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) discloses the privacy practices for: (i) SportsLife X and (ii) the SportsLife X Site and various related services.  SportsLife X, in connection with the provider of the SportsLife X Site, is committed to protecting your privacy online.  Please read the information below to learn our policies regarding your use of the SportsLife X Site.
 
YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS POLICY IS PART OF THE SPORTSLIFE X SITE’S TERMS OF USE, AND BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SPORTSLIFE X SITE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE POLICY.  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THE POLICY, PLEASE EXIT THE SITE NOW.

However. most of the information on the SportsLife X Site is very personalized to the individual players and fans.  To have your own player or fan page and use many of the features of the SportLife X Site, you must register and provide us with your name and other variables.

QUICK GUIDE TO PRIVACY POLICY CONTENTS
 
1.     TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED.
2.     ONLINE SERVICES.
3.     COMPELLED DISCLOSURE.
4.     COOKIES.
5.     UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION.

7.     PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD-PARTY SITES.
8.     MISCELLANEOUS PRIVACY ISSUES.

 
1.                 TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED.
 
In order to better provide you with our numerous services, we collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.  Our primary goal in collecting information from you is to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience while using the SportsLife X Site and facilitating your athletic activities at the Facility and other places you may play.
 
Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”):  This refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are.  When you engage in certain activities on the SportsLife X Site, such as registering, paying a playing fee, or Posting material, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.  It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities.  We may ask, however, that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, gender, date of birth, the facility you play at and other information.  In addition, we also may collect a person’s education level; alma mater; athletic history and achievements, employment; hobbies; sports interests; and any other aspect our users want to volunteer about their lives.  If you pay any playing fees or purchase anything through our SportsLife X Site, our gateway merchant services company also will collect your credit card information.  We do NOT store credit card information on our servers or other computers.  We may also collect information from you at other points on the SportsLife X Site such as an your playing statistics.  However, this policy is subject to change without notice and we encourage you to periodically check our Policy statement.
 
One of the great benefits most SportsLife X users obtain is to have his/her own personal player or fan home page.  This contains some PII like your name, Facility you play at, sports you play or follow as a fan, athletic statistical performance.  It also may contain photos of you that you or others post.  It does not contain your street address, telephone number, or e-mail address however.  When you send messages to other players or fans, playing facility staff or any other user of SportsLife X, the message will reach them, but you will not be able to see their e-mail address—nor can they see yours.
 
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”):  This refers to information that does not by itself identify a specific individual.  We may gather certain general information about you based upon where and how you visit the SportsLife X Site in several ways.  This information may be compiled and analyzed on both an individual and an aggregated basis.  This information may include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") the web address that you just came from when you visited the SportsLife X Site, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and/or your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.  A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web (“Web”).  An IP address is an identifier for a computer or device on a Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol ("TCP/IP") network, such as the Web.  Networks like the Web use the TCP/IP protocol to route information based on the IP address of the destination.  In other words, an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web or allowing Web servers to locate and identify your computer.  Computers require IP addresses in order for users to communicate on the Internet.
 
We use your PII to provide our services to you and for other purposes.  Specifically, we collect such information and use it to help provide our services to our users, allow our users to relate to each other through Communities and provide us with concise demographic information to help us garner and target advertising on SportsLife X ONLY..  We or the Facilities will use your PII, specifically your e-mail, to provide notifications of scheduling changes and other announcements that are deemed very important.  We or the Facilities may use PII to deliver information to you,  to contact you regarding administrative notices or to display targeted advertisements.  We may also use PII to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, and enforce our agreements with you.  Please note that many transactions and interactions on our SportsLife X Site are being done on behalf of the sports Facility or arena where you and/or your children play.  As such, we will provide your PII to these sports facilities and arenas.  Rest assured that we will not share your credit card information with the sports Facility or arena as we do not even keep that information ourselves.  These sports Facilities and arenas may have different privacy policies and business practices than we do.  We encourage you to check these sports Facilities and arenas for their specific privacy policies and business practices.  We DO NOT share your PII in a form that could identify you with anyone other than the Facility in which you play or follow. 
 
We will use Non-PII in a general, aggregated form to help us demographically target customers, other customer communications or for any potential sponsors.  We also reveal certain Non-PII demographic information about individuals to advertiser researchers, but when we do so enough PII is stripped out so that you can never be identified..  For example, we will disclose general types of people who click on third party advertisements or play in-line hockey, i.e., gender, age, Zip Code, sports preferences, education level, etc., but such disclosure will never identify any names, street addresses, phone numbers or e-mail addresses that could identify the particular individual.  We will also use both PII and Non-PII to enhance the smooth operation of the SportsLife X Site, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze the SportsLife X Site’s use, improve our service offerings, and customize the SportsLife X Site’s Content, layout, and services. 
 
2.                 ONLINE SERVICES.
 
When you register with SportsLife X, we collect your name, e-mail address, and other information necessary to provide services to you.  You acknowledge that by signing up for online services you are also opting in for e-mail announcements or alerts.  SportsLife X and your playing Facility will use your e-mail address to send you updates and alerts on SportsLife X’s online services.  This helps us keep you informed of our online services and better serve you.  Except for your Facilities and in some cases your team Captain/Coach or other players on your team, you will NOT receive any electronic or other correspondence from third parties.
 
3.                 COMPELLED DISCLOSURE.
 
If we are required by law to disclose the information that you have submitted, we will attempt to provide you with notice (unless we are prohibited by law) that a request for your information has been made in order to give you an opportunity to object to the disclosure.  We will attempt to provide this notice by e-mail, if you have given us an e-mail address, or by postal mail if you have entered a postal address.  We will independently object to overly broad requests for access to information about users of the SportsLife X Site.  If you do not challenge the disclosure request, we may be legally required to turn over your information to law enforcement agencies or a court of competent jurisdiction.
 
4.                 COOKIES.
 
When you use the SportsLife X Site, we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of the SportsLife X Site by, for example, allowing you to return to the SportsLife X Site without having to sign in each time.  A cookie is a small data text file, which is stored on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits).  Cookies contain information that can be read later by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Our cookies (i) make your use of the SportsLife X Site easier and (ii) make the SportsLife X Site run more smoothly.  You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of the SportsLife X Site may not work properly in that case.  Once you leave the SportsLife X Site, the “cookie” remains on your hard drive in case you choose to visit the SportsLife X Site again or perform other functions.  Rest assured that at no time will our “cookie” collect your PII or any other information from your computer.
 
We specifically do no use cookies to help track your web activity on the Internet or on any other sites on the Internet, nor do we cooperate with others who attempt to do so.  Further, we do not allow any of our advertisers to do so on our site although if you go to their website they may engage in such a practice.
 
5.                 UPDATING AND CORRECTING INFORMATION.
 
We believe you should have the ability to access and edit the PII that you have provided to us.  You may access your account and change any of your PII yourself at any time.
 
We encourage you to promptly update your PII if it ever changes.  You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed.  While we will comply to the best of our ability, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information remaining because of backups and historical archives.  Nonetheless, if you do delete most of your PII, understand that you will not be able to use the SportLife X Site any longer as our computer does not know where to start you when you sign in and what you may see and not see.
 
6.                 SECURITY OF INFORMATION.
 
At the SportsLife X Site, you can be assured that your PII security is consistent with current industry standards.  The importance of security for all PII associated with our users is of utmost concern to us.  We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.  For example, we may store your personal information on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.  When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 256-bit encryption protocol or newer technology, which is the industry standard and prevents unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is intercepted.
 
In order to most efficiently serve you, credit card transactions are directly handled by established third-party banking and processing agents who receive the information needed to verify and authorize your credit card or other payment information. 
 
Unfortunately on today’s Internet, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network or in any server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  As a result, while we conscientiously strive to protect your PII, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet and computer server technology that are beyond our control; and (b) the security, integrity, and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through the SportsLife X Site cannot be guaranteed and as with any other website on the Internet, it is possible that any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with while in transit by a third party.
 
7.                 PRIVACY POLICIES OF THIRD-PARTY SITES.
 
As a public service, we may maintain links to other Web sites.  Except as otherwise discussed in this Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.  Other sites accessible through the SportsLife X Site have their own privacy policies and data collection, use, and disclosure practices.  For more information on this topic, please consult each specific site’s privacy policy.  You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties.
 
8.                 MISCELLANEOUS PRIVACY ISSUES.
 
While the SportsLife X Site is directed to athletes of all ages including to children 13 years old or younger, our policy is that we do not knowingly collect, use, or disclose PII about users that are 13 years of age or younger without a parent or guardian’s permission.  If you have any questions about this Policy, the practices of the SportsLife X Site, or your dealings with SportsLife X, please communicate with us by using the “Contact Us” component of the SportsLife X Site



 I am over the age of 18 and am agreeing for myself or I am a parent/guardian agreeing on behalf of my minor child. *
