In the Sweet Spot

Acreage in the Permian Basin constitutes one of the premier oil and gas assets in the world, and we have accumulated a substantial acreage portfolio in the sweet spots of both the Midland and Southern Delaware Basins.










Home»About»Operations








midland basin
southern delaware basin





















The majority of our acreage offers “stacked pay” potential to develop oil and gas from several prospective zones. Our acreage benefits from a favorable combination of depth, thickness, thermal maturity, and organic content, which contributes to higher productivity, number of discrete target horizons, and resource potential.
Compared to other basins in North America, horizontal development in the Permian Basin is still in its infancy, and we believe there is ample opportunity for ongoing productivity enhancement as we optimize completion techniques, fine-tune target intervals, and test new strategies for reservoir stimulation.


Parsley's Midland Basin acreage is characterized by favorable thermal maturity for high oil content, sufficient depth to drive strong, pressure-fueled recovery rates, and ample thickness, with differentiated multi-target potential in Upton and Reagan Counties, in particular. At 800-900 feet thick across much of our acreage, our Wolfcamp A/B complex is among the thickest in the deep portion of the basin, supporting the potential for up to 60 wells per section in the Wolfcamp A/B complex alone. 


Like our Midland Basin acreage, Parsley’s Southern Delaware acreage is characterized by favorable reservoir characteristics. Zonal testing indicates stacked pay potential from the Bone Spring through the Woodford, with a thick, geopressured Wolfcamp interval throughout. Mineral ownership enhances already compelling well economics on a significant portion of the acreage, which is positioned at the gateway to the basin, providing ample infrastructure and takeaway capacity.

A Step Ahead

Parsley's first-class asset base and willingness to think creatively keeps us a step ahead. Our conservative financial strategy ensures we stay there. 










Home»About














About Parsley Energy
Parsley’s first-class asset base and willingness to think creatively keeps us a step ahead. Our conservative financial strategy ensures we stay there.
Founded in 2008, Parsley Energy is a Permian-focused independent oil and natural gas company with an extensive operating history and footprint, a premier acreage position, best-in-class well results, an attractive growth profile, and a conservative financial strategy. We have drilled and operate hundreds of vertical and horizontal wells, having transitioned from vertical drilling to horizontal drilling in order to most effectively capture our abundant resource potential. 
Thriving across Cycles
Our past is characterized by rapid growth, cost compression, and creative transactions through which we have built a premier acreage position. We have delivered on our promise to build a first-class asset base from which we are driving value in an efficient, disciplined manner. Our operational proficiency, advantaged asset base, and disciplined hedging program have enabled us to create significant value across commodity price contexts.
Scratching the Surface
Our future will be shaped by resource and margin expansion. Given the differentiated thickness of our target intervals, Parsley's asset base includes abundant value yet to be unlocked. We perceive substantial opportunity to de-risk additional targets and reduce between-well spacing, increasing per-section recovery rates. With our substantial drilling inventory and an enviable track record of highly productive horizontal wells, Parsley Energy is poised to deliver high-return growth across market cycles.
Committed to the Core
A deep and overriding commitment to safety and environmental responsibility pervades our operations and broader organizational culture, as expressed in our Health, Safety, and Environmental Mission Statement.

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
