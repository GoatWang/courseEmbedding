KT Corporation (Hangul: 케이티 주식회사), formerly Korea Telecom, is South Korea's largest telephone company.
The state-owned firm is South Korea's first telephone company and as such it dominates the local landline and broadband Internet market, serving about 90 percent of the country's fixed-line subscribers and 45 percent of high-speed Internet users. After selling its wireless affiliate Korea Mobile Telecom in 1994, KT returned to the wireless market with the creation of PCS carrier KTF in 1996.
The company's 2009 merger with KTF, its wireless subsidiary, made it the country's ninth largest chaebol (conglomerate) with nearly 24 trillion won ($20 billion) in assets.[2]
In January 2011, KT launched unified brand "Olleh" for both fixed-line and cellular broadband services.[3]
In late 2015 former KT president Suk-Jae Lee was charged of breach of trust and embezzlement, allegations which he denies.[4]

Company overview[edit]
Founded in 1981 as a public utility, KT actively led Korea's transition to the information era and played a key role in transforming Korea into a major information technology hub. As a state-owned firm, KT had the clout to influence changes to itself and Korean telecommunications industry as a whole; selling its wireless affiliate in 1994, founding another in 1996 and becoming, along with Dacom, one of Korea's earliest ISPs. In 2001 KT acquired struggling broadband provider Thrunet, then the largest broadband company in Korea, which paved the way for KT to dominate the broadband market.[5] In 2009, KT merged with its wireless subsidiary KTF, paving the way to the integration of landline and cellular services. Ever since KT introduced the Apple iPhone to South Korea, it has been constantly seeking new business area, such as media, e-commerce, and global business partnerships. The company has a well-distributed shareholder structure under which the National Pension Service (NPS) is the largest shareholder (6.81% as of December 31, 2012), but NPS holds no managerial rights over the company.[6] Under the current shareholder structure, no controlling shareholder exists.

KT Corporation (Hangul: 케이티 주식회사), formerly Korea Telecom, is South Korea's largest telephone company.
The state-owned firm is South Korea's first telephone company and as such it dominates the local landline and broadband Internet market, serving about 90 percent of the country's fixed-line subscribers and 45 percent of high-speed Internet users. After selling its wireless affiliate Korea Mobile Telecom in 1994, KT returned to the wireless market with the creation of PCS carrier KTF in 1996.
The company's 2009 merger with KTF, its wireless subsidiary, made it the country's ninth largest chaebol (conglomerate) with nearly 24 trillion won ($20 billion) in assets.[2]
In January 2011, KT launched unified brand "Olleh" for both fixed-line and cellular broadband services.[3]
In late 2015 former KT president Suk-Jae Lee was charged of breach of trust and embezzlement, allegations which he denies.[4]

Company overview[edit]
Founded in 1981 as a public utility, KT actively led Korea's transition to the information era and played a key role in transforming Korea into a major information technology hub. As a state-owned firm, KT had the clout to influence changes to itself and Korean telecommunications industry as a whole; selling its wireless affiliate in 1994, founding another in 1996 and becoming, along with Dacom, one of Korea's earliest ISPs. In 2001 KT acquired struggling broadband provider Thrunet, then the largest broadband company in Korea, which paved the way for KT to dominate the broadband market.[5] In 2009, KT merged with its wireless subsidiary KTF, paving the way to the integration of landline and cellular services. Ever since KT introduced the Apple iPhone to South Korea, it has been constantly seeking new business area, such as media, e-commerce, and global business partnerships. The company has a well-distributed shareholder structure under which the National Pension Service (NPS) is the largest shareholder (6.81% as of December 31, 2012), but NPS holds no managerial rights over the company.[6] Under the current shareholder structure, no controlling shareholder exists.

KT Corporation (Hangul: 케이티 주식회사), formerly Korea Telecom, is South Korea's largest telephone company.
The state-owned firm is South Korea's first telephone company and as such it dominates the local landline and broadband Internet market, serving about 90 percent of the country's fixed-line subscribers and 45 percent of high-speed Internet users. After selling its wireless affiliate Korea Mobile Telecom in 1994, KT returned to the wireless market with the creation of PCS carrier KTF in 1996.
The company's 2009 merger with KTF, its wireless subsidiary, made it the country's ninth largest chaebol (conglomerate) with nearly 24 trillion won ($20 billion) in assets.[2]
In January 2011, KT launched unified brand "Olleh" for both fixed-line and cellular broadband services.[3]
In late 2015 former KT president Suk-Jae Lee was charged of breach of trust and embezzlement, allegations which he denies.[4]

Company overview[edit]
Founded in 1981 as a public utility, KT actively led Korea's transition to the information era and played a key role in transforming Korea into a major information technology hub. As a state-owned firm, KT had the clout to influence changes to itself and Korean telecommunications industry as a whole; selling its wireless affiliate in 1994, founding another in 1996 and becoming, along with Dacom, one of Korea's earliest ISPs. In 2001 KT acquired struggling broadband provider Thrunet, then the largest broadband company in Korea, which paved the way for KT to dominate the broadband market.[5] In 2009, KT merged with its wireless subsidiary KTF, paving the way to the integration of landline and cellular services. Ever since KT introduced the Apple iPhone to South Korea, it has been constantly seeking new business area, such as media, e-commerce, and global business partnerships. The company has a well-distributed shareholder structure under which the National Pension Service (NPS) is the largest shareholder (6.81% as of December 31, 2012), but NPS holds no managerial rights over the company.[6] Under the current shareholder structure, no controlling shareholder exists.

KT Corporation (Hangul: 케이티 주식회사), formerly Korea Telecom, is South Korea's largest telephone company.
The state-owned firm is South Korea's first telephone company and as such it dominates the local landline and broadband Internet market, serving about 90 percent of the country's fixed-line subscribers and 45 percent of high-speed Internet users. After selling its wireless affiliate Korea Mobile Telecom in 1994, KT returned to the wireless market with the creation of PCS carrier KTF in 1996.
The company's 2009 merger with KTF, its wireless subsidiary, made it the country's ninth largest chaebol (conglomerate) with nearly 24 trillion won ($20 billion) in assets.[2]
In January 2011, KT launched unified brand "Olleh" for both fixed-line and cellular broadband services.[3]
In late 2015 former KT president Suk-Jae Lee was charged of breach of trust and embezzlement, allegations which he denies.[4]

Company overview[edit]
Founded in 1981 as a public utility, KT actively led Korea's transition to the information era and played a key role in transforming Korea into a major information technology hub. As a state-owned firm, KT had the clout to influence changes to itself and Korean telecommunications industry as a whole; selling its wireless affiliate in 1994, founding another in 1996 and becoming, along with Dacom, one of Korea's earliest ISPs. In 2001 KT acquired struggling broadband provider Thrunet, then the largest broadband company in Korea, which paved the way for KT to dominate the broadband market.[5] In 2009, KT merged with its wireless subsidiary KTF, paving the way to the integration of landline and cellular services. Ever since KT introduced the Apple iPhone to South Korea, it has been constantly seeking new business area, such as media, e-commerce, and global business partnerships. The company has a well-distributed shareholder structure under which the National Pension Service (NPS) is the largest shareholder (6.81% as of December 31, 2012), but NPS holds no managerial rights over the company.[6] Under the current shareholder structure, no controlling shareholder exists.

KT Corporation (Hangul: 케이티 주식회사), formerly Korea Telecom, is South Korea's largest telephone company.
The state-owned firm is South Korea's first telephone company and as such it dominates the local landline and broadband Internet market, serving about 90 percent of the country's fixed-line subscribers and 45 percent of high-speed Internet users. After selling its wireless affiliate Korea Mobile Telecom in 1994, KT returned to the wireless market with the creation of PCS carrier KTF in 1996.
The company's 2009 merger with KTF, its wireless subsidiary, made it the country's ninth largest chaebol (conglomerate) with nearly 24 trillion won ($20 billion) in assets.[2]
In January 2011, KT launched unified brand "Olleh" for both fixed-line and cellular broadband services.[3]
In late 2015 former KT president Suk-Jae Lee was charged of breach of trust and embezzlement, allegations which he denies.[4]

Company overview[edit]
Founded in 1981 as a public utility, KT actively led Korea's transition to the information era and played a key role in transforming Korea into a major information technology hub. As a state-owned firm, KT had the clout to influence changes to itself and Korean telecommunications industry as a whole; selling its wireless affiliate in 1994, founding another in 1996 and becoming, along with Dacom, one of Korea's earliest ISPs. In 2001 KT acquired struggling broadband provider Thrunet, then the largest broadband company in Korea, which paved the way for KT to dominate the broadband market.[5] In 2009, KT merged with its wireless subsidiary KTF, paving the way to the integration of landline and cellular services. Ever since KT introduced the Apple iPhone to South Korea, it has been constantly seeking new business area, such as media, e-commerce, and global business partnerships. The company has a well-distributed shareholder structure under which the National Pension Service (NPS) is the largest shareholder (6.81% as of December 31, 2012), but NPS holds no managerial rights over the company.[6] Under the current shareholder structure, no controlling shareholder exists.

kt, leading the development of the information and communications industries of Korea since its foundation in 1981.


Quadrupling the number of fixed lines in 12 years.Expanding 4.5 million fixed lines to 20 million in just 12 years, kt introduced universal telephone service to every citizen of Korea, leading the development and advancement of communications services. More recently, kt established an advanced broadband network for the first time in Asia, and launched Korea's first communication satellite 'Mugunghwa (Sharon's Rose)', contributing to making Korea one of the most advanced countries in information and communications.
More than just fixed lines, into the wireless internet business.As becoming a government-funded corporation in 1997, kt changed its business portfolio by focusing more on wireless and internet services instead of fixed lines. Taking over Hansol M.com and merging with its subsidiary KTF, kt expanded its business scope and included mobile communication as its main service. kt became a privately owned company in 2002 and began concentrating on building broadband network. As a result, the company set several new records including the increase of ADSL subscribers to 6 million in just 3 years and played a leading role in the age of digital networking.
A growing corporation, prepared for the age of convergencekt will continue to make efforts to play a leading role in the global market and become a trustworthy company by fulfilling corporate responsibility and ensuring quality service and technology in the age of convergence where voice and data, fixed and mobile, and communications and broadcasting services are converged.
Global ktMeanwhile, kt also became a global corporation by tapping into overseas markets. In particular, kt’s mobile subsidiary NTC enlisted more than one million subscribers in 2007 in Primorsky Krai, Russia and was selected as the best corporate in social contribution in the Russian province. In 2009, kt merged with KTF to keep pace with the global trends of fixed/mobile convergence and entered the new era of convergence, following those of CDMA and ADSL.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Quadrupling the number of fixed lines in 12 years.
Expanding 4.5 million fixed lines to 20 million in just 12 years, kt introduced universal telephone service to every citizen of Korea, leading the development and advancement of communications services. More recently, kt established an advanced broadband network for the first time in Asia, and launched Korea’s first communication satellite ‘Mugunghwa (Sharon’s Rose)’, contributing to making Korea one of the most advanced countries in information and communications.
More than just fixed lines, into the wireless internet business.
As becoming a government-funded corporation in 1997, kt changed its business portfolio by focusing more on wireless and internet services instead of fixed lines. Taking over Hansol M.com and merging with its subsidiary KTF, kt expanded its business scope and included mobile communication as its main service. kt became a privately owned company in 2002 and began concentrating on building broadband network. As a result, the company set several new records including the increase of ADSL subscribers to 6 million in just 3 years and played a leading role in the age of digital networking.
A growing corporation, prepared for the age of convergence
kt will continue to make efforts to play a leading role in the global market and become a trustworthy company by fulfilling corporate responsibility and ensuring quality service and technology in the age of convergence where voice and data, fixed and mobile, and communications and broadcasting services are converged.
Global kt
Meanwhile, kt also became a global corporation by tapping into overseas markets. In particular, kt’s mobile subsidiary NTC enlisted more than one million subscribers in 2007 in Primorsky Krai, Russia and was selected as the best corporate in social contribution in the Russian province. In 2009, kt merged with KTF to keep pace with the global trends of fixed/mobile convergence and entered the new era of convergence, following those of CDMA and ADSL

KT Corporation implements data lake and accelerates mobile app market share
Dell EMC storage and data lake strategy enables KT Corporation to gain market share with its mobile navigation application and derive greater value from big data 












Customer
KT Corporation



Industry
Telecommunications      



Offerings
Dell EMC Isilon S-series scale-out storage, Dell EMC VMAX 10K and Dell EMC VNX 5400 unified storage



Key Challenges
Improve application performance to gain market share, support expected growth in users, expand services based on real-time data analysis



Outcomes
Delivers foundations for a data lake, accelerates big data analysis, scales for rapid surges in data




















Challenges
Deliver real-time data analysis
As Korea’s largest telco, KT Corporation dominates the local landline and broadband Internet market. KT Corporation recently launched its own smartphone navigation application—Olleh Navi—which recommends traffic routes to its customers based on real-time traffic information. KT Corporation wanted to gain market share in mobile navigation applications and improve user experience. 
It sought to achieve this through enhancing the Olleh Navi user experience, delivering the most efficient route information, and developing valuable navigation services based on real-time data analysis. With the number of navigation app users expected to double in 2016, KT Corporation wanted a highly scalable infrastructure that could exploit this growth and gain greater value from the data. To accomplish this, the telco wanted to migrate to a storage solution that could enable accurate and rapid analysis of big data for real-time traffic, and scale to meet surges in data growth.



































Our Approach
Accelerate application performance with Data Lake strategy
Dell EMC Account Manager, JeongYoon Kim, Dell EMC Isilon sales manager, JongJun Son, Account Systems Engineer, SungYong Lee, and Senior Software Engineer, Miri Kim, collaborated with KT Corporation to demonstrate the business agility, scalability, and cost efficiencies of Dell EMC Isilon storage that is optimized for a data lake strategy and rapid processing of massive amounts of data. Dell EMC provided consultation around optimizing the Hadoop architecture and storage in line with Olleh Navi’s real-time data analysis requirements. 
KT Corporation chose Dell EMC VMAX 10K and Dell EMC VNX 5400 unified storage. The telco deployed, three Dell EMC Isilon S210 scale-out nodes providing 43.2 terabytes of capacity that are HDFS enabled.


















“In a traditional analytics environment, we would have to purchase and maintain large numbers of servers. With Dell EMC Isilon, we have the flexibility of separating compute and storage, we can increase storage respectively when required. This solution allows us to store large volumes of data with in-place analytics in a single repository which enables us to conduct analysis without data ETL processing.”
KT Corporation















Outcomes




Accelerating business growth through advanced data lake 
KT expects the number of Olleh Navi users to double within the year due to its advanced user experience and high-quality route data. KT is using big data to enhance its offerings and attract new users. Because Dell EMC Isilon eliminates the necessity for data movement between data storage and an analytics platform, it minimizes data extraction, transformation and loading, and accelerates data analysis time.





Improving user experience with optimized architecture
With its optimized architecture, KT Corporation’s Olleh Navi mobile navigation application delivers users with real time traffic conditions and provides the best route to a destination every 5 minutes, versus competitor apps that update every 15 minutes.





Reducing total cost of ownership by 34 percent
Through the cost-efficiencies of single volume storage for NAS and Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) through Dell EMC Isilon’s multi-protocol feature, the business can reduce its total cost of ownership (TCO) by 34 percent.
Dell EMC Isilon has native access to HDFS and this means the business no longer have to migrate their data to a separate data appliance. This enables KT Corporation to produce faster analytics results.
