(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10�K.  Overview  Simon Property Group, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for U.S. federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. Simon Property Group, L.P. is our majority-owned Delaware partnership subsidiary that owns all of our real estate properties and other assets. In this discussion, unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to "Simon" mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the "Operating Partnership" mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to "we," "us" and "our" mean collectively Simon, the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Simon and/or the Operating Partnership. According to the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, the Operating Partnership is required to pay all expenses of Simon.  We own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets(R), and The Mills(R). As of December 31, 2016, we owned or held an interest in 206 income�producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 108 malls, 67 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills, four lifestyle centers, and 13 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. In addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at 27 properties in the United States and we have one outlet and one other significant retail project under development. Internationally, as of December 31, 2016, we had ownership interests in nine Premium Outlets in Japan, three Premium Outlets in South Korea, two Premium Outlets in Canada, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in Malaysia. We also own an interest in six Designer Outlet properties in Europe and one Designer Outlet property in Canada, of which four properties are consolidated. Of the six properties in Europe, two are located in Italy and one each is located in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. We also have four international outlet properties under development. As of December 31, 2016, we owned a 20.3% equity stake in Klepierre SA, or Klepierre, a publicly traded, Paris�based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 16 countries in Europe.  We generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants, including:  � base minimum rents,  � overage and percentage rents based on tenants' sales volume, and  � recoverable expenditures such as property operating, real estate taxes, repair and maintenance, and advertising and promotional expenditures.  Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.  We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following:  � attracting and retaining high quality tenants and utilizing economies of scale to reduce operating expenses,  � expanding and re�tenanting existing highly productive locations at competitive rental rates,  � selectively acquiring or increasing our interests in high quality real estate assets or portfolios of assets,  � generating consumer traffic in our retail properties through marketing initiatives and strategic corporate alliances, and  � selling selective non�core assets.  We also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities:  � establishing our malls as leading market resource providers for retailers and other businesses and consumer�focused corporate alliances, including payment systems (such as handling fees relating to the sales of  Table of Contents  bank�issued prepaid cards), national marketing alliances, static and digital media initiatives, business development, sponsorship, and events,  � offering property operating services to our tenants and others, including waste handling and facility services, and the provision of energy services,  � selling or leasing land adjacent to our properties, commonly referred to as "outlots" or "outparcels," and  � generating interest income on cash deposits and investments in loans, including those made to related entities.  We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk�reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties.  We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.  To support our growth, we employ a three�fold capital strategy:  � provide the capital necessary to fund growth,  � maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and  � manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.  We consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable property NOI (NOI for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.  Results Overview  Diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit decreased $0.01 during 2016 to $5.87 as compared to $5.88 in 2015. The decrease in diluted earnings per share and diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to:  � a 2015 gain on acquisitions and disposals of $250.5 million, or $0.69 per diluted share/unit, related to a non-cash gain on Klepierre's acquisition of Corio N.V., or Corio, of $206.9 million, or $0.57 per diluted share/unit, and gains of $43.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted share/unit, due to the disposition of our interests in three unconsolidated properties,  � a 2015 gain of $80.2 million, or $0.22 per diluted share/unit, from the sale of marketable securities,  � an increase in charges on early extinguishment of debt of $15.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted share/unit,  � decreased consolidated lease settlement activity in 2016 of $25.0 million, or $0.07 per diluted share/unit, and  � a 2016 charge on the write-off of pre-development costs of $31.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share/unit, partially offset by  � improved operating performance and core business fundamentals in 2016 and the impact of our acquisition and expansion activity,  � a 2016 gain on acquisitions and disposals of $84.6 million, or $0.23 per diluted share/unit, related to a non-cash gain on the consolidation of additional properties of $41.4 million, or $0.11 per diluted share/unit, a gain on the disposition of our interest in seven properties of $35.1 million, or $0.10 per diluted share/unit, and a gain related to Klepierre's sale of certain assets of which our share of the gain was $8.1 million, or $0.02 per diluted share/unit,  � a 2016 gain related to the disposition of our interest in two multi-family residential investments of $29.0 million, net of taxes, or $0.08 per diluted share/unit, and  � decreased interest expense in 2016 of $66.1 million, or $0.18 per diluted share/unit.  Table of Contents  Core business fundamentals improved during 2016, primarily driven by increased leasing activity. Portfolio NOI grew by 6.7% in 2016 as compared to 2015. Comparable property NOI grew 3.6% for our portfolio of U.S. Malls, Premium Outlets, and The Mills. Total sales per square foot, or psf, were relatively flat at $614 psf at December 31, 2016 compared to $620 psf at December 31, 2015, for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets. Average base minimum rent for U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 5.4% to $51.59 psf as of December 31, 2016, from $48.96 psf as of December 31, 2015. Leasing spreads in our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets were favorable as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents, resulting in an open/close leasing spread (based on total tenant payments - base minimum rent plus common area maintenance) of $7.82 psf ($69.20 openings compared to $61.38 closings) as of December 31, 2016, representing a 12.7% increase. Ending occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets was near historically peak levels at 96.8% as of December 31, 2016, as compared to 96.1% as of December 31, 2015, an increase of 70 basis points, primarily due to the effect of vacancies created as a result of tenant bankruptcies during 2015.  Our effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2016 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 49 basis points to 3.39% as compared to 3.88% at December 31, 2015. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 66 basis points (3.46% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 4.12% at December 31, 2015) partially offset by an increase in the effective overall borrowing rate on variable rate debt of 26 basis points (1.76% at December 31, 2016 as compared to 1.50% at December 31, 2015). At December 31, 2016, the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 7.4 years as compared to 5.9 years at December 31, 2015.  Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 included:  � Decreasing our USD denominated borrowings by $815.0 million on the Operating Partnership's $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, or Credit Facility.  � Repaying our Euro denominated borrowings of $246.1 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) on the Operating Partnership's $3.5 billion supplemental unsecured revolving credit facility, or Supplemental Facility, and together with the Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities.  � Increasing our USD denominated borrowings by $125.0 million on the Supplemental Facility.  � Increasing our borrowings under the Operating Partnership's global unsecured commercial paper note program, or the Commercial Paper program, by $183.8 million through the issuance of U.S. dollar denominated notes.  � Decreasing our Euro denominated borrowings of $103.6 million (U.S. dollar equivalent) under the Commercial Paper program.  � Issuing, on January 13, 2016, $550.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed annual interest rate of 2.50% with a maturity date of July 15, 2021 and $800.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed annual interest rate of 3.30% with a maturity date of January 15, 2026.  � Issuing, on May 13, 2016, ?500 million ($566.7 million U.S. dollar equivalent as of the issuance date) of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 1.25% with a maturity date of May 13, 2025.  � Issuing, on November 23, 2016, $550.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 2.35% with a maturity date of January 30, 2022, $750.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 3.25% with a maturity date of November 30, 2026 and $550.0 million of senior unsecured notes at a fixed interest rate of 4.25% with a maturity date of November 30, 2046.  � Redeeming at par $1.2 billion of senior unsecured notes with fixed interest rates ranging from of 2.80% to 6.10% and repaying a $240.0 million unsecured term loan.  � Completing the early redemption of a series of senior unsecured notes comprising $650.0 million with a fixed interest rate of 10.35%. We recorded a $136.8 million loss on extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the early redemption.  � Unencumbering six properties by repaying $638.9 million in mortgage loans with a weighted average interest rate of 7.03%.  United States Portfolio Data  The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy, average base minimum rent per square foot, and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets. We include acquired  Table of Contents  properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. The Washington Prime Group Inc., or Washington Prime, properties have been removed from the portfolio data for all periods presented. For comparative purposes, we separate the information related to The Mills from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any properties located outside the United States.  The following table sets forth these key operating statistics for:  � properties that are consolidated in our consolidated financial statements,  � properties we account for under the equity method of accounting as joint ventures, and  � the foregoing two categories of properties on a total portfolio basis.   %/Basis Points %/Basis Points 2016 Change (1) 2015 Change (1) 2014 U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets: Ending Occupancy Consolidated 97.1 % +70 bps 96.4 % -90 bps 97.3 % Unconsolidated 95.8 % +50 bps 95.3 % -110 bps 96.4 % Total Portfolio 96.8 % +70 bps 96.1 % -100 bps 97.1 % Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot Consolidated $ 49.94 5.4 % $ 47.39 4.5 % $ 45.34 Unconsolidated $ 56.19 4.8 % $ 53.64 3.4 % $ 51.89 Total Portfolio $ 51.59 5.4 % $ 48.96 4.1 % $ 47.01 Total Sales per Square Foot Consolidated $ 600 (1.2) % $ 607 0.7 % $ 603 Unconsolidated $ 660 (0.8) % $ 665 -2.1 % $ 679 Total Portfolio $ 614 (1.0) % $ 620 0.1 % $ 619 The Mills: Ending Occupancy 98.4 % -10 bps 98.5 % +10 bps 98.4 % Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot $ 29.07 7.1 % $ 27.14 6.7 % $ 25.43 Total Sales per Square Foot $ 565 (0.5) % $ 568 5.0 % $ 541  Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot. Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.  Total Sales per Square Foot. Total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12�month basis at owned GLA (for mall stores with less than 10,000 square feet) in the malls and The Mills and stores with less than 20,000 square feet in the Premium Outlets. Retail sales at owned GLA affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes, etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.  Current Leasing Activities  During 2016, we signed 960 new leases and 1,270 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment and leases with terms of one year or less) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. Malls  Table of Contents  and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 7.3 million square feet, of which 5.4 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During 2015, we signed 1,068 new leases and 1,217 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 7.3 million square feet, of which 5.6 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $59.45 per square foot in 2016 and $59.84 per square foot in 2015 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $39.29 per square foot and $30.42 per square foot, respectively.  Japan Data The following are selected key operating statistics for our Premium Outlets in Japan. The information used to prepare these statistics has been supplied by the managing venture partner. December 31, %/basis point December 31, %/basis point December 31, 2016 Change 2015 Change 2014 Ending Occupancy 99.5% -30 bps 99.8% 70 bps 99.1% Total Sales per Square Foot � 99,971 -1.60% � 101,574 7.00% � 94,933 Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot � 5,038 1.43% � 4,967 1.16% � 4,910  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  � We, as a lessor, retain substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the investment properties and account for our leases as operating leases. We accrue minimum rents on a straight�line basis over the terms of their respective leases. Substantially all of our retail tenants are also required to pay overage rents based on sales over a stated base amount during the lease year. We recognize overage rents only when each tenant's sales exceed its sales threshold.  � We review investment properties for impairment on a property�by�property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of investment properties may not be recoverable. These circumstances include, but are not limited to, a decline in a property's cash flows, occupancy or comparable sales per square foot. We measure any impairment of investment property when the estimated undiscounted operating income before depreciation and amortization plus its residual value is less than the carrying value of the property. To the extent impairment has occurred, we charge to income the excess of carrying value of the property over its estimated fair value. We may decide to sell properties that are held for use and the sale prices of these properties may differ from their carrying values. We also review our investments, including investments in unconsolidated entities, if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable. We will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the fair value of the investments below carrying value is other�than�temporary. Changes in economic and operating conditions that occur subsequent to our review of recoverability of investment property and other investments could impact the assumptions used in that assessment and could result in future charges to earnings if assumptions regarding those investments differ from actual results.  Table of Contents  � To maintain Simon's status as a REIT, we must distribute at least 90% of REIT taxable income in any given year and meet certain asset and income tests. We monitor our business and transactions that may potentially impact Simon's REIT status. In the unlikely event that we fail to maintain Simon's REIT status, and available relief provisions do not apply, we would be required to pay U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates during the period Simon did not qualify as a REIT. If Simon lost its REIT status, it could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless its failure was due to reasonable cause and certain other conditions were met. As a result, failing to maintain REIT status would result in a significant increase in the income tax expense recorded and paid during those periods.  � We make estimates as part of our valuation of the purchase price of acquisitions (including the components of excess investment in joint ventures) to the various components of the acquisition based upon the fair value of each component. The most significant components of our valuations are typically the determination of fair value to the buildings as�if�vacant, land and market value of in�place leases. In the case of the fair value of buildings and fair value of land and other intangibles, our estimates of the values of these components will affect the amount of depreciation we record over the estimated useful life of the property acquired or the remaining lease term. In the case of the market value of in�place leases, we make our best estimates of the tenants' ability to pay rents based upon the tenants' operating performance at the property, including the competitive position of the property in its market as well as sales psf, rents psf, and overall occupancy cost for the tenants in place at the acquisition date. Our assumptions affect the amount of future revenue that we will recognize over the remaining lease term for the acquired in�place leases.  � A variety of costs are incurred in the development and leasing of properties. After determination is made to capitalize a cost, it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited. Determination of when a development project is substantially complete and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment. The costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs. The capitalized costs include pre�construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. We consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy and cease capitalization of costs upon opening.  Results of Operations  In addition to the activity discussed above in the "Results Overview" section, the following acquisitions, openings, and dispositions of consolidated properties affected our consolidated results from continuing operations in the comparative periods:  � During 2016, we disposed of three retail properties.  � During the first quarter of 2016, we consolidated two Designer Outlet properties in Europe that had previously been accounted for under the equity method. During the third quarter of 2016, we consolidated two more Designer Outlet properties in Europe, which were previously accounted for under the equity method.  � On October 29, 2015, we opened Tampa Premium Outlets, a 441,000 square foot outlet center in Lutz (Tampa), Florida.  � On October 1, 2015, we opened Tucson Premium Outlets, a 366,000 square foot outlet center in Marana (Tucson), Arizona.  � On January 15, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in Jersey Gardens (renamed The Mills at Jersey Gardens) in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park Village in Fort Worth, Texas.  � On January 30, 2014, we acquired the remaining 50% interest in the previously unconsolidated Arizona Mills from our joint venture partner.  � On January 10, 2014, we acquired one of our partner's interests in a portfolio of ten properties, seven of which we had previously consolidated.  � During 2014, we disposed of three retail properties.  Table of Contents  In addition to the activities discussed above and in "Results Overview", the following acquisitions, dispositions, and openings of joint venture properties affected our income from unconsolidated entities in the comparative periods:  � During 2016, we disposed of four retail properties.  � On November 3, 2016, we and our partner opened a 500,000 square foot retail component of Brickell City Centre in Miami, Florida. We have a 25.0% noncontrolling interest in the retail component of this center.  � On October 27, 2016, we and our partner opened Clarksburg Premium Outlets, a 392,000 square foot outlet center in Clarksburg, Maryland. We have a 66.0% noncontrolling interest in this new center.  � On September 15, 2016, we were part of a consortium that completed the acquisition of Aeropostale, out of bankruptcy. Our noncontrolling interest in the retail operations venture and in the licensing venture is 49.05% and 28.45%, respectively.  � On June 24, 2016, we and our partner opened a 355,000 square foot outlet center in Columbus, Ohio. We have a 50% noncontrolling interest in this new center.  . . .  Feb 24, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Ladies and Gentlemen:                                                           

         Simon  DeBartolo  Group,  L.P.,  a Delaware  limited  partnership  (the
"Operating Partnership") proposes to issue and sell up to $750,000,000 aggregate
principal  amount of its unsecured,  unsubordinated  debt  securities (the "Debt
Securities") from time to time, in or pursuant to one or more offerings on terms
to be determined at the time of sale. The Debt  Securities will be issued in one
or more series under an indenture,  dated as of November 21, 1996, (the "Initial
Indenture"), between the Operating Partnership, the Guarantor (as defined below)
and a trustee  (a  "Trustee").  Each  series  of Debt  Securities  may vary,  as
applicable,  as to title,  aggregate  principal amount,  rank,  interest rate or
formula and timing of payments thereof,  stated maturity date, redemption and/or
repayment  provisions,  sinking fund  requirements  and any other variable terms
established  by or  pursuant  to the  Indenture,  as the same may be  amended or
supplemented from time to time (the "Indenture").  Simon Property Group, L.P., a
Delaware limited partnership and a subsidiary of the Operating  Partnership (the
"Guarantor" and, together with the Operating  Partnership,  the  "Partnerships")
will guarantee (the  "Guarantee")  the due and punctual payment of the principal
of,  premium,  if any,  interest on, and any other  amounts with respect to, the
Debt Securities, when and as the same shall become due and payable, whether at a
maturity date, on redemption,  by declaration of acceleration  or otherwise.  As
used  herein,  "Securities"  shall mean the Debt  Securities  together  with the
Guarantee.                                                                      

P-->EX-1.16th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�6th
         Whenever the  Partnerships  determine to make an offering of Securities
through Merrill Lynch & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce,  Fenner & Smith Incorporated
("Merrill  Lynch"),  or through  an  underwriting  syndicate  managed by Merrill
Lynch,  Merrill Lynch and the Partnerships will enter into an agreement (each, a
"Terms  Agreement")  providing  for  the  sale of such  Securities  to,  and the
purchase and offering thereof by, Merrill Lynch and such other underwriters,  if
any,  selected by Merrill  Lynch (the  "Underwriters",  which term shall include
Merrill  Lynch,  whether  acting  as  sole  Underwriter  or  as a  member  of an
underwriting  syndicate,  as well as any  Underwriter  substituted  pursuant  to
Section 10 hereof);  PROVIDED,  that, the  Partnerships  are not obligated,  and
shall have  complete and absolute  discretion  to determine if and when, to make
any offering, to make any offering through Merrill Lynch or any other person, or
to enter into any Terms Agreement.  The Terms Agreement relating to the offering
of Securities  shall specify the aggregate  principal amount of Securities to be
initially  issued  (the  "Initial  Underwritten  Securities"),  the name of each
Underwriter  participating in such offering (subject to substitution as provided
in Section 10 hereof),  the name of any  Underwriter  other than  Merrill  Lynch
acting as co-manager in connection with such offering,  the aggregate  principal
amount of Initial Underwritten  Securities which each such Underwriter severally
agrees to purchase,  whether such offering is on a fixed or variable price basis
and, if on a fixed price basis,  the initial  offering price, the price at which
the Initial Underwritten Securities are to be purchased by the Underwriters, the
form,  time, date and place of delivery and payment of the Initial  Underwritten
Securities  and any other material  variable  terms of the Initial  Underwritten
Securities,  as well as the material  variable  terms of any related  Underlying
Securities.  In addition,  if  applicable,  such Terms  Agreement  shall specify
whether the  Partnerships  have agreed to grant to the Underwriters an option to
purchase  additional  Securities  to  cover  over-allotments,  if  any,  and the
aggregate  principal  amount of  Securities  subject to such option (the "Option
Underwritten  Securities").  As used herein, the term "Underwritten  Securities"
shall include the Initial Underwritten  Securities and all or any portion of any
Option   Underwritten   Securities.   The  Terms   Agreement,   which  shall  be
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT A hereto,  may take the form of an exchange
of any standard form of written  telecommunication  between the Partnerships and
Merrill Lynch,  acting for itself and, if applicable,  as  representative of any
other  Underwriters.  Each offering of Underwritten  Securities  through Merrill
Lynch as sole  Underwriter  or  through  an  underwriting  syndicate  managed by
Merrill Lynch will be governed by this Underwriting  Agreement,  as supplemented
by the applicable Terms Agreement.                                              

         The Partnerships have filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  "Commission")  a  registration  statement on Form S-3 (No.  333-11491) and
pre-effective  amendment nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 thereto for the  registration of the
Securities  under the Securities  Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"),  and
the offering  thereof from time to time in accordance with Rule 415 of the rules
and   regulations  of  the  Commission   under  the  1933  Act  (the  "1933  Act
Regulations"),  and the Partnerships have filed such  post-effective  amendments
thereto  as may be  required  prior to the  execution  of the  applicable  Terms
Agreement.  Such registration  statement (as so amended, if applicable) has been
declared  effective by the  Commission and the Indenture has been duly qualified
under the Trust  Indenture  Act of 1939,  as  amended  (the  "1939  Act").  Such

"Transaction  Entities"),  the Company and the Guarantor  represent and warrant,
jointly and  severally,  to Merrill  Lynch,  as of the date hereof,  and to each
Underwriter named in the applicable Terms Agreement,  as of the date thereof, as
of the Closing Time (as defined  below) and, if  applicable,  as of each Date of
Delivery (as defined below) (in each case, a "Representation Date"), as follows:

(1)   COMPLIANCE   WITH   REGISTRATION    REQUIREMENTS.    The
         Partnerships  meet the  requirements for use of Form S-3 under the 1933
         Act.   Each  of  the   Registration   Statement  and  any  Rule  462(b)
         Registration  Statement has become  effective under the 1933 Act and no
         stop order suspending the  effectiveness of the Registration  Statement
         or any Rule 462(b)  Registration  Statement  has been issued  under the
         1933 Act and no  proceedings  for that purpose have been  instituted or
         are pending  or, to the  knowledge  of the  Transaction  Entities,  are
         contemplated by the Commission or the state securities authority of any
         jurisdiction,  and  any  request  on the  part  of the  Commission  for
         additional  information has been complied with. No order  preventing or
         suspending  the use of the Prospectus has been issued and no proceeding
         for that  purpose  has been  instituted  or,  to the  knowledge  of the
         Transaction  Entities,  threatened  by  the  Commission  or  the  state
         securities  authority of any jurisdiction.  In addition,  the Indenture
has been duly qualified under the 1939 Act.

         and the  Guarantor  with the  Commission  (the  "Form  10-Ks"))  became
         effective and at each Representation Date, the Registration  Statement,
         any  Rule  462(b)   Registration   Statement  and  any  amendments  and
         supplements  thereto complied and will comply in all material  respects
         with the  requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act Regulations and
         the 1939 Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission  under the

         an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
         required  to be stated  therein  or  necessary  to make the  statements
         therein  not  misleading.  At the  date of the  Prospectus  and at each
         Representation  Date, the Prospectus and any amendments and supplements
         thereto did not and will not include an untrue  statement of a material
         fact or omit to state a material  fact  necessary  in order to make the
         statements  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
         were made, not misleading.  If the Partnerships elect to rely upon Rule
         434 of the 1933 Act Regulations,  the Partnerships will comply with the
         requirements   of  Rule  434.   Notwithstanding   the  foregoing,   the
         representations  and warranties in this  subsection  shall not apply to

         transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission pursuant to EDGAR,
except to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.             

         If a Rule 462(b)  Registration  Statement is required

         Partnerships have complied or will comply with the requirements of Rule

         Adverse  Effect.   Except  as  otherwise  stated  in  the  Registration
         Statement and the Prospectus, all of the issued and outstanding capital
         stock or other  equity  interests  of each  such  entity  has been duly

         free and  clear  of any  security  interest,  mortgage,  pledge,  lien,
         encumbrance,  claim or  equity  (collectively,  "Liens").  No shares of
         capital  stock or other equity  interests of such entities are reserved
         for any purpose,  and there are no outstanding  securities  convertible
         into or exchangeable for any capital stock or other equity interests of
         such  entities  and  no  outstanding  options,  rights  (preemptive  or
         otherwise)  or warrants to purchase or to subscribe  for shares of such
         capital  stock  or  any  other  securities of  such entities, except as

         arising by operation of law, under the charter or bylaws or such entity
        or under any agreement to which any Simon DeBartolo Entity is a party.

(10)  GOOD  STANDING  OF  PROPERTY  PARTNERSHIPS.  Each of the
         Property  Partnerships  is duly  organized  and  validly  existing as a
         limited or general  partnership,  as the case may be, in good  standing
         under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of formation. Each of the
         Property  Partnerships  has the  requisite  power and authority to own,
         lease and operate its properties,  and to conduct the business in which
         it is  engaged.  Each of the  partnership  agreements  of the  Property
         Partnerships  is in  full  force  and  effect.  Each  of  the  Property
         Partnerships  is duly qualified or registered as a foreign  partnership
         to transact  business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction  in
         which such qualification or registration is required, whether by reason
         of the  ownership  or leasing of property  or the conduct of  business,
         except  where the  failure to so qualify or  register  would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.                                      

(11)   CAPITALIZATION.    If   the   Prospectus   contains   a

         "Historical",   (except  for  subsequent  issuances  thereof,  if  any,
         contemplated  under this Underwriting  Agreement,  pursuant to employee
         benefit plans referred to in the Prospectus or pursuant to the exercise
         of convertible  securities or options  referred to in the  Prospectus).
         Such units of partners'  equity have been duly  authorized  and validly
         issued  by  the   Operating   Partnership   and  are  fully   paid  and
         non-assessable   and  have  been  offered  and  sold  or  exchanged  in
         compliance with all applicable  laws  (including,  without  limitation,
         federal and state securities laws), and none of such units of partners'
         equity were issued in violation of preemptive  or other similar  rights
         arising  by  operation  of  law,  under  the   certificate  of  limited
         partnership   and  the  OP  Partnership   Agreement  of  the  Operating
         Partnership  or under any agreement to which the Operating  Partnership
         or any of the other Simon  DeBartolo  Entities is a party or otherwise.

         reserved  for any  purpose  and  there  are no  outstanding  securities
         convertible  into or exchangeable  for any units of partners' equity of
         the Operating  Partnership  and except as granted in this  Underwriting
         Agreement and any Terms  Agreement,  there are no outstanding  options,
         rights  (preemptive  or  otherwise)  or  warrants  to  purchase  or  to
         subscribe for such units of partners' equity or any other securities of
the Operating Partnership.                                    

(12) AUTHORIZATION OF SPG, LP PARTNERS' EQUITY. All the issued
         and  outstanding  units of general,  limited and/or  preferred  partner
         interests  of SPG,  LP  ("SPG,  LP  partners'  equity")  have been duly
         authorized and are validly issued,  fully paid and  non-assessable  and
         have  been  offered  and  sold or  exchanged  in  compliance  with  all
         applicable  laws  (including,  without  limitation,  federal  and state
         securities laws). There are no outstanding  securities convertible into

         pursuant  to  the  Underwriting  Agreement  and  the  applicable  Terms
         Agreement  against payment of the consideration  therefor  specified in
         such  Terms  Agreement,  will  constitute  valid and  legally  binding,
         unsecured obligations of the Operating Partnership, enforceable against
         the Operating Partnership in accordance with their terms, except as the
         enforcement   thereof  may  be  limited  by   bankruptcy,   insolvency,
         reorganization,  moratorium  or  other  similar  laws  relating  to  or
         affecting   creditors'   rights  generally  or  by  general   equitable
         principles, and except further as enforcement thereof may be limited by
         (A)  requirements  that a claim  with  respect  to any Debt  Securities
         denominated  other  than in U.S.  dollars  (or a foreign  or  composite
         currency  judgment  in respect of such  claim) be  converted  into U.S.
         dollars at a rate of exchange  prevailing on a date determined pursuant
         to  applicable  law or (B)  governmental  authority to limit,  delay or

         registered   holder  thereof  is  entitled  to  the  benefits  of,  the
         applicable Indenture.  Such Underwritten  Securities rank and will rank
         on a party with all  unsecured  indebtedness  (other than  subordinated
         indebtedness)  of the Operating  Partnership  that is  outstanding on a
         Representation  Date or that may be incurred  thereafter  and senior to
         all subordinated  indebtedness  that is outstanding on a Representation
         Date or that may be incurred thereafter,  except that such Underwritten
         Securities will be effectively  subordinate to the prior claims of each
         secured  mortgage  lender  to any  specific  Portfolio  Property  which
         secures  such  lender's  mortgage  and any claims of creditors of Joint
Venture Properties.

         unsecured  obligations  of  the  Guarantor,   enforceable  against  the
         Guarantor in  accordance  with their terms,  except as the  enforcement
         thereof  may be  limited  by  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,
         moratorium or other  similar laws  relating to or affecting  creditors'
         rights generally or by general equitable principles, and except further
         as enforcement  thereof may be limited by (A) requirements that a claim
         with respect to any Guarantee  denominated  other than in U.S.  dollars

         Securities  and  the  related  Guarantee  being  sold  pursuant  to the
         applicable  Terms  Agreement,  the  Indenture has been, or prior to the
         issuance of the Debt  Securities and the related  Guarantee  thereunder
         will  have  been,  duly  authorized,  executed  and  delivered  by  the
         Partnerships and, upon such authorization, execution and delivery, will
         constitute a valid and legally binding  agreement of the  Partnerships,
         enforceable against the Partnerships, as applicable, in accordance with
         its  terms,  except  as  the  enforcement  thereof  may be  limited  by
         bankruptcy,  insolvency,  reorganization,  moratorium  or other similar

         or  instrument  to which  each  entity is a party or by which or any of
         them may be  bound,  or to which any of its  property  or assets or any
         Portfolio Property may be bound or subject  (collectively,  "Agreements
         and  Instruments"),  except for such  violations or defaults that would
         not result in a Material  Adverse Effect.  The execution,  delivery and
         performance  of  this  Underwriting  Agreement,  the  applicable  Terms
         Agreement,  the Indenture and any other agreement or instrument entered
         into  or  issued  or to be  entered  into  or  issued  by  any  of  the
         Transaction  Entities in connection with the transactions  contemplated
         hereby or thereby or in the  Registration  Statement and the Prospectus
         and the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein and in the

11

P-->EX-1.116th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�16th
         Registration  Statement and the Prospectus  (including the issuance and
         sale of the  Underwritten  Securities  and the use of the proceeds from
         the sale of the Underwritten  Securities as described under the caption
         "Use of Proceeds") and compliance by each of the  Transaction  Entities
         with its obligations hereunder and thereunder have been duly authorized
         by all necessary  corporate or partnership  action, as the case may be,
         and do not and will not,  whether  with or without the giving of notice
         or passage of time or both, conflict with or constitute a breach of, or
         default or Repayment  Event (as defined below) under,  or result in the
         creation or  imposition  of any lien,  charge or  encumbrance  upon any
         assets,  properties or operations of the Operating  Partnership  or any
         other Simon DeBartolo Entity or any Property  Partnership  pursuant to,
         any Agreements and  Instruments,  except for such conflicts,  breaches,
         defaults, Repayment Events or liens, charges or encumbrances that would
         not result in a Material Adverse Effect, nor will such action result in
         any violation of the provisions of the respective partnership agreement
         and  certificate  of limited  partnership  of the  Partnerships  or the
         organizational  documents  of any other Simon  DeBartolo  Entity or any
         applicable law, statute,  rule,  regulation,  judgment,  order, writ or

         or foreign,  having  jurisdiction over the Operating  Partnership,  any
         other Simon  DeBartolo  Entity or any  Property  Partnership  or any of
         their assets, properties or operations, except for such violations that
         would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  As used herein, a "Repayment

         debenture or other  evidence of  indebtedness  (or any person acting on
         such holder's  behalf) the right to require the repurchase,  redemption
         or repayment of all or a material  portion of such  indebtedness by the
         Operating Partnership, any other Simon DeBartolo Entity or any Property
Partnership.

         Transaction Entities, is imminent, and the Transaction Entities are not
         aware of any existing or imminent labor disturbance by the employees of
         any  of its or any  subsidiary's  principal  suppliers,  manufacturers,
         customers or contractors, which dispute or disturbance, in either case,
    may reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(20)  ABSENCE  OF  PROCEEDINGS.  There  is  no  action,  suit,
         proceeding,  inquiry  or  investigation  before  or  by  any  court  or
         governmental  agency or body,  domestic or foreign,  now pending, or to
         the  knowledge  of  the  Transaction  Entities  threatened  against  or
         affecting the Operating  Partnership,  any other Simon DeBartolo Entity
         thereof, or any Property  Partnership or any officer or director of the
         Operating  Partnership  which  is  required  to  be  disclosed  in  the
         Registration  Statement  and  the  Prospectus  (other  than  as  stated
         therein), or which might reasonably be expected to result in a Material
         Adverse Effect, or which might reasonably be expected to materially and
         adversely  affect the assets,  properties or operations  thereof or the
         consummation  of this  Underwriting  Agreement,  the  applicable  Terms
         Agreement or the Indenture or the transactions  contemplated  herein or
therein. The aggregate of all pending legal or governmental

         DeBartolo  Entity,  or any Property  Partnership is a party or of which
         any of their respective assets, properties or operations is the subject
         which  are  not  described  in  the  Registration   Statement  and  the
         Prospectus,  including  ordinary routine  litigation  incidental to the
         business,  could not  reasonably  be  expected  to result in a Material
Adverse Effect.                                               

(21) ACCURACY OF EXHIBITS. There are no contracts or documents
         which are required to be described in the Registration  Statement,  the
         Prospectus or the documents  incorporated by reference therein or to be
         filed as exhibits thereto which have not been so described and/or filed
         as required  and the  descriptions  thereof or  references  thereto are
         correct in all Material  respects and no Material defaults exist in the
         due  performance or observance of any Material  obligation,  agreement,
   covenant or condition contained in any such contract or document.

(22) REIT  QUALIFICATION.  At all times since  January 1, 1994
         the Company has been, and upon the sale of the applicable  Underwritten
         Securities,  the Company will continue to be, organized and operated in
         conformity with the  requirements  for  qualification  as a real estate
         investment  trust under the Internal  Revenue Code of 1986,  as amended
         (the "Code"),  and its proposed  method of operation  will enable it to
         continue  to  meet  the  requirements  for  taxation  as a real  estate
         investment  trust under the Code.  At all times since  January 1, 1994,
         DeBartolo had been  organized  and had operated in conformity  with the
         requirements for  qualification as a real estate investment trust under
the Code.                                                     

(23)   INVESTMENT   COMPANY   ACT.   Each  of  the   Operating
         Partnership,  the  other  Simon  DeBartolo  Entities  and the  Property
         Partnerships is not, and upon the issuance and sale of the Underwritten
         Securities  as  herein  contemplated  and  the  application  of the net
         proceeds  therefrom  as  described  in the  Prospectus  will not be, an
         "investment  company" within the meaning of the Investment  Company Act
of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").                         

(24)   INTELLECTUAL   PROPERTY.   To  the   knowledge  of  the
         Transaction  Entities,  none of the  Simon  DeBartolo  Entities  or the
         Property Partnerships is required to own, possess or obtain the consent
         of  any  holder  of any  trademarks,  service  marks,  trade  names  or
         copyrights  not now lawfully  owned,  possessed or licensed in order to
conduct the business now operated by such entity.             

(25)  ABSENCE  OF FURTHER  REQUIREMENTS.  No filing  with,  or
         authorization,   approval,   consent,  license,  order,   registration,
         qualification  or decree of,  any court or  governmental  authority  or
         agency or any other  entity or person is  necessary or required for the
         performance  by each of the  Transaction  Entities  of its  obligations
         under this  Underwriting  Agreement,  the applicable Terms Agreement or
         the Indenture or in connection with the transactions contemplated under
         this  Underwriting  Agreement,  such Terms  Agreement or the Indenture,
except such as have been already  obtained or as may          

13

P-->EX-1.118th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
         be required under state  securities laws or under the by-laws and rules
       of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD").

(26)  POSSESSION  OF  LICENSES  AND  PERMITS.   The  Operating
         Partnership  and the other Simon  DeBartolo  Entities and each Property
         Partnership  possess such permits,  licenses,  approvals,  consents and
         other authorizations (collectively,  "Governmental Licenses") issued by
      the appropriate federal, state, local or foreign regulatory agencies
         or bodies necessary to conduct the business now operated by them except
         for such Governmental Licenses, the failure to obtain would not, singly
         or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. The Operating
         Partnership  and the other Simon  DeBartolo  Entities and each Property
         Partnership are in compliance with the terms and conditions of all such
         Governmental Licenses, except where the failure so to comply would not,
         singly or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect. All of
         the  Governmental  Licenses  are  valid and in full  force and  effect,
         except  where  the  invalidity  of such  Governmental  Licenses  or the
         failure of such  Governmental  Licenses  to be in full force and effect
         would not result in a Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither the Operating
         Partnership  nor any of the  other  Simon  DeBartolo  Entities  nor any
         Property Partnership has received any notice of proceedings relating to
         the revocation or modification of any such Governmental Licenses which,
         singly or in the aggregate,  if the subject of an unfavorable decision,
ruling or finding, would result in a Material Adverse Effect.

         Partnership.  All  leases  and  subleases  under  which  the  Operating
         Partnership,   any  other  Simon  DeBartolo   Entity  or  any  Property
         Partnerships  hold properties are in full force and effect,  except for
         such  which  would not have a  Material  Adverse  Effect.  Neither  the
         Operating  Partnership,  the other  Simon  DeBartolo  Entities  nor the
         Property  Partnerships has received any notice of any Material claim of
         any sort that has been asserted by anyone  adverse to the rights of the

         Partnerships  or any tenant of any of the  Portfolio  Properties  is in
         default  under any of the ground leases (as lessee) or space leases (as
         lessor  or  lessee,  as the case  may be)  relating  to,  or any of the
         mortgages or other security  documents or other agreements  encumbering
         or otherwise recorded against,  the Portfolio  Properties,  and none of
         the Transaction  Entities knows of any event which, but for the passage
         of time or the giving of notice,  or both,  would  constitute a default
         under any of such  documents or  agreements,  in each case,  other than
         such defaults that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  No tenant
         under any of the leases,  pursuant to which the Company,  either of the
         Partnerships  or  any  Property  Partnership,  as  lessor,  leases  its
         Portfolio Property, has an option or right of first refusal to purchase

         limitation,  building and zoning codes,  laws and  regulations and laws
         relating  to  access  to the  Portfolio  Properties),  except  for such
         failures  to comply  that  would not in the  aggregate  have a Material
         Adverse Effect.  None of the Transaction  Entities has knowledge of any
         pending or threatened condemnation proceeding,  zoning change, or other
         proceeding  or action  that will in any manner  affect the size of, use
         of,  improvements  on,  construction  on or access  to,  the  Portfolio
         Properties,  except such  proceedings  or actions that would not have a
Material Adverse Effect.                                      

(29)  ENVIRONMENTAL  LAWS.  Except as otherwise  stated in the

         DeBartolo Entities nor any Property  Partnership is in violation of any
         federal,  state,  local or  foreign  statute,  law,  rule,  regulation,

         treatment,  storage,  disposal,  transport  or  handling  of  Hazardous
         Materials  (collectively,  "Environmental  Laws"),  (B)  the  Operating
         Partnership,  the  other  Simon  DeBartolo  Entities  and the  Property
         Partnerships have all permits,  authorizations  and approvals  required
         under any applicable Environmental Laws and are each in compliance with

         investigation or proceedings  relating to any Environmental Law against
         the Operating Partnership, any of the other Simon DeBartolo Entities or
         the Property  Partnerships and (D) there are no events or circumstances
         that might  reasonably  be  expected  to form the basis of an order for
         clean-up  or  remediation,  or an  action,  suit or  proceeding  by any

thereby on the date of such  certificate  and,  unless  subsequently  amended or

SECTION 2.        SALE AND DELIVERY TO UNDERWRITERS; CLOSING. 

(a)   UNDERWRITTEN   SECURITIES.   The  several   commitments   of  the
Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten  Securities pursuant to the applicable
Terms  Agreement  shall  be  deemed  to  have  been  made  on the  basis  of the
representations  and  warranties  herein  contained  and shall be subject to the
terms and conditions herein set forth.                                          

(b) OPTION UNDERWRITTEN SECURITIES.  In addition,  subject to the terms
and conditions set forth therein,  the Partnerships may grant, if so provided in
the applicable Terms Agreement, an option to the Underwriters, severally and not
jointly,  to  purchase  up to the  aggregate  principal  amount  of  the  Option
Underwritten  Securities  set forth  therein at a price per Option  Underwritten
Security equal to the price per Initial  Underwritten  Security,  less an amount
equal  to  any  interest  or  redemption   payments  payable  by  the  Operating
Partnership on the Initial Underwritten Securities but not payable on the Option
Underwritten Securities.  Such option, if granted, will expire 30 days after the
date of such Terms Agreement, and may be exercised in whole or in part from time
to time only for the  purpose of covering  over-allotments  which may be made in
connection  with the  offering  and  distribution  of the  Initial  Underwritten
Securities  upon notice by Merrill Lynch to the  Partnerships  setting forth the
aggregate  principal  amount of Option  Underwritten  Securities as to which the
several Underwriters are then exercising the option and the time, date and place
of payment and delivery for such Option Underwritten  Securities.  Any such time
and  date of  payment  and  delivery  (each,  a "Date  of  Delivery")  shall  be
determined  by Merrill  Lynch,  but shall not be later than seven full  business
days after the  exercise of said  option,  nor in any event prior to the Closing
Time, unless otherwise agreed upon by Merrill Lynch and the Partnerships. If the
option  is  exercised  as to all  or any  portion  of  the  Option  Underwritten
Securities,  each of the Underwriters,  severally and not jointly, will purchase
that proportion of the total aggregate  principal amount of Option  Underwritten
Securities then being purchased which the aggregate  principal amount of Initial
Underwritten  Securities each such  Underwriter has severally agreed to purchase
as set forth in such  Terms  Agreement  bears to the total  aggregate  principal
amount of  Initial  Underwritten  Securities,  subject  to such  adjustments  as
Merrill Lynch in its  discretion  shall make to eliminate any sales or purchases
of a fractional aggregate principal amount of Option Underwritten Securities.   

(c) PAYMENT.  Payment of the  purchase  price for, and delivery of, the
Initial  Underwritten  Securities shall be made at the office of Rogers & Wells,
or at such  other  place  as shall  be  agreed  upon by  Merrill  Lynch  and the
Partnerships,  at 10:00 A.M. (Eastern time) on the third (fourth, if the pricing
occurs after 4:30 P.M.  (Eastern  time) on any given day) business day after the
date of the applicable Terms Agreement  (unless postponed in accordance with the

17

P-->EX-1.122nd�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
provisions of Section 10 hereof), or such other time not later than ten business
days  after  such  date as  shall  be  agreed  upon  by  Merrill  Lynch  and the
Partnerships  (such time and date of payment and delivery  being  herein  called
"Closing Time"). In addition,  in the event that the Underwriters have exercised
their  option,  if  any,  to  purchase  any or all  of the  Option  Underwritten
Securities,  payment of the  purchase  price for,  and  delivery  of such Option
Underwritten Securities,  shall be made at the above-mentioned offices of Rogers
& Wells, or at such other place as shall be agreed upon by Merrill Lynch and the
Operating  Partnership,  on the  relevant  Date of Delivery as  specified in the
notice from Merrill Lynch to the Partnerships.                                  

                  Payment  shall be made to the  Operating  Partnership  by wire
transfer of same day funds  payable to the order of the  Operating  Partnership,
against   delivery  to  Merrill  Lynch  for  the  respective   accounts  of  the
Underwriters  of the  Underwritten  Securities  to be purchased  by them.  It is
understood that each Underwriter has authorized  Merrill Lynch, for its account,
to accept  delivery of, receipt for, and make payment of the purchase price for,
the Underwritten  Securities which it has severally agreed to purchase.  Merrill
Lynch,  individually and not as  representative  of the  Underwriters,  may (but
shall  not  be  obligated  to)  make  payment  of the  purchase  price  for  the
Underwritten  Securities to be purchased by any Underwriter  whose check has not
been received by the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery,  as the case
may be, but such payment shall not relieve such Underwriter from its obligations
hereunder.                                                                      

(d) DENOMINATIONS;  REGISTRATION.  The Underwritten Securities shall be
in such  denominations and registered in such names as Merrill Lynch may request
in  writing  at least one full  business  day prior to the  Closing  Time or the
relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be. The Underwritten  Securities will
be made available for  examination and packaging by Merrill Lynch in The City of
New York not later than 10:00 A.M.  (Eastern  time) on the business day prior to
the Closing Time or the relevant Date of Delivery, as the case may be.          

SECTION 3.        COVENANTS OF THE TRANSACTION ENTITIES. 

         Each of the Transaction  Entities covenants with Merrill Lynch and with
each Underwriter  participating in the offering of Underwritten  Securities,  as
follows:                                                                        

(a) COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES REGULATIONS AND COMMISSION REQUESTS. The
Partnerships, subject to Section 3(b), will comply with the requirements of Rule

confirm the notice in writing,  of (i) the  effectiveness of any  post-effective
amendment  to the  Registration  Statement  or the filing of any  supplement  or
amendment  to the  Prospectus,  (ii)  the  receipt  of  any  comments  from  the
Commission,  (iii)  any  request  by the  Commission  for any  amendment  to the
Registration  Statement or any amendment or supplement to the  Prospectus or for
additional  information,  and (iv) the  issuance by the  Commission  of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any order
preventing  or  suspending  the  use of any  preliminary  prospectus,  or of the
suspension of the  qualification of the Underwritten  Securities for offering or

Partnerships will promptly effect the filings necessary pursuant to Rule 424 and

Prospectus  transmitted for filing under Rule 424 was received for filing by the
Commission  and,  in the  event  that it was  not,  it will  promptly  file  the
Prospectus.  The Partnerships  will make every reasonable  effort to prevent the
issuance  of any stop  order and,  if any stop  order is  issued,  to obtain the
lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.                                

(b) FILING OF  AMENDMENTS.  The  Partnerships  will give Merrill  Lynch
notice of its  intention to file or prepare any  amendment  to the  Registration
Statement  (including any filing under Rule 462(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations),
any Term Sheet or any amendment, supplement or revision to either the prospectus
included in the Registration Statement at the time it became effective or to the
Prospectus,  whether  pursuant to the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act or otherwise,  will
furnish  Merrill Lynch with copies of any such documents a reasonable  amount of
time prior to such proposed filing or use, as the case may be, and will not file
or use any such document to which Merrill Lynch or counsel for the  Underwriters
shall reasonably object.

(d) DELIVERY OF  PROSPECTUSES.  The  Partnerships  will deliver to each
Underwriter,  without charge,  as many copies of each preliminary  prospectus as
such Underwriter may reasonably request,  and the Partnerships hereby consent to

Prospectus is required to be delivered  under the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act, such
number of copies of the Prospectus as such  Underwriter may reasonably  request.
If  applicable,  the  Prospectus  and  any  amendments  or  supplements  thereto
furnished  to  the  Underwriters   will  be  identical  to  the   electronically
transmitted copies thereof filed with the Commission  pursuant to EDGAR,  except
to the extent permitted by Regulation S-T.                                      

(e) CONTINUED  COMPLIANCE WITH SECURITIES LAWS. The  Partnerships  will
comply with the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act  Regulations  and the 1934 Act and the
1934 Act  Regulations so as to permit the completion of the  distribution of the
Underwritten  Securities as contemplated in this Underwriting  Agreement and the
applicable Terms Agreement and in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

19

P-->EX-1.124th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Securities,  any event shall
occur or  condition  shall  exist as a result of which it is  necessary,  in the
opinion of counsel for the  Underwriter  or for the  Partnerships,  to amend the
Registration Statement in order that the Registration Statement will not contain
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein not misleading
or to amend or supplement the  Prospectus in order that the Prospectus  will not
include an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of
the circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser,  or if it
shall be necessary,  in the opinion of such  counsel,  at any such time to amend
the  Registration  Statement or amend or supplement  the  Prospectus in order to
comply with the  requirements of the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act  Regulations,  the
Partnerships  will  promptly  prepare and file with the  Commission,  subject to
Section 3(b),  such  amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such
statement or omission or to make the  Registration  Statement or the  Prospectus
comply  with  such  requirements,  and  the  Partnerships  will  furnish  to the
Underwriters and counsel for the  Underwriters,  without charge,  such number of
copies of such  amendment  or  supplement  as the  Underwriters  may  reasonably

(f) BLUE SKY  QUALIFICATIONS.  The  Partnerships  will use  their  best
efforts,  in  cooperation  with the  Underwriters,  to qualify the  Underwritten
Securities and any related Underlying Securities for offering and sale under the
applicable  securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions  (domestic or
foreign) as Merrill Lynch may designate and to maintain such  qualifications  in
effect  for a period of not less  than one year from the date of the  applicable
Terms Agreement;  provided, however, that neither Partnership shall be obligated
to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify or register as a
foreign partnership or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in which it
is not so qualified or registered, or provide any undertaking or make any change
in its  charter or bylaws  that the Board of  Directors  of SD  Property  or the
Company,  as  applicable,  reasonably  determines  to be  contrary  to the  best
interests of the Partnerships, respectively, and their respective unitholders or
to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing  business in any  jurisdiction
in which it is not  otherwise  so  subject.  In each  jurisdiction  in which the
Underwritten  Securities  or any  related  Underlying  Securities  have  been so
qualified or registered,  the Partnerships will file such statements and reports
as  may  be  required  by  the  laws  of  such  jurisdiction  to  continue  such
qualification  in effect for a period of not less than one year from the date of
such Terms Agreement.                                                           

(g) EARNINGS STATEMENT.  The Partnerships will timely file such reports

preliminary  prospectus  or the  Prospectus  (or  any  amendment  or  supplement
thereto).                                                                       

(c) ACTIONS AGAINST PARTIES; NOTIFICATION. Each indemnified party shall
give notice as promptly as reasonably  practicable to each indemnifying party of
any action  commenced  against it in  respect of which  indemnity  may be sought
hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve such
indemnifying  party  from  any  liability  hereunder  to  the  extent  it is not
materially  prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it
from any liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this indemnity
agreement.  In the case of parties  indemnified  pursuant to Section 6(a) above,
counsel to the indemnified  parties shall be selected by Merrill Lynch,  and, in
the case of parties indemnified  pursuant to Section 6(b) above,  counsel to the
indemnified  parties  shall  be  selected  by  the  Operating  Partnership.   An
indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of any such
action;  provided,  however,  that counsel to the  indemnifying  party shall not
(except  with the  consent  of the  indemnified  party)  also be  counsel to the
indemnified party. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for fees
and expenses of more than one counsel (in addition any local  counsel)  separate
from their own counsel for all  indemnified  parties in connection  with any one
action or  separate  but  similar  or related  actions in the same  jurisdiction
arising out of the same general  allegations or  circumstances.  No indemnifying
party  shall,  without the prior  written  consent of the  indemnified  parties,
settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
litigation,  or any  investigation or proceeding by any  governmental  agency or
body,  commenced  or  threatened,  or any claim  whatsoever  in respect of which
indemnification  or contribution could be sought under this Section 6 or Section
7 hereof (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties
thereto),  unless  such  settlement,  compromise  or  consent  (i)  includes  an
unconditional  release of each indemnified  party from all liability arising out
of such litigation,                                                             

27

investigation,  proceeding  or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to
or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any
indemnified party.                                                              

(d) SETTLEMENT WITHOUT CONSENT IF FAILURE TO REIMBURSE.  If at any time
an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the
indemnified  party for fees and  expenses  of  counsel  in  accordance  with the
provisions  hereof,  such indemnifying  party agrees that it shall be liable for
any settlement of the nature  contemplated by Section 6(a)(2)  effected  without
its written  consent if (i) such settlement is entered into in good faith by the
indemnified party more than 45 days after receipt by such indemnifying  party of
the aforesaid  request,  (ii) such indemnifying party shall have received notice
of the terms of such settlement at least 30                                     
days prior to such  settlement  being  entered into and (iii) such  indemnifying
party shall not have reimbursed such  indemnified  party in accordance with such
request prior to the date of such settlement.                                   

SECTION 7.        CONTRIBUTION. 

         If the  indemnification  provided  for in  Section  6 hereof is for any
reason  unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified  party in
respect of any losses,  liabilities,  claims,  damages or  expenses  referred to
therein,  then each indemnifying  party shall contribute to the aggregate amount
of such  losses,  liabilities,  claims,  damages and  expenses  incurred by such
indemnified  party,  as incurred,  (i) in such  proportion as is  appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Transaction  Entities,  on the one
hand,  and the  Underwriters,  on the  other  hand,  from  the  offering  of the
Underwritten  Securities  pursuant to the applicable  Terms Agreement or (ii) if
the  allocation  provided by clause (i) is not permitted by  applicable  law, in
such  proportion  as is  appropriate  to reflect not only the relative  benefits
referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative  fault of the  Transaction
Entities,  on the one  hand,  and of the  Underwriters,  on the other  hand,  in
connection  with the  statements  or  omissions  which  resulted in such losses,
liabilities,  claims,  damages  or  expenses,  as  well  as any  other  relevant
equitable considerations.                                                       

         The relative benefits received by the Transaction  Entities, on the one
hand, and the Underwriter, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of
the Underwritten  Securities pursuant to the applicable Terms Agreement shall be
deemed to be in the same  respective  proportions as the total net proceeds from
the  offering  of  such  Underwritten  Securities  (before  deducting  expenses)
received  by the  Operating  Partnership  and the  total  underwriting  discount
received  by the  Underwriters,  in each  case as set  forth on the cover of the
Prospectus,  or, if Rule 434 is used,  the  corresponding  location  on the Term
Sheet bear to the aggregate  initial public offering price of such  Underwritten
Securities as set forth on such cover.                                          

         The relative fault of the  Transaction  Entities,  on the one hand, and
the Underwriters,  on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among
other things,  whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or the  omission  or  alleged  omission  to state a  material  fact  relates  to
information  supplied by the Transaction Entities or by the Underwriters and the
parties'  relative intent,  knowledge,  access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement or omission.                                  

28

P-->EX-1.133rd�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
         The Transaction  Entities and the Underwriters  agree that it would not
be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 7 were determined
by pro rata allocation  (even if the Underwriter  were treated as one entity for
such purpose) or by any other method of  allocation  which does not take account
of the  equitable  considerations  referred  to  above  in this  Section  7. The
aggregate amount of losses,  liabilities,  claims, damages and expenses incurred
by an indemnified  party and referred to above in this Section 7 shall be deemed
to include any legal or other expenses  reasonably  incurred by such indemnified
party in investigating,  preparing or defending  against any litigation,  or any
investigation  or proceeding by any  governmental  agency or body,  commenced or
threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission.                                      

         Notwithstanding  the provisions of this Section 7, no Underwriter shall
be required to contribute  any amount in excess of the amount by which the total
price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to
the public were  offered to the public  exceeds the amount of any damages  which
such  Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.                       

         No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of
Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.                        

         For purposes of this  Section 7, each  person,  if any, who controls an
Underwriter  within  the  meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section 20 of
the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and
each director of the General Partners,  each officer of the General Partners who
signed the  Registration  Statement,  and each person,  if any, who controls the
Transaction Entities within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act or Section
20 of the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Transaction
Entities.  The Underwriters'  respective  obligations to contribute  pursuant to
this Section 7 are several in  proportion  to the number or aggregate  principal
amount,  as the  case may be,  of  Initial  Underwritten  Securities  set  forth
opposite their respective names in the applicable Terms Agreement and not joint.

 SECTION 8.        REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS TO SURVIVE
DELIVERY. 

         All  representations,  warranties  and  agreements  contained  in  this
Underwriting  Agreement or the applicable  Terms Agreement or in certificates of
officers  of the  Partnerships  or  authorized  representatives  of  each of the
Transaction Entities submitted pursuant hereto or thereto shall remain operative
and in full force and  effect,  regardless  or any  investigation  made by or on
behalf  of any  Underwriter  or  controlling  person,  or by or on behalf of the
Transaction  Entities,  and  shall  survive  delivery  of and  payment  for  the
Underwritten Securities.                                                        

SECTION 9.        TERMINATION. 

29

P-->EX-1.134th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
 (a) UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT.  This Underwriting Agreement (excluding the
applicable  Terms Agreement) may be terminated for any reason at any time by the
Partnerships  or by  Merrill  Lynch upon the  giving of 30 days'  prior  written
notice of such termination to the other party hereto.                           

(b) TERMS  AGREEMENT.  Merrill Lynch may terminate the applicable Terms
Agreement, by notice to the Partnerships, at any time at or prior to the Closing
Time or any relevant Date of Delivery,  if (i) there has been, since the time of
execution  of such Terms  Agreement  or since the  respective  dates as of which
information  is given in the  Prospectus,  any  material  adverse  change in the
condition,  financial or  otherwise,  or in the  earnings,  business  affairs or
business  prospects of the Operating  Partnership  and the other Simon DeBartolo
Entities  considered as one  enterprise,  whether or not arising in the ordinary
course of business,  or (ii) there has occurred any material  adverse  change in
the financial markets in the United States or internationally or any outbreak of
hostilities or escalation  thereof or other calamity or crisis, or any change or
development   involving  a  prospective  change  in  national  or  international
political,  financial, or economic conditions,  in each case the effect of which
is such as to make it, in the judgment of Merrill Lynch, impracticable to market
the  Underwritten  Securities  or to  enforce  contracts  for  the  sale  of the
Underwritten  Securities,  or (iii) trading in any securities of the Company has
been suspended or limited by the Commission or the New York Stock  Exchange,  or
if  trading  generally  on the New York Stock  Exchange  or the  American  Stock
Exchange or in the  over-the-counter  market has been  suspended or limited,  or
minimum or maximum  prices for trading  have been fixed,  or maximum  ranges for
prices have been  required,  by either of said exchanges or by such system or by
order of the Commission,  the NASD or any other governmental  authority,  (iv) a
banking  moratorium has been declared by either Federal,  New York,  Delaware or
Maryland authorities or (v) if the rating assigned by any nationally  recognized
statistical  rating  organization  to  any  Debt  Securities  of  the  Operating
Partnership as of the date of the  applicable  Terms  Agreement  shall have been
downgraded  since  such  date or if any  such  rating  organization  shall  have
publicly  announced  that it has  placed any  series of Debt  Securities  of the
Operating  Partnership  under  surveillance  or review,  with possible  negative
implications,  as to the rating of such Debt Securities or any of the Company's,
SPG, LP's or the Operating Partnership's other securities.                      

(c) LIABILITIES. If this Underwriting Agreement or the applicable Terms
Agreement is terminated  pursuant to this Section 9, such  termination  shall be
without  liability of any party to any other party except as provided in Section
4 hereof,  and provided further that Sections 1, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 13 hereof shall
survive such termination and remain in full force and effect.                   

SECTION 10.       DEFAULT BY ONE OR MORE OF THE UNDERWRITERS. 

         If one or more of the  Underwriters  shall fail at the Closing  Time or
the relevant Date of Delivery,  as the case may be, to purchase the Underwritten
Securities which it or they are obligated to purchase under the applicable Terms
Agreement (the "Defaulted Securities"), then Merrill Lynch shall have the right,
within  24  hours  thereafter,  to  make  arrangements  for  one or  more of the
non-defaulting Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not
less than all, of the Defaulted Securities in such amounts as may be agreed upon
and upon the terms

herein set forth;  if,  however,  Merrill  Lynch shall not have  completed  such
arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:                                  

                  (a) if the aggregate principal amount, of Defaulted Securities
         does not exceed 10% of the aggregate  principal  amount of Underwritten
         Securities  to be  purchased  on  such  date  pursuant  to  such  Terms
         Agreement,   the  non-defaulting   Underwriters  named  in  such  Terms
         Agreement  shall be obligated,  severally and not jointly,  to purchase
         the full  amount  thereof  in the  proportions  that  their  respective
         underwriting  obligations  under  such  Terms  Agreement  bear  to  the
 underwriting obligations of all non-defaulting Underwriters, or

                  (b) if the aggregate principal amount of Defaulted  Securities
         exceeds  10%  of  the  aggregate   principal   amount  of  Underwritten
         Securities  to be  purchased  on  such  date  pursuant  to  such  Terms
         Agreement,  such Terms Agreement (or, with respect to the Underwriters'
         exercise of any  applicable  over-allotment  option for the purchase of
         Option Underwritten  Securities on a Date of Delivery after the Closing
         Time,  the  obligations  of  the  Underwriters  to  purchase,  and  the
         Operating  Partnership to sell, such Option Underwritten  Securities on
         such Date of Delivery) shall terminate without liability on the part of
any non-defaulting Underwriter.                               

         No  action  taken  pursuant  to  this  Section  10  shall  relieve  any
defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.                

         In the  event of any  such  default  which  does  not  result  in (i) a
termination of the applicable  Terms  Agreement or (ii) in the case of a Date of
Delivery  after the  Closing  Time,  a  termination  of the  obligations  of the
Underwriters   and  the   Partnerships   with  respect  to  the  related  Option
Underwritten  Securities,  as the  case  may be,  either  Merrill  Lynch  or the
Partnerships  shall have the right to postpone  the Closing Time or the relevant
Date of Delivery,  as the case may be, for a period not exceeding  seven days in
order to effect  any  required  changes  in the  Registration  Statement  or the
Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements.

         (10)  Commencing with the Company's  taxable year beginning  January 1,
1994, the Company has been  organized in conformity  with the  requirements  for
qualification and taxation as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code.  

         At the Underwriters' request, Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,  Wharton & Garrison
shall also confirm to the Underwriters that it has been informed by the Staff of
the Commission that the  Registration  Statement is effective under the 1933 Act
and,  to  the  knowledge  of  such  counsel,   no  stop  order   suspending  the
effectiveness of the  Registration  Statement has been issued under the 1933 Act
or proceedings therefor initiated or threatened by the Commission.              

         In connection  with the preparation of the  Registration  Statement and
the Prospectus,  such counsel has  participated in conferences with officers and
other  representatives  of the Transaction  Entities and the independent  public
accountants  for the  Partnerships  and the Company at which the contents of the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus and related matters were discussed. On
the basis of such participation and review, but without independent verification
by such counsel of, and without assuming any  responsibility  for, the accuracy,
completeness  or  fairness  of the  statements  contained  in  the  Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or any amendments or supplements  thereto,  no facts
have come to the  attention of such counsel that would lead them to believe that
the Registration  Statement  (except for financial  statements and schedules and
other  financial  data included  therein and for the T-1, as to which we make no
statement),  at the  time  the  Registration  Statement  or  any  post-effective
amendment  thereto  became  effective  or at the  date of the  applicable  Terms
Agreement,  contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or  necessary  to make  the
statements  therein not  misleading  or that the  Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto (except for financial  statements and the schedules and other
financial  data  included  therein  and  for the  T-1,  as to  which  we make to
statement),  at the time the Prospectus was issued, at the time any such amended
or  supplemented  prospectus  was issued or at the Closing  Time,  contained  or
contains an untrue  statement of a material  fact or omitted or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.                   

         In  rendering  such  opinion,  such  counsel may rely (A) as to matters
involving the  application of the laws of Maryland and Ohio, upon the opinion of
Piper & Marbury  and Vorys,  Sater,  Seymour  and Pease,  respectively,  special
Maryland and Ohio counsel,  respectively,  to the  Transaction  Entities  (which
opinion shall be dated and furnished to Merrill Lynch at the Closing Time, shall
be satisfactory in form and substance to counsel for the  Underwriters and shall
expressly state that the counsel for the  Underwriters may rely on such opinions
as if it were addressed to them),  and (B), as to matters of fact (but not as to
legal  conclusions),  to  the  extent  they  deem  proper,  on  certificates  of
responsible  officers of the  Partnerships  and public  officials.  Such opinion
shall  not  state  that it is to be  governed  or  qualified  by,  or that it is
otherwise subject to, any treatise, written policy or other document relating to
legal opinions,  including,  without limitation, the Legal Opinion Accord of the
ABA Section of Business Law (1991).

is required for an accountant to give negative assurance on interim   
financial  information.  A review  in  accordance  with SAS No.  71 will only be
performed  at the request of the Company and the  accountant's  report,  if any,
related to that review will be  addressed  only to the Company.  Many  companies
have a SAS No. 71 review  performed in connection  with the preparation of their
10-Q financial statements. See CODIFICATION OF STATEMENTS ON AUDITING STANDARDS,
AU ss. 722 for a description of the procedures  thaT  constitute  such a review.
The comfort letter itself should recite that the review was performed and a copy
of the report,  if any,  should be attached  to the comfort  letter.  Any report
issued  pursuant to SAS No. 71 that is mentioned in the  Registration  Statement
should also be included in the Registration Statement as an exhibit. If a review
in  accordance  with  SAS No.  71 has  not  and  will  not be  performed  by the
accountants,  they should be prepared to perform certain agreed-upon  procedures
on the interim financial information and to report their findings thereon in the
comfort letter. See CODIFICATION OF STATEMENTS ON AUDITING STANDARDS, AU ss. 622
for  a  discussion  of  reports  related  to  the  accountant's  performance  of
agreed-upon  procedures.  Any question as to whether a review in accordance with
SAS No. 71 will be performed by the accountants should be resolved early.

         certain  income  statement  items,  including net sales,  total and per

         FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS AND SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA, and include in their
         report in the  Registration  Statement and the Prospectus the paragraph
         contemplated  by SAS No.  42.9.  This  situation  may arise only if the
         Selected  Financial  Data do not  include  interim  period data and the
         five-year selected data are derived entirely from financial  statements
         audited by the auditors  whose  report is included in the  Registration
         Statement and the Prospectus. If the guidelines set forth in SAS No. 42
         are   followed  and  the   accountant's   report  as  included  in  the
         Registration  Statement  and the  Prospectus  includes  the  additional
         language  prescribed  by SAS No. 42.9,  the  bracketed  language may be

History[edit]
Simon Property Group was formed in 1993[9] when the majority of the shopping center interests of Melvin Simon & Associates became a publicly traded company. Melvin Simon & Associates, owned by brothers Melvin Simon and Herbert Simon, was founded in 1960 in Indianapolis, Indiana, and had long been one of the top shopping center developers in the United States.
In 1996, Simon DeBartolo Group was created when Simon Property merged with former rival DeBartolo Realty Corp.[10] This was shortly after DeBartolo Realty became a publicly traded company encompassing the shopping mall interests of the Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. family, another leading developer. Simon DeBartolo rapidly acquired assets in the then-fragmented industry. Notable acquisitions included The Retail Property Trust and a group of properties held by IBM's pension plan in 1997 and Corporate Property Investors (CPI) in 1998. Following the CPI acquisition in 1998, the company announced it was reverting to its original name, Simon Property Group, as the DeBartolo family was resuming its private real-estate development operation, while retaining their interest in Simon.




Simon Property Group Headquarters, opened in 2007


Simon continued to be a prolific acquirer of shopping centers, including a portfolio from New England Development in 1999; several prime properties from Rodamco North America in 2002 (including Houston Galleria in Houston, Texas and SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina); several high-profile properties such as Dadeland Mall, Fashion Valley Mall, Copley Place, Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, and Stanford Shopping Center; and in 2004, Chelsea Premium Outlets (now simply named "Premium Outlets"). In 2003, Simon became a co-owner of The Kravco Company, which became Kravco Simon. On April 3, 2007, a partnership including Simon agreed to acquire the Mills Corporation.[11]
In June 2011, Simon Property Group entered into a partnership with Nintendo to provide complimentary 3DS Wi-Fi hotspots at nearly 200 of its malls.[12] The Wi-Fi only works for Nintendo 3DS systems. It will not work on PC, Mac, iOS or Android.

In December 2013, Simon announced it would form a REIT of its smaller malls and community shopping centers called Washington Prime Group (Initially to be named SpinCo). The spin-off was created in May 2014 and was headed by Mark Ordan who was the final CEO of the Simon-bought Mills Corporation. The regional malls in WPG were still managed by Simon and flagged as Simon Properties on websites and inside their malls until early 2016, while Washington Prime managed the "strip centers" of the portfolio in-house.[13] In September 2014, WPG announced to acquire Glimcher Realty Trust and its properties, in which Washington Prime Group would be renamed WP Glimcher when the deal was made.[14] The deal was completed in January 2015. As part of the deal, Simon acquired Jersey Gardens (renamed to "The Mills at Jersey Gardens" and added to the Mills portfolio) in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park Village in Fort Worth, Texas, while WP Glimcher acquired Brunswick Square in East Brunswick, New Jersey from Simon.
Recent acquisition offers[edit]
General Growth Properties[edit]
On November 29 of 2009, Financial Times reported that Simon may have attempted to acquire its failing rival General Growth Properties, which was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Should GGP have been acquired in its entirety, such deal would be worth up to $30 billion at the time.[15] Simon hired property investment firm Cohen & Steers, J.P. Morgan, as well as the Lazard investment bank and the Wachtell Lipton Rosen  &  Katz law firm to explore the possibility of acquiring GGP.
On February 16, 2010, Simon announced that it placed a bid on February 8 to acquire General Growth Properties in a deal worth $10 billion.[16] However, the bid was rejected by General Growth twice during the week it was announced. On February 19, 2010, one GGP shareholder filed suit (Young v. Bucksbaum) against the company's board of directors for rejecting Simon's bid, accusing chairman John Bucksbaum and six other board members of breaching their fiduciary duty to GGP's investors.[17] The General Growth board favored an investment offer from Brookfield Asset Management worth $2.6 billion.
Simon's next step, on April 14, 2010, was to announce a $2.5 billion equity investment offer which equaled the price per share of Brookfield's offer.[18] Simon claimed that the deal was more favorable to GGP and its equity holders than Brookfield's offer, stating that it would eliminate the highly dilutive warrants that GGP would issue to Brookfield, Pershing Square and Fairholme Capital. Simon's offer also included a co-investment commitment by Paulson & Co worth $1 billion. Simon Property Group had not ruled out a full takeover of General Growth, claiming that their investment offer would give them more time to work out their differences concerning antitrust issues.[19]
On May 7, 2010, Simon Property Group decided to withdraw its acquisition and recapitalization proposals for General Growth Properties.[20]
Prime Outlets[edit]
On December 8, 2009, Simon Property Group was offered the sale of Prime Retail's Prime Outlets portfolio for $2.24 billion, which included centers at Williamsburg, Virginia, San Marcos, Texas and Hagerstown, Maryland. In May 2010, Simon surprisingly acquired Prime Outlets-Puerto Rico in Barceloneta, which was renamed "Puerto Rico Premium Outlets." However, at the time, Simon did not acquire the whole portfolio, excluding Prime Outlet's center at St. Augustine, Florida where Simon's Premium Outlet mall was already located. [21] Finally, on August 30, 2010, Simon officially acquired the Prime Retail portfolio of twenty-one outlet malls, including the Barceloneta, Puerto Rico location acquired in May 2010. Three properties were not included: the indoor St. Augustine, Florida property, and developments at Grand Prairie, Texas and Livermore Valley, California.[22] The acquired properties received Premium Outlet branding just after the completion of the deal. The developments at Grand Prairie, Texas and Livermore Valley, California were acquired in 2012, just months after their openings, and were rebranded as "Premium Outlets."
Capital Shopping Centres[edit]
At the end of 2010, Simon Property Group attempted to acquire UK-based retail investment group Capital Shopping Centres (CSCG), after CSCG signed a deal with Peel Group to acquire the Trafford Centre.[23] This offer was later declined by Capital Shopping Centres shareholders in an EGM, with the shareholders, many of whom are South African, voting instead for the deal with the Peel Group.[24]
Premium Outlets expansion into Canada[edit]
On August 1, 2013, Toronto Premium Outlets opened in Halton Hills, Ontario, Canada.[25][26] Premium Outlets Montreal, which is the second Premium Outlet Center located in Canada opened in October, 2014.[27]

History[edit]
Simon Property Group was formed in 1993[9] when the majority of the shopping center interests of Melvin Simon & Associates became a publicly traded company. Melvin Simon & Associates, owned by brothers Melvin Simon and Herbert Simon, was founded in 1960 in Indianapolis, Indiana, and had long been one of the top shopping center developers in the United States.
In 1996, Simon DeBartolo Group was created when Simon Property merged with former rival DeBartolo Realty Corp.[10] This was shortly after DeBartolo Realty became a publicly traded company encompassing the shopping mall interests of the Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. family, another leading developer. Simon DeBartolo rapidly acquired assets in the then-fragmented industry. Notable acquisitions included The Retail Property Trust and a group of properties held by IBM's pension plan in 1997 and Corporate Property Investors (CPI) in 1998. Following the CPI acquisition in 1998, the company announced it was reverting to its original name, Simon Property Group, as the DeBartolo family was resuming its private real-estate development operation, while retaining their interest in Simon.




Simon Property Group Headquarters, opened in 2007


Simon continued to be a prolific acquirer of shopping centers, including a portfolio from New England Development in 1999; several prime properties from Rodamco North America in 2002 (including Houston Galleria in Houston, Texas and SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina); several high-profile properties such as Dadeland Mall, Fashion Valley Mall, Copley Place, Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, and Stanford Shopping Center; and in 2004, Chelsea Premium Outlets (now simply named "Premium Outlets"). In 2003, Simon became a co-owner of The Kravco Company, which became Kravco Simon. On April 3, 2007, a partnership including Simon agreed to acquire the Mills Corporation.[11]
In June 2011, Simon Property Group entered into a partnership with Nintendo to provide complimentary 3DS Wi-Fi hotspots at nearly 200 of its malls.[12] The Wi-Fi only works for Nintendo 3DS systems. It will not work on PC, Mac, iOS or Android.

In December 2013, Simon announced it would form a REIT of its smaller malls and community shopping centers called Washington Prime Group (Initially to be named SpinCo). The spin-off was created in May 2014 and was headed by Mark Ordan who was the final CEO of the Simon-bought Mills Corporation. The regional malls in WPG were still managed by Simon and flagged as Simon Properties on websites and inside their malls until early 2016, while Washington Prime managed the "strip centers" of the portfolio in-house.[13] In September 2014, WPG announced to acquire Glimcher Realty Trust and its properties, in which Washington Prime Group would be renamed WP Glimcher when the deal was made.[14] The deal was completed in January 2015. As part of the deal, Simon acquired Jersey Gardens (renamed to "The Mills at Jersey Gardens" and added to the Mills portfolio) in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park Village in Fort Worth, Texas, while WP Glimcher acquired Brunswick Square in East Brunswick, New Jersey from Simon.
Recent acquisition offers[edit]
General Growth Properties[edit]
On November 29 of 2009, Financial Times reported that Simon may have attempted to acquire its failing rival General Growth Properties, which was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Should GGP have been acquired in its entirety, such deal would be worth up to $30 billion at the time.[15] Simon hired property investment firm Cohen & Steers, J.P. Morgan, as well as the Lazard investment bank and the Wachtell Lipton Rosen  &  Katz law firm to explore the possibility of acquiring GGP.
On February 16, 2010, Simon announced that it placed a bid on February 8 to acquire General Growth Properties in a deal worth $10 billion.[16] However, the bid was rejected by General Growth twice during the week it was announced. On February 19, 2010, one GGP shareholder filed suit (Young v. Bucksbaum) against the company's board of directors for rejecting Simon's bid, accusing chairman John Bucksbaum and six other board members of breaching their fiduciary duty to GGP's investors.[17] The General Growth board favored an investment offer from Brookfield Asset Management worth $2.6 billion.
Simon's next step, on April 14, 2010, was to announce a $2.5 billion equity investment offer which equaled the price per share of Brookfield's offer.[18] Simon claimed that the deal was more favorable to GGP and its equity holders than Brookfield's offer, stating that it would eliminate the highly dilutive warrants that GGP would issue to Brookfield, Pershing Square and Fairholme Capital. Simon's offer also included a co-investment commitment by Paulson & Co worth $1 billion. Simon Property Group had not ruled out a full takeover of General Growth, claiming that their investment offer would give them more time to work out their differences concerning antitrust issues.[19]
On May 7, 2010, Simon Property Group decided to withdraw its acquisition and recapitalization proposals for General Growth Properties.[20]
Prime Outlets[edit]
On December 8, 2009, Simon Property Group was offered the sale of Prime Retail's Prime Outlets portfolio for $2.24 billion, which included centers at Williamsburg, Virginia, San Marcos, Texas and Hagerstown, Maryland. In May 2010, Simon surprisingly acquired Prime Outlets-Puerto Rico in Barceloneta, which was renamed "Puerto Rico Premium Outlets." However, at the time, Simon did not acquire the whole portfolio, excluding Prime Outlet's center at St. Augustine, Florida where Simon's Premium Outlet mall was already located. [21] Finally, on August 30, 2010, Simon officially acquired the Prime Retail portfolio of twenty-one outlet malls, including the Barceloneta, Puerto Rico location acquired in May 2010. Three properties were not included: the indoor St. Augustine, Florida property, and developments at Grand Prairie, Texas and Livermore Valley, California.[22] The acquired properties received Premium Outlet branding just after the completion of the deal. The developments at Grand Prairie, Texas and Livermore Valley, California were acquired in 2012, just months after their openings, and were rebranded as "Premium Outlets."
Capital Shopping Centres[edit]
At the end of 2010, Simon Property Group attempted to acquire UK-based retail investment group Capital Shopping Centres (CSCG), after CSCG signed a deal with Peel Group to acquire the Trafford Centre.[23] This offer was later declined by Capital Shopping Centres shareholders in an EGM, with the shareholders, many of whom are South African, voting instead for the deal with the Peel Group.[24]
Premium Outlets expansion into Canada[edit]
On August 1, 2013, Toronto Premium Outlets opened in Halton Hills, Ontario, Canada.[25][26] Premium Outlets Montreal, which is the second Premium Outlet Center located in Canada opened in October, 2014.[27]

History[edit]
Simon Property Group was formed in 1993[9] when the majority of the shopping center interests of Melvin Simon & Associates became a publicly traded company. Melvin Simon & Associates, owned by brothers Melvin Simon and Herbert Simon, was founded in 1960 in Indianapolis, Indiana, and had long been one of the top shopping center developers in the United States.
In 1996, Simon DeBartolo Group was created when Simon Property merged with former rival DeBartolo Realty Corp.[10] This was shortly after DeBartolo Realty became a publicly traded company encompassing the shopping mall interests of the Edward J. DeBartolo Sr. family, another leading developer. Simon DeBartolo rapidly acquired assets in the then-fragmented industry. Notable acquisitions included The Retail Property Trust and a group of properties held by IBM's pension plan in 1997 and Corporate Property Investors (CPI) in 1998. Following the CPI acquisition in 1998, the company announced it was reverting to its original name, Simon Property Group, as the DeBartolo family was resuming its private real-estate development operation, while retaining their interest in Simon.




Simon Property Group Headquarters, opened in 2007


Simon continued to be a prolific acquirer of shopping centers, including a portfolio from New England Development in 1999; several prime properties from Rodamco North America in 2002 (including Houston Galleria in Houston, Texas and SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina); several high-profile properties such as Dadeland Mall, Fashion Valley Mall, Copley Place, Fashion Centre at Pentagon City, and Stanford Shopping Center; and in 2004, Chelsea Premium Outlets (now simply named "Premium Outlets"). In 2003, Simon became a co-owner of The Kravco Company, which became Kravco Simon. On April 3, 2007, a partnership including Simon agreed to acquire the Mills Corporation.[11]
In June 2011, Simon Property Group entered into a partnership with Nintendo to provide complimentary 3DS Wi-Fi hotspots at nearly 200 of its malls.[12] The Wi-Fi only works for Nintendo 3DS systems. It will not work on PC, Mac, iOS or Android.

In December 2013, Simon announced it would form a REIT of its smaller malls and community shopping centers called Washington Prime Group (Initially to be named SpinCo). The spin-off was created in May 2014 and was headed by Mark Ordan who was the final CEO of the Simon-bought Mills Corporation. The regional malls in WPG were still managed by Simon and flagged as Simon Properties on websites and inside their malls until early 2016, while Washington Prime managed the "strip centers" of the portfolio in-house.[13] In September 2014, WPG announced to acquire Glimcher Realty Trust and its properties, in which Washington Prime Group would be renamed WP Glimcher when the deal was made.[14] The deal was completed in January 2015. As part of the deal, Simon acquired Jersey Gardens (renamed to "The Mills at Jersey Gardens" and added to the Mills portfolio) in Elizabeth, New Jersey and University Park Village in Fort Worth, Texas, while WP Glimcher acquired Brunswick Square in East Brunswick, New Jersey from Simon.
Recent acquisition offers[edit]
General Growth Properties[edit]
On November 29 of 2009, Financial Times reported that Simon may have attempted to acquire its failing rival General Growth Properties, which was operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Should GGP have been acquired in its entirety, such deal would be worth up to $30 billion at the time.[15] Simon hired property investment firm Cohen & Steers, J.P. Morgan, as well as the Lazard investment bank and the Wachtell Lipton Rosen  &  Katz law firm to explore the possibility of acquiring GGP.
On February 16, 2010, Simon announced that it placed a bid on February 8 to acquire General Growth Properties in a deal worth $10 billion.[16] However, the bid was rejected by General Growth twice during the week it was announced. On February 19, 2010, one GGP shareholder filed suit (Young v. Bucksbaum) against the company's board of directors for rejecting Simon's bid, accusing chairman John Bucksbaum and six other board members of breaching their fiduciary duty to GGP's investors.[17] The General Growth board favored an investment offer from Brookfield Asset Management worth $2.6 billion.
Simon's next step, on April 14, 2010, was to announce a $2.5 billion equity investment offer which equaled the price per share of Brookfield's offer.[18] Simon claimed that the deal was more favorable to GGP and its equity holders than Brookfield's offer, stating that it would eliminate the highly dilutive warrants that GGP would issue to Brookfield, Pershing Square and Fairholme Capital. Simon's offer also included a co-investment commitment by Paulson & Co worth $1 billion. Simon Property Group had not ruled out a full takeover of General Growth, claiming that their investment offer would give them more time to work out their differences concerning antitrust issues.[19]
On May 7, 2010, Simon Property Group decided to withdraw its acquisition and recapitalization proposals for General Growth Properties.[20]
Prime Outlets[edit]
On December 8, 2009, Simon Property Group was offered the sale of Prime Retail's Prime Outlets portfolio for $2.24 billion, which included centers at Williamsburg, Virginia, San Marcos, Texas and Hagerstown, Maryland. In May 2010, Simon surprisingly acquired Prime Outlets-Puerto Rico in Barceloneta, which was renamed "Puerto Rico Premium Outlets." However, at the time, Simon did not acquire the whole portfolio, excluding Prime Outlet's center at St. Augustine, Florida where Simon's Premium Outlet mall was already located. [21] Finally, on August 30, 2010, Simon officially acquired the Prime Retail portfolio of twenty-one outlet malls, including the Barceloneta, Puerto Rico location acquired in May 2010. Three properties were not included: the indoor St. Augustine, Florida property, and developments at Grand Prairie, Texas and Livermore Valley, California.[22] The acquired properties received Premium Outlet branding just after the completion of the deal. The developments at Grand Prairie, Texas and Livermore Valley, California were acquired in 2012, just months after their openings, and were rebranded as "Premium Outlets."
Capital Shopping Centres[edit]
At the end of 2010, Simon Property Group attempted to acquire UK-based retail investment group Capital Shopping Centres (CSCG), after CSCG signed a deal with Peel Group to acquire the Trafford Centre.[23] This offer was later declined by Capital Shopping Centres shareholders in an EGM, with the shareholders, many of whom are South African, voting instead for the deal with the Peel Group.[24]
Premium Outlets expansion into Canada[edit]
On August 1, 2013, Toronto Premium Outlets opened in Halton Hills, Ontario, Canada.[25][26] Premium Outlets Montreal, which is the second Premium Outlet Center located in Canada opened in October, 2014.[27]

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that are included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Overview  Simon Property Group, L.P. is a Delaware limited partnership and the majority-owned partnership subsidiary of Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation. In this discussion, the terms "Operating Partnership", "we", "us" and "our" refer to Simon Property Group, L.P. and its subsidiaries and the term "Simon" refers specifically to Simon Property Group, Inc. Simon is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. REITs will generally not be liable for federal corporate income taxes as long as they distribute not less than 100% of their REIT taxable income. According to our partnership agreement, we are required to pay all expenses of Simon.  We own, develop and manage retail real estate properties, which consist primarily of malls, Premium Outlets(R), and The Mills(R). As of December 31, 2015, we owned or held an interest in 209 income-producing properties in the United States, which consisted of 108 malls, 71 Premium Outlets, 14 Mills, four lifestyle centers, and 12 other retail properties in 37 states and Puerto Rico. We opened four outlets in 2015 and have three outlets and two other significant retail projects under development. In addition, we have redevelopment and expansion projects, including the addition of anchors, big box tenants, and restaurants, underway at 29 properties in the U.S. and Europe. Internationally, as of December 31, 2015, we had ownership interests in nine Premium Outlets in Japan, three Premium Outlets in South Korea, two Premium Outlets in Canada, one Premium Outlet in Mexico, and one Premium Outlet in Malaysia. As of December 31, 2015, we had a noncontrolling ownership interest in a joint venture that holds five outlet properties in Europe and one outlet property in Canada. Of the five properties in Europe, two are located in Italy and one each is located in Austria, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Additionally, as of December 31, 2015, we owned a 20.3% equity stake in Klepierre SA, or Klepierre, a publicly traded, Paris-based real estate company, which owns, or has an interest in, shopping centers located in 16 countries in Europe.  We generate the majority of our revenues from leases with retail tenants including:     Revenues of our management company, after intercompany eliminations, consist primarily of management fees that are typically based upon the revenues of the property being managed.  We invest in real estate properties to maximize total financial return which includes both operating cash flows and capital appreciation. We seek growth in earnings, funds from operations, or FFO, and cash flows by enhancing the profitability and operation of our properties and investments. We seek to accomplish this growth through the following:       We also grow by generating supplemental revenue from the following activities:    Table of Contents    We focus on high quality real estate across the retail real estate spectrum. We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward criteria. We selectively develop new properties in markets we believe are not adequately served by existing retail outlet properties.  We routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international strategy includes partnering with established real estate companies and financing international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.  To support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:     We consider FFO, net operating income, or NOI, and comparable property NOI (NOI for properties owned and operated in both periods under comparison) to be key measures of operating performance that are not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.  Results Overview  Diluted earnings per common unit of partnership interest, or unit, increased $1.36 during 2015 to $5.88 as compared to $4.52 in 2014. The increase in diluted earnings per unit was primarily attributable to:         Core business fundamentals improved during 2015, primarily driven by higher tenant sales and strong leasing activity. Portfolio NOI grew by 7.1% in 2015 as compared to 2014. Comparable property NOI also grew 3.7% for our portfolio of U.S. Malls, Premium Outlets, and The Mills. Total sales per square foot, or psf, increased 0.1% from $619 psf at December 31, 2014, to $620 psf at December 31, 2015, for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets. Average base minimum rent for U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets increased 4.1% to $48.96 psf as of December 31, 2015, from $47.01 psf as of December 31, 2014. Releasing spreads remained positive in our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets as we were able to lease available square feet at higher rents than the expiring rental rates on the same space, resulting in a releasing spread (based on total tenant payments - base minimum rent plus common area maintenance) of $10.62 psf ($69.64 openings compared to $59.02 closings) as of December 31, 2015, representing a 18.0% increase over expiring payments. Ending occupancy for our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets was 96.1% as of December 31, 2015, as compared to 97.1% as of December 31, 2014, a decrease of 100 basis points primarily as a result of tenant bankruptcy activity announced in the first quarter of 2015.  Table of Contents  Our effective overall borrowing rate at December 31, 2015 on our consolidated indebtedness decreased 53 basis points to 3.88% as compared to 4.41% at December 31, 2014. This reduction was primarily due to a decrease in the effective overall borrowing rate on fixed rate debt of 51 basis points (4.12% at December 31, 2015 as compared to 4.63% at December 31, 2014). At December 31, 2015, the weighted average years to maturity of our consolidated indebtedness was 5.9 years as compared to 6.2 years at December 31, 2014.  Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015, included:          United States Portfolio Data  The portfolio data discussed in this overview includes the following key operating statistics: ending occupancy, average base minimum rent per square foot, and total sales per square foot for our domestic assets. We include acquired properties in this data beginning in the year of acquisition and remove disposed properties in the year of disposition. The Washington Prime properties have been removed from the portfolio data for all periods presented. For comparative purposes, we separate the information related to The Mills from our other U.S. operations. We also do not include any properties located outside the United States.  The following table sets forth these key operating statistics for:     Table of Contents   %/Basis %/Basis Points Points 2015 Change (1) 2014 Change (1) 2013 U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets: Ending Occupancy Consolidated 96.4% -90 bps 97.3% -20 bps 97.5% Unconsolidated 95.3% -110 bps 96.4% +100 bps 95.4% Total Portfolio 96.1% -100 bps 97.1% +20 bps 96.9% Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot Consolidated $47.39 4.5% $45.34 4.6% $43.33 Unconsolidated $53.64 3.4% $51.89 3.8% $50.00 Total Portfolio $48.96 4.1% $47.01 4.4% $45.01 Total Sales per Square Foot Consolidated $607 0.7% $603 - $603 Unconsolidated $665 -2.1% $679 1.3% $670 Total Portfolio $620 0.1% $619 0.2% $618 The Mills�: Ending Occupancy 98.5% +10 bps 98.4% -10 bps 98.5% Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot $27.14 6.7% $25.43 6.9% $23.79 Total Sales per Square Foot $568 5.0% $541 2.3% $529   (1)  Ending Occupancy Levels and Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot. Ending occupancy is the percentage of gross leasable area, or GLA, which is leased as of the last day of the reporting period. We include all company owned space except for mall anchors, mall majors, mall freestanding and mall outlots in the calculation. Base minimum rent per square foot is the average base minimum rent charge in effect for the reporting period for all tenants that would qualify to be included in ending occupancy.  Total Sales per Square Foot. Total sales include total reported retail tenant sales on a trailing 12-month basis at owned GLA (for mall stores with less than 10,000 square feet) in the malls and The Mills and stores with less than 20,000 square feet in the Premium Outlets. Retail sales at owned GLA affect revenue and profitability levels because sales determine the amount of minimum rent that can be charged, the percentage rent realized, and the recoverable expenses (common area maintenance, real estate taxes, etc.) that tenants can afford to pay.  Current Leasing Activities  During 2015, we signed 803 new leases and 1,594 renewal leases (excluding mall anchors and majors, new development, redevelopment, expansion, downsizing and relocation) with a fixed minimum rent across our U.S. Malls and Premium Outlets portfolio, comprising approximately 7.5 million square feet, of which 5.8 million square feet related to consolidated properties. During 2014, we signed 773 new leases and 1,581 renewal leases with a fixed minimum rent, comprising approximately 7.4 million square feet, of which 5.5 million square feet related to consolidated properties. The average annual initial base minimum rent for new leases was $55.24 per square foot in 2015 and $58.57 per square foot in 2014 with an average tenant allowance on new leases of $36.66 per square foot and $38.83 per square foot, respectively.   Japan Data The following are selected key operating statistics for our Premium Outlets in Japan. The information used to prepare these statistics has been supplied by the managing venture partner. %/basis %/basis December 31, point December 31, point December 31, 2015 Change 2014 Change 2013 Ending Occupancy 99.8% 70 bps 99.1% -30 bps 99.4% Total Sales per Square Foot �101,574 7.00% �94,933 4.37% �90,959 Average Base Minimum Rent per Square Foot �4,967 1.16% �4,910 0.45% �4,888  Table of Contents  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. From time to time, we reevaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. Below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 of the notes to consolidated financial statements.      Table of Contents   Results of Operations  In addition to the activity discussed above in the "Results Overview" section, the following acquisitions, openings, and dispositions of consolidated properties affected our consolidated results from continuing operations in the comparative periods:            In addition to the activities discussed above and in "Results Overview", the following acquisitions, dispositions, and openings of joint venture properties affected our income from unconsolidated entities in the comparative periods:       Table of Contents    . . .
