Microsoft’s Top Lawyer Is the Tech World’s Envoy

Bradford Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, worked as a lawyer in Washington and has cultivated relationships there.

REDMOND, Wash. —  Bradford L. Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel, was in Berlin meeting with government officials this spring when a case kept popping up unexpectedly.How would the company respond, the officials demanded to know, to a judge’s ruling in New York that would give the American government access to a customer’s email sitting in an Irish data center? Germans were already furious about revelations that Americans spied on the country’s chancellor, Angela Merkel. And unless the ruling was reversed, one official told Mr. Smith, the German government would never rely on an American company like Microsoft to store its data in the cloud.After his conversations about the case in Germany, Microsoft subsequently challenged the judge’s ruling in court, the first time an American company is believed to have fought back against a domestic warrant for data held overseas. A hearing on the case is planned for July 31.Such are the decisions regularly faced by Mr. Smith, 55, who has become the elder statesman of Microsoft and a de facto ambassador for the technology industry at large. As Microsoft’s chief representative on public policy matters, including privacy — an issue under close scrutiny around the world — Mr. Smith plays a significant role in many of the most critical decisions affecting the company’s fortunes.

Mr. Smith said he told the German official about the case: “We’ve taken this on with a complete commitment to persevere and to do everything we can appropriately to win.” Continue reading the main story

The promise to the German officials carried weight. Mr. Smith is one of the most influential voices inside Microsoft, partly because he has been in his job since 2002, which makes him the longest serving member of the senior leadership team.His influence has only increased in recent years while Microsoft has churned through top executives and made other major changes, all in an effort to keep pace with competitors in the marketplace. Last week, in another major change, Microsoft said it planned to eliminate up to 18,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its total work force, over the next 12 months in an effort to thin out layers of bureaucracy at the company and move more quickly.But Mr. Smith’s weight extends to the wider tech industry as well, partly because of his understanding of Washington. Mr. Smith worked for years as a lawyer there before moving to Microsoft’s headquarters here outside Seattle. While much of the tech industry looks upon government with a strong sense of skepticism, if not disdain, he has cultivated relationships there for years.“He brings a much more Washington sensibility to the West Coast than many of his peers,” said Anne-Marie Slaughter, a former State Department official who now runs the New America Foundation and attended Princeton University with Mr. Smith. “He recognizes the necessity of government engagement. Government is not just an entity for favors. It has to be part of the solution.”Mr. Smith’s political skills have led to some speculation that he will pursue elected office. For now, though, he is putting those skills to use for Microsoft and the technology industry, particularly after the disclosures by Edward J. Snowden of government efforts to collect private data from online services operated by Microsoft, Google and others without search warrants and subpoenas. The leaks shook executives throughout the industry, many of whom worry about damage to the appeal of their products.Last year, Mr. Smith equated government snooping with other serious threats like malware and cyberattacks, and he also led an industry push for changes in how the government collects data.“People won’t use technology they don’t trust, and we need to take the kinds of steps to sustain that trust,” he said in an interview last week.

An earlier policy issue facing Microsoft suggests how Mr. Smith likes to handle problems with pragmatism. When he interviewed for the general counsel job in 2001 with Bill Gates and other senior leaders of the company, Microsoft was facing a litany of penalties in its antitrust battle with the Justice Department, narrowly avoiding a government-ordered breakup of the company.

But a new wave of antitrust battles in Europe and from private companies loomed. During his interview, Mr. Smith showed the executives a single slide declaring that Microsoft needed to make peace with its foes.At the time, Microsoft was widely seen as a bully. People who know Mr. Smith said that changing the company’s legal stance in the antitrust case, as well as later legal stances the company has taken, helped soften the company’s public image. Microsoft’s repeated stumbles with important products have also made the company seem less fearsome.After the Snowden disclosures, Mr. Smith pursued an industrywide effort to limit the damage. In July of last year, Mr. Smith picked up the phone and called his counterpart at Google, Kent Walker, to explore whether the companies could gain strength by working together on a settlement with the government on data collection.The overture was remarkable considering Microsoft and Google are ferocious business competitors, and Microsoft has denounced Google’s privacy practices through its “Scroogled” advertising campaign. But the two companies put aside their hostilities and, in January, they and other technology companies reached a deal with the Obama administration. Leslie Miller, a spokeswoman for Google, declined to comment.“Kent and I talk frequently,” Mr. Smith said. “Sometimes we’re on the same side, sometimes we’re on opposite sides.”And in the fall of 2013, Mr. Smith and Erika Rottenberg, the general counsel of LinkedIn, the social media company, organized a meeting of general counsels from a half dozen or so major technology companies to talk about further unifying their efforts to press for government change. The meeting, in a private dining room of a restaurant in Palo Alto, Calif., eventually led to the formation of the Reform Government Surveillance coalition, which counts Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, Microsoft and LinkedIn as members.“He’s good glue for those kinds of groups because of his policy skills and general intelligence,” Bruce Sewell, the general counsel of Apple, said of Mr. Smith.Some of Microsoft’s positions have continued to upset privacy advocates, putting Mr. Smith in the cross hairs of their objections. In March, a legal filing in a criminal case against a former Microsoft employee revealed that Microsoft snooped on the email and instant messaging accounts of a French blogger. The spying into the Microsoft-operated services was part of an internal investigation into leaks by the former employee, who received a three-month prison sentence.

Marc Rotenberg, president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, said his view of Microsoft’s actions on privacy was “mostly favorable.” While he criticized Microsoft’s snooping, he commended Mr. Smith for quickly vowing to hand off similar cases to law enforcement officials in the future.Mr. Smith has experienced disappointments in his job. After a two-year investigation into Google, the Federal Trade Commission last year found that the company did not violate antitrust laws in the way it handles web search results, as Microsoft had argued.Ed Lazowska, a professor of computer science at the University of Washington, said Mr. Smith has also used his bully pulpit at Microsoft to advocate investments in education and changes in immigration policy, both important issues for Microsoft and the technology industry.“There are very few people for whom I have as much admiration,” Mr. Lazowska wrote in email. “Imagine me saying this about a lawyer!”

Item Description: University Press of Florida. Paperback. Book Condition: new. BRAND NEW, The Rescue of the "Gale Runner": Death, Heroism, and the U.S. Coast Guard, Dennis L. Noble, James C. Bradford, Gene A. Smith, This on-the-spot narrative of the February 1997 loss of three U.S. Coast Guardsmen from the Quillayute River Station during a maritime rescue is both a commemoration and a report of the failure of the Coast Guard's senior leadership to appreciate and support the work of enlisted men and women at often remote and dangerous small-boat stations.The first in-depth look at a small-boat maritime rescue by the U.S. Coast Guard, this book is also the first to describe the role of those at small-boat rescue stations and of the policy setters at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, D.C. Its author was in the right place at the right time on a night when everything went wrong. From the first alarm to the dramatic helicopter rescue of the crew of a foundering sailboat, from the onshore rescue of the sole survivor of the first dispatched Coast Guard crew to the tragic losses, this man-against-the-sea tale is told largely in the words of the participants and others who were with author Dennis Noble at the station near La Push, Washington, on the night the tragedy unfolded.Noble also provides an analysis of the state of the Coast Guard, how its current problems have developed, and what effect they have on the service's operations. As the story unfolds, the views of senior enlisted personnel at the station paint a picture of an overworked small-boat rescue force and their feelings toward what they perceive as a distant, and in many cases unaware, officer corps. Noble contrasts these perspectives with those voiced by the investigating commissioned officers and higher-ups at Coast Guard headquarters.Illustrated with 29 photos and maps, Noble's contribution to the annals of maritime history isa riveting account of extraordinary heroism in the face of regrettable human tragedy.

Not Enough Room?


We've recently added extra insulation to many of our water heaters to meet the new federal efficiency regulations. We have only added an inch or two to most models, but the new larger size may pose a problem when choosing a replacement if your water heater is installed in a tight space. 

If the new model just won't fit into your available space, you may consider installing a smaller capacity model. Depending on how much hot water you actually use, you might not even notice the loss in capacity.  
If you notice the reduction in hot water capacity or anticipate that it will be noticeable, you can increase the tank temperature from the factory setting of 120° degrees to offset the loss in capacity in most installations. 
Scalding Risk
Higher temperatures increase the risk of scalding. Even at 120°F, hot water can scald. If you choose a higher temperature setting, or to reduce the risk of scaling at any setting, install Thermostatic Mixing Valves (temperature limiting valves) at each point-of-use. These valves automatically mix hot and cold water to limit the temperature at the tap. 
When you purchase your water heater, the manual will have additional important information regarding water temperature. 
OK, I understand the risks
