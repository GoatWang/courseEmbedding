			Mr. Shumate is the Managing Partner, North America of Squire Patton Boggs (US) LLP, where he has practiced law since February 1988. Mr. Shumate is also the chairman of the board, lead director, and a member of the governance and nominating committee of CyrusOne Inc., a publicly traded provider of data center consulting services, and a trustee and Chairman on The Ohio State University Board of Trustees. From July 2005 to January 2013, he served as a director of Cincinnati Bell, Inc., a publicly traded provider of voice and data telecommunications products and services. He also served as a director of the Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company from 1998 until its acquisition in 2008, as well as Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. from 2002 until its acquisition in 2009.
 
The Board concluded that Mr. Shumate should serve as a Director primarily due to his significant legal background and his experience in managing a business and serving as a director of other public companies and as a trustee of several non-profit organizations. Mr. Shumate has practiced law for nearly 40 years and was named a Lawyer of the Year 2016 by Best Lawyers and an Ohio Super Lawyer by Law and Politics magazine. Together with his service as a director of other public companies, Mr. Shumate's background allows him to provide valuable insights to the Board, particularly in regard to corporate governance and risk issues that we confront.
