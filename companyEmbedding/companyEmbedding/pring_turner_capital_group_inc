Martin J. Pring
Investment Strategist
Intrigued by the dynamics of financial market behavior, Martin founded Pring Research in 1978 by providing research for financial institutions. Since 1984, he has published the Intermarket Review, a monthly global market report that analyzes the world’s principal financial markets. He has written more than 20 books on topics such as asset allocation, market psychology and investing around the business cycle. His widely popular book, “Technical Analysis Explained”, has been translated into 8 languages and for several decades was required reading for the Chartered Market Technician’s (CMT) designation.
Their shared interest in business cycle investing led Martin to join with Joe Turner and co-found Pring Turner Capital Group in 1988. Martin, in collaboration with Dow Jones Indexes, co-developed the Dow Jones Pring U.S. Business Cycle Index in 2012, a unique index based on the firms “Six-Stage” business cycle investment strategy.
Currently, he is adjunct professor at Golden Gate University in San Francisco teaching the world’s first virtual graduate level course on technical analysis. He has been honored by his peers with several lifetime achievement awards recognizing his career-long investment research contributions.

×Jim KopasPortfolio Manager
Ever since he can remember, Jim has always had a keen eye for business. His “professional” career began at the ripe old age of 11 when he started a dog walking service to help neighbors with especially energetic pets. After just a few months of walking dogs and with years of accumulated birthday savings, Jim had enough money to open his first brokerage account. He has been enamored with investing ever since.
To grow his investing knowledge, Jim enrolled at Santa Clara University in 2005 and three years later received a BSC degree in Finance. Upon graduation he joined Pring Turner just in time to be greeted with the greatest financial crises since the Great Depression, an even more valuable learning experience than college. In 2013, he earned the Chartered Financial Analyst®(CFA) designation, the most respected and recognized investment management designation in the world.
Away from the office, Jim loves spending precious time with his wife Genna and daughter Kate. The Kopas family especially enjoys traveling, attending Cal Football games, and long walks with the family’s golden retrievers.

×Joe D. Turner
Portfolio Manager
Joe began his career with Dean Witter in 1968. Feeling he could better serve clients as an independent advisor, in 1977 he formed an SEC registered investment advisory firm.

On that basis, Mr. Turner has taught multiple graduate level courses at Golden Gate University in San Francisco primarily on business cycle strategy and the psychology of investing.

Investment Philosophy

 

Navigating the risks and rewards of the markets.
Our investment philosophy and how we invest for you is what makes Pring Turner unique. Similar to the layers of risk protection built into your car, we too build many layers of risk protection into your investment portfolio. Our conservative “All-Season” approach is designed to adapt to the ever-changing economy and financial markets. With two distinct game plans; one to grow wealth in favorable periods and another to protect during bear markets. Our goal is to make sure you’re protected and prepared for all market environments.

 
 
 
 
 





 


Business Cycle Roadmap
> Our GPS Navigation
Over the last century, three out of every four major stock market declines (-20% or more) have occurred during economic recessions. Our proprietary business cycle barometers act like a GPS and help us navigate the major ups and downs of the markets. As the economy changes, we make important investment adjustments to better prepare for the road ahead.

 
 
 
 





 


Quality, Value, and Income
> Seat-belts, Airbags, and Shock Absorbers
Financial research shows the higher the quality of an investment, the better the performance on a risk adjusted basis. We emphasize investments in high quality stocks and bonds, so you can rest assured knowing there is a quality seat-belt in place to protect your valuable nest egg.
Like an airbag supplying an added safety cushion for the driver, purchasing high quality companies at attractive prices provides a similar margin of safety for investors. This disciplined, safety-first approach provides another layer of protection. In the long run studies show value investing outperforms growth investing with significantly less risk.
Many investors tend to focus on capital appreciation as income gets relegated to the backseat. However, historically a significant portion of stock investment returns have come from dividends.  Markets move up and down but consistent dividend income serves as a valuable and rewarding shock absorber for your investment portfolio.
If you remember only one thing, remember this…
You will come across an occasional pothole on your investment journey.  Our job is to steer you clear of those hazards, so you arrive safely and smoothly to your desired financial destination.

 
 
 
 





 




How Has Our All-Season Strategy Performed?
“How have you performed” is only half the question! “How much risk did you take to generate that return?” is an equally important question. One of the best ways to judge risk-adjusted returns is to examine how well an advisor handles difficult market environments. Since 2000, the markets have experienced two vicious declines of greater than 50%, providing an excellent benchmark to gauge risk-adjusted performance. During this challenging time our “All-Season” strategy has provided steady growth while taking roughly half the risk of the S&P 500.

Frequently Asked Investment Advisor Questions

Some of the most frequent and most important questions we get asked are listed here, click on the question  or + sign to read the answers below..
 
 
What are the Key Questions to Ask When Selecting A Financial Advisor?

Selecting the right financial advisor for you is one of the most important financial decisions you will make in your lifetime. Interviewing and hiring the right financial advisor who is a good match for your needs is possible if you ask the right questions. Your job is to secure forthright answers to these questions without the typical marketing hype. Taken together with your personal concerns these six sets of questions are a very good starting point to help determine if a particular financial advisor is the right match for you.
 
 
Why should I hire Pring Turner to manage my investment portfolio? 

Our four managing partners at Pring Turner headquartered in Walnut Creek, Ca. (Martin, Joe, Tom and Jim) have more than 135 years of combined experience in the investment advisory business. We provide a professional, disciplined approach to investment management. Working individually with you, we develop a set of personalized investment guidelines designed to meet your unique goals. Based on those guidelines we continuously monitor and adjust your investments to protect and steadily grow your valuable nest egg. Our clients appreciate the peace of mind knowing their wealth is being carefully invested by a team of seasoned investment professionals.
 
 
Are you a Fee-only investment advisor or commission-based?

Our fee-only incentive based compensation structure is designed to align our interests with yours. We do not receive compensation from commissions and strive to keep transaction costs low. The flat annual percentage fee is personalized for you based upon your investments under management.
 
 
What will you do to protect my wealth in the next major market decline?

As your investment advisor we continually “stress test” your portfolio to help protect you through major declines. Stress testing means thinking a step ahead to protect your portfolio and better shield yourself from a bear market decline. Active asset allocation shifts to reduce stock exposure during hazardous market conditions is a decades long hallmark of our investment process. Secondly, only holding higher quality stocks with above average dividend income further should protect your investment portfolio from large declines. We believe the end result is a much more favorable and tolerable path to protect and grow your wealth over the long run.
 
 
How have the investment portfolios you manage performed?

In order to judge performance properly investors should not only ask an investment advisor, “What is your performance?”–that is only half of the question. “How much risk did you take to generate that return?” is the most important question. Over several decades, through both good and bad market cycles, we have delivered what we believe are attractive and steady returns with low risk. Click here to view our investment performance history that adhere to the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) .
 
 
What is the difference between active investment strategies and passive investments?

Academics and investors have debated over the superiority of a passive investment strategy versus an active investment approach for years. First, let’s clear up the confusion surrounding active investing. As fee-only investment advisors we believe “active” is best defined as meaning active risk-management. With nearly 50 years of observing investors, we believe active risk management is the superior approach due to the inability of investors to suffer through the psychological stress or emotional aspects associated with the steep price declines associated with passive investing. Continue reading Active vs. Passive Investment Strategies; Which is Right for You? to learn more about these two investment approaches.
 
 
Are you giving up control when you work with a fee-only investment advisor?

Absolutely not. By taking the time to clearly define your investment goals, you are actually taking control of your investment future. You control the investment process through well-defined guidelines established with your investment advisor. We work right alongside with you and your other trusted professional network (Lawyer, Accountant, etc…) to successfully meet your long term goals.    
 
 
How can you protect yourself from unscrupulous investment fraudsters like Bernie Madoff?

The Madoff case was the largest fraud and Ponzi scheme ever and much can be learned from the fiasco. The single biggest step you can take to protect yourself from something similar is to be sure to have your investments held by a large, well-recognized third party custodian (like Charles Schwab). Be wary of investment advisors that ask you to add your money to a pooled account rather than establishing an account in your individual name.  A third party custodian safeguards your investments and allows for online viewing of your individual account balance.  And finally as a general rule of thumb, if the investment program sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
 
 
Are investment portfolios managed exactly alike?

No! Everyone has their own special circumstances and goals. We personalize a suitable strategy to meet your own long-term needs. We manage to your investment objectives taking into consideration multiple factors including your taxes, income, experience, comfort level, and any other relevant issues. Our investment advisory service is highly personalized. The doors to our Walnut Creek, California office are always open. You are encouraged to contact us with any questions or meet with us as often as needed.
 
 
What kind of record keeping do Investment Advisors provide?

Besides receiving a monthly investment statement from your custodian, i.e. Charles Schwab, you receive a detailed quarterly statement and performance figures from your investment advisor. At the end of each year, if you have a taxable account you will receive a thorough tax summary that includes capital gain/loss information and breakdown of all income and dividend payments from your custodian. This consolidated 1099 statement is all you will need at tax preparation time. Our goal is to help keep your investment record keeping simple.
 
 
What types of accounts can investment advisors manage?

We have the ability to manage all of your typical investment and retirement accounts including: Individual Accounts, Joint Accounts, Trust Accounts, Traditional IRAs, 401(k) Rollovers, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs,  Retirement plans, and non-profit organizations including foundations and endowments that appreciate a disciplined, conservative investment style.

Another All-Time High
 by Pring Turner Investment Management - Financial Advisor | Apr 18, 2012 | Newsletters | 0 comments
 






The long-standing promise Pring Turner Capital Group makes to clients is our commitment to protect and grow your valuable assets. This past quarter once again demonstrates how we have delivered on that commitment. The typical long-term Pring Turner client, adjusting for withdrawals, achieved another all-time high in portfolio value. This new high achievement marks the 11th year of the past 13 years clients can make this claim. It is especially notable considering this treacherous timeframe represented one of worst periods for stocks in the last century.
As we pointed out in our January Newsletter “entering 2012, investors will be buffeted by both positive and negative crosscurrents.” This past quarter benefited handsomely from the positive crosscurrents, even more than we anticipated as stock market performance was strong. As the chart illustrates we are pleased to report the typical portfolio reached new high levels, an accomplishment few individual investors or even professionals can assert.

 



To say the past 13 years has been challenging may be a slight understatement because the total return (dividends included) for the stock market has disappointed investors with one of the worst performances in American financial history. This extended dismal period includes two devastating 50%+ stock market declines and raised havoc for most investors and especially retirees dependent on a stable portfolio and income to supplement living expenses. We are pleased to report clients who have been with us during this timeframe have indeed seen their wealth protected and steadily earned positive returns while taking less risk. We are committed to do even better for you in the next decade.

 

Business Cycle Outlook
This business cycle continues to make slow progress. This slow recovery is typical of economic expansions that develop after experiencing deep financial crises such as the painful 2008-2009 melt-down. Decision-makers everywhere are understandably cautious which supports both good and bad scenarios. Good in that no unhealthy excesses have developed, yet bad in that cautiousness restrains spending and new investments. The outcome is a labored economic recovery.
Longer term one big reason we have low expectations for this and future business cycle expansions relates to the link between employment and consumer spending. This link is important because consumer spending drives nearly 70% of the nation’s business activity. The American consumer still has concerns for their job security, and rightly so, resulting in cautious spending for goods and services. The secular bear market theme we outlined in our “Lost Decade” article, published in late 2009, can in part be explained by the continuing U.S. struggle to reverse the long-term structure of American job losses.
Recent monthly employment statistics reflect historically weak job growth for this nearly three year old economic expansion. Relatively weak job growth is only part of the bigger problem. Millions of jobs were lost during the 2007-2009 ‘Great Recession’ that have not been recovered and will take years to mend. The Civilian Employment to Population Ratio (number of working Americans/ total eligible workforce) demonstrates the extent of the bigger problem.

 



Since the end of the last recession it is clear no net new jobs have been created relative to our growing population. Jobs are simply not being created fast enough to meaningfully lower the unemployment rate and bring those idle workers back into the labor force. The result is a continued sub-par recovery that teeters between modest growth and slowdown. Eventually, a stronger employment environment will lead to higher consumer spending and a stronger economy—the virtuous cycle we would like to see take hold. But this more favorable environment is not yet evident.

 



Financial Market Outlook
U.S. financial markets are benefiting from 1) a slow and steady improvement in a still fragile economy, 2) a strong Federal Reserve easing of monetary conditions, and 3) the perception of being a safe haven from the European debt crisis. These conditions should continue to support U.S. markets for the duration of this business cycle and contrasts with less promising performance in overseas financial exchanges.
We believe the three year cyclical bull market for stocks is not finished, but perhaps getting tired. After a five month rally the stock market is entitled to take a short breather. Expect stocks to consolidate some of the recent gains and pull back in price over the next few weeks. However, our business cycle research shows evidence of continued modest, yet positive, economic momentum. This allows the stock market more upside potential as the year progresses. We will be searching and evaluating additional conservative growth and income ideas to purchase on weakness. Our goal is to see your portfolio achieve further new all-time high levels later this year.
As mentioned earlier, our longer term view remains that the U.S. stock market is still in a secular bear market and faces strong headwinds for a number of years to come. In fact, the Pring Turner team has completed a new investment book to be published by McGraw Hill next month entitled Investing in the Second Lost Decade. Our forthcoming book not only lays out the detailed case why investors should prepare for another lost decade but also how investors can protect and even grow their assets during this continued difficult time. The investment principles, disciplines and course of action we explain in the book are the same ones that brought you safely and profitably through the last 13 very difficult investment years. We are working hard to develop even better tools to navigate the second lost decade and look forward with confidence to both the challenges and opportunities in the years ahead.
Thank you for your trust and the opportunity to help you. As always, please feel free to contact us should you have any questions.

Net of fee performance was calculated using actual fees. The investment management fee schedule for the composite is 1.25% on the first $1 million, and 1.00% on amounts over $1 million. Actual investment advisory fees incurred by clients may vary. Further information regarding investment advisory fees is described in Part II of the firm’s Form ADV. Composite performance is presented gross of foreign withholding taxes on dividends, interest income, and capital gains. Policies for valuing portfolios, calculating performance, and preparing compliant presentations are available upon request.
The annual composite dispersion presented is an asset-weighted standard deviation calculated using accounts in the composite the entire year.

His widely popular book, “Technical Analysis Explained”, has been translated into 8 languages and for several decades was required reading for the Chartered Market Technician’s (CMT) designation.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.
