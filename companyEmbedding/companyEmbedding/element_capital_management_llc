                  Alt Turnover is calculated by taking either the total MV of new purchases or
                   the MV of securities sold, whichever is less,
                   divided by the total MV of the fund.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Started his career as Finance VP of Dayco Holding Corp, his family’s real estate investment company with over US$300 million in assets primarily in Florida, Colorado and Venezuela. In 2000 on behalf of Cartera de Inversiones Venezolanas C.A., a private equity investment firm with over US$7 billion in assets, Mr. D’Agostino acquired Banco Noroco, a small commercial bank. Merged the bank with a mortgage broker company obtaining a full retail bank license and renamed it Norvalbank. In 2003 after Norvalbank grew from US$70 million in assets to US$500 million, Mr. D’Agostino again merged the bank with Banco Occidental de Descuento (BOD). When the merger was completed, Mr. D’Agostino founded the private banking division for BOD. Today BOD’s private banking division manages over US$1 billion in assets.

Element Overview
Element Capital Advisors Ltd., (ELEMENT) is an independent investment advisory firm domiciled in the British Virgin Islands and with offices in Panama City, Panama, and Caracas, Venezuela.
Our mission is to offer investment advisory services to our clients through investment products that deliver high returns with low relative volatility, uncorrelated to broad market indices. Capital preservation and portfolio liquidity is always the firm’s primary objective. ELEMENT helps clients diversify their portfolios through a rigorously researched and vetted investment portfolio. We do not employ a “one-size-fits-all” approach to potential investments. In managing the investment advisory process and in constructing our client products we are not motivated by generating commissions or placement fees but to create a stable investment product for our clients.
In order to provide independent and impartial advice ELEMENT is dedicated exclusively to investment management. Investors have the same basic requirements when selecting where and how to invest: Trust and satisfactory returns. As a result, always avoiding conflicts of interest, our recommendations are based solely on our convictions. We are dedicated to delivering security and transparency.
Our investment products are offered to institutional and high net worth investors worldwide. The firm internally manages its portfolios that consist of investments in hedge funds and select market securities where we have identified significant opportunity. After a detailed background investigation and legal, compliance and regulatory risks are assessed we selectively choose the appropriate external hedge fund managers and investments to include in our portfolio.
ELEMENT’s products are marketed to qualified high-net-worth and institutional investors outside of the United States. We are dedicated to providing the level of personal service and attention to our investors that has been noticeably absent from large international investment management companies. No matter how large a client’s initial investment with ELEMENT, we will provide all investors with the transparency and attention that we as investors would expect.
