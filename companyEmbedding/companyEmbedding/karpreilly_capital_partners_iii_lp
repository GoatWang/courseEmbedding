 Patxi’s Pizza gets boost from private equity investment 



                                                posted in: Investment 

 

San Francisco, California
Patxi’s Pizza gets boost from private equity investment. Exec says deal will help chain compete with fast-casual brands.

The Patxi’s Pizza chain is ramping up growth and testing new ovens that will help the full-service, deep-dish concept compete with the growing crop of fast-casual pizza players.
The San Francisco-based Patxi’s — pronounced, “pah-cheese” — closed on a deal in February that gave private-equity firm KarpReilly LLC a controlling interest.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Bill Freeman, Patxi’s chief executive, said the growth capital will help support the 12-unit chain’s planned expansion.
The chain plans to open four more units in 2014 and another five to eight units in 2015. The goal is to reach 70-plus units within five years, Freeman said. All units will be company owned, and the chain has no plans to franchise.
Freeman, a former telecommunications entrepreneur, founded Patxi’s in 2004 with friend and pizza chef Francisco “Patxi” Azpiroz. Their aim was to create a warm and inviting neighborhood pizza joint offering Chicago-style deep-dish pies with quality ingredients.
More recently, Patxi’s has been perfecting a thin-crust addition to the menu. The chain is testing and likely to roll out new electric 800-degree ovens, made specifically for thin-crust pies, that allow the chef to dial in the ideal cooking temperature for the top and bottom of the pizza.
Thin-crust pizzas will bake in about 2.5 minutes in the new ovens versus roughly 10 minutes in the chain’s existing ovens designed for the original signature deep dish. That means guests will be able to order a custom pizza that can be served at a speed that would be more conducive to lunch. It also means that Patxi’s will be able to compete more directly with rapidly growing fast-casual pizza players like MOD Pizza, Blaze Fast Fire’d Pizza and PizzaRev.
“We can bake a pizza just as quickly as they can,” noted Freeman.
Unlike the fast-casual pizza chains, however, Patxi’s does about half of its business in dine-out and delivery orders. Patxi’s also has a full bar with about 20 beers on tap.
The average check is about $35, and average unit volumes top $2.5 million in restaurants that are typically between 3,000 and 4,000 square feet, said Freeman. The chain has recorded same-store sales increases of 15 percent or more over the past five years.
“Overall, the quality of our food is what differentiates us,” he said. “But people also see us as a great value. You feel like you had a $70 experience for $30.”
Freeman said the partnership with KarpReilly is a good fit for Patxi’s. KarpReilly has a long history of investment in the restaurant space, including chains such as Café Rio, Burger Lounge, Café Zupas, Habit Burger Grill, Miller’s Ale House, Marie Callender’s, Z Tejas Southwestern Grill, Mimi’s Café, Elephant Bar, the Sprinkles cupcake concept, and Hooters.
As a result of the deal, Russ Bendel, Habit Burger’s chief executive and an industry veteran, has joined Patxi’s board of directors, Freeman said.

Item�1.
Security and the Issuer  This statement on Schedule
13D relates to the shares of Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share (the �Common Shares�), of Charlotte Russe Holding, Inc. (the �Issuer�). The principal executive offices of the Issuer are located at 4645 Morena
Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92117.  �


Item�2.
Identity and Background  (a) � (c),
(f)�This statement is filed on behalf of KarpReilly Capital Partners, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (�KarpReilly LP�), KarpReilly GP I, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (�KarpReilly GP�), Allan
W. Karp, a citizen of the United States of America (�Allan Karp�), Christopher K. Reilly, a citizen of the Unites States of America (�Christopher Reilly�), and William P. Logan, a citizen of the Unites States of
America (�William Logan�, and together with KarpReilly LP, KarpReilly GP, Allan Karp and Christopher Reilly, collectively, the �Reporting Persons�). The Reporting Persons are filing jointly, and the agreement among
the Reporting Persons to file jointly is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. The business address and principal office, as applicable, of all Reporting Persons is 104 Field Point Road, Greenwich, CT 06830. 
KarpReilly LP is primarily engaged in the business of making and overseeing equity and equity-related investments with the principal objective of
appreciation of capital invested. KarpReilly GP is primarily engaged in the business of serving as the general partner of KarpReilly LP, and as such, is in a position, directly or indirectly, to determine the investment and voting decisions of

primary mission is to invest in consumer growth companies and help them achieve their long-term vision. Allan Karp and Christopher Reilly are the managers of KarpReilly GP, and as such, are in a position, directly or indirectly, to determine the
investment and voting decisions of KarpReilly GP and KarpReilly LP. William Logan�s present principal occupation or employment is partner of KarpReilly, LLC.  (d), (e)�During the last five years, no Reporting Person has been (i)�convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii)�a party to a civil proceeding of a
judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree, or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state
securities laws or finding any violations with respect to such laws.  �


Item�3.
Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration  In acquiring the 1,172,162 Common Shares owned by KarpReilly LP, KarpReilly LP expended approximately $10,776,242 (excluding commissions) of its general funds.  Allan Karp acquired (i)�191,274 of the Common Shares owned by Allan Karp through distributions in-kind from an investment partnership and through open market purchases 




prior to calendar year 2008 and (ii)�10,000 of the Common Shares owned by Allan Karp through open market purchases made in calendar year 2008 expending
approximately $129,600 (excluding commissions) of his personal funds for such calendar year 2008 purchases.  Christopher Reilly acquired
3,641 Common Shares owned by Christopher Reilly through open market purchases, in all cases prior to calendar year 2008.  William Logan
acquired (i)�85 of the Common Shares owned by William Logan through open market purchases prior to calendar year 2008 and (ii)�1,000 of the Common Shares owned by William Logan through open market purchases made in calendar year 2008
expending approximately $12,870 (excluding commissions) of his personal funds for such calendar year 2008 purchases.  �


Item�4.
Purpose of Transaction  Allan Karp made the
purchases noted in Item�3 above for investment purposes in the ordinary course of business and, at the time of such purchases, not for any purpose of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer, and not in connection with or as a
participant in any proposed transaction having that purpose or effect. Christopher Reilly made the purchases noted in Item�3 above for investment purposes in the ordinary course of business and, at the time of such purchases, not for any
purpose of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer, and not in connection with or as a participant in any proposed transaction having that purpose or effect. William Logan made the purchases noted in Item�3 above for investment
purposes in the ordinary course of business and, at the time of such purchases, not for any purpose of changing or influencing the control of the Issuer, and not in connection with or as a participant in any proposed transaction having that purpose
or effect. KarpReilly LP made the purchases noted in Item�3 above for the purpose of facilitating making a proposal to acquire (together with other investors) 100% of the outstanding Common Shares.  On November�12, 2008, KarpReilly LP and H.I.G. Capital, LLC (�HIG�) sent a letter to the Board of Directors of the Issuer, including
an equity commitment letter between KarpReilly LP, J.P. Morgan U.S. Direct Corporate Finance Institutional Investors III LLC (�JP Morgan Institutional�) and J.P. Morgan Corporate Finance Private Investors III LLC (�JP Morgan
Private�, and together with JP Morgan Institutional, �JP Morgan�), and issued a press release disclosing that letter. Among other matters discussed in the letter, KarpReilly LP and HIG (i)�made a non-binding proposal
to offer to acquire 100% of the outstanding Common Shares at a range of $9.00 to $9.50 per share in cash, subject to a twenty-one day due diligence period that would allow KarpReilly LP and HIG to finalize their proposal, (ii)�stated that such
an acquisition would be completed using their own funds, along with the excess cash of the Issuer and funds from a KarpReilly LP co-investor, and would not be subject to any financing condition and (iii)�requested that the Board of Directors
immediately release Mark Hoffman, the Issuer�s former Chief Executive Officer, from the current restrictions imposed on him by the Board of Directors, which prevent Mr.�Hoffman from working with prospective acquirers of the Issuer. Copies
of the letter from KarpReilly LP and HIG to the Board of Directors and the related press release are attached hereto as Exhibits B and C and are incorporated herein by reference. 


The Reporting Persons currently plan to seek to pursue a consensual transaction in which they would be
permitted by the Issuer for a 21-day period access to financial and other information to conduct business, accounting, legal and other due diligence and, subject to the satisfactory results of that due diligence, would seek during that period to
negotiate and enter into a definitive merger agreement providing for the acquisition by KarpReilly LP and HIG of 100% of the outstanding Common Shares. Daniel T. Carter, the Issuer�s former Chief Financial Officer, has been engaged and has
worked with KarpReilly LP on a consulting basis to assist with such due diligence primarily during the summer of 2008. Patti Shields, the Issuer�s former executive vice president and general merchandising officer, has agreed to work with
KarpReilly LP on a consulting basis to assist with such due diligence.  Subsequent to the issuance of the press release disclosing the
letter sent to the Board of Directors on November�12, 2008, KarpReilly LP has been contacted by, and in response thereto, has had discussions with, shareholders of the Issuer about KarpReilly LP�s proposal and the Issuer�s prospects.
Neither KarpReilly LP nor HIG has been contacted by the Issuer�s Board of Directors.  On November�12, 2008 (and subsequent to
delivery of the proposal letter and issuance of the press release described above), the Issuer issued a press release reporting its financial results for its fiscal quarter and year ended September�27, 2008. Reported financial results included
diluted earnings per share of $0.01, excluding transition and impairment costs, as compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $0.33 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2007, citing among other factors �an increased level of
markdowns.� Comparable stores sales for the fourth quarter were reported to have declined 3.8%. In its press release the Issuer also indicated its expectation that earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 will be between
$0.10 and $0.18, exclusive of transition costs, as compared to diluted earnings per share of $0.56 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 (a decline of 82% to 68%), and that comparable store sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009 will be
�in the negative mid to high-single digit range.�  The reported and expected revenue and comparable store sales in the
Company�s November�12 press release are roughly in line with the Reporting Persons� prior expectations; however, the reported earnings and expected earnings are significantly below the Reporting Person�s prior expectations based
on the Reporting Persons� familiarity with the specialty apparel industry, understanding of the current retail environment and prior experience with the Issuer. Prior to entering into a merger agreement at a price in the range described in
KarpReilly LP and HIG�s proposal letter ($9.00 to $9.50 per share), the Reporting Persons would need to understand the causes of the shortfall in the reported earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and evaluate the key assumptions
leading to the severe erosion of the expected earnings for the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Depending on the results of this analysis, the Reporting Persons expect to continue to seek to pursue the acquisition of 100% of the Common Shares,
although it is possible that it may be at a lower valuation that appropriately reflects the Issuer�s expected operating performance.  The Reporting Persons intend to continue to evaluate their investment in and plans with respect to the Issuer in light of all relevant factors, including the Issuer�s response to KarpReilly LP and HIG�s proposal, information
available to the Reporting Persons concerning the Issuer, conditions in the specialty retail environment and the U.S. economy 




generally, and other investment opportunities available to the Reporting Persons, and may change their plans at any time. Depending on relevant factors at
the time, future plans or proposals of the Reporting Persons could include: additional purchases of Common Shares, either in the open market or privately negotiated purchases; abandoning efforts to acquire or influence the direction of the Company
and/or disposing of some or all of the Reporting Person�s Common Stock in either open market or privately negotiated transactions.  �


Item�5.
Interest in Securities of the Issuer  (a),
(b)�Based upon the Issuer�s Form 10-Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August�1, 2008, there were 20,871,889 Common Shares issued and outstanding as of July�29, 2008. The 1,378,162 Common Shares beneficially
owned by all Reporting Persons represent approximately 6.6% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding. The 1,172,162 Common Shares beneficially owned by KarpReilly LP (the �KarpReilly LP Shares�) represent approximately 5.62% of
the Common Shares issued and outstanding. The 1,172,162 Common Shares beneficially owned by KarpReilly GP represent approximately 5.62% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding. The 1,373,436 Common Shares beneficially owned by Allan Karp
(the �Allan Karp Shares�) represent approximately 6.58% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding. The 1,175,803 Common Shares beneficially owned by Christopher Reilly (the �Christopher Reilly Shares�) represent
approximately 5.63% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding. The 1,085 Common Shares beneficially owned by William Logan (the �William Logan Shares�) represent approximately 0.0052% of the Common Shares issued and outstanding.
An additional 100 Common Shares are owned by an employee of KarpReilly LLC, but KarpReilly LP expressly disclaims any agreement to act together with such employee for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of such equity securities
of the Issuer.  Collectively, the Reporting Persons beneficially own 1,378,162 Common Shares constituting approximately 6.6% of all of the
outstanding Common Shares.  KarpReilly LP has the power to vote or to direct the vote of (and the power to dispose or direct the disposition
of) the KarpReilly LP Shares.  KarpReilly GP, as general partner of KarpReilly LP, has the shared power to vote or to direct the vote of
(and the shared power to dispose or direct the disposition of) the KarpReilly LP Shares.  By virtue of Allan Karp and Christopher
Reilly�s positions as the managers of KarpReilly GP, which is the general partner of KarpReilly LP, Allan Karp and Christopher Reilly may be deemed to have the shared power to vote or direct the vote of (and the shared power to dispose or
direct the disposition of) the KarpReilly LP Shares.  Allan Karp has the power to vote or to direct the vote of (and the power to dispose or
direct the disposition of) the Allan Karp Shares.  Christopher Reilly has the power to vote or to direct the vote of (and the power to
dispose or direct the disposition of) the Christopher Reilly Shares.  William Logan has the power to vote or to direct the vote of (and the
power to dispose or 




direct the disposition of) the William Logan Shares.  KarpReilly GP does not own any Common Shares directly.  As of the date hereof, no Reporting Person owns any Common Shares other
than those set forth in this Item�5.  (c) The trading dates, number of Common Shares purchased or sold, and the price per share for all
transactions by the Reporting Persons in the Common Shares within the last 60 days, which were all brokered transactions, are set forth below:  �

Exhibit B  
  November�12, 2008  Board
of Directors  Charlotte Russe Holding, Inc.  4645 Morena
Boulevard  San Diego, California 92117  Ladies and Gentlemen:
 Almost a year has passed since KarpReilly wrote to the Board of Directors, expressing its interest in acquiring 100% of the equity of Charlotte Russe
Holding, Inc. (�Charlotte Russe� or the �Company�). Clearly, we were disappointed when the Board declined to engage in a constructive dialogue with us. In the time that has elapsed, Charlotte Russe has lost its Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Merchandise Manager, and head of Human Resources. In the meantime, same-store sales have declined, overhead spending has increased and new unit expansion has been curtailed. We believe that investors have
lost confidence In the Company�s current direction, as evidenced by a 67% decline in the Company�s share price since the 52-week high.  Today the
Company is severely weakened, with no stable senior management team, no growth plans and dim prospects. Moreover, it faces one of the most difficult and unpredictable consumer environments in years. Even after a replacement senior management team
has been hired, it will be new to Charlotte Russe and perhaps new to the challenging juniors retailing industry. And it seems certain that they will not have worked together as a time-tested team. While the Company wrestles with all of these
specific challenges in such an uncertain economic environment, the risks to the shareholders of Charlotte Russe are enormous. We believe these issues can be reversed, yet we do not believe they can be reversed without fundamental change, change
which will be very difficult to implement in the context of being a public company.  Based on these beliefs, we are submitting this non-binding proposal on
behalf of KarpReilly Capital Partners, LP (and affiliates) (�KarpReilly�) and H.I.G. Capital, LLC (and affiliates) (�H.I.G.�) to acquire 100% of the stock of Charlotte Russe Holding, Inc. at a range of between $9.00 and $9.50 per
share in cash. Our proposal represents a 31% to 38% premium to the most recent closing price of $6.89.  We think the transaction represents the best
alternative to the public shareholders as well as the Company and its employees, and we strongly prefer to complete this investment with friendly cooperation from the board and the Company. Towards that end, we would expect to be at the upper end of
our range in a friendly transaction in which the Board cooperates openly with our due diligence and agrees to release Mark Hoffman, the Company�s former CEO, from the current restrictions imposed by the Board, restrictions which prevent Mark
from working with prospective acquirers of the Company. We fail to see the benefit that such restrictions provide to the Company�s shareholders. 


November 12, 2008  Board of Directors  Charlotte Russe Holdings, Inc.  Page 2  �
Assuming a cooperative transaction, we will require 21 days of confirmatory due diligence to finalize our proposal.
Given Allan Karp�s twelve years of history as a major shareholder of the Company (including eleven years on the Board), we are very familiar with the business and foresee no issues arising during this short diligence period.  To expedite closing and to remove uncertainty that would be created by relying on third-party debt financing, KarpReilly Capital Partners, LP (along with its affiliated
co-investors, investment funds advised by JPMorgan Asset Management) and H.I.G. Capital, LLC are prepared to fund this acquisition with 100% equity from their respective committed investment funds. Our combined equity commitments of $165 million to
$175 million, together with excess cash of Charlotte Russe, represent more than enough capital to complete the acquisition in the range we have indicated and pay transaction expenses. An equity commitment letter from investment funds advised by
JPMorgan Asset Management is attached to this letter. We will not require a financing contingency in the definitive merger agreement.  Background on
KarpReilly�& H.I.G. Capital  As you know, Allan Karp has been a shareholder of Charlotte Russe since 1996 and served on the Board of
Directors from 1996 to 2007. Along with previous management, Allan and his investment firm acquired 100% of the Company in 1996 and played a significant role in guiding the Company from a small, regional retail chain to a large, national company.
Today, KarpReilly and its affiliates own 1,118,680 shares, representing a 5.4% ownership position which will be appropriately reflected on a Schedule 13D to be filed shortly. We believe this stake makes KarpReilly one of the Company�s largest
shareholders.  KarpReilly is a private investment firm, founded by Allan Karp and Chris Reilly, whose primary mission is to invest in consumer growth
companies and help them achieve their long-term vision. Over the past 15 years, the principals of KarpReilly have invested in, sat on the boards of and nurtured over 25 companies, including numerous retail and consumer growth companies. 
H.I.G. Capital is a leading global private equity investment firm focused exclusively on the middle market. It has a broad and flexible capital base and more than
$7.5 billion of equity capital under management. Based in Miami, and with offices in Atlanta, Boston, and San Francisco in the U.S., as well as affiliate offices in London, Hamburg and Paris in Europe, H.I.G. specializes in providing capital to
small and medium-sized companies with attractive growth potential. Since its founding, H.I.G. has invested in and managed more than 200 companies worldwide. The firm�s current portfolio includes companies with combined revenues in excess of $7
billion. For more information, please refer to the H.I.G. website at www.higcapital.com.  Timing and Next Steps  Based on the foregoing, we urge the Board to take action now to enhance value for its shareholder base. We believe that our proposal represents the most compelling and
realistic option for doing so. We are prepared to commence our confirmatory due diligence immediately and believe that we can enter into a definitive, binding merger agreement to acquire the Company within twenty-one days if we are provided
sufficient access to information and management. 


November 12, 2008  Board of Directors  Charlotte Russe Holdings, Inc.  Page 3  �
We appreciate your consideration and look forward to your prompt response.  �

November�12, 2008
�
 KarpReilly Capital Partners, LP (and affiliates) (�KarpReilly�) in conjunction with H.I.G. Capital, LLC
(and affiliates) (�H.I.G.�) disclosed today that they are submitting an unsolicited, non-binding proposal to the Board of Directors of Charlotte Russe Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHIC) to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the company at
a valuation range of between $9.00 and $9.50 per share in an all-cash, all-equity transaction. This offer represents a 31 to 38% premium above yesterday�s closing price. KarpReilly also disclosed that it has acquired 1,118,680 shares of
Charlotte Russe which, at a 5.4% ownership stake, makes it one of the company�s largest shareholders.  KarpReilly (along with its affiliated
co-investors) and H.I.G. (together, the �Investor Group�) intend to fund the acquisition with 100% equity available from committed investment funds. The proposal is subject to twenty-one days of due diligence and other customary
conditions, but is not conditioned upon receiving debt financing.  KarpReilly originally approached Charlotte Russe to pursue a potential acquisition
almost a year ago, but was rebuffed by the Board of Directors at the time. Since KarpReilly�s initial offer, Charlotte Russe has suffered from extensive turnover among its senior management team, declining same store sales and increasing
operating expenses. In July, the Charlotte Russe Board of Directors appointed one of its members as interim CEO and CFO, and subsequently in August, it adopted a poison pill. The company�s stock price has declined 67% from the 52-week high.
 �We believe that investors have lost confidence in the current direction of Charlotte Russe,� said Allan Karp, partner at KarpReilly, and a
former director of Charlotte Russe for eleven years. �While we believe that this erosion can be reversed, we don�t believe it will be without fundamental change, which will be very difficult to implement in the context of being a public
company. Given our deep experience in retailing, and with Charlotte Russe in particular, we believe that we and H.I.G. can offer Charlotte Russe stockholders superior value to what they can realistically expect to receive remaining as stockholders
of the current public company. We hope that the Board of Directors will recognize that a potential sale transaction with KarpReilly and H.I.G. would be in the public stockholders� best interest, and that the Board will work to facilitate this
opportunity for the stockholders.�  KarpReilly and H.I.G. are prepared to commence due diligence immediately, with the goal of entering into a binding
merger agreement with Charlotte Russe within twenty-one days of being provided access to financial and other information. A copy of the offer letter for Charlotte Russe is attached to this press release.  Charlotte Russe, based in San Diego, California, is a mall-based specialty retailer of fashionable, value-priced apparel and accessories for young women. As of
September�27, 2008, the company had 487 stores across the United States and Puerto Rico.

Re:
Financing for Proposed Acquisition of Charlotte Russe Holding, Inc.  Ladies and Gentlemen:  1. You (�KarpReilly�) have informed us of your intention to propose an acquisition of 100% of the
outstanding equity securities of Charlotte Russe Holding, Inc. (the �Company�) at a price within the range of $9.00 to $9.50 per share. The transaction would likely be accomplished by a merger (the �Merger�) of a
newly formed corporation to be controlled by you (�Newco�) with and into the Company pursuant to definitive documentation to be negotiated with the Company�s board of directors (the �Merger Agreement�).
 2. This letter confirms the several (not joint and several) commitment of each undersigned entity, subject to the conditions set forth
herein, to purchase, or cause a permitted assignee to purchase, a portion of the equity of Newco upon consummation of the Merger for an aggregate purchase price indicated on the signature page of this letter (the amount of each such commitment with
respect to an undersigned is referred to herein as the �Commitment�), which collectively aggregate $50 million, solely for the purpose of funding, and to the extent necessary to fund, the consideration to be paid to holders of the
Company�s equity securities pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger Agreement at a price within the range of $9.00 to $9.50 per share per share and related transaction expenses.  3. The Commitment, including the obligation of an undersigned to fund the Commitment, with respect to each of the undersigned, is expressly subject to:
(a)�the undersigned�s satisfaction with the results of its legal, accounting and business due diligence investigation of the Company, the capital, tax, accounting and legal structure relating to the Merger, and all agreements and
arrangements (whether or not the undersigned is a party thereto) relating to Newco; (b)�the execution of definitive agreements relating to the Merger (including the Merger Agreement) and the transactions contemplated thereby on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the undersigned and the prior or simultaneous consummation of the Merger in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement without material waiver, modification or amendment of any terms or conditions thereof (other
than material waivers, modifications or amendments consented to by the undersigned); (c)�the prior or simultaneous receipt by Newco of the funding commitments of KarpReilly and H.I.G. Capital, LLC referred to in the letter dated on or 




about the date of this letter from KarpReilly and H.I.G. Capital, LLC to the board of directors of the Company; and (d)�the execution and delivery of
the Merger Agreement by each party thereto on or before December�31, 2008. Notwithstanding anything in this letter to the contrary, in the event that any of the undersigned determine (in its sole discretion) that one or more of the conditions
specified in clauses (a)�through (d)�of this paragraph 3 has not or is not capable of being satisfied or fulfilled, then the undersigned shall promptly notify KarpReilly, at which point this letter and the Commitment shall terminate with
respect to the undersigned and the undersigned shall have no further obligations in respect of this letter, except for any surviving obligations set forth in paragraphs 9, 10, 12 and 13, but only as to the Commitment of the undersigned providing
such notice.  4. The Commitment may not be assigned without the prior consent of KarpReilly, except the undersigned may assign all or a
portion of the Commitment to any of its affiliated funds or affiliated entities under common control with or advised by the undersigned which do not beneficially own any of the Company�s equity securities. Any assignment that does not comply
with the provisions of this paragraph shall be deemed null and void ab initio.  5. KarpReilly and its affiliates shall cause Newco
to use all funded Commitments solely for the purpose of funding, and to the extent necessary to fund, (a)�the consideration to be paid to holders of the Company�s equity securities pursuant to and in accordance with the Merger Agreement at
a price within the range of $9.00 to $9.50 per share per share and (b)�related transaction expenses, as described in this letter.  6.
If KarpReilly determines, in its sole discretion, that the continued participation by the undersigned in the transaction may have a material adverse effect on Newco or the Company, or cause or contribute to a delay in the consummation of the Merger
or if the undersigned fails to fund its Commitment in accordance with the terms hereof, then KarpReilly shall have the right to terminate all (but not less than all of) the Commitments. The undersigned shall provide KarpReilly with such information
as KarpReilly may reasonably request to make the determinations described in this paragraph 6.  7. The undersigned, solely as to itself,
represents, warrants and covenants that it does not have beneficial ownership of any securities of the Company and without the prior consent of KarpReilly will not acquire beneficial ownership of any securities of the Company while the Commitment
remains in force.  8. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or implied in this letter, (a)�KarpReilly acknowledges and agrees
that no person other than the undersigned has any obligation hereunder and that neither KarpReilly nor any other person shall have any recourse hereunder against any former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or limited
partner, manager, member, stockholder, advisor, affiliate or assignee of the undersigned, and (b)�this letter is intended to be solely for the benefit of

jurisdiction over the undersigned), (c)�after it is generally known to the public or the securities industry (other than through a breach of this letter); (d)�to the extent it is or becomes available to the undersigned on a nonconfidential
basis, provided that the source of such information was not known by the undersigned (after such inquiry as would be reasonable in the circumstances)�to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other legal or contractual obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such information; or (e)�to the extent necessary to correct any false or misleading information which may become public concerning the relationship between the undersigned and KarpReilly. Except as otherwise
provided in the next sentence, in the event that the undersigned or an affiliate or representative of the undersigned is requested or required by law and regulation or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, or other facts with
respect thereto, the undersigned shall provide KarpReilly with prompt notice of any such request or requirement so that KarpReilly may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the undersigned, its
affiliates and its representatives shall have the right to disclose Confidential Information to any regulator or governmental supervisory authority having jurisdiction over the undersigned or its advisors and the undersigned shall not be required to
provide notice to KarpReilly of any such disclosure unless it is lawfully permitted to do so. The undersigned may use Confidential Information only to evaluate its Commitment and participation in the transaction sponsored by KarpReilly described

expenses reasonably incurred by KarpReilly while the Commitment remains in force in connection with the potential acquisition of the Company by Newco, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of

percentage of any such expenses (a)�to the extent such expenses were incurred by KarpReilly subsequent to the undersigned�s or KarpReilly�s termination of the undersigned�s Commitment and (b)�in the event that the Merger is
consummated by Newco.  11. The undersigned acknowledges that KarpReilly expects that its proposed acquisition of the Company will become
publicly disclosed and that it may desire or be required to publicly disclose the undersigned�s Commitment, including the identity of the

the prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) of both the form and content of all such disclosures.  12. This letter
shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All claims, actions, proceedings, suits, complaints, petitions or other

Re:
Potential acquisition of Charlotte Russe Holding, Inc.  Ladies and
Gentlemen:  Thank you for your interest in joining with us to propose a transaction (�Project X�) to acquire Charlotte Russe
Holding, Inc. (the �Company�). We are excited about the opportunity and hope you are as well. This letter sets forth our agreement regarding certain matters pertaining to Project X.  The parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of their affiliates and representatives to, maintain the confidentiality of all information furnished to
them by or at the direction of the other party pertaining to the Company or Project X whether provided before or after the date of this letter and including the fact that KarpReilly Capital Partners, L.P. (�KarpReilly�) and H.I.G. Capital,
LLC (�H.I.G.�) are pursuing Project X, (�Confidential Information�) other than Confidential Information disclosed (a)�with the other party�s written consent, (b)�to the extent required by law or regulation
(including in any report, statement or testimony required to be submitted to any municipal, state, provincial or federal regulatory body having jurisdiction over such party), (c)�after it is generally known to the public or the securities
industry (other than through a breach of this letter); (d)�to the extent it is or becomes available to either party on a nonconfidential basis, provided that the source of such information was not known by such party (after such inquiry
as would be reasonable in the circumstances)�to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or other legal or contractual obligation of confidentiality with respect to such information; or (e)�to the extent necessary to correct any false or
misleading information which may become public concerning the relationship between H.I.G. and KarpReilly, after notice to and consultation with H.I.G. or KarpReilly, as applicable. In the event that either party hereto or an affiliate or
representative of either party hereto is requested or required by law and regulation or legal process to disclose any Confidential Information, or other facts with respect thereto, such party shall provide the other party with prior notice of any
such request or requirement a reasonable time prior to the time of the required disclosure, to the extent practicable, so that the other party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.  Without the prior written consent of the other party, the parties hereto may use Confidential Information supplied to them by or at the request of the
other party or any of 




its affiliates or any of its or their respective lawyers, accountants, consultants and other advisors (�Representatives�), for the sole and
exclusive purpose of participating in an acquisition of the Company in a transaction sponsored by KarpReilly with the participation of H.I.G. and not in connection with any other transaction or investment directly or indirectly involving the assets,
securities or business of the Company.  Provided that KarpReilly (i)�is in compliance with the terms of this letter, (ii)�has not
indicated that it will not agree to the terms we have discussed and (iii)�has not indicated that it is no longer interested in pursuing Project X, H.I.G. further agrees that during the period beginning on the date of this letter and ending one
year after the date of this letter, H.I.G. will not directly or indirectly pursue or otherwise work on a transaction directly or indirectly involving the assets or a significant amount of securities of the Company independently or with any other
person or entity who is not also working with KarpReilly unless KarpReilly provides its written consent thereto. H.I.G. acknowledges that it is aware and that its Representatives have been advised that the United States securities laws generally
prohibit any person having material non-public information about a company from purchasing or selling securities of that Company.  KarpReilly agrees that, so long as you remain committed to pursuing with KarpReilly an acquisition of the Company based on the terms we have discussed (and confirm that commitment to KarpReilly upon reasonable request) and the proposed
acquisition of the Company is consummated by KarpReilly or any affiliate within one year of the date of this letter based on such terms, you will be offered the opportunity to invest, in securities with the same economic terms as those received by
KarpReilly, an equity amount equal to 42.9% of the total equity consideration needed to complete the acquisition; provided that such investment opportunity will be subject to your execution and delivery of definitive transaction documents
containing terms customary for transactions of this type (including those we have discussed with you).  Each of KarpReilly and H.I.G. shall
be responsible for its proportionate share (allocated pro rata according to relative equity commitments) of all third party fees and other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably incurred or reasonably committed to be paid collectively by KarpReilly and
H.I.G. in connection the potential acquisition of the Company (including such fees and expenses reasonably incurred or reasonably committed to be paid by or on behalf of an entity formed by KarpReilly to effect Project X (�Newco�)) and
incurred after the date of this letter and until such party informs the other party in writing that it no longer wishes to pursue Project X; provided that if the acquisition is consummated, such fees and expenses shall be paid by Newco or the
Company. KarpReilly and H.I.G. shall have the right to approve significant engagements (e.g., legal, accounting) necessary to pursue the transaction.  You represent, warrant and covenant that you do not have beneficial ownership of any securities of the Company and without the prior consent of KarpReilly will not acquire beneficial ownership of any securities of the
Company until you inform KarpReilly in writing that you no longer wish to pursue Project X.  �

KarpReilly and H.I.G. each acknowledges and agrees that money damages would be an insufficient remedy for
