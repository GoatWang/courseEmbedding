HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dynegy Inc. (NYSE:DYN) has signed two separate definitive sets of 
      agreements to acquire the ownership interests in certain Midwest 
      generation assets from Duke Energy and EquiPower Resources Corp and 
      Brayton Point Holdings, LLC from ECP. The Duke portfolio includes its 
      retail business and ownership interests in the following plants: Killen, 
      Stuart, Conesville, Miami Fort, Zimmer, Hanging Rock, Washington, 
      Fayette, Lee and Dicks Creek. The ECP assets include these generating 
      facilities: Milford, Lake Road, Dighton, Masspower, Liberty, Elwood, 
      Richland, Stryker, Kincaid and Brayton Point. Upon closing both 
      transactions, Dynegy will own nearly 26,000 megawatts (MW) of generating 
      capacity nationally and provide retail electricity to residents and 
      businesses in Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
    


      “The two acquisitions announced today are both exceptionally high 
      quality portfolios that have been well managed and run by Duke and ECP 
      employees. The addition of these portfolios transforms Dynegy by adding 
      considerable scale in the PJM and New England markets. The Duke and ECP 
      employees are committed, hard-working men and women and we look forward 
      to engaging their expertise and talent in the combined business. In 
      addition, we intend to honor the terms of the collective bargaining 
      agreements in both generating fleets,” said Dynegy President and Chief 
      Executive Officer Robert C. Flexon. “The addition of these portfolios is 
      forecasted to significantly improve our financial outlook by tripling 
      our 2015 Adjusted EBITDA and being massively accretive to Adjusted 
      EBITDA and Free Cash Flow per share in 2015 and beyond.”
    

Transaction Benefits


      The addition of the ECP assets and the Duke generation portfolio and 
      retail marketing business complements Dynegy’s existing assets and 
      retail business by adding significant scale and fuel diversification in 
      markets the Company currently participates in but otherwise lacks scale. 
      Of the 12,500 MW being acquired, 5,053 MW are modern combined cycle 
      natural gas plants and 3,793 MW are environmentally compliant coal 
      generation plants. Additional benefits from these transactions include:
    


        PJM and ISO-NE capacity payments will represent 25% of the combined 
        company’s gross margin compared to 11% today as a result of 
        quadrupling the size of the PJM fleet and increasing the size of the 
        New England fleet seven-fold.
      

        Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow accretion per share in 2015 of 
        approximately 125% and 220%, respectively.
      

        Dynegy’s $3.2 billion net operating loss position will be available to 
        offset taxable income of the combined company, providing nearly $500 
        million in present value cash tax savings.
      

        In addition to the $40 million in targeted annual cost savings, 
        Dynegy’s existing infrastructure and general and administrative costs 
        will be leveraged across a much larger asset base, reducing the 
        general and administrative cost per MWh from $1.67 to $1.10. As part 
        of the integration, Dynegy will expand its highly successful PRIDE 
        (Producing Results through Innovation by Dynegy Employees) program to 
        both businesses to generate balance sheet and operational efficiencies 
        beyond those identified to date.
      

        Duke Energy Retail will expand Dynegy’s retail business into three new 
        competitive retail markets (Ohio, Pennsylvania and Michigan). The 
        EquiPower and Duke Ohio generation assets will provide load following 
        generation to support the retail businesses.
      


Transaction Structure


      Dynegy has committed financing in place for both the liquidity 
      facilities and the transaction purchase prices and expects to access the 
      capital markets in advance of closing to raise the permanent financing 
      for the transactions.
    

      Dynegy Inc. intends to issue approximately $5 billion in new unsecured 
      bonds and $1.25 billion in equity and equity-linked securities. Included 
      in the equity figure is $200 million of Dynegy common stock that will be 
      issued to ECP as part of the transaction consideration at closing. To 
      support the collateral and liquidity needs of the combined enterprise, 
      the Company has secured two incremental corporate-level revolving credit 
      facilities totaling $950 million, bringing total revolver capacity at 
      Dynegy Inc. to $1.425 billion. Additionally, approximately $300 million 
      in working capital and cash collateral postings will be transferred to 
      Dynegy with the acquired portfolios at closing.
    

      “The target capital structure of the combined company has been designed 
      to ensure the continued strength and flexibility of our balance sheet 
      and maintain significant secured capacity for both hedging and liquidity 
      requirements going forward. We appreciate the support of the company’s 
      relationship banks which have provided committed financing to ensure 
      both sufficient funds for closing as well as revolver capacity to manage 
      the liquidity requirements of the combined company,” said Dynegy 
      Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Clint Freeland.
    

      The transaction’s financing structure is consistent with the Company’s 
      focus on balance sheet management, value-creating capital allocation, 
      and sufficient liquidity to weather changes in commodity markets. The 
      new assets will be incorporated into Dynegy’s existing first lien 
      structure to support the Company’s hedging and collateral management 
      programs.
    

Combined Portfolio Profile


      To provide investors with a view of the combined company’s earnings 
      power, Dynegy has provided estimated full year 2015 Adjusted EBITDA and 
      Free Cash Flow guidance of $1.2-$1.4 billion and $480 - $680 million, 
      respectively. This assumes that closing of both transactions occurs on 
      December 31, 2014 and that Dynegy owns both portfolios for the full year 
      of 2015.
    

      Dynegy continues to support environmentally compliant coal and gas-fired 
      generation as a responsible way to support America’s future energy 
      needs. Dynegy remains committed to working with local communities, state 
      and federal regulators, and legislators to ensure that affordable, 
      reliable, responsible and environmentally compliant electricity is 
      provided to the communities that the Company serves.
    

      In addition, Dynegy intends to honor the agreement ECP reached to retire 
      the Brayton Point facility on May 31, 2017 and complete the 
      decommissioning following retirement.
    

Approvals and Time to Close


      Both transactions are expected to close by the end of the first quarter 
      2015. The transactions are subject to customary closing conditions, 
      including approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 
      expiration of Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting periods.
    

Advisors


      Lazard and Credit Suisse acted as financial advisors on both 
      transactions. Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial advisor on the ECP 
      transaction and Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisor on the Duke 
      transaction.
    

Investor Conference Call/Webcast

      call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. ET/7:30 a.m. CT. Participants may

      This press release contains statements reflecting assumptions,

      that are intended as “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of 
      Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E

      risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from current projections, forecasts, estimates and 
      expectations of Dynegy is contained in Dynegy’s filings with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). 
      Specifically, Dynegy makes reference to, and incorporates herein by

      statements described in this press release could be affected by the 
      following, among other things, (i) conditions to the closing of any of 
      the transactions may not be satisfied; (ii) problems may arise in 
      successfully integrating the Duke Energy, EquiPower and Brayton power 
      facilities into Dynegy’s current portfolio, which may result in Dynegy 
      not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; (iii) Dynegy 
      may be unable to achieve expected synergies or it may take longer than 
      expected to achieve such synergies; (iv) any of the transactions may 
      involve unexpected costs or unexpected liabilities; (v) Dynegy may be 
      unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for any of the 
      transactions or required regulatory approvals may delay any of the 
      transaction or result in the imposition of conditions that could have a 
      material adverse effect on Dynegy or cause Dynegy to abandon any of the 
      transactions; (vi) the business of Dynegy may suffer as a result of 
      uncertainty surrounding the transactions; (vii) the industry may be 
      subject to future regulatory or legislative actions, including 
      environmental, that could adversely affect Dynegy; and (viii) Dynegy may 
      be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive 
      factors. Any or all of Dynegy’s forward-looking statements may turn out 
      to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known 
      or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are 
      beyond Dynegy’s control.

The power plants are:

* Conesville coal-fired station, located in Conesville, Ohio.
* Dicks Creek natural gas facility, located in Middletown, Ohio.
* Fayette natural gas energy facility, located in Masontown, Pennsylvania.[Native Advertisement]
* Hanging Rock natural gas energy facility, located in Ironton, Ohio.
