Investor Alert:  Waveland Resource Partners IV LP





(Last Updated On: April 10, 2017)Waveland Resource Partners IV LP Investment Losses
Have you suffered investment losses in Waveland Resource Partners IV LP? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses by filing a FINRA Dispute Resolution claim against the brokerage firm that sold you the investment.
According to their website, Waveland invests in oil and gas exploration and development throughout the Mid-Continent and Permian Basin regions of the United States alongside many of the largest and most active exploration and production companies.
Waveland often raises money for investments through Reg D private placement offerings like the company did for Waveland Resource Partners IV LP.  These Reg D private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission, usually between 7-10%, as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from 1-3%.
The Trouble with Alternative Investment Products
The trouble with alternative investment products, like Waveland Resource Partners IV LP, is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds.  An additional risk inherent to Mewbourne Oil offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities.
The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like Waveland Resource Partners IV LP.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment recommendation that is made is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
Risks with Reg D Private Placements
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commissions and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresent the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks.
For example, Waveland’s own website has this to say: “Private placements Investments involve a high degree of risk and should be undertaken only by persons who have the sophistication and financial resources to assume these risks.”
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be found liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
Recovery of Investment Losses
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of Waveland Resource Partners IV LP or another Waveland Reg D private placement investment, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.

Waveland Capital Investigation





(Last Updated On: January 31, 2017)Waveland Capital Investment Losses
Have you suffered losses in a Waveland investment program? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover some of your losses through a FINRA dispute resolution claim against the brokerage firm that recommended the investment.
According to their website, Waveland Capital Group is a merchant bank with core investment focus in the oil and gas industry predominantly by way of limited partnerships. Waveland was founded in 2000 and is headquartered in Irvine, CA.
The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms have for recommending high-risk oil and gas programs. The firm has handled a number of claims involving Waveland. In those claims, the firm has alleged, among other things, that the Waveland investments were (1) high-risk and unsuitable for our clients given their financial situation, needs and investment objectives, (2) that the risks of the investment were not fully disclosed to them, and (3) that the brokerage firms that sold the investments failed to conduct the proper due diligence with respect to the Waveland investments (as the firms are required to do by FINRA Rules).
The Problem with Oil and Gas Limited Partnerships
The problem with oil and gas limited partnerships like those offered by Waveland are they are exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and lack the same regulatory oversight as other investment products. These types of limited partnerships are also high-risk, speculative ventures that often lack liquidity. In addition, limited partnerships offer extremely high commission fees that are often 3-4x higher than more traditional investments, like mutual funds or bonds.
For more information on The White Law Group’s Investigation see, Investor Alert: Waveland Resource Partners I LP
Specifically, The White Law Group is investigating potential claims involving the following Waveland offerings:
Waveland Drilling Partners 2011-A
Waveland Drilling Partners 2011-B
Waveland Drilling Partners III-A
Waveland Drilling Partners III-B
Waveland Resource Partners II
Waveland Resource Partners III
Waveland Ventures IV-B, LLC
Waveland Ventures V-C, LLC
Most recently, Waveland Resource Partners IV, LP,  a filed form D to raise $50 million in equity financing on October 11th.
Recovery of Investment Losses
