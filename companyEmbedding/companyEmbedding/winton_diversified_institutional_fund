All investments carry risk. Different investments carry different levels of risk, depending on the investment strategy and the underlying assets. Generally, the higher the potential return of an investment, the greater the risk.
The risks of investing in this fund include:

Market risk: Changes in the prices of futures positions held by the fund may result in loss of principal or large movements in the unit price of the fund within short or long periods of time. Global and local economic, financial, political, technological and environmental factors can drive changes in the prices of futures positions. It is not possible to predict the occurrence or magnitude of these and other potentially relevant factors. Different factors may affect the price of individual futures positions, particular asset classes (such as shares, bonds, interest rates, currencies and commodities) or futures positions generally at different times.
Leverage risk: Arises when the fund takes on positions that are greater in size than its assets. The fund will take leveraged positions with the aim of increasing returns which can also lead to increased losses. Leverage arises in the fund through taking both long and short futures positions which are larger in size than the net asset value of the fund. While this process forms a key part of the investment strategy, it may mean that gains and losses may be significantly greater than those in a fund that is not leveraged. The fund employs significant leverage and this may result in a loss of some or all of the fund's capital.
Strategy, model and research risk: Winton's investment approach is based on research into past data and the application of that research to the development of mathematical models that attempt to forecast returns, risk, correlation and transaction costs. Many of these models are trend following models that attempt to identify and exploit market trends. Mathematical models are representations of reality but they may be incomplete and/or flawed and there is an inherent risk that any forecasts derived from them may be inaccurate, particularly if the research or models are based on, or incorporate, inaccurate assumptions or data. Assumptions or data may be inaccurate from the outset or may become inaccurate as a result of many factors such as, changes in market structure, increased government intervention in markets or growth in assets managed in accordance with similar investment strategies. In particular, such factors may make Winton’s trend following models less effective because they may lessen the prospect of identified trends occurring or continuing in the future. As a result of the foregoing, the investment system may not generate profitable trading signals and the fund may suffer a loss.

For a full description of the risks of investing in the fund, you should read the Product Disclosure Statement before deciding to invest.

Detailed fund information



       Winton Capital Management Limited (Winton) is a global investment management company, based in London. Winton focuses on achieving absolute returns through advanced statistical research into financial markets. Winton was founded in 1997 by David Harding, one of the pioneers of trend-following systematic trading. It has since become a leader in the specialised field of managed futures and is now one of the largest Commodity Trading Advisers in the world.
    



       The Winton Global Alpha Fund aims to generate long-term total returns from a specialist managed futures strategy.
    

       Futures are contracts that allow investors to buy or sell an asset (for example commodities, equities, bonds) on a specified future date at an agreed price.
    

       The fund can potentially benefit from rising and falling markets, taking advantage of either a rise in the underlying price (if it takes a 'long' position) or a fall in the underlying price (if it takes a 'short' position).
    



       Winton aims to achieve strong long-term returns without relying on general growth in asset values. It pursues a diversified trading strategy and targets risk, not return.
    

       The fund trades approximately 100 global futures markets, across categories such as share indices, bonds, interest rates, currencies and commodities.
    

       Winton further believes that trading strategies, by their nature, need to be constantly updated in order to maintain their competitive edge. For this reason, Winton invests heavily in a program of statistical research.
    

       The Winton Investment System, largely automated and based on mathematical models derived through statistical research, is a result of over 25 years of scientific research into financial markets.
    

       The investment team:
    


        accesses a world of data from thousands of markets including economic statistics, weather records, demographic data and much more
      

        extracts meaning from noisy market data
      

        gains an edge by detecting subtle patterns in the way markets move to make market predictions.

The Morning Brief: David Harding’s Winton Capital Plots Big Expansion


					March 04, 2014

					 
                    Stephen Taub
				



Winton Capital, the ninth largest hedge
    fund firm in the world, is embarking on a major expansion. The
    London-based managed futures giant, which had more than $25
    billion at the beginning of 2013, is looking to hire as many as
    100 employees this year alone, launch five funds and open
    offices in New York, Tokyo and Sydney, according to the Wall Street Journal. Winton
    founder David Harding is said to be playing a more active role
    at the firm now that chief executive Tony Fenner-Leitão
    resigned.
Last month Winton moved into new offices in West London,
    according to the report. "To grow, you need to have several
    things in place: office space, management know-how, money and
    the will — we now have all those things in place,"
    Harding told the paper.
Last year Winton posted a 9.42 percent gain in its $10
    billion flagship Winton Futures Fund, an impressive performance
    considering a number of managed futures funds and trend
    followers lost money, in some cases by double-digits.
    Winton’s high-flying, $650 million Winton Global
    Equity Fund, a long-only equity strategy, finished the year up
    29.77 percent. Winton’s $220 million Winton
    Evolution Fund, which the firm describes as a supercharged
    version of WFF, rose 14.56 percent last year. The fund had 40
    percent of its risk in cash equities, versus 25 percent for the
    Winton Futures Fund, and targets 12 percent volatility, versus
    10 percent for WFF. The firm also manages the Winton
    Diversified Futures Fund, an onshore U.S. fund that was
    launched in July 2012. It finished the year up 6.64 percent and
    had $300 million under management at year-end. The Winton
    Diversified Strategies Fund, which follows the same strategy
    and leverage levels as the Winton Evolution Fund, was up 5.87
    percent it its first, partial year of trading. It launched in
    July 2013 and now manages $90 million.
One major reason Winton fared so well in 2013 is that it had
    a big exposure to the strong global equities market. It did
    well in both index and individual cash equities.

Cantor Fitzgerald Asset Management announced it acquired
    Fintan Partners, a fixed income absolute return fund of funds
    led by founder Alexander Klikoff. Fintan boosts
    Cantor’s assets under management and advisement to
    $3 billion. Cantor’s asset management clients
    include institutional investors and high net worth clients
    globally. Prior to founding Fintan, Klikoff managed Stanford
    University’s endowment portfolio that was
    allocated to hedge funds.
    — 

    Now this is what you call finding a bargain in a super sale.
    Shares of J.C. Penney surged another 9.34 percent, to close at
    $7.96. The stock is now up 50 percent in just the five trading
    days since it reported its most recent quarterly results. The
    stock, once held by a handful of hedge fund firms, lost its
    biggest booster when Pershing Square Capital
    Management’s William Ackman unloaded his
    entire stake in the ailing retailer last August.
    — 

    Activist favorite Sotheby’s fell only about
    half of a percentage point Monday after plummeting 6.67 percent
    on Friday. That’s when the auctioneer admitted it
    took possession of a 59.60-carat pink diamond after the buyer
    couldn’t pay the $83 million it had pledged.
    — 

    BNY Mellon named Frank La Salla chief executive officer of
    its Alternative Investment Services business. He was most
    recently managing director at Pershing, a BNY Mellon company,
    where he was responsible for all of Pershing’s
    business outside of the U.S. He reports to Samir Pandiri, BNY
    Mellon executive vice president and CEO of asset servicing, who
    held LaSalla’s new position for the past two
    years.

About Winton









 
Why Invest        Philosophy & Investment Systems        Team     
 













 








Why Invest 

Led by David Harding, who has  been at the forefront of systematic investment for over 25 years,* having  founded two of the world’s leading quantitative investment firms.
Employs over 100 Research and Data staff continually working on enhancements to Winton’s investment systems.  
Manages assets on behalf of some of the largest and  most sophisticated institutional investors, including pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and global financial institutions, as well as wholesale clients.
Over 400 employees, with offices in  London, Oxford, New York, San Francisco, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Tokyo and Zurich.



Investment Philosophy

Winton’s investment solutions are based on the belief that profitable investment opportunities can be identified through the application of advanced statistical and pattern recognition techniques to large datasets.
 Such systems employ forecasts or signals that are typically weak and barely distinguishable from noise. Consequently, Winton focuses much of its efforts on establishing the statistical significance of signals and devising appropriate risk and cost controls.
Winton believes more reliable investment decisions can be made using statistical inference from empirical evidence than deductive reasoning from economic axioms.

Investment Systems

 Winton's investment systems are the  product of nearly two decades of applying science, technology and statistical  research to investment management. The systems combine forecasts of returns, volatilities and correlations with estimates of transaction costs to arrive at  daily investment decisions.

                        There are substantial risks and conflicts of interests associated with Managed Futures and commodities accounts, and you should only invest risk capital. The success of an investment is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor (CTA) to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade. The identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult, requires skill, and involves a significant degree of uncertainty. CTAs have total trading authority, and the use of a single CTA could mean a lack of diversification and higher risk. The high degree of leverage often obtainable in commodity trading can work against you as well as for you, and can lead to large losses as well as gains. Returns generated from a CTA’s trading, if any, may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume. You can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment. If you use notional funding, you may lose more than your initial cash investment. Managed Futures and commodities accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees. It may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets. The disclosure document contains a complete description of each fee to be charged to your account by a CTA. CTAs may trade highly illiquid markets, or on foreign markets, and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request.
