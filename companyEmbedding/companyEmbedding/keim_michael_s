Spinelli continues in the role of president of Consumer Banking but will now be responsible for Univest’s entire financial center network including the Valley Green Bank Division offices. Hugh W. Connelly has been promoted to president of Small Business Lending for Univest Bank and Trust Co. in addition to continuing his responsibilities as president of Univest Capital, Inc., a small ticket commercial finance business and subsidiary of Univest Bank and Trust Co.  “While Univest Corporation has and will continue to focus on diversifying our business and building out our insurance, investment and other financial capabilities, we remain committed to growing our largest subsidiary, Univest Bank and Trust Co.,” said Jeffrey M. Schweitzer, president and chief executive officer of Univest Corporation.  “For nearly 140 years, Univest Bank and Trust Co. has been a leading community bank.  Our growth and investments in technology, people and convenience solutions have positioned us to deliver all of the products and services of a large financial institution while leveraging our local decision making and superior customer service.  I have worked with Mike for more than seven years and know he is the right person to lead this team and strategically work to move the bank forward.” Univest Corporation, which has $2.9 billion in assets, will be among the largest community financial institutions in the Philadelphia region, and one of the only remaining, once BB&T’s pending acquisition of National Penn Bank is completed in 2016.  With the acquisition of Valley Green Bank on January 1, 2015, Univest Bank and Trust Co. physically entered the Philadelphia market with three financial centers and one loan production office in Center City, a move which has proven to be beneficial as the company has expanded its footprint, deepened relationships and reported strong earnings growth in the first six months.    “I am honored to lead this experienced team as Univest remains focused on building our business both organically and through acquisition,” said Keim.  “With all of the disruption in the marketplace and many community and regional banks being acquired in the last few years, we are looking forward to expanding partnerships and building new relationships with customers still looking for a local, strong and stable community partner that values relationships and supports the communities in which we serve.” Univest Bank and Trust Co. started its business in 1876 in Souderton, Montgomery County, where the Corporation’s current headquarters still are today.  It operates 29 financial centers throughout Bucks, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties and has regional offices that provide lending and other financial solutions in Chester County, Philadelphia and the Lehigh Valley.  In 2014, Univest Corporation and its subsidiaries gave back more than $1.2 million to the communities it serves and its employees volunteered more than 15,500 hours, a testament to the story its executives share about being rooted in community. About Univest Corporation of PennsylvaniaUnivest Corporation of Pennsylvania (UVSP), including its wholly-owned subsidiary, Univest Bank and Trust Co., has $2.9 billion in assets and more than $3.0 billion in assets under management and supervision through its Wealth Management lines of business.

Description
The most comprehensive resource of its kind, Ciottone’s Disaster Medicine, 2nd Edition, thoroughly covers isolated domestic events as well as global disasters and humanitarian crises. Dr. Gregory Ciottone and more than 200 worldwide authorities share their knowledge and expertise on the preparation, assessment, and management of both natural and man-made disasters, including terrorist attacks and the threat of biological warfare. Part 1 offers an A-to-Z resource for every aspect of disaster medicine and management, while Part 2 features an exhaustive compilation of every conceivable disaster event, organized to facilitate quick reference in a real-time setting.
Reviews"There is no better time to announce a newly updated edition of the leading textbook on disaster medicine. ... Ciottone’s Disaster Medicine is a tightly edited, thorough exploration of all aspects of disaster medicine. The book achieves its lofty goal of being complete yet accessible. It meets the challenge of being up to date in a dynamic field. Clear chapter structure offers both historical perspective and current practice, and summaries allow readers to build a framework for concepts that improve retention. ... Appealing to students, the book provides all the necessary fundamentals that will facilitate more advanced study. Practitioners of disaster medicine will find the book an excellent resource for reference and referral. ... The rigorous academic skill of the expert authors lends each chapter insight, authority, and thoroughness. ... Although a read-through of this list of evils may be overwhelming, this book offers the best that could be offered: timeless, thoroughness, and usability."

-Stephen C. Morris, MD, MPH (Annals of Emergency Medicine, Volume 67, no. 6: June 2016)
"We recently experienced a surge of patients in our emergency department with tear gas exposure from a riot. After the event, I consulted the book and there were two succinct chapters that related to this event… Looking forward, I intend to spend some time really engaging with this book and saving it for reference as more disasters are inevitable…the book feels not only comprehensive, but truly definitive."
-Michael D. Zwank, MD, RDMS, FACEP (University of Minnesota Medical School) Doody’s Score: 95 - 4 Stars!
