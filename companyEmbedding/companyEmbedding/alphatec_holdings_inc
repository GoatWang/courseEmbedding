Improving Patient Outcomes
Keeshara is an energetic, active 17-year old high school student. Her favorite hobby is basketball and she plays on the varsity team at her school in Virginia. At the age of 14 she was diagnosed with scoliosis, a disorder in which there is a sideways curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees, often accompanied by rotation to one side.
It affects approximately 7 million people in the U.S. alone, and in most cases the cause is unknown.
Keeshara’s first symptoms began in her early teens as back pain, which made it uncomfortable for her to play her favorite sport.

Main navigationHome / Product Portfolio / Minimally Invasive Surgery / Battalion™ Lateral Access System and Squadron™ Lateral RetractorBattalion™ Lateral Access System and Squadron™ Lateral Retractor









A customizable response to a patient’s unique anatomical challenges

 



The Battalion Lateral System with the Squadron Lateral Retractor provides surgeons with a next-generation lateral system with unrivaled, unique functionality designed to improve clinical outcomes by reducing tissue creep, minimizing psoas retraction time, and achieving alignment and fusion objectives.
The system is designed to allow surgeons to customize the access to match the patient’s unique anatomy including:

Independent retraction of the cranial/caudal blades
DepthControl™ technology that provides in-situ, low profile, blade height adjustment
LevelToe™ mechanics ensure that the blades maintain a parallel plane when toed up to 15°
Straight, angled, and offset instrumentation to provide access to the L4/L5 segment
Robust implant/inserter interface with one step ETA (engage, twist, attach) loading
Battalion Lateral Spacer is available in 0° to 15° of lordosis with a variety of width and height options for the lumbar and thoracic spine
Intelligent instrumentation featuring Stealth Coating™ to minimize glare, AlphaTexture™ handles, and modular instruments with depth and orientation markings

The Squadron Lateral Retractor is compatible with most neuromonitoring platforms enabling access safely through the psoas. The system is recommended for use with the Arsenal™ Spinal Fixation System or the Illico® MIS Posterior Fixation System. The Battalion Lateral implant is also cleared for use with both autograft and allograft biologic materials.

Alphatec Holdings, Inc. Announces FDA Clearance for Its Adjustable Bridge Product
CARLSBAD, Calif., July 18, 2006 /PRNewswire-FirstCall via COMTEX News Network/ -- Alphatec Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: ATEC), a medical device company that provides customized spinal products and a broad suite of spine fusion solutions, announced today that it has received 510(k) clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") allowing it to market its adjustable bridge product.  As previously disclosed in Company filings, Alphatec entered in to a private label distribution agreement with Sea Spine, Inc. for the sale of Sea Spine's Cross Link(R) adjustable bridge product under Alphatec's private label.  This FDA clearance will allow Alphatec to begin the immediate commercial sale of its private label adjustable bridge, which will be used in combination with the Company's Zodiac(R) line of polyaxial pedicle screws. Ronald G. Hiscock, President and Chief Executive Officer of Alphatec remarked, "Receipt of this 510(k) clearance is an important milestone for the commercial sale of our adjustable bridge product.  We believe that many surgeons prefer the use of an adjustable bridge in order to provide additional stabilization in multi-level spinal surgeries.  As such, we hope to see increased revenue per surgery as physicians make use of this excellent product complement.  Once again, Alphatec has demonstrated its commitment to expanding its product offering with high quality products and services that surgeons require." About Alphatec Alphatec is a medical device company focused on the design, development, manufacturing and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders.  Alphatec's principal product offerings are primarily focused on the U.S. spine fusion market, which is estimated to approach $3 billion in 2007, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Alphatec Spine, Inc., and include a variety of spinal implant products and systems comprised of components such as spine screws, spinal spacers, and plates that offer multiple solutions to address patients' needs.  In addition to Alphatec's U.S. presence, it also participates in the Japanese spine fusion and orthopedic trauma markets through its subsidiary, Alphatec Pacific, Inc.  Our mission is to be a value based leader in the spinal market by providing unmatched service to and taking scientific direction from our physician customers.  We do so through our unique in-house manufacturing facility in Carlsbad, California that allows us to respond quickly and to customize innovative products needed for spine fusion surgery. Forward Looking Statements This press release may contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainty, including statements that Alphatec's commercial sale of such private label adjustable bridge products will occur in the time periods planned, that many of Alphatec's multi-level fusion surgeries are candidates for use with an adjustable bridge product, that surgeons will adopt our private label adjustable bridge product, and that our private label adjustable bridge product will provide complementary revenues by increasing our revenue per surgery.  Such statements are based on management's current expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.  Alphatec cautions investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, the following: Alphatec's ability to develop and expand its spine fusion business in the United States and Japan, Alphatec's ability to expand and maintain a successful sales and marketing organization, continuation of favorable third party payor reimbursement for procedures performed using our products, unanticipated expenses or liabilities or other adverse events affecting cash flow or Alphatec's ability to achieve profitability, uncertainty of additional funding, uncertainty of success in developing any new products, failure to successfully introduce and develop new products, including products related to license agreements, failure to obtain FDA clearance or approval for particular devices, Alphatec's ability to compete with other competing products and with emerging new technologies within and outside of spinal fusion, product liability exposure and patent infringement claims.  Please refer to  the risks detailed in Alphatec's Form S-1 on file with the SEC, as well as the risks detailed  from time to time in Alphatec's SEC reports, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, reports on Form 8-K and annual reports on Form 10-K.  We disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, unless required by law.

Alphatec Holdings, Inc. Enhances Technology and Product Portfolio With Global Licensing Agreement




















April 11, 2007 06:00 ET

 | Source: Alphatec Holdings, Inc.





CARLSBAD, Calif., April 11, 2007 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- Alphatec Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATEC), a leading medical device company focused on the design, development, manufacturing and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders, announced today that it has entered into a license agreement with Roger P. Jackson, M.D. for the global rights to use certain polyaxial screw, helical flange, and instrumentation technology designed by Dr. Jackson. The technology license enables Alphatec to rapidly develop a second-generation polyaxial pedicle screw system that will be manufactured via a proprietary bottom-loaded process. Terms of the agreement, which were not disclosed, include royalties on net sales of products incorporating the licensed technology.


"After a thorough review of the current intellectual property landscape in the polyaxial screw arena, rigorous product testing and multi-faceted focus group feedback, we are extremely pleased with our agreement with Dr. Jackson to license his leading polyaxial screw technology, instruments and methodologies," stated M. Ross Simmonds, Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Alphatec. Simmonds added, "This global license agreement further demonstrates our commitment to providing complete product solutions targeted at serving the needs of the spinal disorder marketplace and enables our surgeon customers to have additional technology options while utilizing Alphatec as their trusted spinal medical device partner."


"I am very pleased to have entered into a license agreement with Alphatec Spine, one of the recognized leaders in the development, manufacture, and marketing of products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders," said Dr. Jackson. "This polyaxial screw technology will enable surgeons to have additional product and technology options in surgery and I am confident that Alphatec is a superbly equipped partner to deliver this technology to the surgeon community and their patients."


The polyaxial screw technology exclusively licensed by Alphatec incorporates a bottom-loaded cam-capture manufacturing process embodied in a pending patent application and certain other proprietary technology owned by Dr. Jackson. Alphatec also acquired the non-exclusive rights to use the helical flange technology developed by Dr. Jackson in conjunction with the polyaxial screw. The helical flange technology pertains to the set screw of the polyaxial screw and contains the proprietary elements embodied in US Patent No. 6,726,689.

					Full Description



Alphatec Holdings, Inc., incorporated on March 4, 2005, is a medical technology company. The Company through its subsidiary, Alphatec Spine, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Alphatec Spine), designs, develops, manufactures and markets products for the surgical treatment of spine disorders. Its product portfolio and pipeline addresses the cervical, thoracolumbar and intervertebral regions of the spine and covers a range of spinal disorders and surgical procedures. Its principal product offerings are focused on the global market for fusion-based spinal disorder solutions. Its products include Cervical and Cervico-Thoracic Products; Thoracolumbar Fixation Products; Spinal Spacers; minimally invasive surgery (MIS) Products, and Biologics.Cervical and Cervico-Thoracic ProductsThe Company's Trestle Luxe Anterior Cervical Plate System has a window that enables the surgeon to have graft site and end plate visualization. Other features of the Trestle Luxe Anterior Cervical Plate system includes a self-retaining screw-locking mechanism that is designed to ensure locking of the plate and a flush profile after the screws are inserted. The Company's Solanas Posterior Cervico/Thoracic Fixation System consists of rods, polyaxial screws, hooks and connectors that provide a solution for posterior cervico/thoracic fusion procedures. It has also designed the Solanas Posterior Cervico/Thoracic System to be used in combination with existing Zodiac Degenerative Spinal Fixation System and its Avalon Occipital Plate, thereby providing surgeons with a solution for occipito-cervico-thoracic fixation. The Pegasus Anchored Cervical Interbody (ACI) system provides surgeons an approach to traditional anterior cervical disectomy and fusion (ACDF). It features a single-step delivery of a spacer with an integrated anchoring mechanism.Thoracolumbar Fixation ProductsThe Company's Arsenal Degenerative Spinal Fixation System is a system for degenerative spinal fusion procedures. The Arsenal Degenerative System provides a solution to combat degenerative pathologies. The Arsenal CBx Cortical Bone Fixation System utilizes a midline approach and cortical bone trajectory. Arsenal CBx is a fixation option for both posterior lateral interbody fusion (PLIF) or transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) applications. The Company's Zodiac Degenerative Spinal Fixation System is a spinal system that offers polyaxial pedicle screws, accompanying implants and instruments for the stabilization of the thoracolumbar spine. Its Zodiac Deformity Spinal Fixation System is a system of instrumentation and implants designed to enable the surgeon to address patient-specific spinal deformity correction procedures. The Zodiac Deformity Spinal Fixation System contains polyaxial screws that are similar in design to those in the Zodiac Degenerative Spinal Fixation System. The Zodiac Deformity Spinal Fixation System offers components that are used in deformity correction procedures and deformity specific instrumentation. Its OsseoScrew Spinal Fixation System is a pedicle screw system that is designed to provide a solution for patients who have poor bone density. The OsseoScrew System is designed to be implanted into the pedicle and then expanded after implementation to achieve increased screw fixation in bone with poor density.Spinal SpacersThe Company's Battalion Universal Spacer System offers comfort, control and design for surgeons performing PLIF/TLIF procedures. The Battalion implants introduce an alternative to interbody fusion by combining the elasticity and radiolucency of polyetheretherketone (PEEK) with a titanium coating for potential osseointegration. The implants, which come in both a straight and curved footprint, feature a bulleted nose for relaxed insertion. The Battalion System also features approximately 180-degree locking inserter that assists with protection of neural elements during insertion of the implant. The Battalion System features instrumentation for disc preparation, access and implantation. It offers multiple implant designs, each of which is available in various shapes and heights. Certain of its Novel spinal spacers are made of titanium and others are made of PEEK. Its Novel PEEK spinal spacers have been approved for use in both the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine. The Company's Alphatec Solus locking ALIF spinal spacer (Alphatec Solus) is a zero-profile PEEK and titanium device offering over four points of fixation. Alphatec Solus features a one-step insertion and deployment feature and is used in anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) procedures.Minimally Invasive Surgery ProductsThe Illico Minimally Invasive Surgery System is a cannulated pedicle screw system that is designed to be inserted via a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Access to the spine is gained through a small incision. The surgeon is then able to see the surgical site by using a small canal through which implants are inserted into the patient with a minimum amount of disruption to the surrounding tissue. The BridgePoint Spinous Process Fixation System is a spinous process fixation system. The system allows surgeons to fixate the spine using an invasive approach by attaching a plate to the spinous process of the vertebral body during spinal fusion surgery.BiologicsThe Company's Neocore Osteoconductive Matrix is a synthetic scaffold for the regeneration of bone. Neocore Osteoconductive Matrix provides an environment for bone growth through a synthetic scaffold. When hydrated with patient bone marrow aspirate (MA) Neocore becomes a complete bone graft, which possesses all the necessary components of bone growth. Engineered to perform similar to natural bone, Neocore's composition and porosity provides revascularization throughout graft and supports replacement of three-dimensional matrix with healthy bone growth.The Company competes with Medtronic, Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Stryker Spine, NuVasive, Zimmer, Biomet, Inc., Orthofix, Globus Medical, Sea Spine, LDR Spine and K2 Medical.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Improving Patient Outcomes
Keeshara is an energetic, active 17-year old high school student. Her favorite hobby is basketball and she plays on the varsity team at her school in Virginia. At the age of 14 she was diagnosed with scoliosis, a disorder in which there is a sideways curvature of the spine greater than 10 degrees, often accompanied by rotation to one side.
It affects approximately 7 million people in the U.S. alone, and in most cases the cause is unknown.
Keeshara’s first symptoms began in her early teens as back pain, which made it uncomfortable for her to play her favorite sport.
