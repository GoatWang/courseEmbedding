GAME DEVELOPMENT

Got a great game idea?
Perhaps just an idea or a concept you want to turn into a game.Or maybe you have some work done on it and need help fleshing it out. No matter the level of completion, we have the writing creativity and talent to make your game the center of attention.




Have trouble finding artists or need someone to layout your manuscript?Whether you need to define your art style or have a particular style in mind, we have access to numerous award-winning artists and layout designers to give your game that extra visual edge.




Want to crowdfund your game but have no experience? As serial creators we've learned a thing or two about running  successful crowdfunding campaigns. From project review, to running the entire campaign our expertise is at your disposal.




From software to games, launch is the hardest part of any project.We can help your game find a quality manufacturer. Get your game out to your backers, and help you get your games into distribution and Amazon.
