Domesticates in Delaware and Becomes a Fully Reporting U.S. IssuerPress Releases2017-05-245 Views Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - May 24, 2017) - SusGlobal Energy Corp. ("SusGlobal Energy") or the ("Company") is pleased to announce that it has domesticated into Delaware and has become a fully reporting U.S. issuer with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") after filing a Registration Statement on Form S-4, with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective on May 10, 2017 and filing a Certificate of Domestication and Certificate of Incorporation with the State of Delaware.Being a fully-reporting issuer in the United States significantly expands the company's eligibility for both analyst coverage and investor interest. Many institutional investors are unable to acquire the securities of a company that is not fully reporting with the SEC. As a fully reporting company, the company's filings will now be accessible through the SEC's main website (via the EDGAR system), allowing investors, the general public, and financial analysts to extensively review the Company's operations and financial performance.Marc Hazout, Executive Chairman and President of SusGlobal Energy, said that becoming a fully reporting U.S. issuer is another measurable step in SusGlobal's aggressive business model, which aims to build value through the identification, development and use of underutilized assets, acquisitions and corporate finance initiatives. "Our aim is to marry a number of strategically acquired and developed high margin technologies with these identified municipal and private assets to provide a sustainable waste to energy solution," Mr. Hazout said.Mr. Hazout concluded, "In a short period of time we have recruited a proven management team, sourced financing and acquired world class technologies. We plan to optimize value and liquidity for our stakeholders with our listing on an American exchange, continuing to execute on our plan and today is another solid step in that direction."

Price on the Grant Date. The Expiry Date for each Option shall be
set by the Board at the time of issue of the Option and shall not

assignable (or transferable) by the Optionee.
3.2 Limits on Shares Issuable
on Exercise of Options
The maximum number of Shares
which may be issuable pursuant to options granted under the Plan
shall be 2,000,000 Shares or such additional amount as may be
approved from time to time by the shareholders of the Company. The
aggregate number of Shares that may be reserved for issuance to any
one individual under the Plan and under all of the Company's other
previously established or proposed share compensation arrangements
shall not exceed 5% of the total number of issued and outstanding
Shares on a non-diluted basis at time of the grant. The aggregate
number of Shares that may be reserved for issuance to Consultants

established or proposed share compensation arrangements shall not

OPTION

an Option may be exercised to purchase any number of Shares up to
the number of Vested Unissued Option Shares at any time after the
Grant Date up to 5:00 pm local time on the Expiry Date and shall

of the Shares in respect of which the Option is exercised, upon and
subject to the provisions of the Plan. Delivery of the optionee's
cheque payable to the Company in the amount of the Option Price
shall constitute payment of the Option Price unless the cheque is
not honoured upon presentation in which case the Option shall not
have been validly exercised.

not normally accept plans which permit vesting over a period of

(b) options issued to Consultants
engaged in Investor Relations Activities must vest in stages over a
period of 12 months with no more than 1/4 of the Options vesting in
any three month period;

SusGro© BioFertilizer
SusGro© BioFertilizer
SusGlobal’s proprietary technology transforms biosolids and organic waste into a pathogen free recognized organic fertilizer.
As chemical fertilizers become less used and alternative sources of valuable organic matter become more difficult to source, SusGro pathogen free organic fertilizer provides an economical, sustainable and highly effective alternative to traditional fertilization.
SusGro is an organically-based, concentrated organic pathogen free liquid fertilizer product with a full complement of nutrients suitable for a wide range of fertilization requirements.
SusGro© – Features & Benefits
MICRONUTRIENTS: In addition to the macros, SusGro provides a variety of valuable micronutrients including high concentrations of Sulphur, Calcium, Iron and Magnesium.
ORGANIC MATTER: SusGro is also ideal for building soil structure due to a uniquely high concentration of organic matter in the material. This helps to improve water retention, soil tilth and pore space.
MULTI-YEAR BENEFIT: Similar to manure, SusGro is high in organic matter and valuable nutrients that are released slowly, over time, thus providing essential benefits for several years after application.
QUALITY & SAFETY: SusGlobal’s proven, quality controlled, proprietary manufacturing approach leverages a combination of heat treating and high-speed shearing to produce SusGro. The result is a truly unique organic fertilizer product that is healthy for the soil, safe, reliable and pathogen free.
