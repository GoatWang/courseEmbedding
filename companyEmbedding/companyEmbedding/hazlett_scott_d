EVANSVILLE, Ind.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accuride Corporation (NYSE: ACW), a leading supplier of components to

      Accuride Wheels business unit, effective immediately. In this capacity, 
      he will report directly to Rick Dauch, President and Chief Executive 
      Officer.
    


      Hazlett takes over the role previously held by Leigh Wright, who will

      record leading the transportation and industrial business units of

      and efficiency of Accuride Wheels, establish common operational and 
      supply chain processes, and fully capitalize on growing market demand 
      for our aluminum and steel-wheel products.”
    

      Hazlett joins Accuride from Kansas City-based MachineryLink, Inc., an 
      early-stage agricultural services firm, where he had served as President 
      and CEO since 2006. Previously, he was a Partner with Conway, Mackenzie 
      & Dunleavy, a Detroit-based industrial turnaround professional services 
      firm, where he contributed to the firm’s interim management and 
      operations practice. He served as group president of TriMas 
      Corporation’s $540 million Cequent Transportation Accessories unit, a 
      global component manufacturer for the consumer and commercial towing, 
      trailering and cargo management markets.
    

      Earlier in his career, Hazlett was Senior Vice President of CNH Global’s 
      $1 billion global agricultural aftermarket business and led Case 
      Corporation’s $650 million North American aftermarket unit as Vice 
      President and General Manager. He began his industrial career at James 
      River Corporation, where he led a $200 million food and consumer 
      products packaging unit.
    

      Hazlett’s corporate career was preceded by his 10-year service with the 
      U.S. Army as a Field Artillery officer. Hazlett is a graduate of the 
      United States Military Academy at West Point, where he earned a Bachelor 
      of Science degree in Industrial Management. He has an MBA from Long

Accuride Corporation Announces Leadership Changes

Scott Hazlett, Senior Vice President, Accuride Wheels and Gunite
EVANSVILLE, Ind. – August 27, 2012 – Accuride Corporation (NYSE: ACW), a leading supplier of components to the commercial vehicle industry, today announced the appointment of Scott D. Hazlett as Senior Vice President and General Manager, Accuride Wheels and Gunite, reporting to Accuride President & CEO Rick Dauch.  Hazlett will take on the added leadership responsibility for Accuride’s Gunite business unit on September 1, 2012, upon the retirement of Kenneth W. Sparks, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Gunite and Imperial, who is concluding three years of service to Accuride.  Separately, Greg Kern, Vice President of Accuride’s Imperial Group business unit who had previously reported to Sparks, now will report directly to Dauch. 
“Scott Hazlett has done an exceptional job revitalizing our core Wheels business, while directing the launch and commercialization of critical new aluminum wheel manufacturing capacity this year,” said Rick Dauch.  “He is a highly effective operations leader, and I am confident that he will complete the manufacturing improvements and consolidation underway at Gunite with speed and efficiency.  The members of Accuride’s Leadership Team appreciate Ken Sparks’ contributions to the company’s positive momentum and wish him the very best in his retirement.”
Hazlett joined Accuride as Senior Vice President and General Manager, Accuride Wheels, in October 2011 from Kansas City-based MachineryLink, Inc., an early-stage agricultural services firm, where he had served as President and CEO since 2006.

Earlier in his career, he served as group president of TriMas Corporation’s $540 million Cequent Transportation Accessories unit, was Senior Vice President of CNH Global’s $1 billion global agricultural aftermarket business, and led Case Corporation’s $650 million North American aftermarket unit.
Hazlett’s corporate career was preceded by his 10-year service with the U.S. Army as a Field Artillery officer. Hazlett is a graduate of the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Industrial Management. He has an MBA from Long Island University and a Master of Education degree from Auburn University. He also completed the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business Executive Management Program.
Ken Sparks joined Accuride Corporation in 2009 and subsequently led its Imperial, Gunite, and Brillion business units, as well as the former Bostrom business unit, implementing operational improvements at each.  Most recently, he served as Senior Vice President and General Manager, Gunite and Imperial.  In 2011, he was Vice President and General Manager of Gunite and Brillion, and in 2010 was Vice President and General Manager of Structural Products, which then included the Imperial and Bostrom units.
