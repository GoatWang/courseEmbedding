New Listing of First ETFs Created by  Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management Co., Ltd.  ~ NZAM ETF J-REIT Index, NZAM ETF TOPIX Ex-Financials~












Today, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Inc. (TSE) announced that "NZAM ETF J-REIT Index" (Code: 1595) and "NZAM ETF TOPIX Ex-Financials" (Code: 1596) managed by Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management Co., Ltd. (NZAM) were listed on the TSE market.

These are the first ETFs managed by Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management Co., Ltd. which is both a subsidiary of Norinchukin Bank and a member of the National Mutual Insurance Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives. Both entities are some of the biggest institutional investors in Japan.

The underlying indicators are "Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index" and "TOPIX Ex-Financials." "Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Index" represents the overall real estate investment trust market of Japan. ETFs tracking this indicator offer the possible merit of receiving relatively high dividends. "TOPIX Ex-Financials" is composed of the common stocks listed on TSE First Section except for the "Banks" "Securities and Commodities Futures," "Insurance " and "Other Financing Business" sectors. Therefore, ETFs tracking this indicator comply with Basel III's so-called "double-gearing problems," and also achieve performance close to that of TOPIX. 

The listing ceremony for the ETFs was held at Tokyo Stock Exchange today, with related parties in attendance.

Mr. Takatani, Chairman & CEO of NZAM commented, "We are so delighted to have our first ETF listed in Tokyo Stock Exchange. The total amount of ETF in Japan had an increase of about 4trillion yen in previous year, which shows investors’ high expectation toward ETF. We will continuously make a full effort to provide a wide variety of products in order to fulfil investors’ needs."

Mr. Kiyota, President & CEO of TSE, commented "We are delighted to welcome the new ETFs ‘NZAM ETF J-REIT Index’ and ‘NZAM ETF TOPIX Ex-Financials’ to our market today, and also very glad to welcome Norinchukin Zenkyoren Asset Management Co., Ltd. to our ETF market. We are strongly confident that these two ETFs will be useful tools for investors to expand their options when implementing investment strategies. TSE will continue working to provide a much more convenient market for all investors."

The Norinchukin Bank (also known as Nochu Bank) is a Japanese cooperative bank serving over 5,612 agricultural, fishing and forestry cooperatives from its headquarters in Tokyo. The bank is one of Japan’s largest institutional investors with an investment portfolio of more than US$400 billion and assets exceeding US$840 billion. The bank is well known as Japan’s largest hedge fund. Through overseas branches located in New York City, London, and Singapore, the bank invests in bond, securitization product, stock, private equity, and real estate. Since huge assets as much as US$840 billion are managed by only around 3,200 employees, the bank is mainly engaged in asset management and large scale corporate financing. The asset management division is constituted of more than 300 MBA holders from top-tier schools. Its members include cooperative federations such as the Japan Agricultural Cooperatives (JA) and the Japan Fishery Cooperatives (JF). Norinchukin supports political lobbies who oppose agricultural imports and the deterioration of living standards in rural areas. Norinchukin has 41 offices throughout Japan and five overseas branches.
History[edit]
The Norinchukin Bank was founded on December 20, 1923 by the Japanese government to support the country's agriculture industry. Norinchukin is derived from the Japanese words No - Rin - Chu - Kin (Agriculture, forestry, central, bank). Norinchukin suffered from a lack of investment funds during World War II, due to restrictions by the Japanese government. After the war, Norinchukin played an important role in rebuilding the country. Once the government encouraged divestment in the textile industry, Norinchukin formed a political lobby to support the agriculture sector. In 1979, Norinchukin set up an international department and formed a relat hukin posted a net income of ¥29.5 billion.

Checklist: 9 Questions Every Advisor Should Be Able to Answer 




Whatever your priorities, this can help you find someone who understands you and has the resources to help you manage your financial life 











AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, WE ALL face major turning points in our lives—getting married, becoming a parent, receiving a life-changing promotion, getting ready to retire. At times like these, many people feel a need for financial help, and start to wonder whether working with a financial advisor might make sense. That's when the search begins.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future. Someone who'll be there for you for years to come, and who can provide more than just stock recommendations.
To find an advisor who can help you with those decisions, don't be afraid to ask the following tough questions—they'll help you get a clear idea of what you can expect from the relationship and whether it makes sense for you.
1. What types of clients do you work with?
Some advisors have special experience working with business owners or members of a specific profession. Others might have particular knowledge in a specialty, such as sustainable investing or retirement planning. Ask what team members or resources from around their company they can call upon to help you meet your specific needs.
The challenge is finding someone you'll feel comfortable talking to about the most personal things—your family, your money, your hopes for your future.
2. What is your track record?
No advisor can or should promise financial results based on past performance. And beware those who do. But an advisor with a record of long relationships with clients likely provides the kind of service that earns their loyalty.
3. How often will we talk?
An advisor should be committed to conversations in person, by phone, or online—whatever your preference is—as often as you require. Every client has different needs and expectations. Be upfront with the advisor about how frequently and by what means you would like to get together to discuss your finances.
4. How realistic are my goals?
Even if you have a strong idea of what you want to accomplish with your money, the right advisor can help you better understand and prioritize your goals, including making any necessary tradeoffs based on your finances, timelines and investing preferences.

5. How will we keep my strategy on course?
Even the best strategy will need adjusting as financial markets and your goals change. An advisor should have a plan for regular reviews and the ability to correct as market conditions and your priorities shift.
6. What happens if the markets are volatile? Will you call me?
When markets get scary, there's nothing worse than feeling isolated and alone. One of an advisor's most vital functions is to reach out at such times, hear your concerns, offer perspective, and talk about any needed adjustments to your strategy.
7. What if I'm upset about a service issue or an investment?
As life becomes increasingly automated, there's nothing like a human voice and quick response when you're concerned about a financial matter. Advisors who define their success by your success will be eager to quickly resolve any such issues.
8. Who will I actually be working with?
Many advisors have teams of professionals to enhance the services they provide. Ask who you'd be working with on a regular basis and their level of experience. Beyond the immediate team, does the company supporting them have access to a broad array of financial insights and resources?
9. How do I pay you for your work?
It's never easy to ask, but the right advisors will welcome this question. Clarity about fees is vital to a successful relationship. Payment—whether a percentage of assets or per transaction—should be structured around your needs and preferences.
