Globatom Announces Pending Launch of New Digital Platform That 
      Promises to Disrupt and Simplify Byzantine End-to-End, Import/Export 
      Services Industry




Turnkey Cloud-Based Service Will Focus First on China/US Trade and 
      Save Businesses Time and Money While Providing Added Transparency






August 20, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--A new start-up is aiming to make life significantly easier for companies 
      engaged in trade between the US and China. Seattle-based Globatom is 
      introducing an intuitive, cloud-based solution that promises to bring 
      the $160 billion global freight forwarding services business into the 21st 
      century while saving clients an average of 25% versus costs for 
      traditional methods.
    


      The Globatom platform uses a seamless blend of digital processes coupled 
      with manual interactions to provide a more comprehensive, virtually 
      turnkey solution versus more limited existing competitors like Flexport 
      and Freightos. One of the exciting elements of the Globatom dashboard is 
      a visual map that shows businesses exactly where their products are 
      in-transit. Globatom will also provide real-time cost and time estimates 
      to help clients determine whether air or ocean transit makes the most 
      sense for a given shipment.
    

      According to Globatom founder Daniel Acosta: “US exporters have long 
      suffered from a mysterious mix of middlemen who practiced an array of 
      archaic manual steps that are increasingly unnecessary in the new 
      digital world. Globatom provides a unique comprehensive approach that 
      will revolutionize, simplify and illuminate the import/export process 
      over the next decade much as the internet has transformed other 
      industries such as newspapers, television and advertising.”


      The need for a technology revolution for the freight forwarding industry 
      has been validated by a leading industry association, The 
      Transpacific Stabilization Agreement, whose spokesman Niels Erich 
      stated: “The right technology is badly needed.” The Globatom 
      digital platform itself has received rave reviews from a variety of 
      interested parties in the freight-forwarding ecosystem. David Bruck, CEO 
      of a fast-growing chemical distribution company called Tryline, says: “Globatom 
      opened our eyes to the unnecessary expenses we were incurring in our 
      exporting of chemical ingredients to China.”


      The Company, which is just now looking for seed funding, was one of five 
      finalists in a recent Washington Technology and Industry Association start-up 
      competition that included over a hundred companies. The platform is in 
      its final stages of development and will complete beta testing with a 
      number of interested businesses this Fall.
    

Globatom (www.globatom.com) 
      is a new cloud-based, end-to-end digital platform that promises to 
      revolutionize the freight forwarding services industry. The Company 
      plans to enter beta testing this Fall and is soliciting requests from 
      businesses engaged in US/China trade.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

                In today’s international shipping world, businesses spend days creating and managing shipments. This is an indus-try that relies heavily on manual ef-forts, people and old school technolo-gies and processes. Most of the time is spent switching between tasks and using a range of applications for each step of the process. 600 million containers move around the world every year and out of that, 200 million containers in the US & China. An average $10 per shipment fee creates an addressable market of $2B.

                In today’s international shipping world, businesses spend days creating and managing shipments. This is an indus-try that relies heavily on manual ef-forts, people and old school technolo-gies and processes. Most of the time is spent switching between tasks and using a range of applications for each step of the process. 600 million containers move around the world every year and out of that, 200 million containers in the US & China. An average $10 per shipment fee creates an addressable market of $2B.
The Globatom system will eliminate the majority of manual processes that are used today and replace them with a technology based platform. The platform will host all the players needed to execute the import/export process and allow the customer to choose the best vendor option or packaged solution given by the system. The individual vendors or packaged selection will use predetermined algorithms that capture the historic transactional data and categorize vendors on the basis of price, time and performance.

Our system will house all the forms needed for the shipping, customs and additional requirements electronically. On Phase 2 forms will be pre-filled out using the information gathered in the initial steps that create the transaction.  Customers will then get to review and electronically sign all forms.
The system will also provide live 24/7 tracking of the shipment (currently engaged with 2 satellite data providers for Ocean transaction and 1 for Air) as well as landed cost calculations, lead times calculations and dynamic dashboards. Since all the players and transactions in the pipeline are covered in one environment, gathering and interpreting data and analytics for the customer becomes easy and almost instantaneous.  

Finally Globatom will provide predictive analytics (machine learning). We will use 6 to 10 years’ worth of historical data to provide analytics on best and most cost effective routes, carriers and ports. Social media and weather patterns will provide recommendations and notifications on route selection and performance. Every transaction that runs through our system will trigger the machine learning algorithms to learn and provide enhanced shipping and routing options to our customers.

The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.
