 FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.  These statements involve risks and uncertainties,
including, among other things, statements regarding our business
strategy, future revenues and anticipated costs and
expenses.  Such forward-looking statements include, among
others, those statements including the words “expects,”
“anticipates,” “intends,”
“believes,” “may,” “will,”
“should,” “could,” “plans,”
“estimates,” and similar language or negative of such
terms.  Our actual results may differ significantly from
those projected in the forward-looking
statements.  Factors that might cause or contribute to
such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed
in Item 2 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.”  You are cautioned not to place undue
reliance on the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of
the date of this report.  Although we believe that the
expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are
reasonable, we do not know whether we can achieve positive future
results, levels of activity, performance, or
goals.  Actual events or results may differ
materially.  We undertake no obligation to publicly
release any revisions to the   forward-looking
statements or reflect events or circumstances taking place after
the date of this document.

1.           
General information

 

Green
Planet Bioengineering Co., Ltd, (the “Company”),
formerly known as Mondo Acquisition II, Inc, was incorporated in
the State of Delaware on October 30, 2006.

 

On
October 24, 2008, the Company entered into an agreement with the
shareholders of Elevated Throne Overseas Ltd. (“Elevated
Throne”) to acquire their issued and outstanding common
stocks in Elevated Throne by issuing 14,141,667 shares of its
common stock. The acquisition, which was consummated on the same
day, constituted a reverse takeover transaction (“RTO”)
and thereafter Elevated Throne became a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company.

 

Elevated
Throne was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (the
“BVI”) on May 8, 2008 as a limited liability company
with registered share capital of $50,000, divided into 50,000
common shares of $1 par value each. Elevated Throne formed Fujian
Green Planet Bioengineering Co., Ltd. (“Fujian Green
Planet”) as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise under the laws
of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) on
July 25, 2008. Fujian Green Planet has a registered capital of
$2,000,000. Pursuant to Fujian Green Planet’s articles of
association, Elevated Throne is required to contribute $2,000,000
to Fujian Green Planet as capital. The Company paid $300,000 and
$1,700,000 on September 7, 2009 and February 19, 2010,
respectively, to fully satisfy the business license requirement
according to the articles of association.

 

PRC law
places certain restrictions on roundtrip investments through
the acquisition of a PRC entity by PRC residents.  To
comply with these restrictions, in conjunction with the RTO, the
Company, via Fujian Green Planet, entered into and consummated
certain contractual arrangements with Sanming Huajian
Bio-Engineering Co., Ltd (“Sanming Huajian”) and their
respective stockholders pursuant to which the Company provides
Sanming Huajian with technology consulting and management services
and appoints its senior executives and approves all matters
requiring shareholders’ approval.  As a result of
these contractual arrangements, which obligates Fujian Green Planet
to absorb a majority of the risk of loss from the activities of
Sanming Huajian and enables Fujian Green Planet to receive a
majority of its expected residual returns, the Company accounts for
Sanming Huajian as a variable interest entity (“VIE”)
under FASB Interpretation No. 46R, “Consolidation of Variable
Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51” (the
“VIE Arrangement”).

 

Sanming
Huajian was organized under the laws of the PRC on April 16, 2004
under the name of Sanming Zhonjian Biological Technology Industry
Co., Ltd as a domestic corporation.  It is classified as
a non-joint capital stock corporation and therefore the capital
stock, consistent with most of the PRC corporations, are not
divided into a specific number of shares having a stated nominal
amount. Sanming Huajian is owned by Mr. Zhao Min, Ms. Zheng Minyan
and Jiangle Jianlong Mineral Industry Co., Ltd with equity interest
of 35%, 36% and 29% respectively. Mr. Zhao and Ms. Zheng
collectively own more than 90% of the Company’s issued and
outstanding common stock after the RTO.

 

The
reverse takeover accounting was used to account for the RTO and the
VIE Arrangement as Sanming Huajian was under common control of Mr.
Zhao and Ms. Zheng before and after the VIE Arrangement. These
financial statements, issued under the name of the Company,
represent the continuation of the financial statements of Sanming
Huajian.

General
information (Cont’d)




 

Following
the RTO and the VIE Arrangement, the Company is primarily engaged
in the manufacture, marketing and sale of extracts from tobacco
leaves residues.  The Company’s products include
Solanesol, Nicotine Sulphate, organic pesticides, organic
fertilizers, CoQ10 (raw format) and a patented organic health
supplement called “Paiqianshu”. Paiqianshu comes in
both liquid and pill forms and it is made from natural green barley
shoot extraction.  The Company operates manufacturing and
distribution primarily in the PRC.

 

On
June 17, 2009, the Company entered into a Preferred Share
Purchase Agreement with ONE Bio Corp. (“ONE”) pursuant
to which the Company agreed to sell and ONE agreed to acquire 5,101
shares of the Company’s preferred stock (“Preferred
Stock”), with par value $0.001 per share. Each share of the
Preferred Stock shall (a) provide ONE with the right to vote 1,000
votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the Company’s
shareholders and (b) be convertible into 1,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock. ONE paid to the Company for the said
shares of Preferred Stock $5,000,000 which was paid by ONE through
the issuance to the Company of 1,004,807 common shares (post
split), representing 4.9% of ONE’s issued and outstanding
common stock. The transaction closed on July 22, 2009 upon
receipt of all required documents and stock
certificates.

 

As part
of the transaction, the Company has also agreed that 35% of the
ONE’s shares issued to the Company shall be deposited into an
escrow account in the event the Company’s EBITDA for fiscal
year 2009 is less than the Company’s EBITDA for fiscal 2008,
the number of shares of ONE’s stock issued to the Company
shall be proportionately reduced as provided for in the Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement. The Company is also subject to a lockup
and leak out period and has one Piggy-Back Registration right as
further defined in the Preferred Stock Purchase
Agreement.

 

On April
14, 2010, we entered into an agreement with ONE Bio, Corp. pursuant
to which, among other things, (i) that certain Amended and Restated
Green Planet Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement made effective as
of June 17, 2009, between us and ONE Bio Corp. (“Amended and
Restated GP Preferred Stock Agreement”) was cancelled, (ii)
we returned to ONE Bio Corp the 1,004,808 shares of ONE Bio, Corp.
common stock that were issued to us pursuant to the Amended and
Restated GP Preferred Stock Agreement, and (iii) ONE Bio Corp
returned to us the 5,101 preferred  shares of our stock that
we issued to ONE Bio, Corp pursuant to the Amended and Restated GP
Preferred Stock Agreement.

 

On April
14, 2010, we granted to ONE an option to acquire 100% of the stock
of Elevated Throne Overseas Ltd. (“Elevated Throne”),
our 100% owned BVI subsidiary. In the event ONE exercises this
option, the closing of the transaction will be subject to the
approval of our stockholders. Furthermore, as a result of this
event and if the transaction is fully consummated, ONE will own
100% of Elevated Throne and its subsidiaries which constitutes
essentially all former operations of Green Planet. Green Planet, in
the event ONE exercises this option, will remain a subsidiary of
ONE and operate as a public shell corporation with the business
purpose to acquire or merge with an existing business
operation.

Summary of
significant accounting policies




 

Principles
of consolidation and basis of presentation

 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“U.S.
GAAP”).

 

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company, its subsidiaries and its 100% VIE Sanming Huajian. All
significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.

 




 



In the
opinion of the management of the Company, all adjustments, which
are of a normal recurring nature and necessary for a fair
presentation of the results for the period ended June 30, 2010,
have been made. These consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial foot notes thereto and the
Company’s Form 10K for the year ended December 31,
2009.




 

Use of
estimates

 

In
preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial
statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting periods. These estimates and
assumptions include, but are not limited to, the valuation of trade
receivables, inventories, fair value of available-for-sale
securities, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation, and the
estimation on useful lives and realizability of intangible assets
and property, plant and equipment. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.

 

Fair
Value Measurements

 

In April
2009, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”)
released ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,
(formerly SFAS No. 157 “ Fair Value Measurements
”) that defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements.

 

According
to ASC 820, investment measured and reported at fair value are
classified and disclosed in one of the following
hierarchy:

 




 



Level 1
-



Quoted
prices are available in active markets for identical investments as
of the reporting date. The type of investments included in Level 1
included listed equities and listed derivatives.




 




 



Level 2
-



Pricing
inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are
either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date,
and fair value is determined through the use of models or other
valuation methodologies.  Investments that are generally
included in this category include corporate bonds and loans, less
liquid and restricted equity securities and certain
over-the-counter derivatives.

Summary of
significant accounting policies (Cont’d)




 




 



Level 3
-



Pricing
inputs are unobservable for the investment and included situations
where there is little, if any, market activity for the
investment.  The inputs into the determination of fair
value require significant management judgment or
estimation.




 

On April
14, 2010, we entered into an agreement with ONE Bio, Corp. pursuant
to which, among other things, (i) that certain Amended and Restated
Green Planet Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement made effective as
of June 17, 2009, between us and ONE Bio Corp. (“Amended and
Restated GP Preferred Stock Agreement”) was
cancelled.

 

The
Company had no investments according to the fair value hierarchy
levels as of June 30, 2010:

 

Accumulated
other comprehensive income

 

Accumulated
other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet
represents foreign currency translation adjustment.

 

Available-for-sale
securities

 

Available-for-sale
securities include securities held for indefinite periods of time
that are not classified either as trading securities or as
held-to-maturity securities. Available-for-sale securities are
recognized at cost and carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
Unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and
recognized in a separate component of other comprehensive income,
net of the related tax effects, until realized.

 

Convertible
loan

 

The
Company’s convertible loan has non-detachable conversion
feature, that were in-the-money with a beneficial conversion
feature as of the commitment date. At issuance, the Company values
separately the beneficial conversion features in convertible loan.
Beneficial conversion feature is recognized by allocating to
additional paid-in capital of the net proceeds from the sale of the
convertible loan equal to the intrinsic value of the beneficial
conversion feature.  Intrinsic value is calculated as the
difference, as of the commitment date, between the conversion price
of the convertible loan and the closing price of the
Company’s common stock on the OTCBB, multiplied by the number
of shares of the Company’s common stock into which the
convertible loan is convertible. If the intrinsic value of the
beneficial conversion feature is greater than the net proceeds
allocated to the convertible loan, the amount of the discount
assigned to the beneficial conversion feature is limited to the
amount of the proceeds.  Interest expense is recognized
using the effective interest method, meaning that any premium or
discount upon issuance is amortized over the life of the
instrument.

Summary of

Allowance
for doubtful accounts

 

The
Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on
management’s assessment of the collectability of trade and
other receivables.  A considerable amount of judgment is
required in assessing the amount of the allowance; the Company
considers the historical level of credit losses and applies
percentages to aged receivable categories. The Company makes
judgments about the creditworthiness of each customer based on
ongoing credit evaluations, and monitors current economic trends
that might impact the level of credit losses in the future. If the
financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate, resulting
in their inability to make payments, a larger allowance may be
required.

 

Based on
the above assessment, during the reporting periods, the management
establishes the following rates of general provision provided on
gross amount of trade and other receivables:

 




 



 



 



Rate



 





 



 



 



 



 





 



Aged
within 1
/
2
year



 



0%



 





 



Aged
over 1
/
2
year but
within 1 year



 



5%



 





 



Aged over
1 year but within 3 years



 



20%



 





 



More than
3 years



 



100%



 




 

Additional
specific provision is made against trade and other receivables aged
less than 1 year to the extent which they are considered to be
doubtful.

 

Bad debts
are written off when identified. The Company extends unsecured
credit to customers ranging from three to six months in the normal
course of business. The Company does not accrue interest on trade
accounts receivable.

 

No
allowance for doubtful debts was provided for the six months ended
June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009, respectively.

 

Inventories

 

Inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined
on a weighted-average basis and includes all expenditures incurred
in bringing the goods to the point of sale and putting them in a
saleable condition.  In assessing the ultimate
realization of inventories, the management makes judgments as to
future demand requirements compared to current or committed
inventory levels. The Company’s reserve requirements
generally increase with its projected demand requirements; decrease
due to market conditions, product life cycle changes. During the
reporting periods, all of the Company’s products are saleable
with high profit margins, the Company did not make any allowance
for slow-moving or defective inventories.

 

No
allowance of obsolete inventories was provided for during the six
months ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.

Summary of
significant accounting policies (Cont’d)




 

Intangible
assets

 

Intangible
assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization is provided on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives. The principal amortization periods are as
follows:-

 





 



 



Amortization
period



 





 



 



 





Technologies



 



5 to 10
years





Software



 



5
years




 

The
Company periodically reviews the original estimated useful lives of
long-lived assets and makes adjustments when appropriate.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are tested for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. The
Company evaluates its intangible assets for impairment by comparing
the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying assets to
their respective carrying amounts.

 

Property,
plant and equipment

 

Property,
plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Cost represents the purchase price of the asset and
other costs incurred to bring the asset into its existing
use.

 

Depreciation
is provided on straight-line basis over their estimated useful
lives. The principal depreciable periods are as follows:





 



 



 





 



 



Depreciable
period



 





 



 



 





Buildings



 



20
years





Plant and
machinery



 



10
years





Office
equipment



 



5
years





Motor
vehicles



 



5
years




 

Construction
in progress represents buildings and machinery under construction,
which is stated at cost less any impairment losses, and is not
depreciated. Cost comprises the direct costs of construction.
Construction in progress is reclassified to the appropriate
category of property, plant and equipment when completed and ready
for use.

 

Maintenance
or repairs are charged to expense as incurred.  Upon sale
or disposition, the applicable amounts of asset cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net
amount less proceeds from disposal is charged or credited to
income.

 

Land use
rights

 

Land use
rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.
Amortization is provided using the straight-line method over the
terms of the lease of 50 years obtained from the relevant PRC land
authority.

 

Impairment
of long-lived assets

 

Long-lived
assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may
not be recoverable. The Company recognizes impairment of long-lived
assets in the event that the net book values of such assets exceed
the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such
assets.  During the reporting periods, the Company has
not identified any indicators that would require testing for
impairment.

2.           Summary
of significant accounting policies (Cont’d)

 

Revenue
recognition

 

The
Company generates revenue from sales of extracts from tobacco
leaves residues. Revenue is recognized when products are delivered
and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss,
collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or
determinable.

 

Deferred
revenue

 

Deferred
revenue represents subsidy income received from the government. It
mainly consisted of receipt of granted funds to subsidize the
Company’s research and development activities and recognized
as income when the relevant criteria are met.

 

Cost of
sales

 

Cost of
sales consists primarily of materials costs, freight charges,
purchasing and receiving costs, inspection costs, wages, employee
compensation, depreciation and related costs, which are directly
attributable to the production of products.

 

Selling
expenses

 

Selling
expenses mainly consist of advertising, commission, entertainment,
salaries, and traveling expense which are incurred during the
selling activities.

 

Advertising
and research and development expenses

 

Advertising
and research and development expenses are charged to expense as
incurred.

 

Stock-based
compensation

 

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC Topic 718 formerly SFAS No.
123R, “Share-Based Payment”, which requires the use of
the fair value method of accounting for share-based compensation.
Under the fair value based method, compensation cost related to
employee stock options or similar equity instruments which are
equity-classified awards, is measured at the grant date based on
the value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service
period, which is usually the vesting period. ASC Topic 718 also
requires measurement of cost of a liability-classified award based
on its current fair value.

 

The fair
value of warrants granted is determined using the Black-Scholes
model. Under this model, certain assumptions, including the
risk-free interest rate, the expected life of the warrants and the
estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock and the
expected volatility, are required to determine the fair value of
the warrants. If different assumptions had been used, the fair
value of the warrants would have been different from the amount the
Company computed and recorded, which would have resulted in either
an increase or decrease in the compensation expense.

2.           Summary
of significant accounting policies (Cont’d)

 

Income
taxes

 

The
Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for
income taxes pursuant to ASC Topic 740 formerly SFAS No. 109,
“Accounting for Income Taxes”. Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
temporary differences between the financial statements carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and loss carry forwards
and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled.

 

Off-balance
sheet arrangements

 

The
Company does not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements.

 

Basic and
diluted earnings per share

 

The
Company reports basic earnings per share in accordance with ASC
Topic 260 formerly SFAS No. 128, “Earnings Per Share”.
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average
number of shares outstanding during the periods presented. The
weighted average number of shares of the Company represents the
common stock outstanding during the reporting periods.

 

Diluted
earnings per share are computed using the sum of weighted average
number of shares outstanding and dilutive potential shares
outstanding during the periods presented. During the six months
ended June 30, 2010 and 2009, dilutive potential shares included
warrants issued to consultants.

 

Comprehensive
income

 

The
Company has adopted ASC Topic 220 formerly SFAS No. 130,
“Reporting Comprehensive Income”, which establishes
standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income, its
components and accumulated balances.  Components of
comprehensive income include net income and foreign currency
translation adjustments.

 

Foreign
currency translation

 

The
functional currency of the Company is Renminbi (“RMB”)
and RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies. The
Company maintains its financial statements in the functional
currency.  Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency are translated into
the functional currency at rates of exchange prevailing at the
balance sheet dates.  Transactions denominated in
currencies other than the functional currency are translated into
the functional currency at the exchanges rates prevailing at the
dates of the transactions. Exchange gains or losses arising from
foreign currency transactions are included in the determination of
net income/loss for the respective periods.

 

For
financial reporting purposes, the financial statements of the
Company which are prepared using the functional currency have been
translated into United States dollars.  Assets and
liabilities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance
sheet dates and revenue and expenses are translated at the average
exchange rates and stockholders’ equity is translated at
historical exchange rates. Any translation adjustments resulting
from the above are not included in determining net income but are
included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of
stockholders’ equity. The average exchange rates in effect as
of June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2009 were 1USD for 6.83 RMB and 6.84
RMB, respectively. The exchange rate in effect as of December 31,
2009 was 1USD for 6.84 RMB. The source for the above exchange rate
information is from Oanda.com.

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements

 

In March
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-11
“Derivatives and Hedging” (Topic 815). ASU No. 2010-11
update provides amendments to subtopic 815-15, Derivatives and
hedging. The amendments clarify about the scope exception in
paragraph 815-10-15-11 and section 815-15-25 as applicable to the
embedded credit derivatives. The ASU is effective on the first day
of the first fiscal quarter beginning after June 15, 2010.
Therefore, for a calendar-year-end entity, the ASU becomes
effective on July 1, 2010. Early application is permitted at the
beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after March 5,
2010. The adoption of this guidance has not had and is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.

 

In April
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-12.
“Income Taxes” (Topic 740). ASU No.2010-12 amends FASB
Accounting Standard Codification subtopic 740-10 Income Taxes to
include paragraph 740-10-S99-4. On March 30, 2010 The President
signed the Health Care & Education Affordable Care Act
reconciliation bill that amends its previous Act signed on March
23, 2010. FASB Codification topic 740, Income Taxes, requires the
measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets to
be based on provisions of enacted tax law. The effects of future
changes in tax laws are not anticipated.” Therefore, the
different enactment dates of the Act and reconciliation measure may
affect registrants with a period-end that falls between March 23,
2010 (enactment date of the Act), and March 30, 2010 (enactment
date of the reconciliation measure). However, the announcement
states that the SEC would not object if such registrants were to
account for the enactment of both the Act and the reconciliation
measure in a period ending on or after March 23, 2010, but notes
that the SEC staff “does not believe that it would be
appropriate for registrants to analogize to this view in any other
fact patterns.” The adoption of this guidance has not had and
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

 

In April
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-13
“Stock Compensation” (Topic 718). ASU No.2010-13
provides amendments to Topic 718 to clarify that an employee
share-based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the
currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the
entity’s equity securities trades should not be considered to
contain a condition that is not a market, performance, or service
condition. Therefore, an entity would not classify such an award as
a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity. The amendments in
this Update are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2010.
The amendments in this Update should be applied by recording a
cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings. The cumulative-effect adjustment should be calculated for
all awards outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in
which the amendments are initially applied, as if the amendments
had been applied consistently since the inception of the award. The
cumulative-effect adjustment should be presented separately.
Earlier application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance has
not had and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

 

In April
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.2010-14,
“Accounting for Extractive Activities – Oil &
Gas” (Topic 932). ASU No. 2010-14 amends FASB accounting
Standard paragraph 932-10-S99-1 due to SEC release no. 33-8995 [FR
78], Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting and provides update as
to amendments to SEC Regulation S-X, Rule 4-10. The adoption of
this guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements (cont’d)

 

In April
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-15.
“Financial Services-Insurance” (Topic 944) ASU
No.2010-15 gives direction on how investments through separate
accounts affect an insurer’s consolidation analysis of those
investments. Under the ASU: an insurance entity should not consider
any separate account interests held for the benefit of policy
holders in an investment to be the insurer’s interests and
should not combine those interests with its general account
interest in the same investment when assessing the investment for
consolidation, unless the separate account interests are held for
the benefit of a related party policy holder as defined in the
Variable Interest Entities Subsections of Subtopic 810-10 and those
Subsections require the consideration of related parties. The
amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments in this
Update should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods upon
the date of adoption. The adoption of this guidance has not had and
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

 

In April
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-16.
“Entertainment-Casinos” (Topic 924). ASU No.2010-16
addresses diversity in practice regarding whether an entity accrues
liabilities for a base jackpot before it is won because they could
avoid the payment. The amendments in this update clarify that an
entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities (or portions thereof)
before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that
jackpot. Jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an
entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot. This guidance applies
to both base and progressive jackpots. The ASU amendments are
effective for fiscal years, and the interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15,
2010.  The adoption of this guidance has not had and is
not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

 

In April
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-17.
“Revenue Recognition-Milestone Method” (Topic 605) ASU
No.2010-17 provides guidance on defining a milestone and
determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone
method of revenue recognition for research or development
transactions. An entity often recognizes these milestone payments
as revenue in their entirety upon achieving a specific result from
the research or development efforts. A vendor can recognize
consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in
its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is
achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered
substantive. Determining whether a milestone is substantive is a
matter of judgment made at the inception of the arrangement. The
ASU is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. Early application
is permitted. Entities can apply this guidance prospectively to
milestones achieved after adoption. However, retrospective
application to all prior periods is also permitted. The adoption of
this guidance has not had and is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.

Recently

In April
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-18.
“Receivables” (Topic 310). ASU No.2010-18 provides
guidance on accounting for acquired loans that have evidence of
credit deterioration upon acquisition. Paragraph 310-30-15-6 allows
acquired assets with common risk characteristics to be accounted
for in the aggregated as a pool. Upon establishment of the pool,
the pool becomes the unit of accounting. When loans are accounted
for as a pool, the purchase discount is not allocated to individual
loans; thus all of the loans in the pool accrete at a single pool
rate (based on cash flow projections for the pool). Under subtopic
310-30, the impairment analysis also is performed on the pool as a
whole as opposed to each individual loan. Paragraphs 310-40-15-4
through 15-12 establish the criteria for evaluating whether a loan
modification should be classified as a troubled debt restructuring.
Specifically paragraph 310-40-15-5 states that “a
restructuring of a debt constitutes a troubled debt restructuring
for purposes of this subtopic if the creditor for economic or legal
reasons related to the debtor’s financial difficulties grants
a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise
consider.” The ASU is effective for modification of loans
accounted for within pools under subtopic 310-30 occurring in the
first interim or annual period ending on or after July 15, 2010.
The amendments are to be applied prospectively. Early application
is permitted. The adoption of this guidance has not had and is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.

 

In May
2010, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2010-19
“Foreign Currency”. (“ASU No. 2010-19”).
ASU 2010-19, codifies the SEC staff announcement made at the March
18, 2010, EITF meeting. The ASU “provides the SEC
staff’s views on certain foreign currency issues related to
investments in Venezuela.” These issues relate to
Venezuela’s highly inflationary status. The ASU became
effective on March 18, 2010. The adoption of this guidance has not
had and is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Income
taxes




 

United
States

 

The
Company is subject to the United States of America Tax law at tax
rate of 40.7%.  No provision for the US federal income
taxes has been made as the Company had no taxable income in this
jurisdiction for the reporting periods. The Company has not
provided deferred taxes on undistributed earnings of its non-U.S.
subsidiaries or VIE as of June 30, 2010 as it was the
Company’s current policy to reinvest these earnings in
non-U.S. operations.

 

BVI

 

Elevated
Throne was incorporated in the BVI and, under the current laws of
the BVI, is not subject to income taxes.

PRC

 

The
PRC’s legislative body, the National People’s Congress,
adopted the unified Corporate Income Tax Law on March 16, 2007.
This new tax law replaces the existing separate income tax laws for
domestic enterprises and foreign-invested enterprises and became
effective on January 1, 2008.  Under the new tax law, a
unified income tax rate is set at 25% for both domestic enterprises
and foreign-invested enterprises.

 

Accordingly,
Fujian Green Planet and Sanming Huajian, both of which are
established in the PRC, are subject to PRC enterprise income tax at
the rate of 25% on their assessable profits during the six month
periods ended June 30, 2010 and 2009.
