                My mortgage company is requiring a letter from Pioneer stating that my royalty payments will continue. Can you provide this?

                When are checks mailed out?
            

Pioneer has two revenue distributions each month, around the 15th of the month and around the 29th, each depending on if the dates fall on a weekend or holiday. The date your revenue is paid depends on when Pioneer receives payment from our purchasers of production. You will receive payment no earlier than 30 days after the month of production and no later than 60 days after the month of production. For newly drilled wells, it usually takes 2-3 months or longer to get title reviewed, division orders mailed out and initial production paid.


                How do I get a copy of my Revenue Detail and payment history?
            

Pioneer offers an on-line system that allows you to see your revenue payment detail.  Just click on Access My Account and log in to view and print your information.


                Why have I not received my check?
            

Typically, this is because your account is in a minimum pay status. Pioneer remits revenue checks to you once your balance exceeds $25. All revenue, regardless of the amount is disbursed once a year, in September of that year. If your amount is above the minimum payment then please allow two weeks before contacting us if you receive your revenue by check and not direct deposit.


                What if my check is lost, stolen or stale dated?
            

Pioneer will reissue a lost, stolen or stale dated check after six weeks from date of check issue. Please download the Request for Check Replacement form and return the completed form, along with the stale dated check to the address noted on the form to request a replacement check.


                Does Pioneer offer IRS tax withholding?
            

At this time, Pioneer does not offer voluntary tax withholding.


                What if I do not receive a check after one month?
            

Pioneer has a $25.00 minimum payment amount. You will receive a check once your revenue amount reaches $25.00 or once a year in September each year when all minimum suspense amounts are released.


                What is a Division Order?
            

A Division Order is a document Pioneer issues that describes the property, the operator, the legal description, the owner's remittance address, as well as the owner's decimal interest and interest type in the property. The owner is asked to sign and return the Division Order. Pioneer uses this information to remit proceeds to the owner if Pioneer has the disbursement responsibility.


                Why does my monthly payment sometimes vary?
            

Many factors contribute to your payment, including: market conditions, fluctuating commodity prices, regulatory or contractual changes, production volumes, seasonal conditions and well downtime.

                Permian Basin
            





Permian Basin



    THE WORLD’S SECOND LARGEST RESOURCE Discovering a resource potential of more than 75 billion barrels oil equivalent (BBOE) in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp shales has re-ignited industry activity in the Permian Basin. Production from the Midland Basin, located within the greater Permian Basin, has increased more than 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD) since 2009, and horizontal rigs now account for more than 65 percent of all drilling rigs in the area. These findings rank the Spraberry/Wolfcamp as the largest U.S. oil field and as the second-largest oil field in the world. Pioneer’s production more than doubled from 45 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOEPD) in 2011 to 112 MBOEPD in the first quarter of 2015. During that time, we successfully appraised six of the 12 prospective intervals within our extensive acreage position. Several of our wells hold records for highest initial production rates delivered from a specific interval. Even better, production data proves many have a resource potential of more than 1 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) each. Pioneer continues to be the largest producer in the Spraberry/Wolfcamp with a resource potential of more than 11 BBOE and an inventory of more than 20,000 untapped horizontal drilling locations.      
        Current Horizontal Drilling Focus Northern acreage:   Wolfcamp B (~80%) Wolfcamp A (~10%) Lower Spraberry Shale (~10%)  Southern acreage:   Wolfcamp B (>90%)          West Texas is Pioneer’s Foundation It’s where we began operations in the early 1980s, where we’ve grown our largest leasehold and where we are now developing several game-changing shale formations. Pioneer built its 785,000-acre position in the Permian Basin’s Spraberry oil field over decades through property acquisitions, mergers and exploratory efforts. Historically we focused on conventional vertical drilling and production. In 2011, our strategy shifted to unconventional operations that use advanced horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies. We now target hydrocarbons in the field’s multiple, oil-rich Spraberry and Wolfcamp shale intervals. After a successful, four-year transformation of our Spraberry/Wolfcamp acreage into a world-class horizontal play, in which we have successfully appraised six highly prospective stacked intervals, we shut down our vertical drilling program in early 2015. This has allowed us to concentrate efforts on more capital-efficient horizontal shale development.           Spraberry/Wolfcamp Shale Intervals Oil and gas resources are produced from multiple formations, including the Spraberry, the Jo Mill, the Dean, the Wolfcamp, the Atoka, the Strawn and the Mississippian. Depths range from 6,700 to 11,300 feet. Oil produced is West Texas Intermediate Sweet, and gas produced is casinghead gas that has a 1,400 BTU average energy content.           A Targeted Approach Seeing strong production results and robust economic returns from the early horizontal wells we drilled in 2011 and 2012 revolutionized our operations. These wells targeted the Wolfcamp B interval within the southern portion of our leasehold, and the production rates were beyond encouraging. In 2013, we entered into a joint venture with Sinochem, a Chinese conglomerate, to accelerate horizontal development of the southern area, which is known as Pioneer’s Southern Wolfcamp asset or the Southern Wolfcamp joint venture area.  The process of transforming the rest of our leasehold – referred to as Pioneer’s Northern Spraberry/Wolfcamp asset – from a vertical drilling program to a more capital-efficient horizontal drilling program soon followed. Our key focus for 2013 was to appraise several Wolfcamp intervals, including the Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B and Wolfcamp D. Highly successful results, coupled with increasing activity in our southern asset, resulted in a 20 percent production growth year-over-year from 2012 to 2014 and a substantial increase in our resource potential. By April 2014, we were operating 16 rigs in our northern asset alone. Our production from Spraberry/Wolfcamp intervals grew another 34 percent throughout the year, and we gained a greater understanding of the value of the shale intervals. The Lower Spraberry Shale interval is estimated to have the most oil in place of all the Midland Basin intervals. Our ongoing appraisal of the Middle Spraberry and Jo Mill intervals has confirmed their potential for future development as well.    Streamlining Our Operations  Our business, engineering, drilling, completions and production teams are continuously working to improve and optimize our Spraberry/Wolfcamp operations. Pioneer’s ongoing initiatives to reduce costs, increase production, gain efficiencies and protect the environment include:   Focusing each rig on one interval  – Drilling one shale interval per rig allows us to focus on how to reduce drilling and completion time and costs more quickly. Increasing multi-well pad drilling – Pioneer’s surface footprint is reduced when we drill multiple wells per pad. Expanding use of casing design modifications – Improved casing designs provide an opportunity for cost reductions through decreased drilling time and reduction of downhole materials and are expected to save $500,000 to $1 million per well. Optimizing completions – We are working to improve the productivity and cost structure of our horizontal well completions by testing a variety of factors of our horizontal well completion program, such as stage length, clusters per stage, fluid volumes and chemistry, and proppent concentration. In many cases, we have been able to leverage knowledge gained from similar testing in our Eagle Ford Shale operations. Testing dissolvable plug technologies – Technologies reduce or eliminate coil tubing drill outs after fracture stimulation and are expected to save $300,000 per well. Securing long-term supplies of lower-cost, non-potable water – Reducing fresh water usage remains a top priority among Pioneer’s water management initiatives. We are evaluating the use of water from brackish reservoirs not suited for drinking or agriculture, actively pursuing partnerships with local cities and municipalities to source wastewater, and evaluating recycling technologies. Soliciting cost reductions from suppliers and service companies during the lower oil price environment – We are evaluating all of our operating costs (such as materials, contract drilling, fuel, labor, rental equipment and well services) and are working with our suppliers and service companies to reduce our costs by year-end 2015.

Current operations[edit]
Pioneer Resources is the largest acreage holder in the Cline Shale, which is part of the Permian Basin.[2][3]
As of December 31, 2016, the company had 725 million barrels of oil equivalent (4.44×109 GJ) of proved reserves, of which 52% was petroleum, 19% was natural gas liquids, and 29% was natural gas. All of the company's reserves are in the United States.[1]
In 2016, the company produced 233 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (1,430,000 GJ) per day, of which 73% was in the Spraberry Trend, 15% was in the Eagle Ford shale, 7% was in the Raton Basin, and 5% was in the Western Panhandle of Texas.[1]
On May 11, 2016, at the Citi Global Energy & Utilities Conference in Hong Kong's Mandarin Oriental, Scott Sheffield, CEO of Pioneer, along with support from Tom Spalding, a geologist and Pioneer's vice president for geoscience, announced that more than 10 billion and possibly as much as 75 billion barrels of oil equivalent had been discovered in Permian shales.[4][5][6][7][8][a]
History[edit]
The company was created in 1997 by the merger of Parker & Parsley Petroleum Company and MESA Inc., owned by T. Boone Pickens[9]
In 2002, Pioneer made discoveries in its offshore Oooguruk field, west of Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. In 2008, Pioneer became the first independent operator to produce oil on the Alaska North Slope. These holdings were sold for $550 million in 2013.[10]
In 2004, Pioneer Natural Resources acquired Evergreen Resources, Inc. in a $2.1 billion transaction.[11]
In June 2010, Pioneer Natural Resources announced a $1.15 billion Eagle Ford Shale midsteam joint venture with Reliance Industries.[12] The business was sold to Enterprise Products Partners for $2.15 billion in 2015.[13][b]
In March 2012, Pioneer Natural Resources announced the $297 million acquisition of Carmeuse Industrial Sands, a silica sand manufacturer the company renamed Premier Silica.[14]
In January 2013, Pioneer Resources announced the sale of a 40% interest in approximately 207,000 net acres (84,000 net hectares) leased in horizontal Wolfcamp Shale to Sinochem Petroleum USA LLC (a subsidiary of Sinochem Group) for $1.7 billion. Pioneer continues as the operator of the project.[15]
In 2014, the company sold non-producing assets in the Hugoton Basin to Linn Energy for $340 million.[16]
Footnotes[edit]



^ Only Saudi Arabia's massive Ghawar field contains more proven petroleum reserves.
^ At the first annual Unconventional Resources Technology Conference (URTeC), a joint effort among SPE, SEG, and AAPG, held in Denver, Aug. 12-14, 2013, Sheffield said, "The Spraberry/Wolfcamp shale, with its 50 billion boe, begins to dwarf the Eagle Ford and the Bakken with 27 billion boe and 13 billion boe, respectively."[2]

Why Pioneer Natural Resources Co., Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., and EOG Resources, Inc. Are Today's 3 Worst Stocks
Oil and gas companies plague the list of the worst performers in the stock market today











                John Divine
            

                (TMFDivine)



            
            Jun 24, 2014 at 7:31PM
            
            






Even after new home sales data for May absolutely blew out expectations, Wall Street was blase, selling off into the closing bell. With both the oil and gas and the materials sectors ending as two of the worst performers in the market, Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE:PXD), Cliffs Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF), and EOG Resources, (NYSE:EOG) had a rough go of it Tuesday. While the S&P 500 Index (SNPINDEX:^GSPC) lost 12 points, or 0.6%, to end at 1,949, the benchmark index actually added to an unusually long streak of low volatility. The S&P hasn't changed by more than 1% in any of the last 47 sessions, the longest such streak since 1995.
While Pioneer Natural Resources was literally the worst stock in the S&P today, plunging 4.8%, tomorrow will almost certainly see a reversal of fortune. The oil and gas explorer, along with only one other company (Enterprise Products Partners LP) was granted exclusive rights to export condensate oil abroad. The permission was given by the U.S. Commerce Department, according to a Wall Street Journal report that hit the wires after the stock market closed. Companies like Pioneer Natural Resources have been banned from exporting unrefined oil for the past 40 years, but that all changed Tuesday.
Cliffs Natural Resources has a monkey on its back. A monkey named Casablanca Capital, which brutally beats its host with PR blasts and demands for executive shakeups every chance it gets. Cliffs Natural Resources lost 4.3% today after the latest example of Casablanca's pugnacious verbal assaults. Casablanca, which owns about 5% of Cliffs, said that Cliffs' claim that Casablanca only plans on holding its shares for 18 months was a "complete fabrication." Casablanca went on to accuse members of Cliffs' Board of being so desperate to "cling to their thrones" that they will "say and do anything" to retain their positions.

EOG Resources is looking to other shale plays for production. Image source: EOG Resources

The last of Tuesday's laggards, EOG Resources, also hails from the oil and gas business. The stock tumbled 3.7% today. EOG Resources, though it engages in other methods of energy extraction, uses fracking extensively in areas like the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford and Bakken shales. In a company presentation this month, EOG said that there may be the equivalent of 1.3 billion barrels of oil in the Permian Basin. Great, right? Well, unfortunately, the quality of the Permian shale is degrading, making other plays more attractive, according to CEO Bill Thomas.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
