Certificates of Deposit (CD)
Certificates of deposit are a deposit of funds in a financial institution for a predetermined term that earn interest at a specified rate or rate formula. CDs may be secured or unsecured and may have fixed or floating rates. CDs may be issued in either physical or DTC-eligible form and in either physical or book-entry form.
 


OverviewCharacteristics 

What are DTC-eligible CDs?
DTC-eligible CDs are time deposits issued by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)-insured financial institutions and are underwritten by Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)-registered broker-dealers. Also known as “brokered deposits,” this type of deposit is offered to investors by issuing institutions looking to raise liquidity and funding through the wholesale and institutional markets.
Unlike traditional CDs, and similar to other securities, DTC-eligible CDs are issued in book entry form and use the CUSIP system for identification and trading in a primary and secondary market.
Similar to traditional CDs and other fixed-income products offered by Multi-Bank Securities, Inc. (MBS), DTC-eligible CDs are often considered a preferred investment alternative for clients concerned about the safety of their principal and the continuity or predictability of cash flows.

Who is the DTC?
The Depository Trust Company (DTC) is the world's largest securities depository. Owned by its members in the financial industry, the DTC is a registered clearing agency with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a member of the Federal Reserve System and a limited purpose trust company under New York Banking Law.
What are Physical CDs?
Physical CDs are time deposits or certificates of deposit safekept at a depository held in the name of the investing entity. A copy of the CD and the new account documents are physically delivered to the institutional investor at the time the funds are transferred. All required information by the issuer is sent, received and signed by the investing entity, and interest payments are distributed to the owner of record. Multi-Bank Securities, Inc. offers both “fee-based” and “no-fee” physical CD rates.
Physicals CDs can be either direct or custodial in nature. Investors send funds either directly to the issuing institution or they send funds to a designated third-party "custodian" - usually another bank. Physicals CDs are available as several types, including as fixed-rate CDs and as step-up and step-down CDs.


Safety
On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which, in part, permanently raises the current standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000. The FDIC insurance coverage limit applies per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.
Multi-Bank Securities, Inc. (MBS) underwrites and offers DTC-eligible CDs issued by “well-capitalized,” FDIC-insured financial institutions. Similar to traditional certificates of deposit, the FDIC insures your investment in a DTC-eligible CD for up to $250,000 in principal and accrued interest, per institution.
FDIC-insured CDs are backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.
Yield
DTC-eligible CDs can offer a greater equivalent return than comparable U.S. Treasuries, agencies, corporate bonds and your local savings, money market or CD rates. A DTC-eligible CDs master certificate varies in principal, from $500,000 to more than $50 million. As a result, our MBS underwriters are typically able to negotiate competitive jumbo CD rates because of their overall principal commitment. When purchasing a DTC-eligible CD, you are able to take advantage of our buying power and remain insured by purchasing individual pieces of the master certificate.
Diversity
DTC-eligible CDs are offered with numerous terms and structures to meet your investment needs. Please contact your MBS broker to learn which of the following structures might be right for you.

Bullets (Fixed-Rate and Term)
Callable CDs
Variable Rate and Step-Up CDs
Zero Coupon CDs
Indexed Linked CDs
Terms Range from 90 Days to 30 Years

No Placement Fees
Similar to other securities, DTC-eligible CDs are purchased with NO placement fees. These CDs are traded at par in the primary market and priced at a premium, at a discount or at par in the secondary market. You will not be required to account for a placement fee or be required to subscribe to a posting service to buy or view top rates and new issuers.
Efficiency and Convenience
Once you have set up an account with Multi-Bank Securities, Inc., no signature cards, applications, W-9 Forms, Corporate Resolutions, Social Security numbers or physical certificates are required to be filled out, signed or returned prior to the purchase, sale or maturity of each negotiable CD transaction.1
All interest and principal payments are wired into your securities account, and are payable to you by ACH, check or wire, with NO wire or transaction fee.
Secondary Market
Although not obligated to do so, MBS does participate in maintaining a secondary market for DTC-eligible CDs. Secondary CDs are bid at a discount, at a premium or at par depending on variables, including prevailing interest rates, term to maturity or call date, principal amount and credit quality of the issuing institutions.
1 - Participating investors are required by FINRA to open a broker-dealer securities account with MBS in order to trade.

Corporate Notes and Bonds
Public or private corporations and organizations issue corporate bonds for the purpose of funding capital improvements, expansions, acquisitions or debt refinancing. Investors essentially are lending money to the issuer.
 


OverviewCharacteristics 

The issuer agrees to make fixed-interest payments and repay the principal at maturity. Unlike stocks, corporate bonds do not give ownership interest in that corporation. Investors are securitized by either corporate assets and/or real estate holdings. They become a general creditor of the issuer.
Corporate bond offerings are evaluated by the key credit rating agencies. They take into consideration the corporation's financial status, resources and competitive position within their industry. For a bond to make investment grade, it must have a minimum rating of Baa from Moody's and BBB from Standard & Poor's (S&P).

Corporate bonds are issued by industrial corporations, financial service corporations, public utilities, transportation corporations and conglomerates.
Types of Corporate Bonds:
Fixed-Rates
An issuer borrows money from an investor and agrees to make semi-annual interest payments at a fixed rate and pays back the principal amount at maturity.
Zero Coupons
Zero coupons are sold at a discount from par and receive a yield that is the difference between the purchase price and the face value price at the maturity. They are taxed annually, even though the full value and accrued interest is paid at maturity.
Floating-Rates
Floating-rate securities have variable interest rates that are adjusted periodically according to the pre-determined index with which they are associated. Some are indexed from short-term Treasuries and other money markets. Yields are typically lower than other fixed-income products with the same maturity because they offer protection against increased interest rates. The rate can be readjusted more than once annually.
Callables
Callable bonds have a provision where the issuer has the right to call back the security on a certain set day before maturity. This can be a disadvantage for the investor in a declining interest rate market. The investor loses the higher interest rate and the issuer can reissue that outstanding debt with a lower rate bond. The investor now has to reinvest at lower interest rates, resulting in lower yields. Because of this, callable bonds carry a higher interest rate.
Puttable Bonds
These bonds are similar to callable bonds. However, with puttable bonds, it is the investor who has the right to call the bond before its maturity date. You can 'put' the bond back to the issuer for the par value plus accrued interest at pre-determined intervals at your discretion. They usually yield lower rates than a comparable bond.
Step-Up Bonds
The investor receives a fixed rate of interest until a pre-determined date. Then the coupon increases if the issuer does not call the bond.


Safety
The corporate bond market is broad and liquid, with more than $707.5 billion issued in 2005* alone.
A fairly liquid secondary market allows investors to sell or trade their securities at market price.
The market price is dependent upon the fluctuation of interest rates, as it is with any fixed-income investment. Depending on when you enter the market, your bonds may sell at par, at a premium or at a discount to their face value.
Yield
Corporate bonds generally offer higher yields than U.S. Treasuries.
Corporate bonds’ true value is in the yield spread over other investments they provide.
Depending on the terms, interest payments can be made monthly, quarterly or semi-annually.
Diversity
Corporate bonds offer short-term (up to five-years), medium-term (five to 12 years) and long-term (more than 12 years) issues.
Corporate bonds are available in an assortment of credit qualities, maturities and coupon structures.
Some corporate securities are callable.
Limitations
Corporate bond interest payments are usually taxable by the federal and state governments.
Some corporate bonds are callable bonds.
A potential increase in the risk of default exists with corporate bonds when compared with U.S. Treasuries. Other possible types of risks, such as changes in corporate credit rating, a leveraged buyout or a weakening in the industry sector, may affect the market value.

Securities Class Action Lawsuits, Stock Lawsuits, Securities Fraud Lawsuits

Securities fraud lawsuits and stock lawsuits have been filed against numerous financial firms, stockbrokers, financial advisers and companies alleging fraud or other misconduct. These allegations include claims that the issuers of securities have misled investors regarding the value of their investments, that stockbrokers or financial advisers acted improperly in managing clients' accounts or that companies that offer employee stock options or benefits plans failed to act in the best interests of plan participants. In some cases, investors can file securities class action lawsuits; in other cases, investors must file an arbitration if they hope to recover their losses.

Securities and Stock Fraud
Stock fraud occurs when the issuer of the security makes false statements about the company's status or fails to disclose important facts that may affect stock value, causing investors to buy or sell stocks under false pretenses. Claims can be brought against the issuer of the security, i.e. the public company, the company's officers, directors or others involved in the violation, including stockbrokers, underwriter or auditors.

Exchange Traded Funds

Companies that issued Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) face lawsuits alleging that they did not adequately disclose the risks associated with those ETFs in their prospectus and registration filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In June, 2009, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issued a regulatory warning regarding leveraged and inverse ETFs, noting that the ETFs are typically not suitable for retail investors who planned to hold them for more than one trading session.

Auction Rate Securities

Investors who put their money in Auction Rate Securities (ARS) have filed lawsuits alleging that they were told the securities were a safe, liquid investment. However, when the ARS market was frozen, many investors found they could not sell their Auction Rate Securities. Some companies have settled claims with clients and agreed to purchase back the Auction Rate Securities.  

Stockbroker Fraud and Stockbroker Arbitration
There are a number of ways a Stockbroker or Financial Advisor can break laws surrounding investment practices. Stockbroker fraud or negligence can include misrepresenting stocks or the risks associated with those investments, recommending unsuitable stocks, charging excessive transaction fees or failing to diversify an investor's portfolio. It is a stockbroker's responsibility to consider his client's best interest in all investment transactions.

Clients who believe their stockbroker has acted improperly may be able to file an arbitration against the broker and, possibly, the financial firm the broker works for. 

Stock Options and ERISA Complaints
ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) regulates employee benefit and pension plans, both of which can be tied into stock options. Employees and retired employees can file a lawsuit against a company and/or its officers for breaching fiduciary responsibilities and putting stock options and pension plans at risk.

Issues involved in ERISA include wrongfully canceling or breaching employee stock options, denying an employee rights granted by a Stock Option Agreement, misrepresenting the value of the stock, failing to act in the best interests of stock option plans, failing to act prudently in conducting and managing investments or lying about the number of options employees will be given. Furthermore, it is a violation of ERISA for an employer to take deductions from an employee's paycheck for benefits but then not make those payments into the benefits plan.

Under ERISA, it is illegal for an employer to "discharge, fine, suspend, expel, discipline, or discriminate against a participant or beneficiary for exercising any right to which he is entitled under the provisions of an employee benefit plan…" Claims have been made alleging that employees were terminated or discriminated against when the employer suspected that the employee was about to make a claim under a benefits plan. In such situations, the employee must prove that the action taken against him was done so primarily to prevent him from accessing benefits and not that the loss of benefits was simply a consequence of the action taken.

Companies that have had ERISA complaints filed against them include YRC Worldwide Inc (concerning the Yellow Freight Pension Plan), Motorola and Sterling Financial Corporation.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
