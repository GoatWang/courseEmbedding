We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of our 
common stock being offered for sale by the selling stockholders. We will incur 
all costs associated with this registration statement and prospectus.


We are a small independent start-up mobile billboard advertising company that 
commenced mobile billboard operations in February of 2014. We will face 
competition from other mobile billboard advertising companies specifically, and 
generally from all other advertising and media companies. Most, if not all of 
our competitors are much larger, well established and better financed companies.
In addition, there is no barrier to entry for other adverting companies should 
they decide to offer advertising on their own Teardrop Trailers. We do not 
consider us to be a factor in our industry and there is no assurance that we 
will be successful in selling advertising services, or even if successful in 
obtaining paying advertisers, that we will be profitable.

There are currently many manufacturers of Teardrop Trailers that offer their 
products to the marketplace. While we believe the Plans we have provides us 
with the ability to assemble trailers at an advantageous price, we do not 
believe that the Plans provide us protection against potential competitors 
entering our intended business.


Company Description
The Teardroppers, Inc. is a Nevada corporation which was formed in June of 2013.

Mobile Billboard Advertising 

We intend to enter the business of mobile billboard advertising by offering to 
provide billboard advertising space on custom designed "Teardrop Trailers". 
Teardrop Trailers, are


 usually designed for short-period accommodations for 
vacationers and travelers. Teardrop Trailers are designed to be towed behind
small economy sized vehicles and pickup trucks. A Teardrop Trailer, also known 
as a "Teardrop Camper Trailer", is a streamlined, compact, lightweight travel 
trailer, which gets its name from its teardrop profile. We have ordered the 
assembly of one Teardrop Trailer from an independent partnership (the 
"Partnership"), based upon Teardrop Trailer designs provided by the Partnership 
and approved by us. This Teardrop Trailer is expected to be delivered by January
15, 2015. In addition, we ordered a "Kit" from the Partnership, along with a 
custom chassis from an independent supplier recommended by the Partnership, 
which enables us to assemble our first Teardrop Trailer. The Teardrop Trailer 
assembled from this Kit is currently being assembled by an independent 
contractor and is expected to delivered to us on December 31, 2014. Due to 
manufacturing limitations of the Partnership, we determined that it would be 
faster and more efficient to assemble a completed Teardrop Trailer from a Kit 
then to wait for delivery of a completed Teardrop Trailer from the Partnership.
In the future, we intend to obtain additional Teardrop Trailers by using a Kit 
and independent contractors to assemble the Kit.

The Teardop Trailer 

Teardrop Trailers are designed to be towed behind small economy sized vehicles, 
pickup trucks and any qualified tow vehicles. A Teardrop Trailer, also known as 
a "Teardrop Camper Trailer", is a streamlined, compact, lightweight travel 
trailer, which gets its name from its teardrop profile. We have ordered the 
assembly of one Teardrop Mobile Trailer from the Partnership at a contract 
price of $5,000. The cost to assemble the Teardrop Trailer from the Kit is a 
total of $4,995($3,000 for the Kit, $495 for the chassis, and $1,500 for the 
services of the independent contractor to assemble the Kit on the chassis.)

Our Teardrop Trailers will be approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) in width and 10 
feet (3.0 m) in length and 5 feet (1.5 m) in height Wheels and tires are 
outside the body and are covered by fenders. Our Teardrop Trailers will be 
covered with thin sheets of aluminum. Since Teardrop Trailers are relatively 
light, most vehicles can tow a Teardrop Trailer and have little effect on the 
vehicle's fuel consumption. We do not intend to lease our Teardrop Trailers 
for camping or recreational use. However, our first trailer will be configured 
in a camping trailer configuration so as to enhance the residual value of the 
trailer. We believe that some of our future rental customers, who will rent 
our trailers for longer periods, may use the interior space for their 
personnel's comfort or for storage.

Our trailers will be assembled upon a chassis that has tail lights, wiring, 
fenders, wheels and a trailer hitch that is compliant with Federal and State 
regulations. We have no formal relationship with any trailer chassis 
manufacturer, but we believe that many manufacturers will continue to offer a 
chassis that we will utilize in our trailers. In the event that chassis become 
unavailable, our business would be adversely affected as we would then have to 
adjust our designs to fit chassis available from other sources.

Marketing 

We intend to market our advertising and design services through our website 
www.tdropmobile.com. We have hired an independent web-site developer to develop 
our website, which is expected to be completed by December 14, 2014. In 
addition, we intend to offer our mobile billboard advertising services through 
traditional marketing channels, such as trade journals, trade catalogues, 
yellow pages advertising, and through the personal contacts of our Management. 
Marketing of our mobile billboard advertising has already commenced as we have 
made several proposals to motor sports events and advertisers to use our 
services. We also market our consulting services through personal contacts of 
our officers and majority shareholder.

We plan to order additional Teardrop Trailers or Kits from either the 
Partnership, or independent Computer Numerical Control ("CNC") contractors. 
The CNC contractor will use the plans and designs provided by the Partnership. 
The Teardrop Trailer we ordered will be assembled on trailer chassis that we 
have obtained from an independent trailer chassis manufacturer.

We have chosen the unique shape and look of a Teardrop Trailer as our 
advertising platform as we believe its "eye appeal" will be attractive to a 
target audience's view and retention of the adverting images which will appear 
on the Teardrop Trailer.

In May of 2014, we acquired two fully restored "Classic" vehicles with the 
intention that these vehicles be used to tow our Teardrop trailers and to be 
used as marketing vehicles for our business. We acquired a 1959 Chevrolet 
Apache Fleetside pick-up truck (the "Apache") and a 1979 Ford Ranchero. On 
September 1, 2014, we returned the Apache to the seller and the consideration 
(333,333 of our shares valued at $50,000) was returned to us. The Ranchero 
vehicle will be available to be leased as a tow vehicle with our Teardrop 
trailers or it can be leased independently from the trailers. We believe that 
the use of this vehicle in conjunction with a Teardrop Trailer, will enhance 
the attractiveness of our advertising offerings to potential lessees.

We intend to offer advertising space on our trailers. Advertisement will be 
installed by applying decals, large vinyl sheets as decals or by fastening one 
large sheet of vinyl to the sides and top of the trailer. In addition, we will 
offer to provide our tow vehicle and a driver.

We believe that the mobile billboard outdoor advertising will offer to 
advertisers:

. Event Marketing 

. New Product Launches 

. Retail Store Openings 

. Grand Openings

We believe that mobile billboard outdoor advertising offers certain advantages 
to advertisers, among which include:

. Mobile trailers are flexible providing one with a wide variety of space and 
  cost options, which can be used for anything from short sales promotions to 
  being part of a long-term brand awareness campaign.

. Instead of hoping people see an advertisement, the advertisements are brought 
  to them.

. They are more cost effective than other forms of advertising. 

. We can park the trailer in front of a business or a competitor's. 

. We can thoroughly saturate a specific area unlike regular billboards, 
  radio, TV or direct mail.

. We can provide specific demographic routes so that there are multiple 
  exposures.

. Mobile billboards create impact because of their movement, size and 
  prominence on the road and can go where other advertising can’t. They merely 
  have to be visible to attract attention.

. We can provide advertisements in the middle of all the activity at a special 
  event like a tournament, fair, tradeshow, sporting event et. al.

. As they are eye-level with consumers, the message is communicated directly, 
  increasing the impact of the product.

We will also offer to work closely with our clients to fully understand the 
client's marketing objectives. We will used our best efforts to identify the 
highest profile locations in our client's target market in order to provide 
the most efficient, high exposure, high impact and cost-effective mobile 
billboard advertising campaign.

At every stage of the process, our services will include design, branding and 
selection of graphics, to achieve maximum results. Audio, illumination, 
promotional sampling and other sensory elements can be added to further 
enhance an advertising message.

Our rates will be negotiated at time of agreement with our client. Our rates 
will be based upon the range of services, length of the advertising contract, 
number of vehicles used, miles traveled, length of campaign, ancillary costs 
and other variables. Generally, we anticipate our rates to be $995 for the 
design and application, and removal of graphics to a trailer; $295 per day for 
the use of the trailer; $175 per day for a tow vehicle and driver, based upon 
a 6 hour day. There will be a 3 day minimum for each trailer rental.

Also, from inception (June 13, 2013) through September 30, 2014, we have paid
$52,500 in consulting fees to DEVCAP Partners, LLC in which Kevin P. O’Connell, 
our majority shareholder is the managing member.

The Teardroppers, Inc. is a Nevada corporation which is controlled by Mr. Kevin 
P. O’Connell who owns a majority interest in DEVCAP Partners, LLC, which owns 
approximately seventy six per cent (76%) of our outstanding common stock. We 
have incurred losses of $334,938 from inception through September 30, 2014. 
Our auditor's report has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to 
continue as a going concern. As at November 30, 2014, we have $79,932 in cash 
on hand.

The Company and its affiliates and promoters have no plans or intentions to 
engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or person or, 
once it is a reporting company, to be used as a vehicle for a private company 
to become a reporting company.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares of our 
common stock being offered for sale by the selling stockholders. We will incur 
all costs associated with this registration statement and prospectus.


We are a small independent start-up mobile billboard advertising company that 
commenced mobile billboard operations in February of 2014. We will face 
competition from other mobile billboard advertising companies specifically, and 
generally from all other advertising and media companies. Most, if not all of 
our competitors are much larger, well established and better financed companies.
In addition, there is no barrier to entry for other adverting companies should 
they decide to offer advertising on their own Teardrop Trailers. We do not 
consider us to be a factor in our industry and there is no assurance that we 
will be successful in selling advertising services, or even if successful in 
obtaining paying advertisers, that we will be profitable.

There are currently many manufacturers of Teardrop Trailers that offer their 
products to the marketplace. While we believe the Plans we have provides us 
with the ability to assemble trailers at an advantageous price, we do not 
believe that the Plans provide us protection against potential competitors 
entering our intended business.


Company Description
The Teardroppers, Inc. is a Nevada corporation which was formed in June of 2013.

Mobile Billboard Advertising 

We intend to enter the business of mobile billboard advertising by offering to 
provide billboard advertising space on custom designed "Teardrop Trailers". 
Teardrop Trailers, are


 usually designed for short-period accommodations for 
vacationers and travelers. Teardrop Trailers are designed to be towed behind
small economy sized vehicles and pickup trucks. A Teardrop Trailer, also known 
as a "Teardrop Camper Trailer", is a streamlined, compact, lightweight travel 
trailer, which gets its name from its teardrop profile. We have ordered the 
assembly of one Teardrop Trailer from an independent partnership (the 
"Partnership"), based upon Teardrop Trailer designs provided by the Partnership 
and approved by us. This Teardrop Trailer is expected to be delivered by January
15, 2015. In addition, we ordered a "Kit" from the Partnership, along with a 
custom chassis from an independent supplier recommended by the Partnership, 
which enables us to assemble our first Teardrop Trailer. The Teardrop Trailer 
assembled from this Kit is currently being assembled by an independent 
contractor and is expected to delivered to us on December 31, 2014. Due to 
manufacturing limitations of the Partnership, we determined that it would be 
faster and more efficient to assemble a completed Teardrop Trailer from a Kit 
then to wait for delivery of a completed Teardrop Trailer from the Partnership.
In the future, we intend to obtain additional Teardrop Trailers by using a Kit 
and independent contractors to assemble the Kit.

The Teardop Trailer 

Teardrop Trailers are designed to be towed behind small economy sized vehicles, 
pickup trucks and any qualified tow vehicles. A Teardrop Trailer, also known as 
a "Teardrop Camper Trailer", is a streamlined, compact, lightweight travel 
trailer, which gets its name from its teardrop profile. We have ordered the 
assembly of one Teardrop Mobile Trailer from the Partnership at a contract 
price of $5,000. The cost to assemble the Teardrop Trailer from the Kit is a 
total of $4,995($3,000 for the Kit, $495 for the chassis, and $1,500 for the 
services of the independent contractor to assemble the Kit on the chassis.)

Our Teardrop Trailers will be approximately 4 feet (1.2 m) in width and 10 
feet (3.0 m) in length and 5 feet (1.5 m) in height Wheels and tires are 
outside the body and are covered by fenders. Our Teardrop Trailers will be 
covered with thin sheets of aluminum. Since Teardrop Trailers are relatively 
light, most vehicles can tow a Teardrop Trailer and have little effect on the 
vehicle's fuel consumption. We do not intend to lease our Teardrop Trailers 
for camping or recreational use. However, our first trailer will be configured 
in a camping trailer configuration so as to enhance the residual value of the 
trailer. We believe that some of our future rental customers, who will rent 
our trailers for longer periods, may use the interior space for their 
personnel's comfort or for storage.

Our trailers will be assembled upon a chassis that has tail lights, wiring, 
fenders, wheels and a trailer hitch that is compliant with Federal and State 
regulations. We have no formal relationship with any trailer chassis 
manufacturer, but we believe that many manufacturers will continue to offer a 
chassis that we will utilize in our trailers. In the event that chassis become 
unavailable, our business would be adversely affected as we would then have to 
adjust our designs to fit chassis available from other sources.

Marketing 

We intend to market our advertising and design services through our website 
www.tdropmobile.com. We have hired an independent web-site developer to develop 
our website, which is expected to be completed by December 14, 2014. In 
addition, we intend to offer our mobile billboard advertising services through 
traditional marketing channels, such as trade journals, trade catalogues, 
yellow pages advertising, and through the personal contacts of our Management. 
Marketing of our mobile billboard advertising has already commenced as we have 
made several proposals to motor sports events and advertisers to use our 
services. We also market our consulting services through personal contacts of 
our officers and majority shareholder.

We plan to order additional Teardrop Trailers or Kits from either the 
Partnership, or independent Computer Numerical Control ("CNC") contractors. 
The CNC contractor will use the plans and designs provided by the Partnership. 
The Teardrop Trailer we ordered will be assembled on trailer chassis that we 
have obtained from an independent trailer chassis manufacturer.

We have chosen the unique shape and look of a Teardrop Trailer as our 
advertising platform as we believe its "eye appeal" will be attractive to a 
target audience's view and retention of the adverting images which will appear 
on the Teardrop Trailer.

In May of 2014, we acquired two fully restored "Classic" vehicles with the 
intention that these vehicles be used to tow our Teardrop trailers and to be 
used as marketing vehicles for our business. We acquired a 1959 Chevrolet 
Apache Fleetside pick-up truck (the "Apache") and a 1979 Ford Ranchero. On 
September 1, 2014, we returned the Apache to the seller and the consideration 
(333,333 of our shares valued at $50,000) was returned to us. The Ranchero 
vehicle will be available to be leased as a tow vehicle with our Teardrop 
trailers or it can be leased independently from the trailers. We believe that 
the use of this vehicle in conjunction with a Teardrop Trailer, will enhance 
the attractiveness of our advertising offerings to potential lessees.

We intend to offer advertising space on our trailers. Advertisement will be 
installed by applying decals, large vinyl sheets as decals or by fastening one 
large sheet of vinyl to the sides and top of the trailer. In addition, we will 
offer to provide our tow vehicle and a driver.

We believe that the mobile billboard outdoor advertising will offer to 
advertisers:

. Event Marketing 

. New Product Launches 

. Retail Store Openings 

. Grand Openings 

. Tradeshow Advertising 

. Political Advertising and Campaigning 

. Publicity 

. Concerts 

. Sporting Events 

. Conventions 

. Trade Shows 

. Outdoor Festivals 

. Beach Cities and Events 

. Grand Openings 

. Holiday Events 

. Motion Picture Premiers 

We believe that mobile billboard outdoor advertising offers certain advantages 
to advertisers, among which include:

. Mobile trailers are flexible providing one with a wide variety of space and 
  cost options, which can be used for anything from short sales promotions to 
  being part of a long-term brand awareness campaign.

. Instead of hoping people see an advertisement, the advertisements are brought 
  to them.

. They are more cost effective than other forms of advertising. 

. We can park the trailer in front of a business or a competitor's. 

. We can thoroughly saturate a specific area unlike regular billboards, 
  radio, TV or direct mail.

. We can provide specific demographic routes so that there are multiple 
  exposures.

. Mobile billboards create impact because of their movement, size and 
  prominence on the road and can go where other advertising can’t. They merely 
  have to be visible to attract attention.

. We can provide advertisements in the middle of all the activity at a special 
  event like a tournament, fair, tradeshow, sporting event et. al.

. As they are eye-level with consumers, the message is communicated directly, 
  increasing the impact of the product.

We will also offer to work closely with our clients to fully understand the 
client's marketing objectives. We will used our best efforts to identify the 
highest profile locations in our client's target market in order to provide 
the most efficient, high exposure, high impact and cost-effective mobile 
billboard advertising campaign.

At every stage of the process, our services will include design, branding and 
selection of graphics, to achieve maximum results. Audio, illumination, 
promotional sampling and other sensory elements can be added to further 
enhance an advertising message.

Our rates will be negotiated at time of agreement with our client. Our rates 
will be based upon the range of services, length of the advertising contract, 
number of vehicles used, miles traveled, length of campaign, ancillary costs 
and other variables. Generally, we anticipate our rates to be $995 for the 
design and application, and removal of graphics to a trailer; $295 per day for 
the use of the trailer; $175 per day for a tow vehicle and driver, based upon 
a 6 hour day. There will be a 3 day minimum for each trailer rental.

Also, from inception (June 13, 2013) through September 30, 2014, we have paid
$52,500 in consulting fees to DEVCAP Partners, LLC in which Kevin P. O’Connell, 
our majority shareholder is the managing member.

The Teardroppers, Inc. is a Nevada corporation which is controlled by Mr. Kevin 
P. O’Connell who owns a majority interest in DEVCAP Partners, LLC, which owns 
approximately seventy six per cent (76%) of our outstanding common stock. We 
have incurred losses of $334,938 from inception through September 30, 2014. 
Our auditor's report has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to 
continue as a going concern. As at November 30, 2014, we have $79,932 in cash 
on hand.

The Company and its affiliates and promoters have no plans or intentions to 
engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or person or, 
once it is a reporting company, to be used as a vehicle for a private company 
to become a reporting company.
