(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Certain statements in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. These factors include, among other things, adverse changes in real estate, financing and general economic or local conditions; the ability to obtain annexation and zoning approvals required to develop our properties; the approval of local governing bodies to develop our properties; successful lobbying of local "no growth" or limited development homeowner groups; eminent domain proceedings; changes in the environmental conditions or changes in the environmental positions of governmental bodies; and potential conflicts of interest between us and our affiliates, including our general partner.  We electronically file our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The public may read and copy any of the reports that are filed with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at (800)-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site at (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically.  Critical Accounting Policies  The SEC previously issued Financial Reporting Release (FRR) or FRR No. 60 "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies." A critical accounting policy is one that would materially affect our operations or financial condition, and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to how we value, classify and allocate costs of our investment properties and revenue recognition. These judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The purpose of the FRR is to provide investors with an understanding of how management forms these policies. Critical accounting policies discussed in this section are not to be confused with accounting principles and methods disclosed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP. GAAP requires information in financial statements about accounting principles, methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates. The following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends, events or uncertainties known which were taken into consideration upon the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions.  Valuation of Investment Properties - On a quarterly basis, we review impairment indicators and if necessary, conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each investment property does not exceed its estimated fair value. If an investment property is considered impaired, we would be required to record an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value.  In determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired, management considers several indicators which require difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, such as projected sales prices, capital expenditures, assessment of current economic conditions and management's intent to hold the remaining parcels until such time as reasonable and acceptable offers are received. These indicators are considered by management in determining the value of any particular property. The value of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain indicators, either individually or taken as a whole. Should the actual results differ from management's judgment, the valuation could be negatively or positively affected.  The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management's continuous process of analyzing each property. For the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, there were no impairments recorded. Subsequent costs incurred above the estimated fair value for any parcels that may be deemed to be impaired will be expensed and included in land operating expenses.  Cost Allocation -We use the area method of cost allocation, whereby a per acre price is used as the standard allocation method for land purchases and sales. The total cost of the parcel is divided by the total number of acres to arrive at a per acre price.  -9-  Revenue Recognition - We recognize income from the sale of land parcels in accordance with the full accrual method of accounting.  Assets Held for Sale - In determining whether to classify an asset as held for sale, we consider whether: (i) management has committed to a plan to sell the asset; (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition;  If all of the above criteria are met, we classify the asset as held for sale. The assets and liabilities associated with those assets that are held for sale are classified separately on the balance sheets for the most recent reporting period. Additionally, the operations for the periods presented are included in the statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  From time to time, we may determine that a "held for sale property" no longer meets the criteria to continue to be classified as held for sale. If this occurs, we record the property at the lower of the carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale or the fair value at the decision date not to sell. As of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we have not classified any investment property as held for sale.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Between October 25, 1989 and October 24, 1991, we sold 50,476.17 limited partnership units to the public at $1,000 per unit resulting in $50,476,170 in gross offering proceeds, not including the general partner's capital contribution of $500.  We used $41,314,301 of gross offering proceeds to purchase, on an all-cash basis, twenty-seven parcels of undeveloped land and two buildings. These investments include the payment of the purchase price, acquisition fees and acquisition costs of such properties. Three of the parcels were purchased during 1990, sixteen during 1991, four during 1992, and four during 1993. On September 16, 2002, we completed a tax-deferred exchange of Parcels 9 and 12 for 50 acres in Kendall County (Parcel 28). Through March 31, 2014, we have had multiple sales, exchange transactions, and conveyances through which we have disposed of the buildings and approximately 3,986 acres of the approximately 4,530 acres originally owned. As of March 31, 2014, cumulative distributions have totaled $92,530,845 to the limited partners, which is equivalent to 183% of the original capital raised which was $50,476,170, and $13,613,195 to the general partner. Of the $92,530,845 distributed to the limited partners, $91,809,845 was net sales proceeds and $721,000 was from operations. As of March 31, 2014, we have used $47,453,723 of working capital for rezoning and other activities. Such amounts have been capitalized and are included in investment properties.  Our capital needs and resources will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the extent to which we conduct rezoning and other activities relating to utility access, the installation of roads, subdivision and/or annexation of land to a municipality, changes in real estate taxes affecting our land, and the amount of revenue received from leasing. As of March 31, 2014, we own, in whole or in part, two parcels, consisting of approximately 544 acres of which 426 are leased to local farmers and are generating sufficient cash flow from leases to cover real estate taxes and insurance expense.  During the three months ended March 31, 2014, we sold the remaining acreage of Parcel 4, resulting in net sales proceeds of $3,872,152 and a gain on sale of $1,812,539. During the three months ended March 31, 2013, there were no land sales. Net sales proceeds, including previously undistributed net sales proceeds, will be used to fund our operations including land improvements and land use activities. At March 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6,474,414. On April 18, 2014, we paid distributions of $3,900,000 to our limited partners and $100,000 to our general partner. The remaining cash balance is available to be used for our costs and liabilities and other activities with respect to our two remaining land parcels. We will evaluate our cash needs during the upcoming year to determine any future distributions.  We continue to closely monitor the real estate market trends, especially within the areas where our remaining parcels are located. We have seen continued improvements in the residential resale real estate market, and are now seeing signs of national homebuilders entering back into the market place. There have been reports of farm parcel sales in surrounding communities from both speculators looking to hold land until the market rebounds as well as farmers looking to increase their farming businesses. We believe we have taken the steps necessary to reduce costs and maintain sufficient reserves of cash and cash equivalents to cover all our costs for an extended period of time as we continue to market the remaining  -10-  parcels for sale. We have farm leases in place which generate sufficient income to cover the costs of insurance expense and real estate taxes. Our remaining land is not encumbered by debt and is located in areas that we believe are in the paths of future development. As such, the Partnership has the ability and management has the intent to hold on to the remaining parcels until such time as reasonable and acceptable offers are received.  Transactions with Related Parties  Our general partner and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursement for salaries and expenses of employees of the general partner and its affiliates relating to our administration. Such costs of $17,703 and $18,794 have been incurred and are included in professional services to affiliates and general and administrative expenses to affiliates for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There are $12,120 and $26,212 in unpaid professional services to affiliates and general and administrative expenses to affiliates as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  An affiliate of our general partner performed marketing and advertising services for us and was reimbursed for direct costs. Such costs of $1,076 and $609 have been incurred and are included in marketing expenses to affiliates for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which $1,114 and $381 was unpaid as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively.  An affiliate of the general partner performed land improvements, rezoning, annexation and other activities to prepare the Partnership's investment properties for sale and was reimbursed (as set forth under terms of the Partnership Agreement) for salaries and direct costs. Such costs of $4,611 and $6,309 have been incurred for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Such costs are included in investment properties, of which $4,663 and $4,777 was unpaid as of March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. Also, an affiliate of the general partner supervises the maintenance of the parcels. Such costs of $567 and $1,272 are included in land operating expenses to affiliates for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, respectively. In addition, the costs related to Parcel 3/27 and Parcel 18 totaled $6,168 for the three months ended March 31, 2013, and are included in discontinued operations, of which $4,611 was unpaid as of December 31, 2013, respectively. The affiliate did not recognize a profit on any project.  As of March 31, 2014, the Partnership held all cash and cash equivalents with Inland Bank and Trust, an affiliate of the general partner.  Results of Operations  As of March 31, 2014, we owned two parcels of land consisting of approximately 544 acres. Of the approximately 544 acres owned, 426 acres are tillable, leased to local farmers and generate sufficient cash flow to cover real estate taxes and insurance expense. Rental income was $38,037 and $37,349 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Farm rent is fully collected during the first quarter. As such, a portion of the farm rent is classified as unearned income. As of March 31, 2014, unearned income was $114,528.  Professional services to affiliates and non-affiliates were $49,123 and $55,609 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Professional services to affiliates and non-affiliates include accounting and legal services. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in accounting fees.  General and administrative expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates were $18,626 and $19,776 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. General and administrative expenses primarily include data processing costs, postage, printing expenses and farm management fees. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in data processing costs.  Marketing expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates were $1,376 and $609 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Marketing expenses to affiliates are costs incurred for preparing and marketing parcels for sale. The increase in marketing expenses is due to some additional internet advertising costs.  Land operating expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates were $8,433 and $8,715 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These costs typically include real estate tax expense, grounds maintenance expense, insurance and the Partnership's proportionate share of the homeowners association fees.  -11-  Interest income was $1,516 and $1,799 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Interest income is primarily a result of cash available to invest on a short term basis during the year as a result of sales proceeds received.  Other income was $2,000 and $2,850 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other income is due primarily to transfer fee income as a result of the number of completed unit transfers. The decrease in 2014 is due to less transfer fee income as a result of a decreased number of completed unit transfers.  Income (loss) from discontinued operations was $(605) and $3,231 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in income (loss) from discontinued operations are the rental income, insurance, real estate taxes, and land operating expenses pertaining to sold parcels. For the three months ended March 31, 2014, the sold parcel includes only Parcel 4. For the three months ended March 31, 2013, sold parcels include Parcel 3/27, Parcel 18, Parcel 22 and Parcel 4.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Certain statements in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. These factors include, among other things, adverse changes in real estate, financing and general economic or local conditions; the ability to obtain annexation and zoning approvals required to develop our properties; the approval of local governing bodies to develop our properties; successful lobbying of local "no growth" or limited development homeowner groups; eminent domain proceedings; changes in the environmental conditions or changes in the environmental positions of governmental bodies; and potential conflicts of interest between us and our affiliates, including our general partner.  Critical Accounting Policies  The Securities and Exchange Commission previously issued Financial Reporting Release (FRR) or FRR No. 60 "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies." A critical accounting policy is one that would materially affect our operations or financial condition, and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to how we value, classify and allocate costs of our investment properties and revenue recognition. These judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The purpose of the FRR is to provide investors with an understanding of how management forms these policies. Critical accounting policies discussed in this section are not to be confused with accounting principles and methods disclosed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP. GAAP requires information in financial statements about accounting principles, methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates. The following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends, events or uncertainties known which were taken into consideration upon the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions.  Valuation of Investment Properties - On a quarterly basis, we review impairment indicators and if necessary, conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each investment property does not exceed its estimated fair value. If an investment property is considered impaired, we would be required to record an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value.  In determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired, management considers several indicators which require difficult, complex and/or subjective judgments, such as projected sales prices, capital expenditures, assessment of current economic conditions, and management's intent to hold on to a property until such time as a reasonable and acceptable offer is received. These indicators are considered by management in determining the value of any particular property. The value of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain indicators, either individually or taken as a whole. Should the actual results differ from management's judgment, the valuation could be negatively or positively affected.  The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management's continuous process of analyzing each property. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not record an impairment. Subsequent costs incurred above the estimated fair value for any parcels that may be deemed to be impaired will be expensed and included in land operating expenses.  Cost Allocation - We use the area method of cost allocation whereby a per acre price is used as the standard allocation method for land purchases and sales. The total cost of the parcel is divided by the total number of acres to arrive at a per acre price.  Revenue Recognition - We recognize income from the sale of land parcels in accordance with the full accrual method of accounting.  Assets Held for Sale - In determining whether to classify an asset as held for sale, we consider whether: (i) management has committed to a plan to sell the asset; (ii) the asset is available for immediate sale, in its present condition;  -13-  Table of Contents  initiated a program to locate a buyer; (iv) we believe that the sale of the asset is probable; (v) the due diligence period per the sales agreement has expired and a closing date has been set; (vi) we are actively marketing the asset for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value; and (vii) actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan.  If all of the above criteria are met, we classify the asset as held for sale. The assets and liabilities associated with those assets that are held for sale are classified separately on the balance sheets for the most recent reporting period. Additionally, the operations for the periods presented are classified on the statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  From time to time, we may determine that a "held for sale property" no longer meets the criteria to continue to be classified as held for sale. If this occurs, we record the property at the lower of the carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale or the fair value at the decision date not to sell. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, we have not classified any properties as held for sale.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Between October 25, 1989 and October 24, 1991, we sold 50,476.17 limited partnership units to the public at $1,000 per unit resulting in $50,476,170 in gross offering proceeds, not including the general partner's capital contribution of $500.  We used $41,314,301 of gross offering proceeds to purchase, on an all-cash basis, twenty-seven parcels of undeveloped land and two buildings. These investments include the payment of the purchase price, acquisition fees and acquisition costs of such properties. Three of the parcels were purchased during 1990, sixteen during 1991, four during 1992, and four during 1993. On September 16, 2002, we completed a tax-deferred exchange of Parcels 9 and 12 for 50 acres in Kendall County (Parcel 28). Through December 31, 2014, we have had multiple sales, exchange transactions and conveyances, disposing of the buildings and approximately 3,986 acres of the approximately 4,530 acres originally owned. Through December 31, 2014, cumulative distributions have totaled $96,430,845 to the limited partners, which is equivalent to 191% of the original capital raised, which was $50,476,170, and cumulative distributions to the general partner have totaled $13,713,195. Of the $96,430,845 distributed to the limited partners, $95,709,845 was net sales proceeds and $721,000 was from operations. Through December 31, 2014, we have used $47,478,601 of working capital for rezoning and other activities. Such amounts have been capitalized and are included in investment properties.  Our capital needs and resources will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the extent to which we conduct rezoning and other activities relating to utility access, the installation of roads, subdivision and/or annexation of land to a municipality, changes in real estate taxes affecting our land, and the amount of revenue received from farm rents. As of December 31, 2014, we own two parcels, the majority of which are leased to local farmers and are generating sufficient cash flow from farm leases to cover real estate taxes and insurance expense. We continue to market the remaining acres for sale.  At December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,282,333 which is available to be used for our costs and liabilities, cash distributions to partners and other activities with respect to one or both of our land parcels.  During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold Parcel 4 for which we received $3,872,152 in net sales proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of $1,812,539. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we sold the remaining acreage of Parcel 3/27 for which we received $1,842,245 in net sales proceeds, resulting in a loss on sale of $95,755, approximately 2.3 acres of Parcel 20 for which we received $699,454 in net sales proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of $358,117, the remaining acreage of Parcel 22 for which we received $301,137 in net sales proceeds, resulting in a loss on sale of $59,148, and the remaining acreage of Parcel 18 for which we received $623,939 in net sales proceeds, resulting in a gain on sale of $186,438. Net sales proceeds, including previously undistributed net sales proceeds, will be used to fund our operations including land improvements and land use activities. We will evaluate our cash needs during the upcoming year to determine any future distributions.  We continue to closely monitor the real estate market trends, especially within the areas where our remaining parcels are located. We have seen continued improvements in the residential real estate market including new construction with national homebuilders entering back into the market place. There have been farm parcel sales in surrounding communities from both speculators looking to hold land until the market fully rebounds as well as farmers looking to increase their  -14-  Table of Contents  farming businesses. We believe we have taken the steps necessary to reduce costs and maintain sufficient reserves of cash and cash equivalents to cover all our costs for an extended period of time as we continue to market the remaining parcels for sale. We have farm leases in place which generate sufficient income to cover the costs of insurance expense and real estate taxes. Our remaining land is not encumbered by debt and is located in areas that we believe are in the paths of future development. As such, the Partnership has the ability and management has the intent to hold on to the remaining parcels until such time as reasonable and acceptable offers are received.  Transactions with Related Parties  Our general partner and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursement for salaries and expenses of employees of the general partner and its affiliates relating to our administration. Such costs of $54,651 and $77,895 are included in professional services to affiliates and general and administrative expenses to affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which $7,726 and $26,212 was unpaid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  An affiliate of our general partner performs marketing and advertising services for us and is reimbursed for direct costs. Such costs of $2,832 and $2,605 have been incurred and are included in marketing expenses to affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which $523 and $381 was unpaid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  An affiliate of our general partner performs land improvements, rezoning, annexation and other activities to prepare our investment properties for sale and is reimbursed for salaries and direct costs. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we incurred $17,417 and $20,011, respectively, of such costs. Such costs are included in investment properties, of which $3,185 and $4,777 was unpaid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Also, an affiliate of the general partner supervises the maintenance of the parcels. Such costs of $2,055 and $5,275 are included in land operating expenses to affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, of which $123 and $0 was unpaid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, the maintenance costs related to Parcels 3/27 and 18 totaled $0 and $22,957 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in discontinued operations, of which $0 and $4,611 was unpaid as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The affiliate did not recognize a profit on any project.  As of December 31, 2014, the Partnership held all cash and cash equivalents with Inland Bank and Trust, an affiliate of the general partner.  Results of Operations  As of December 31, 2014, we owned two parcels of land consisting of approximately 544 acres. Of the approximately 544 acres owned, approximately 426 acres are tillable, leased to local farmers and generate sufficient cash flow to cover real estate taxes and insurance. Rental income was $152,565 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The 2015 farm leases for our tillable land were negotiated and fully executed within the first quarter of 2015 at comparable rates to the 2014 farm leases.  Professional services to affiliates and non-affiliates were $140,868 and $174,560 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Professional services to affiliates and non-affiliates include primarily accounting and legal services. The decrease is due primarily to a decrease in accounting fees.  General and administrative expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates were $44,652 and $52,048 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. General and administrative expenses primarily include data processing costs, postage, printing, investor services expenses and farm management fees. General and administrative expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates decreased primarily due to a decrease in postage, data processing, and subscription services.  Marketing expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates were $3,282 and $4,525 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Marketing expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates are costs incurred for preparing and marketing parcels for sale and monitoring activity at the parcels. The marketing expenses decreased in 2014 primarily due to less sales activity in 2014.  -15-  Table of Contents  Land operating expenses to affiliates and non-affiliates were $44,198 and $39,967 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These costs typically include real estate tax expense, ground maintenance expense, and insurance expense. The increase for 2014 is due to an increase in real estate taxes for the remaining parcels.  Interest income was $5,905 and $6,752 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Interest income is primarily a result of cash available to invest on a short term basis during the year as a result of sales proceeds received. Interest income decreased due to less cash available to invest.  Other income was $5,945 and $9,950 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Other income is due primarily to transfer fee income as a result of the number of completed Unit transfers. The decrease for 2014 is due to less transfer income as a result of a decreased number of investors seeking transfers.  Loss from discontinued operations was $605 and $1,870 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Included in loss from discontinued operations are the rental income, insurance, real estate taxes, and land operating expenses pertaining to parcels sold during 2014 and 2013. The operations related to Parcel 4, which was sold during the first quarter of 2014, are included in the loss from discontinued operations on the accompanying statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In addition, the loss related to Parcel 3/27, Parcel 18 and Parcel 22, which were sold during 2013, are included in the loss from discontinued operations on the accompanying statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.  On March 14, 2014, the Partnership sold Parcel 4, resulting in a gain on sale of $1,812,539 for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the Partnership sold the remaining acres of Parcel 3/27, approximately 2.3 acres of Parcel 20, the remaining acres of Parcel 22 and the remaining acres of Parcel 18, resulting in a gain on sale of $389,652.  Our Partnership Agreement  Our partnership agreement prescribes the allocation of profits and losses, and the distribution priorities of available cash. If and to the extent that real estate taxes and insurance payable with respect to our land during a given year exceed our revenues, our general partner will make a supplemental capital contribution of such amount to us to ensure that we have sufficient funds to make such payments and receives a special allocation of expenses in a like amount.  Profits and losses from operations (other than capital transactions) will be allocated 99% to the limited partners and 1% to the general partner. The net gain from sales of our properties is first allocated among the partners in proportion to the negative balances, if any, in their respective capital accounts. Thereafter, except as provided below, net gain is allocated to the general partner in an amount equal to the proceeds distributed to the general partner from such sale and the balance of any net gain is allocated to the limited partners. If the amount of net gain realized from a sale is less than the amount of cash distributed to the general partner from such sale, we will allocate income or gain to the general partner in an amount equal to the excess of the cash distributed to the general partner with respect to such sale as quickly as permitted by law. Any net loss from a sale will be allocated to the limited partners.  Distributions of net sales proceeds will be allocated between the general partner and the limited partners based upon both an aggregate overall return to the limited partners and a separate return with respect to each parcel of land purchased by us.  As a general rule, net sale proceeds will be distributed 90% to the limited partners and 10% to the general partner until the limited partners have received from net sale proceeds (i) a return of their original capital plus (ii) a noncompounded cumulative preferred return of 15% of their invested capital. However, with respect to each parcel of land, the general partner's 10% share will be subordinated until the limited partners receive a return of the original capital attributed to such parcel ("parcel capital") plus a 6% per annum noncompounded cumulative preferred return thereon.  After the amounts described in items (i) and (ii) above and any previously subordinated distributions to the general partner have been paid, and the amount of any supplemental capital contributions have been repaid to the general partner, subsequent distributions shall be paid 75% to the limited partners and 25% to the general partner without considering parcel capital. If, after all net sale proceeds have been distributed, the general partner has received more than 25% of all  -16-  Table of Contents  net sale proceeds (exclusive of distributions made to the limited partners to return their original capital), the general partner shall contribute to us for distribution to the limited partners an amount equal to such excess.  Any distributions from net sales proceeds at a time when invested capital is greater than zero shall be deemed applied first to reduction of such invested capital before application to payment of any deficiency in the 15% cumulative preferred return.  Subsequent Events  The Partnership evaluates subsequent events occurring between the most recent balance sheet date and the date that the financial statements are available to be issued in order to determine whether the subsequent events are to be recorded in and/or disclosed in the Partnership's financial statements and footnotes. The financial statements are considered to be available to be issued at the time that they are filed with the SEC. There are no subsequent events to report that would have a material impact on the Partnership's financial statements.  Other Items  In accordance with Article XVI Section 16.1 of the Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P. Partnership Agreement and Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(j), we did not reach the maximum threshold of limited partnership units that may be transferred/assigned directly between parties during 2014. For the benefit of interested limited partners, we have a relationship with a "qualified matching service" as defined under Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(g). In accordance with this Treasury Regulation and the IRS private letter ruling obtained by the "qualified matching service", we understand that limited partnership units may be transferred/assigned through the "qualified matching service" up to a separate maximum threshold each taxable year (in addition to the maximum threshold that may be transferred/assigned directly between parties discussed above). However, there can be no assurance that the IRS private letter ruling will apply to transfers of units, or that any particular transfer will not violate the transfer restrictions contained in our partnership agreement or the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section 1.7704-1(g). If you have any interest in participating in a transfer/assignment of partnership units through this "qualified matching service," please contact American Partnership Board directly at 800-736-9797. You are strongly encouraged to consult your personal legal, financial and tax advisors in connection with any such transfer/assignment.  The Illinois Department of Revenue regulates Illinois income tax withholding requirements for nonresident partners. Payment of the required withholding amount will be made to the Illinois Department of Revenue prior to April 15, 2015. You are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor in connection with the Illinois withholding requirements for nonresident partners. We are also required to pay a withholding tax to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to a partner's allocable share of our taxable net income, if the partner is a foreign person. We will first pay the withholding tax from the distributions to any nonresident and/or foreign partners, and to the extent that the tax exceeds the amount of distributions withheld, or if there have been no distributions to withhold, the excess will be accounted for as a distribution to such nonresident and/or foreign partners. Payment of the required withholding amount will be made to the Internal Revenue Service prior to April 15, 2015.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Contractual Obligations, Liabilities and Contracts and Commitments  None  Litigation  On or about April 8, 2010, the Partnership received notification from the attorneys for the Village of Elburn that in effect demanded completion of certain land improvements. The Partnership is a co-indemnitor of the subdivision bonds that secure completion of the land improvements on Parcels 5 and 19 of the Blackberry Subdivision in Elburn, IL. On April 22, 2010, the Partnership received notice from the bonding companies demanding completion and satisfaction of such obligations. The actual costs of the remaining improvements of the subdivision for the work related to the called bonds are less than the outstanding bond amounts. The Partnership worked with a representative of the bonding company who had been working with the Village of Elburn on this matter. A meeting was held to obtain a common understanding of the scope of remaining work required to be completed. The parties determined that it was necessary to hire an engineer to provide an updated punch list of required work. The Partnership received a final updated punch list of required work, as  -17-  Table of Contents  well as bids for the actual cost to complete the required improvements. During the second quarter of 2013, a settlement agreement was entered into between the Partnership and the bonding company. The Partnership paid the final agreed-upon amount of $1,300,000 on May 20, 2013 and received a release from the bonding company.  On or about December 16, 2011, the Partnership received service of a Third Party Complaint filed by Bond Safeguard Insurance Company ("Bond") against the Partnership and Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation along with six other third party defendants. The lawsuit has been brought in the Circuit Court of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit in Kane County, Illinois (the "Lawsuit"). In the Lawsuit, the County of Kane (the "County") alleges that B&B Enterprises and/or Blackberry Creek Development Corporation (collectively "B&B") are responsible for the relocation of approximately twenty-three power poles at an alleged cost of $819,740. Alternatively, the County alleges that either Bond or Commonwealth Edison Company ("ComEd") is responsible for the cost of the pole relocation. On November 23, 2011, Bond filed an Answer denying the County's allegations and has pled five affirmative defenses. The affirmative defenses generally allege that the bond did not cover the pole relocation, that only one pole needs to be relocated at significantly less cost, and alternatively, that ComEd is responsible for any pole relocation costs. As alternative relief, Bond filed a Counterclaim against B&B and ComEd and a Third Party Complaint against the Partnership and four individuals (the "Individuals") contending that, if Bond is deemed responsible for or settles the County's allegations, then B&B, the Partnership, and/or the Individuals bear some or all of this responsibility under a General Agreement of Indemnity. Bond also seeks its attorneys' fees based on such General Agreement of Indemnity.  On February 21, 2012, the Partnership filed an Answer and Affirmative Defenses denying the material allegations asserted by Bond. Bond has not replied to the Affirmative Defenses. The County has served discovery requests to B&B, Bond and ComEd. Bond has served discovery requests on the County. The County has produced a limited amount of documents and provided interrogatory responses to Bond which have been provided to us. ComEd produced limited documents and responses in March 2013 and produced additional documents in June 2013 following entry of a protective order. The County's counsel previously informed counsel for the other parties that between five and eight of the poles at issue have been moved by ComEd as part of a different project. Thus, these poles were not expected to be a continued issue in this case. In October 2014, the County's counsel informed counsel for the other parties that seven of these poles were only partially removed by ComEd as part of the different project. The County has not yet indicated whether it will pursue removal of these seven partial poles as part of this lawsuit. Thus, the number of poles at issue remains under investigation and may be subject to further dispute.  The investigation of the claims and defenses in the Lawsuit is ongoing. It is not possible at this time to evaluate the likelihood of an outcome. For this same reason, any effort to estimate the range of potential loss is limited, other than $0 (based on a judgment in favor of the Partnership), to the . . .

Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, LP





Description




                          Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P. is a Limited Partnership that was formed in June 1989, to invest in undeveloped land on an all-cash basis and realize appreciation of such land upon resale.


Please note that Net Asset Value (NAV) and Funds From Operation (FFO) are not reported for this asset; refer to the SEC Edgar Filings link for additional information about Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P.                        





	Original share price is the original issuance price of non-traded public REIT shares.
	

Book value is the most recently published total shareholders' equity divided by shares outstanding. 


	Many non-traded public REIT managers publish an estimated net asset value (“NAV”) per share. To make this calculation, REIT managers rely in part on an estimate of the fair market value of the REIT’s real estate investments, then adjust to give effect to other REIT assets and liabilities, including mortgages. The resultant valuation is then divided by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at a NAV per share.
	

Historic dividend is the recent amount paid by a non-traded public REIT to its shareholders. Dividends are typically distributed quarterly and are subject to adjustment at each distribution period. 	 

FFO is a financial calculcation that is widely recognized in the REIT industry as a measure of operating performance, or cash flow. FFO is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO was developed by NAREIT as a measure of performance to recognize that income-producing real estate has historically not depreciated consistent with the basis as determined under GAAP.

PART I
Item 1. Business

Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P.  was formed on June 28, 1989, to invest in undeveloped land on an all-cash basis and realize appreciation of such land upon resale. On October 25, 1989, we commenced an offering of 30,000 (subject to an increase to 60,000) limited partnership units or units at $1,000 per unit, pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-11 under the Securities Act of 1933. On October 24, 1991, we terminated our offering of units, after we sold 50,476.17 units, at $1,000 per unit, resulting in $50,476,170 in gross offering proceeds, not including our general partner's capital contribution of $500. All of the holders of our units were admitted to our partnership. Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation is our general partner. Our limited partners share in their portion of benefits of ownership of our real property investments according to the number of units held. As of December 31, 2004, we have repurchased a total of 408.65 units for $383,822 from various limited partners through the unit repurchase program. Under this program, limited partners could, under certain circumstances, have their units repurchased for an amount equal to their original capital as reduced by distributions from net sale proceeds.

We purchased on an all-cash basis, 27 parcels of undeveloped land and two buildings and are engaged in the rezoning and resale of the parcels. On September 16, 2002, we completed a tax-deferred exchange of Parcels 9 and 12 for 50 acres in Kendall County (Parcel 28). All of the investments were made in the Chicago metropolitan area. The anticipated holding period of the land was approximately two to seven years from the completion of the land portfolio acquisitions. As a result of the lengthy rezoning and entitlement processes and the no growth mentality of the municipalities where the land is located, our holding period has exceeded our original estimates. As of December 31, 2004, we have had multiple sales transactions, through which we have disposed of approximately 2,997 acres of the approximately 4,530 acres originally owned. We continue to market the remaining acres for sale.

We are engaged in the business of real estate investment which management considers being a single operating segment. A presentation of information about operating segments would not be material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole.

We plan to enhance the value of our land through pre-development activities such as rezoning, annexation and land planning. We have already been successful in, or are in the process of, pre-development activity on several of our land investments.  Parcel 20 has been granted rezoning which will permit additional land to be useable for development.  We are in zoning and planning discussions for Parcels 3 and 27. We have completed our final planning on Parcels 4 and 18 and marketing has begun on these parcels. 

In addition to the sales of the remaining acres of Parcels 1, 14 and 26 in 2004, we also sold 99 acres of Parcel 22, 80 acres of Parcel 8, and 9 acres of Parcel 18. In March 2004, we paid distributions totaling $15,000,000, which included $10,888,098 paid to the limited partners and $4,111,902 paid to the general partner. In December 2004, we paid an additional distribution of $6,200,000 to the limited partners.  In addition to these sales which occurred in 2004, we anticipate additional sales of over 250 acres of Parcels 8, 10, 20 and 21 during 2005.  Undistributed net sales proceeds will be used to cover our operations, including property upgrades. We will evaluate our cash needs throughout the year to determine future distributions.

We had no employees during 2004.

Our general partner and its affiliates provide services to us. Our general partner and its affiliates are reimbursed for salaries and expenses of employees of the general partner and its affiliates relating to the administration of the partnership. An affiliate of the general partner performs marketing and advertising services for us and is reimbursed for direct costs. An affiliate of the general partner performs property upgrades, rezoning, annexation and other activities to prepare our parcels for sale and is reimbursed for salaries and direct costs.

Our general partner anticipates that the land we acquired will produce sufficient income to pay property taxes, insurance and other miscellaneous expenses. Income will be derived through leases to farmers or from other activities compatible with undeveloped land. Although the general partner believes that leasing our land will generate sufficient revenues to pay these expenses, there can be no assurance that this will in fact occur. Our general partner has agreed to make a supplemental capital contribution to us if and to the extent that real estate taxes and insurance payable with respect to our land during a given year exceed the revenue earned by us from leasing our land during such year. Any supplemental capital contribution will be repaid only after limited partners have received, over the life of our partnership, a return of their original capital plus the 15% cumulative return. A majority of the parcels purchased by us consist of land which generates revenue from farming or other leasing activities. It is not expected that we will generate cash distributions to limited partners from farm leases or other leasing activities. Through December 31, 2004, our land has generated sufficient revenues from leasing to cover real estate taxes and insurance expense.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Certain statements in this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Federal Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance, or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance, or achievements expressed or implied by these forward looking statements. These factors include, among other things, the ability to obtain annexation and zoning approvals required to develop our properties; the approval of local governing bodies to develop our properties; successful lobbying of local "no growth" or limited development homeowner groups; adverse changes in real estate, financing and general economic or local conditions; eminent domain proceedings; changes in the environmental conditions or changes in the environmental positions of governmental bodies; and potential conflicts of interest between us and our affiliates, including our general partner.

Critical Accounting Policies

On December 12, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Financial Reporting Release or FRR No. 60 "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies."  A critical accounting policy is one that would materially affect our operations or financial condition, and requires management to make estimates or judgements in certain circumstances. We believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to how we value our investment properties and mortgage loans receivable and revenue recognition.  These judgements often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The purpose of the FRR is to provide investors with an understanding of how management forms these policies.  Critical accounting policies discussed in this section are not to be confused with accounting principles and methods disclosed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America or GAAP.  GAAP requires information in financial statements about accounting principles, methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates.  The following disclosure discusses judgements known to management pertaining to trends, events or uncertainties known which were taken into consideration upon the application of those policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions.

Valuation of Investment Properties - On a quarterly basis, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, we conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each property does not exceed its estimated fair value.  If this were to occur, we would be required to record an impairment loss equal to the excess of carrying value over fair value.

In determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired, management considers several factors such as projected capital expenditures and sales prices. The aforementioned factors are considered by management in determining the value of any particular property.  The value of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain factors, either individually or taken as a whole.  Should the actual results differ from management's judgement, the valuation could be negatively or positively affected.

The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management's continuous process of analyzing each property. For the year ended December 31, 2004, we had recorded no such impairment.

Cost Allocation - We use the area method of cost allocation, which approximates the relative sales method of cost allocation, whereby a per acre price is used as the standard allocation method for land purchases and sales. The total cost of the parcel is divided by the total number of acres to arrive at a per acre price.

-9-


Valuation of Mortgage Loans Receivable - On a quarterly basis, we conduct an analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each mortgage loan receivable is recoverable from the borrower. If we determine all or a portion of the receivable is not collectible, we would be required to record an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to the amount estimated to be uncollectible.

In determining the value of mortgage loans receivable, management considers projected sales proceeds available and expenses related to the property associated with the mortgage. Should the actual results differ from management's judgement, the valuation could be negatively or positively affected.

The valuation and possible subsequent allowance for doubtful accounts is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management's continuous process of analyzing each mortgage loan receivable. As of December 31, 2004, the partnership has evaluated the mortgage loans receivables and recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,208,378 on one of the mortgage loans receivable.

Revenue Recognition - We recognize income from the sale of land parcels in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate.


Liquidity and Capital Resources

On October 25, 1989, we commenced an offering of 30,000 (subject to increase to 60,000) limited partnership units or units pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-11 under the Securities Act of 1933. On October 24, 1991, we terminated our offering of units, with total sales of 50,476.17 units, at $1,000 per unit, resulting in $50,476,170 in gross offering proceeds, not including the general partner's capital contribution of $500. All of the holders of these units were admitted to the partnership. Our limited partners share in their portion of benefits of ownership of our real property investments according to the number of units held.

We used $41,314,301 of gross offering proceeds to purchase, on an all-cash basis, 27 parcels of undeveloped land and two buildings. These investments include the payment of the purchase price, acquisition fees and acquisition costs of such properties.  Three of the parcels were purchased during 1990, sixteen during 1991, four during 1992, and four during 1993. On September 16, 2002, we completed a tax-deferred exchange of Parcels 9 and 12 for 50 acres in Kendall County (Parcel 28). As of December 31, 2004, we have had multiple sales and exchange transactions through which we have disposed of the buildings and approximately 2,997 acres of the approximately 4,530 acres originally owned. As of December 31, 2004, cumulative distributions have totaled $61,265,834 to the limited partners and $7,488,195 to the general partner.  Of the $61,265,834 distributed to the limited partners, $60,544,834 was net sales proceeds, which represents a return of original capital, and $721,000 was from operations. As of December 31, 2004, we have used $25,509,564 of working capital for rezoning and other activities. Such amounts have been capitalized and are included in investment properties.

Our capital needs and resources will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the extent to which we conduct rezoning and other activities relating to utility access, the installation of roads, subdivision and/or annexation of land to a municipality, changes in real estate taxes affecting our land, and the amount of revenue received from leasing. As of December 31, 2004, we own, in whole or in part, 12 parcels, the majority of which are leased to local tenants and are generating sufficient cash flow from leases to cover property taxes and insurance. We continue to market the remaining acres for sale.

At December 31, 2004, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4,338,694 which is available to be used for our costs and liabilities, cash distributions to partners and other activities with respect to some or all of our land parcels. 

-10-

In 2004 we received net sales proceeds of approximately $23,345,000 from the sales of Parcels 1, 8, 14, 18, 22 and 26. On March 26, 2004, we paid distributions totaling $15,000,000, which includes $10,888,098 paid to the limited partners and $4,111,902 paid to the general partner. In December 2004, we distributed an additional $6,200,000 to the limited partners.  In addition to these sales which occurred in 2004, we anticipate additional sales of Parcels  3, 10, 18 and 20 during 2005. See Subsequent Events for sales which have occurred in 2005. We have entered into two sales contracts on portions of Parcel 18. Undistributed net sales proceeds will be used to cover our operations, including property upgrades. We will evaluate our cash needs throughout the year to determine future distributions.

We plan to enhance the value of our land through pre-development activities such as rezoning, annexation and land planning. We have already been successful in, or are in the process of, pre-development activity on several of our land investments.  Parcel 20 has been granted rezoning which will permit additional land to be useable for development.  We are in zoning and planning discussions for Parcels 3 and 27. We have completed our final planning on Parcels 4 and 18 and marketing has begun on these parcels.


Transactions with Related Parties

Our general partner and its affiliates are entitled to reimbursement for salaries and expenses of employees of the general partner and its affiliates relating to our administration. Such costs of $64,788, $71,464 and $90,522 are included in professional services to affiliates and general and administrative expenses to affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, of which $12,267 and $8,354 was unpaid as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

An affiliate of our general partner performed marketing and advertising services for us and was reimbursed for direct costs.   Such costs of $28,048, $26,008 and $23,495 have been incurred and paid and are included in marketing expenses to affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, all of which was paid at December 31, 2004 and 2003.

An affiliate of our general partner performed property upgrades, rezoning, annexation and other activities to prepare our land investments for sale and was reimbursed for salaries and direct costs. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we incurred $256,488 and $209,345, respectively, of such costs. The affiliate did not recognize a profit on any project. Such costs are included in investment properties, of which $21,775 and $36,913 was unpaid as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Results of Operations

Income from the sale of investment properties of $23,345,650 and cost of investment properties sold of $6,573,355 recorded for the year ended December 31, 2004 is the result of the sale of the remaining 372 acres of Parcel 1, the sale of 80 acres of Parcel 8, the sale of 1.2 acres of Parcel 14, the sale of 9.25 acres of Parcel 18, the sale of 101 acres of Parcel 22 and the sale of the 10 remaining lots of Parcel 26.  Income from the sale of investment properties of $3,792,214 and cost of investment properties sold of $2,258,971 for the year ended December 31, 2003 is the result of the sale of approximately 3 acres of Parcel 2, 14 acres of Parcel 14, 34 acres of Parcel 22 and the sale of additional lots of Parcel 26. The sales activity for the year ended December 31, 2003 is the result of favorable zoning and a change in our marketing approach to target homebuilders, commercial users and land developers. Income from the sale of investment properties of $10,950,654 and cost of investment properties sold of $4,420,813 for the year ended December 31, 2002 is the result of the sale of approximately 12 acres of Parcels 14 and 17, 136 acres of Parcel 22, the sale of the remaining lot at the Ponds of Mill Race Creek subdivision (Parcel 23) and the sale of additional lots of the Bliss Woods subdivision (Parcel 26).

During 2001, we sold 189 acres of Parcel 5 and 436 acres of Parcel 19 for $17,500,000 and recorded deferred gain of $10,203,634.  We received a deferred down payment note in the amount of $1,500,000, due December 31, 2001.  The note had an interest rate of 6%, however the note provided for the interest to be waived if the principal was paid in full by December 1, 2001.  We received payment of the deferred down payment note on December 1, 2001 and recognized $875,923 of deferred gain.  We also received an installment note in the amount of $16,000,000 at the time of closing.  The installment note matures July 1, 2011 and has an interest rate of 6%. During 2004, we received principal payments totaling $2,117,892 and recognized deferred gain of $1,239,953. As of December 31, 2004, the balance of the mortgage loan receivable was $12,677,979. The remaining deferred gain will be recognized as payments are received.

As of December 31, 2004, we owned 12 parcels of land consisting of approximately 1,533 acres. Of the approximately 1,533 acres owned, 1,236 acres are tillable, leased to local farmers and generate sufficient cash flow to cover property taxes, insurance and other miscellaneous expenses. Rental income was $127,291, $190,115 and $201,262 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Rental income continues to decrease due to a decrease in the tillable acres as a result of sales. 

Professional services to affiliates were $40,156, $38,388 and $62,728 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Professional services to affiliates decreased in 2004 and 2003 due to a decrease in legal services as a result of less sales activity.

General and administrative expenses to non-affiliates were $53,113, $29,206 and $45,541 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2004 was due to an increase in the printing, postage and investor service expenses. 

Tax expenses were $144,677, $56,451 and $90,959 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.  The increase in tax expenses in 2004 is due to state taxes paid and accrued as a result of the land sales.

Marketing expenses to non-affiliates were $75,440, $79,038 and $151,090 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in 2002 was due to increased marketing and advertising through radio and local cable television ads. In 2003 and continuing into 2004, we changed our marketing approach to target homebuilders, industrial users and land developers through direct mailings, newspaper and trade publication advertising and an enhanced website.

Land operating expenses to non-affiliates were $50,465, $81,971 and $215,126 for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. These costs primarily include real estate tax expense, ground maintenance and insurance expense on the parcels owned and decrease as acres are sold.  

We determined that the maximum value of Parcel 15 could be realized if the parcel was developed and sold as individual lots. However, if we had followed that plan, there is a possibility that it could have increased income taxes. Therefore, we sold the parcel to a third party developer whereby 100% of the sales price was represented by a note receivable from the buyer. This transaction was deemed an installment sale.  After the sale, the developer, through a limited liability company or LLC, secured third party financing to cover the deferred down payment owed to us as well as provide proceeds to begin the development of the project. This sale was structured so that the deferred down payment received at the time of the sale was sufficient to provide a distribution to our limited partners that equated to the parcel capital allocated to the parcel plus approximately a 6% return per annum on the capital invested in the parcel (parcel capital) through the date of the distribution.

-12-

The velocity of the developer's individual home sales was slower than was originally projected and consequently, the developer's carrying costs were higher.  As a result of the slower lot sales, the net sale proceeds available to us are lower than anticipated. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, we have recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,208,378 and $336,712 relating to the mortgage receivable and accrued interest, respectively, relating to the sale of Parcel 15 and have written off the related deferred gain of $747,454.

Our general partner guaranteed the third party development loans owed by the LLC. In reviewing the development's financial situation, our general partner determined that it would be in its best interest to have an affiliate acquire the interest in the limited liability company. The general partner and its affiliates concluded that they could better control the continuing costs to complete the development and would therefore have the best opportunity to limit their exposure under the guarantee agreements and possibly recover a portion of the amount owed. An affiliate of our general partner contributed approximately $1,500,000 to acquire the interests in these LLCs. Our general partner contributed approximately $500,000 to pay off the debt under its guarantee of the LLC loans. The affiliate of the general partner will complete the development and sale of this project. We continue to monitor the development's financial situation.  Our limited partners received distributions that equated to the parcel capital plus approximately a 6% return per annum on the parcel capital through the date of the distribution.


Our Partnership Agreement

Our partnership agreement defines the allocation of profits and losses, and available cash. If and to the extent that real estate taxes and insurance payable with respect to our land during a given year exceed our revenues, our general partner will make a supplemental capital contribution of such amount to us to ensure that we have sufficient funds to make such payments.

Profits and losses from operations (other than capital transactions) will be allocated 99% to the limited partners and 1% to the general partner. The net gain from sales of our properties is first allocated among the partners in proportion to the negative balances, if any, in their respective capital accounts. Thereafter, except as provided below, net gain is allocated to the general partner in an amount equal to the proceeds distributed to the general partner from such sale and the balance of any net gain is allocated to the limited partners. If the amount of net gain realized from a sale is less than the amount of cash distributed to the general partner from such sale, we will allocate income or gain to the general partner in an amount equal to the excess of the cash distributed to the general partner with respect to such sale as quickly as permitted by law.  Any net loss from a sale will be allocated to the limited partners.

Distributions of net sale proceeds will be allocated between the general partner and the limited partners based upon both an aggregate overall return to the limited partners and a separate return with respect to each parcel of land purchased by us.

As a general rule, net sale proceeds will be distributed 90% to the limited partners and 10% to the general partner until the limited partners have received from net sale proceeds  (i) a return of their original capital plus (ii) a noncompounded cumulative preferred return of 15% of their invested capital. However, with respect to each parcel of land, the general partner's 10% share will be subordinated until the limited partners receive a return of the original capital attributed to such parcel ("parcel capital") plus a 6% per annum noncompounded cumulative preferred return thereon.

After the amounts described in items  (i) and  (ii) above and any previously subordinated distributions to the general partner have been paid, and the amount of any supplemental capital contributions have been repaid to the general partner, subsequent distributions shall be paid 75% to the limited partners and 25% to the general partner without considering parcel capital. If, after all net sale proceeds have been distributed, the general partner has received more than 25% of all net sale proceeds (exclusive of distributions made to the limited partners to return their original capital), the general partner shall contribute to us for distribution to the limited partners an amount equal to such excess.

Any distributions from net sales proceeds at a time when invested capital is greater than zero shall be deemed applied first to reduction of such invested capital before application to payment of any deficiency in the 15% cumulative preferred return.


Subsequent Events

On January 10, 2005, we sold 150 acres of Parcel 10 for approximately $7,882,000 and recorded a gain of approximately $5,900,000.

On February 10, 2005, we sold 10 lots of Parcel 18 for approximately $520,000 and recorded a gain of approximately $67,000.

On February 17, 2005, we sold 36 acres of Parcel 2 for approximately $2,250,000 and recorded a gain of approximately $1,630,000.

Inflation

Inflation in future periods may cause capital appreciation of our investments in land. Rental income levels  (from leases to new tenants or renewals of existing tenants) will rise and fall in accordance with normal agricultural market conditions and may or may not be affected by inflation. To date, our operations  have not been significantly affected by inflation.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm


To the Partners of 
Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P. (a limited partnership) ("the Partnership") as of December 31, 2004, and the related statements of operations, partners' capital, and cash flows for the year then ended.  The financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.  

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership's internal control over financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P. at December 31, 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Financial Statements

For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002
(1) Organization and Basis of Accounting

The Registrant, Inland Land Appreciation Fund II, L.P. (the "Partnership"), is a limited partnership formed on June 28, 1989, pursuant to the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, to invest in undeveloped land on an all-cash basis and realize appreciation of such land upon resale. On October 25, 1989, the Partnership commenced an Offering of 30,000 (subject to increase to 60,000) Limited Partnership Units pursuant to a Registration under the Securities Act of 1933.  The Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement") provides for Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation to be the General Partner. On October 24, 1991, the Partnership terminated its Offering of Units, with total sales of 50,476.17 Units, at $1,000 per Unit, resulting in $50,476,170 in gross offering proceeds, not including the General Partner's capital contribution of $500. All of the holders of these Units have been admitted to the Partnership. As of December 31, 2004, the Partnership has repurchased a total of 408.65 Units for $383,822 from various Limited Partners through the Unit Repurchase Program. Under this program, Limited Partners may, under certain circumstances, have their Units repurchased for an amount equal to their Invested Capital.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain reclassifications were made to the 2002 and 2003 financial statements to conform with the 2004 presentation.

Offering costs have been offset against the Limited Partners' capital accounts.

The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents and are carried at cost, which approximates market.

The Partnership recognizes income from the sale of land parcels in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 66, "Accounting for Sales of Real Estate".

For vacant land parcels and parcels with insignificant buildings and improvements, the Partnership uses the area method of allocation, which approximates the relative sales method of allocation, whereby a per acre price is used as the standard allocation method for land purchases and sales. The total cost of the parcel is divided by the total number of acres to arrive at a per acre price. For parcels with significant buildings and improvements (Parcel 24, described in Note 4), the Partnership records the buildings and improvements at a cost based upon the appraised value at the date of acquisition. Buildings and improvements are depreciated using the straight-line method of depreciation over a useful life of thirty years.  Repair and maintenance expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets", ("SFAS No. 144").  SFAS 144 addresses accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets.  This statement supersedes SFAS No. 121.  The Partnership adopted the provisions of this statement beginning January 1, 2002.  SFAS No. 144 established new rules for the recognition, measurement and reporting of long-lived assets which are impaired and either held for sale or in use by the Partnership. The adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the Partnership.

A presentation of information about operating segments as required in SFAS No.  131, "Disclosures About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information" would not be material to an understanding of the Partnership's business taken as a whole as the Partnership is engaged in the business of real estate investment which management considers to be a single operating segment.

On January 1, 2003, the Partnership adopted FASB Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45") "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness to Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and a rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34". FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued. FIN 45 also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the Partnership's financial statements.

In January 2003, FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46") "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) No. 51", which was revised in December 2003.  The primary objectives of FIN No. 46 are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights (Variable Interest Entities) and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the Variable Interest Entity (the Primary Beneficiary).  The effective date for the Partnership was March 31, 2004. FIN 46, as revised, did not have a material impact on the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement No. 150 ("SFAS 150") "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity".  This statement establishes standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments as liabilities that embody obligations of the issuer and have characteristics of both liabilities and equity. SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial instruments created or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The provisions of SFAS No. 150 did not have an impact on the Partnership's financial condition and results of operations. 

Effective January 1, 2001, the Partnership adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138 and 149. This statement standardizes the accounting for derivative instruments by requiring that an entity recognize those items as assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure them at fair value.  It also provides for matching the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of (a) the changes in fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk or (b) the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transaction.  The net impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 133 has no effect on the Partnership's financial statements.

The Partnership is required to pay a withholding tax to the Internal Revenue Service with respect to a Partner's allocable share of the Partnership's taxable net income, if the Partner is a foreign person. The Partnership will first pay the withholding tax from the distributions to any foreign partner, and to the extent that the tax exceeds the amount of distributions withheld, or if there have been no distributions to withhold, the excess will be accounted for as a distribution to the foreign partner. Withholding tax payments are made every April, June, September and December.

No provision for Federal income taxes has been made, as the liability for such taxes is that of the Partners rather than the Partnership.

The Partnership records are maintained on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The Federal income tax return has been prepared from such records after making appropriate adjustments, if any, to reflect the Partnership's accounts as adjusted for Federal income tax reporting purposes. Such adjustments are not recorded in the records of the Partnership.  The net effect of these items is summarized as follows:

The net income per Unit is based upon the weighted average number of Units of 50,068 during 2004 and 2003.

(2) Partnership Agreement

The Partnership Agreement defines the allocation of profits and losses, and available cash. If and to the extent that real estate taxes and insurance payable with respect to the Partnership's land during a given year exceed revenues of the Partnership, the General Partner will make a Supplemental Capital Contribution of such amount to the Partnership to ensure that it has sufficient funds to make such payments.

Profits and losses from operations  (other than capital transactions) will be allocated 99% to the Limited Partners and 1% to the General Partner. The net gain from sales of Partnership properties is first allocated among the Partners in proportion to the negative balances, if any, in their respective capital accounts. Thereafter, except as provided below, net gain is allocated to the General Partner in an amount equal to the proceeds distributed to the General Partner from such sale and the balance of any net gain is allocated to the Limited Partners. If the amount of net gain realized from a sale is less than the amount of cash distributed to the General Partner from such sale, the Partnership will allocate income or gain to the General Partner in an amount equal to the excess of the cash distributed to the General Partner with respect to such sale as quickly as permitted by law.  Any net loss from a sale will be allocated to the Limited Partners.

Distributions of Net Sale Proceeds will be allocated between the General Partner and the Limited Partners based upon both an aggregate overall return to the Limited Partners and a separate return with respect to each parcel of land purchased by the Partnership.

(continued)

As a general rule, Net Sale Proceeds will be distributed 90% to the Limited Partners and 10% to the General Partner until the Limited Partners have received from Net Sale Proceeds  (i) a return of their Original Capital plus (ii) a noncompounded Cumulative Preferred Return of 15% of their Invested Capital. However, with respect to each parcel of land, the General Partner's 10% share will be subordinated until the Limited Partners receive a return of the Original Capital attributed to such parcel ("Parcel Capital") plus a 6% per annum noncompounded Cumulative Preferred Return thereon.

After the amounts described in items  (i) and  (ii) above and any previously subordinated distributions to the General Partner have been paid, and the amount of any Supplemental Capital Contributions have been repaid to the General Partner, subsequent distributions shall be paid 75% to the Limited Partners and 25% to the General Partner without considering Parcel Capital. If, after all Net Sale Proceeds have been distributed, the General Partner has received more than 25% of all Net Sale Proceeds (exclusive of distributions made to the Limited Partners to return their Original Capital), the General Partner shall contribute to the Partnership for distribution to the Limited Partners an amount equal to such excess.

Any distributions from Net Sales Proceeds at a time when Invested Capital is greater than zero shall be deemed applied first to reduction of such Invested Capital before application to payment of any deficiency in the 15% Cumulative Preferred Return.

(3) Transactions with Affiliates

The General Partner and its Affiliates are entitled to reimbursement for salaries and expenses of employees of the General Partner and its Affiliates relating to the administration of the Partnership. Such costs are included in professional services to Affiliates and general and administrative expenses to Affiliates, of which $12,267 and $8,354 was unpaid as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

An Affiliate of the General Partner performed marketing and advertising services for the Partnership and was reimbursed (as set forth under term of the Partnership Agreement) for direct costs. Such costs of $28,048, $26,008 and $23,495 have been incurred and are included in marketing expenses to Affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, all of which was paid as of December 31, 2004 and 2003.

An Affiliate of the General Partner performed property upgrades, rezoning, annexation and other activities to prepare the Partnership's land investments for sale and was reimbursed (as set forth under terms of the Partnership Agreement) for salaries and direct costs.  For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Partnership incurred $256,488 and $209,345, respectively, of such costs.  The Affiliate did not recognize a profit on any project. Such costs are included in investment properties, of which $21,775 and $36,913 was unpaid as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

(4) Investment Properties (continued)

Included in the purchase of Parcel 23 was a newly constructed 2,500 square foot house. The house was sold in March 1993.

Included in the purchase of Parcel 24 was a 2,400 square foot office building. The building was sold in 2001.

Parcel 23, annexed and zoned to Oswego, Illinois as part of the Mill Race Creek subdivision, consists of two parts:  a 28-acre multi-family portion and a 105-acre single-family portion.  The Partnership sold the 28-acre multi-family portion on June 7, 1995 and as of December 31, 2002, all of the 243 single-family lots.
On September 16, 2002, the Partnership completed a tax-deferred exchange of Parcels 9 and 12 for 50 acres in Kendall County (Parcel 28).
As of December 31, 2003, the Partnership recorded a $561,359 impairment loss on land relating to Parcel 26.  The remaining cost of Parcel 26 exceeded the projected sales proceeds on the remaining lots and accordingly, the Partnership has recorded the impairment loss to reduce the remaining cost of Parcel 26 to the projected sales proceeds. As of December 31, 2004, the total gain recorded, net of the impairment loss, from the sales of Parcel 26 lots was approximately $493,000.

On May 16, 2001, the Partnership sold 189 acres of Parcel 5 and 436 acres of Parcel 19 for $17,500,000 and recorded deferred gain of $10,203,634.  The Partnership received a deferred down payment note in the amount of $1,500,000, due December 31, 2001.  The note had an interest rate of 6%, however the note provided for the interest to be waived if the principal was paid in full by December 1, 2001.  The Partnership received payment of the deferred down payment note on December 1, 2001 and recognized $875,923 of deferred gain.  The Partnership also received an installment note in the amount of $16,000,000 at the time of closing.  The installment note matures July 1, 2011 and has an interest rate of 6%.  The remaining deferred gain will be recognized as payments are received.

The General Partner determined that the maximum value of Parcel 15 could be realized if the parcel was developed and sold as individual lots. However, if we had followed that plan, there is a possibility that it could have increased income taxes. Therefore, the Partnership sold the parcel to a third party developer whereby 100% of the sales price was represented by a note receivable from the buyer. This transaction was deemed an installment sale. After the sale, the developer, through a limited liability company or LLC, secured third party financing to cover the deferred down payment owed to us as well as provide proceeds to begin the development of the project. This sale was structured so that the deferred down payment received at the time of the sale was sufficient to provide a distribution to our Limited Partners that equated to the parcel capital allocated to the parcel plus approximately a 6% return per annum on the capital invested in the parcel (parcel capital) through the date of the distribution.

(continued)

The velocity of the developer's individual home sales was slower than was originally projected and consequently, the developer's carrying costs were higher.  As a result of the slower lot sales, the net sale proceeds available to the Partnership were lower than anticipated. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Partnership has recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $1,208,378 and $336,712 relating to the mortgage receivable and accrued interest, respectively, relating to the sale of Parcel 15 and has written off the related deferred gain of $747,454.

The General Partner guaranteed the third party development loans owed by the limited liability company. In reviewing the development's financial situation, our General Partner determined that it would be in its best interest to have an affiliate acquire the interest in the limited liability company. The General Partner and its affiliates concluded that they could better control the continuing costs to complete the development and would therefore have the best opportunity to limit their exposure under the guarantee agreements and possibly recover a portion of the amount owed to the Partnership. An affiliate of our General Partner contributed approximately $1,500,000 to acquire the interests in these LLCs. Our General Partner contributed approximately $500,000 to pay off the debt under its guarantee of the LLC loans. The affiliate of the General Partner will complete the development and sale of this project. 


 (7) Subsequent Events

On January 10, 2005, the Partnership sold 150 acres of Parcel 10 for approximately $7,882,000 and recorded a gain of approximately $5,900,000.

On February 10, 2005, the Partnership sold 10 lots of Parcel 18 for approximately $520,000 and recorded a gain of approximately $67,000.

On February 17, 2005, the Partnership sold 36 acres of Parcel 2 for approximately $2,250,000 and recorded a gain of approximately $1,630,000.

Item 9.  Changes in and Disagreements with Independent Auditors on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

On January 27, 2005, our audit committee engaged Grant Thornton LLP ("Grant Thornton") to serve as our independent registered public accounting firm effective immediately.  In addition, on January 27, 2005, our audit committee accepted notice from Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte"), its current independent registered public accounting firm, indicating that, effective immediately, Deloitte will resign as our independent registered public accounting firm. 

The reports of Deloitte on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 did not contain an adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion or explanatory paragraphs and were not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principle.

In connection with Deloitte's audits of our two most recent fiscal years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003, there were no disagreements with Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to the satisfaction of Deloitte, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on the financial statements for such periods.  During the our two most recent fiscal years, there were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K.

We provided Deloitte a copy of the Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and requested Deloitte to furnish us with a letter addressed to the SEC stating whether Deloitte agreed with the above statements made by us and, if not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. We filed Deloitte's response with the SEC on Form 8-K.

We did not consult Grant Thornton regarding (i) either the application of accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated transaction or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on our financial statements; as such, no written or oral advice was provided, and none was an important factor considered by us in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issues; or (ii) any matter that was a subject of a disagreement or reportable event with Deloitte (as there were none).


Item 9(a)  Controls and Procedures

The general partner conducted, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report.  Based upon that evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information that is required to be disclosed in the periodic reports that we must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

There were no significant changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2004 that have materially effected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 9 (b).  Other Information

Not applicable.

Item 11. Executive Compensation

Our general partner is entitled to receive a share of cash distributions of net sale proceeds based upon both an aggregate overall return to the limited partners and a separate return with respect to each parcel of land purchased by us. 

Our partnership agreement defines the allocation of profits and losses, and available cash. If and to the extent that real estate taxes and insurance payable with respect to our land during a given year exceed our revenues, our general partner will make a supplemental capital contribution of such amount to us to ensure that we have sufficient funds to make such payments.

Profits and losses from operations (other than capital transactions) will be allocated 99% to the limited partners and 1% to the general partner. The net gain from sales of our properties is first allocated among the partners in proportion to the negative balances, if any, in their respective capital accounts. Thereafter, except as provided below, net gain is allocated to the general partner in an amount equal to the proceeds distributed to the general partner from such sale and the balance of any net gain is allocated to the limited partners. If the amount of net gain realized from a sale is less than the amount of cash distributed to the general partner from such sale, we will allocate income or gain to the general partner in an amount equal to the excess of the cash distributed to the general partner with respect to such sale as quickly as permitted by law.  Any net loss from a sale will be allocated to the limited partners.

Distributions of net sale proceeds will be allocated between the general partner and the limited partners based upon both an aggregate overall return to the limited partners and a separate return with respect to each parcel of land purchased by us.

As a general rule, net sale proceeds will be distributed 90% to the limited partners and 10% to the general partner until the limited partners have received from net sale proceeds  (i) a return of their original capital plus (ii) a noncompounded cumulative preferred return of 15% of their invested capital. However, with respect to each parcel of land, the general partner's 10% share will be subordinated until the limited partners receive a return of the original capital attributed to such parcel ("parcel capital") plus a 6% per annum noncompounded cumulative preferred return thereon.

After the amounts described in items  (i) and  (ii) above and any previously subordinated distributions to the general partner have been paid, and the amount of any supplemental capital contributions have been repaid to the general partner, subsequent distributions shall be paid 75% to the limited partners and 25% to the general partner without considering parcel capital. If, after all net sale proceeds have been distributed, the general partner has received more than 25% of all net sale proceeds (exclusive of distributions made to the limited partners to return their original capital), the general partner shall contribute to us for distribution to the limited partners an amount equal to such excess.

Any distributions from net sales proceeds at a time when invested capital is greater than zero shall be deemed applied first to reduction of such invested capital before application to payment of any deficiency in the 15% cumulative preferred return.

Inland American – SEC Probe – Salas Wang Investigation
May 11, 2012


The Wall Street is reporting that the SEC is investigating Inland American Non-Traded REIT.  Our firm has been investigating shareholder claims against brokers who sold shares to investors for sometime.  This recent SEC action, we believe, is the culmination of years of abuse.  According to the WSJ:
The SEC is looking at activity of Inland American Real Estate Trust to determine if the REIT committed violations related to management fees, the timing and amount of distributions paid to investors, and transactions with affiliates, according to a company filing with the SEC on Monday.
If you own shares of Inland American, please call Jeffrey Salas at 312.803.4963 or fill out the contact form below.
