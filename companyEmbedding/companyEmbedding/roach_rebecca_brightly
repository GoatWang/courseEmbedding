After a roach infestation, you will most likely notice skin irritations, rashes, and cockroach bites making you feel self conscious when in public. Even worse, restless nights and insomnia which now affects your personal life, causing anxiousness and nervousness.

While you may see one or two roaches or other insects. Your family and children will feel them the worse. The roaches migrate to food, counter tops, eating areas and can transport disease.


Being Forced To Evacuate


Insomnia and Feeling Self Conscious


When the infestation is left untreated, you will be told to throw away all your valuables, your clothes, countertops, furniture, bedding, etc. Then after all this, you would be asked to politely evacuate and you or a company would use toxic pesticides having you, your family, and your pets feeling homeless for at least 4 weeks.

Top Product of 2014 for Green Pest Control









by Senam – Amazon Review


Below Are Only A Few 5 Star Reviews We Received From
Amazon, Ebay Sears, MyCleaningProducts.com and our other retailers.


by Barb Kelly – Amazon Review


Worked very well. Have not seen a live roach and has been two weeks since I sprayed. Thanks Roach Bully!








I bought this because we had a roach problem. It has a slight odor that smells pleasant. It doesn't give me an asthma attack the way that poisons do. It takes a little longer for the bugs to die, but they do die. I have used it on ants and spiders also.


I recently had a roaches outbreak, and I would see them even in the middle of the day. After I got this item, I sprayed it all over my house, (everywhere) and let it dry for a few minutes (or hours) and then went to bed: I did not see one roach!

After I washed my older blanket -which I thought the roaches were hiding in- I sprayed it silly, as well, and went to sleep soundly. Those roaches have not come back yet.

This product works!! The roaches might simply be hiding for now, I’m not sure, but I intend to spray my entire bed room soon, to make sure they never show their ugly bug faces again. This was a good expense.


We were scared out of our wits with roaches when I notice a roach crawling on my child. I found you guys from a friend and want to thank you. Roach Bully is a great product and worked as promised. No more  roaches. You have saved me a ton of worry. Thank you.


A Must If You Have A Roach Problem!








We recently had roaches in my apartment building. They did not hire an exterminator right away. I purchased this product and sprayed the area in the doorway to my apartment because I did not want the roaches coming into my apartment. I also sprayed the areas under my bathroom and kitchen sinks. I believe that this product helped a lot.

I have not seen any roach in my apartment and I hope I never do.


Great Stuff!

- Stephanie - Amazon Review


This has been used on two occasions in the past three years due to apartment roach infestations. It has been effective both times. The smell is there, but not unpleasant. We have a house cat and the product has been harmless, as described, to her. This product is a very “green” product and I highly recommend this over any type of chemical infestation treatment that may be out there. Shipping was great as well as packaging.


Bully Those Roaches


Bully Those Roaches!








by Gentle Deer Lion Tamer– Amazon Review


I had Roach Bully sent to my son who is living in Harlem. He had roaches all over the house. I sent him detailed instructions on how to use it with DE. Needless to say, the kid did not follow my instructions and just sprayed it around and sprinkled the DE into the carpet where he sleeps!

Thankfully it WORKED!

He sleeps on the floor on an air mattress and this stuff works! The roaches have disappeared and his spirits are better.

He thinks I’m joking when I told him that when he comes home he’s coming in the back door naked while I take his stuff to the laundromat ha ha!


Roach Bully has been a Top Green Product with large pest control companies, hotels and health facilities, farms, and animal clinics. Since it’s public release we have already received great feedback from our customers in helping them get rid of their roach problem.
