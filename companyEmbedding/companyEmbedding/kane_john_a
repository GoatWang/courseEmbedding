John's passion for search, focus on customer experience, and his strategic awareness enabled him to quickly get sponsorship for his ideas and bring a diverse coalition of stakeholders into alignment. He also demonstrated his effectiveness in vendor management, ensuring that vendor priorities aligned appropriately with HPE's strategic goals around search.  John's integrity and openness to new ideas made him a highly reliable partner and an excellent collaborator.  I'd be happy to work with John on any future endeavor.See moreSee lessSign up to see who recommended John T.GroupsEnterprise SearchGraph Theory and AlgorithmsProduct ManagementWolfram|AlphaEnterprise Search Products & ServicesDeep LearningUser ExperienceSee 7 moreSearch Open SourceEnterprise Search DevelopersWeb Search Engine ProfessionalsBig Retail SearchSemantic SearchData Science  CentralProduct Management Leadership NetworkSee lessView John T.’s full profile to...See who you know in commonGet introducedContact John T. directlyView John T.’s Full ProfileNot the John T. you’re looking for?
