 News | Radiation Dose Management | June 21, 2017  
 RadNet Inc. Acquires Equity Stake in Medic Vision 
 RadNet will employ Medic Vision’s CT Dose reduction and XR-29 compliance products in its facilities as well as helping develop future products
  


 




June 21, 2017 — RadNet Inc. and Medic Vision Imaging Solutions Ltd. announced that RadNet has acquired an equity stake in Medic Vision.
This investment comes after both parties announced last summer that RadNet will use Medic Vision's CT [computed tomography] Dose reduction and management and XR-29 compliance products in numerous facilities. The companies also added that they will join forces in the development and validation of Medic Vision’s future products.
“We are highly impressed by the quality of the technology, products and services that Medic Vision provides, as well as the company's roadmap for future offerings,” said Howard Berger, M.D., CEO, RadNet. “We identified the significant technical progress and leadership Medic Vision has demonstrated throughout the years, and believe that combined with our experience, knowledge and expertise, Medic Vision can accelerate its growth and innovation,” added Dr. Berger.
“Since we started collaborating with RadNet, we recognized the importance and effectiveness of our products and services to RadNet’s services and to that of the rest of the imaging industry,” explained Eyal Aharon, CEO, Medic Vision.
