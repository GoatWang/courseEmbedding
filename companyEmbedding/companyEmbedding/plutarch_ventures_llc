Don't Be Crass
Posted: 

Thursday, March 2, 2017 4:31 PM EST
Updated: 

Friday, March 3, 2017 8:32 AM EST
By Scott Flood, Owner, Scott Flood Writing

Scott Flood is the owner of Scott Flood Writing.


Not long ago, I ran across an article by a CEO of what appeared to be an impressive, progressive company. I expected to find a glimpse of useful wisdom, but was stopped in my tracks by the sheer amount of profanity and vulgarity he had woven into his words.The CEO may have had brilliant counsel to share, but I was so distracted by the scatological remarks and gratuitous profanities that peppered his remarks that I can't even remember the subject of the article, or the name of his company.Now, I'm not a prude or someone who lives in a sheltered world. I can swear with more vigor and variety than most people I know. I'd also wager that I have mastery of profanities you've never heard, including delightful epithets from other languages. Writers tend to gorge themselves on obscure vocabulary.But I don’t understand why a presumably respected leader of a business found it necessary to publicly spew the kind of language most of us would never utter in polite company while promoting his business. Were the terms he used a critical component of the message he was trying to convey? Sure didn’t seem like it. Instead, he reminded me of a middle-schooler who couldn’t wait to share the dirty words he learned that day. His company may be phenomenal, but I’ll always see it as a club of potty-mouthed youngsters.Perhaps it’s just another symptom of an era in which crass has become the new normal. We have entertainers who spit out profanity with the enthusiasm of a tent preacher. We have professional athletes who can’t be interviewed without a ready hand on the bleep button. And we even have a president who brushes aside his use of what he dismisses as locker-room talk.There’s nothing new about crass or profane language. It’s long been an argot used within specific groups. Take comments such as “he swears like a drunken sailor” or the casual profanity long associated with factory workers. What does appear to be new is a willingness to take that language out of the private settings and spew it publicly. I once worked in an ad agency where f-bombs were the lingua franca among the staff, but even the filthiest mouths among us knew to use restraint when clients were visiting.The simple fact is that profanity and vulgarity are lazy substitutes for real emotion. Writers who use them the way I sprinkle Parmesan cheese on pasta are taking the easy way out. Being crass offers no real benefit to the speaker or his or her audience. It doesn’t improve communication, sharpen meaning, or enhance anyone’s image.I’m sure some readers are dismissing my concerns as a generational thing, writing me off as some kind of ancient fogey. Yet I firmly believe that there are far more people who find such language offensive than those who accept it. Granted, the offended may have averaged more birthdays, but they probably make up the vast majority of your target audience. Why run the risk of turning them away just so you can flaunt your fluidity with f-bombs?In my college years, a favorite philosophy professor realized he could catch the attention of sleepy undergrads by swearing the proverbial blue streak. A reply to a question about Plutarch quickly devolved into an f-bomb-laden rant, Lewis Black-style. He kept everyone awake and chuckling, but they remembered him for the coarseness of his words instead of the brilliance of his scholarship. Our post-class conversations revealed a thoughtful scholar that my classmates never got to see, because they couldn’t get past his language. Instead of creating connections, his approach put distance between him and those who might have benefited from his knowledge.Face it: the world is already full of tastelessness and vulgarity. Why would anyone feel the need to drag us down any deeper? If you want to bandy obscenities and vulgarities around the locker room, the golf course, or the bar, have at it. But please don’t weave them into your conversations or writings about your business. It may be a little more challenging to stay on the high road, but it’s well worth the effort.Scott Flood is the owner of Scott Flood Writing.

Benefits of Partnering With a Local PEO By Matt Thomas President, WorkSmart Systems Inc.2017-07-26T22:01:42ZExactly how much time does your company spend on HR-related tasks? An infographic shows HR teams, on average, spend over 50 percent of their time on three non-HR-admin areas within a business: meeting with senior staff and business partners, employee relations and engagement, and meeting with employees. This means essentially half the remaining HR staffs' time is being spent on admin-related tasks. More companies are turning to professional employer organizations as a solution.More

We Live In An Era Of Dangerous Imbalances



And history shows they correct painfully 



by Adam Taggart
Friday, February 13, 2015, 9:19 PM



The intervention by the world's central banks has resulted in today's bizarro financial markets, where "bad news is good" because it may lead to more (sorry, moar) thin-air stimulus to goose asset prices even higher.

RJK Ventures LLC Introduces the MAG|Coupler™ Product Line
RJK Ventures LLC announced today that it has introduced and is now shipping the new patent pending MAG|Coupler™ magazine accessory product line.
ALISO VIEJO, Calif. – Nov. 24, 2015 – (ArmsVault.com) — RJK Ventures LLC announced today that it has introduced and is now shipping a new product line of firearms magazine accessories branded MAG|Couplers™.
MAG Coupler
Firearms enthusiasts now have an effective way to safely and securely improve magazine handling. The product couples magazines by replacing their floorplates and replacing them with a MAG|Coupler to facilitate more expedient and efficient magazine swaps without increasing the capacity of an individual magazine. Initially being introduced for industry standard AR15/M4/M16 magazines, the patent pending technology enables RJK Ventures LLC to expand the offering across a variety of magazine variants.
AR15 with MAG Coupler
MAG|Couplers simply replace the floorplate of your existing magazine allowing for the connection of two like magazines back to back. All magazine sizes are supported at launch from low capacity 10-round magazines through standard capacity magazines.

“MAG|Couplers have compelling features that allow my customers to couple their CA approved 10-round magazines together as well as take advantage of all the standard storage pouches designed for 30-round mags. We are pleased to be a stocking dealer for RJK Ventures LLC.” – Mike Penhall, Owner, OC Armory – A full service FFL 07/02 SOT located in Laguna Hills, California
“The MAG|Coupler works great! I took it out to the range yesterday and cycled 100 rounds through with no problems.” –  Mike, Yorba Linda, CA
“Great idea, good quality polymer and texture; easy to install and disassemble. Highly recommended.” – James, NJ
“The mag coupler has surpassed my expectations. After receiving it, assembly took approximately 1 min. The combined mag is the same size as my 10/30 mags. I would definitely recommend this to friends.” – Erik, Costa Mesa, CA
Key Product Highlights:

Magazine couplers enable improved magazine handling
Custom development for specific magazine fit and function
Popular AR platform firearm magazines supported at product launch
Use standard factory magazines
No permanent modifications
Made in the USA

The AR15/M4/M16 magazine couplers are now shipping and are available in 1 and 3 packs from the RJK Ventures LLC MAG|Couplers™ online store – www.magcoupler.com.
