For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

      of July 16, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $15,617,000 class G, 
      $41,645,303 class H, $29,498,000 interest-only class X-E, or the 
      $41,645,303 interest-only class X-F.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 81 loans secured by 128 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.4 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by German American Capital Corporation, Cantor Commercial Real Estate 
      lending, L.P., Ladder Capital Financial LLC and Pillar Funding LLC
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 73.3% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 80.9%, and asset summary reviews on 80.9% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Leverage in Line with 2014 and 2015 Averages: The pool's Fitch DSCR and 
      LTV are 1.18x and 106.1%, respectively. The leverage metrics for this 
      transaction are in line with other
    

      recent Fitch-rated, fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The 2014 
      average Fitch DSCR was 1.19x, and the average Fitch LTV was 106.2%. The 
      2015 YTD DSCR and LTV averages are 1.21x and 109.3%, respectively.
    

      Investment-Grade Credit Opinion Loans: Three loans totaling 15.1% of the 
      pool have investment-grade credit opinions on a stand-alone basis. 
      Lakewood Center Mall (8.6%) has an investment-grade opinion of 'A+sf', 
      40 Wall Street (4.3%) has an investment-grade opinion of 'BBB-sf' and 
      Avco Center (2.2%) has an investment-grade opinion of 'BBB-sf'. 
      Excluding the credit opinion loans, Fitch's implied conduit 
      subordination at 'AAAsf' is approximately 27.0% and 'BBB-sf' is 
      approximately 8.6%.
    

      Strong Collateral Quality: As a percentage of Fitch inspected 
      properties, 40.5% of the pool received a property quality grade of "B+" 
      or higher. Three loans (5.1% of the pool) received property quality 
      grades of 'A-' or higher. Only one inspected property (0.4%) received a 
      property quality grade below 'B-'.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's NCF was 18.25% below the most recent 
      year's NOI (for properties for which a full year NOI was provided, 
      excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period).The 
      following rating sensitivities describe how the ratings would react to 
      further NCF declines below Fitch's NCF. The implied rating sensitivities 
      are only indicative of some of the potential outcomes and do not 
      consider other risk factors to which the transaction is exposed. 
      Stressing additional risk factors may result in different outcomes. 
      Furthermore, the implied ratings, after the further NCF stresses are 
      applied, are more akin to what the ratings would be at deal issuance had 
      those further stressed NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to COMM 
      2015-CCRE24 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'Asf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10 - 11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from KPMG 
      LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on Form ABS 
      Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the 81 mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary (RAC).

Exhibit 99.4
 






EXECUTION VERSION

  
MORTGAGE
LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT
 
This Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement (this “Agreement”), is dated and effective July 24, 2015 between Pillar Funding LLC, as seller (the
“Seller”), Pillar Capital Partners I LLC (“PCPI”) and Deutsche Mortgage & Asset Receiving
Corporation, as purchaser (the “Purchaser”).
 
The Seller
desires to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser desires to purchase, subject
to the terms and conditions set forth below, the commercial, multifamily and, if applicable, manufactured housing mortgage loans
(collectively, the “Mortgage Loans”) identified on the schedule annexed hereto as Exhibit A (the “Mortgage
Loan Schedule”).
 
It is expected that the
Mortgage Loans will be transferred, together with other commercial, multifamily and, if applicable, manufactured housing mortgage
loans (such Mortgage Loans, the “Other Mortgage Loans”) to COMM 2015-CCRE24 Mortgage Trust, a trust fund (the
“Trust Fund”) to be formed by the Purchaser, the beneficial ownership of which will be evidenced by a series
of commercial mortgage pass-through certificates (the “Certificates”). The offer and sale of certain classes
of the Certificates (the “Registered Certificates”) will be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Securities Act”). The Trust Fund will be created and the Certificates will be issued pursuant
to a pooling and servicing agreement, dated as of August 1, 2015 (the “Pooling and Servicing Agreement”), between
the Purchaser, as depositor (in such capacity, the “Depositor”), Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as
master servicer (in such capacity, the “Master Servicer”), LNR Partners, LLC, as special servicer (the “Special
Servicer”), Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Wells Fargo Bank,
National Association, as certificate administrator (in such capacity, the “Certificate Administrator”), custodian
and paying agent, and Park Bridge Lender Services LLC, as operating advisor (the “Operating Advisor”).
 
The Purchaser intends
to sell the Registered Certificates to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (“DBSI”), Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. (“CF&Co.”),
CastleOak Securities, L.P. (“CastleOak”) and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (“Citigroup” and,
together with DBSI, CF&Co. and CastleOak, in their capacities as underwriters, the “Underwriters”) pursuant
to an underwriting agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the “Underwriting Agreement”). The Purchaser intends
to sell other Certificates (the “Non-Registered Certificates”) to DBSI, CF&Co. and Wells Fargo Securities,
LLC (together, in their capacities as initial purchasers, the “Initial Purchasers” and, together with the Underwriters,
the “Principals”) pursuant to a certificate purchase agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the “Certificate
Purchase Agreement”). Capitalized terms that are used but not defined herein have the respective meanings assigned to
them in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement (in effect as of the Closing Date) or in the Indemnification Agreement, dated the date
hereof (the “Indemnification Agreement”), between the Seller, the Purchaser and the Principals.
 
Now, therefore, in consideration
of the premises and the mutual agreements set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
 
 
 
 
Section
1.     Agreement to Purchase.
 
Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Seller agrees to sell, assign, transfer and otherwise convey to the Purchaser upon
receipt of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in this Section 1, and the Purchaser agrees to purchase, the Mortgage Loans.
The purchase and sale of the Mortgage Loans shall take place on or about August 6, 2015 or such other date as shall be mutually
acceptable to the parties hereto (the “Closing Date”). As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loans will have
an aggregate principal balance (the “Aggregate Cut-off Date Balance”), after application of all payments of
principal due thereon on or before the Cut-off Date, whether or not received, of $94,683,738, subject to a variance of plus or
minus 5.0%. The purchase price of the Mortgage Loans (the “Mortgage Loan Purchase Price”) shall be equal to
the amount set forth in the Bill of Sale (substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto), to be entered into between the
parties to this Agreement in connection with this Agreement and the issuance of the Certificates (the “Bill of Sale”).
 
Section
2.     Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.
 
(a)          On
the Closing Date, subject only to receipt by the Seller of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price, the satisfaction of the other closing
conditions required to be satisfied on the part of Purchaser pursuant to Section 7 and the issuance of the Certificates,
the Seller agrees to sell, transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the Purchaser, and without limiting Section 4(a)
hereof without recourse, all the right, title and interest of the Seller from and after the Closing Date in and to the following
property whether now owned or existing or hereafter acquired or arising (the “Covered Assets”): the Mortgage
Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, including all rights to payment in respect thereof, which, notwithstanding the
foregoing, includes all interest and principal received or receivable by the Seller on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans after
the Cut-off Date (subject to the proviso in the next sentence), together with all of the Seller’s right, title and interest
in and to the proceeds of any related title, hazard, or other insurance policies and any escrow, reserve or other comparable
accounts related to the Mortgage Loans, subject to (i) that certain Agreement to Appointment of Master Servicer dated as of August
1, 2015, between the Master Servicer and the Seller, (ii) the rights of any related
Companion Loan Noteholder pursuant to the related Intercreditor Agreement, if any, and (iii) any Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement
relating to a Non-Serviced Loan Combination, if any. The Purchaser shall be entitled to (and, to the extent received by
or on behalf of the Seller, the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser) all scheduled
payments of principal and interest due on the Mortgage Loans after the Cut-off Date, and all other recoveries of principal and
interest collected thereon after the Cut-off Date; provided, that all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on
or before the Cut-off Date and collected after the Cut-off Date shall belong to the Seller, and the Purchaser or its successors
or assigns shall promptly remit any such payments to the Seller.
 
With respect to any Mortgage
Loan that is subject to an Intercreditor Agreement, the parties hereto intend that the provisions of this Section 2(a) serve as
an assignment and assumption agreement between the Seller (solely as holder of such Mortgage Loan and not as holder of any related
Companion Loan), as the assignor, and the Purchaser, on behalf of the Trust, as the assignee. Accordingly, the Seller hereby (and
in accordance with and subject to all other applicable provisions of this Agreement) assigns, grants, sells, transfers, delivers,
sets over,
 
2
 
 
and conveys to the Purchaser all right, title and interest of the Seller in, to and arising out of the related Intercreditor
Agreement (solely as holder of such Mortgage Loan and not as holder of any related Companion Loan) and the Purchaser, on behalf
of the Trust, hereby accepts (subject to applicable provisions of this Agreement) the foregoing assignment and assumes all of the
rights and obligations of Seller (solely as holder of such Mortgage Loan and not as holder of any related Companion Loan) with
respect to the related Intercreditor Agreement from and after the Closing Date. In addition, the Purchaser acknowledges that any
such Mortgage Loan that is a Serviced Mortgage Loan shall be serviced pursuant to the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
 
Within 45 days after
the Closing Date or, without limiting the requirements of the first paragraph of Section 2(d), after such later date on which the
Seller has received all the missing filing/recording information, the Seller shall, or shall at the expense of the Seller cause
a third party vendor (which may be the Trustee, Certificate Administrator or Custodian pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
or otherwise) to, except in the case of any Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, (1) complete (to the extent necessary)
and submit for recording (in favor of the Trustee in the following form: “Wilmington Trust, National Association, as Trustee,
for the benefit of the Holders of COMM 2015-CCRE24 Mortgage Trust Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates” (in such
capacity and, with respect to any Serviced Loan Combination, on behalf of any related Serviced Companion Loan Noteholders)) in
the appropriate public recording office (a) each Assignment of Mortgage referred to in clause (iii) of Exhibit B which has
not yet been submitted for recording and (b) each Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits referred to in clause
(viii)(B) of Exhibit B (if not otherwise included in the related Assignment of Mortgage) which has not yet been submitted
for recordation; and (2) complete (to the extent necessary) and file in the appropriate public filing office each UCC assignment
of financing statement referred to in clause (v)(B) and (xiii) of Exhibit B which has not yet been submitted for filing
or recording. Each such document shall reflect that the recorded original should be returned by the public recording office to
the Custodian or its designee (or to the Seller or its designee as an alternative) following recording, and each such document
shall reflect that the file copy thereof should be returned to the Custodian or its designee (or to the Seller or its designee
as an alternative) following filing; provided that in those instances where the public recording office retains the original
Assignment of Mortgage or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, the Custodian shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain therefrom a certified copy of the recorded original, at the expense of the Depositor. In the event that any such
document or instrument is lost or returned unrecorded or unfiled, as the case may be, because of a defect therein, the Seller shall
promptly prepare or cause the preparation of a substitute therefor or cure or cause the curing of such defect, as the case may
be, and shall thereafter deliver the substitute or corrected document to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent
owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including, without limitation, the Trustee) for recording or filing, as appropriate, at the
Seller’s expense. In the event that the Seller receives the original recorded or filed copy, the Seller shall, or shall cause
a third party vendor or any other party under its control to, promptly upon receipt of the original recorded or filed copy (and
in no event later than 5 Business Days following such receipt) deliver such original to the Custodian, with evidence of filing
or recording thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2, in those instances where the
public recording office retains the original Mortgage, Assignment of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment
of Assignment of Leases,
 
3
 
 
Rents and Profits, if applicable, after any has been recorded, the obligations hereunder of the Seller
shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon delivery to the Custodian of a copy of the recorded original of such Mortgage, Assignment
of Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits or Reassignment of Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits.
 
Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2 or in Section 2.01(a), Section 2.01(b), Section
2.01(c) or Section 2.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, in connection with a Servicing Shift Loan
Combination (1) instruments of assignment to the Trustee may be in blank and need not be recorded pursuant to this Agreement
(other than endorsements to the note(s) evidencing the related Servicing Shift Mortgage Loan) until the earlier of (i) the
related Servicing Shift Lead Note Securitization Date, in which case such instruments shall be assigned and recorded in
accordance with the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and (ii) such Servicing Shift Loan Combination becoming a
Specially Serviced Loan prior to such Servicing Shift Lead Note Securitization Date, in which case assignments and
recordations shall be effected in accordance with the preceding paragraph until the occurrence, if any, of such Servicing
Shift Lead Note Securitization Date, (2) no letter of credit need be amended (including, without limitation, to change the
beneficiary thereon) until the earlier of (i) the related Servicing Shift Lead Note Securitization Date, in which case such
amendment shall be in accordance with the related Other Pooling and Servicing Agreement and (ii) such Servicing Shift Loan
Combination becoming a Specially Serviced Loan prior to such Servicing Shift Lead Note Securitization Date, in which case
such amendment shall be effected in accordance with the terms of Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, and (3)
on and following such Servicing Shift Lead Note Securitization Date, the Person selling the related Servicing Shift Lead Note
to the related Other Depositor, at its own expense, shall be (a) entitled to direct in writing, which may be conclusively
relied upon by the Custodian, the Custodian to deliver the originals of all the Loan Documents relating to such Servicing
Shift Loan Combination in its possession (other than the original note(s) evidencing such Servicing Shift Mortgage Loan) to
the related Other Trustee or the related Other Custodian, (b) if the right under clause (a) is exercised, required to cause
the retention by or delivery to the Custodian of photocopies of Loan Documents related to such Servicing Shift
Loan Combination so delivered to such Other Trustee or such Other Custodian, (c) entitled to cause the completion (or in the
event of a recordation as contemplated by clause (1)(ii) of this paragraph, the preparation, execution and delivery)
and recordation of instruments of assignment in the name of the related Other Trustee or related Other Custodian, (d) if
the right under clause (c) is exercised, required to deliver to the Trustee or Custodian photocopies of any instruments
of assignment so completed and recorded, and (e) entitled to require the Master Servicer to transfer, and to cooperate with
all reasonable requests in connection with the transfer of, the Servicing File, and any Escrow Payments, reserve funds and
items specified in clauses (xix) and (xx) of the definition of “Mortgage File” on Exhibit B hereto, for such
Servicing Shift Loan Combination to the related Other Servicer.
 
On the Closing Date,
upon (i) notification from the Seller that the Mortgage Loan Purchase Price referred to in Section 1 has been received by
the Seller and (ii) the issuance of the Certificates, the Purchaser shall be authorized to release to the Certificate Administrator
or its designee all of the Mortgage Files in the Purchaser’s possession relating to the Mortgage Loans.
 
(b)          In
connection with the Seller’s assignment pursuant to subsection (a) above, and subject to subsections (c) and (d) below, the
Seller shall deliver to and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with, the Custodian, on or before the Closing
Date, the documents and/or instruments referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix)
of Exhibit B for each Mortgage Loan so assigned (with originals with respect to clause (i) and copies with respect
to clauses (ii), (vii), (xi) and (xix)) and, except as otherwise provided in Section 2(d) below,
within 30 days following the Closing Date, the remaining applicable documents in Exhibit B for each such Mortgage Loan,
with copies to the Master Servicer; provided that, with respect to a
 
4
 
 
Mortgage Loan that is included in a Serviced Loan Combination,
except for the Note referred to in clause (i)(B) of Exhibit B, only a single original set of Loan Documents in Exhibit
B is required to be delivered. With respect to a Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the preceding document
delivery requirements will be met by the delivery by or on behalf of the Seller to the Custodian of copies of the documents specified
in Exhibit B (other than the Note and intervening endorsements evidencing a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, with respect to
which the originals shall be required), including a copy of the Mortgage securing the applicable Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan and
copies of the companion notes, and any assignments or other transfer documents referred to on Exhibit B as being in favor of the
Trustee shall instead be in favor of the applicable Other Trustee.
 
(c)          If
the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original Note, the Seller shall deliver a copy
or duplicate original of such Note, together with an affidavit certifying that the original thereof has been lost or destroyed
and an indemnification in connection therewith in favor of the Certificate Administrator, the Trustee and the Custodian.
 
(d)          If
the Seller cannot deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of any of the documents and/or
instruments referred to in clauses (ii), (iii), (v)(A), (viii)(A), (xiv) and (xvi) of
Exhibit B and the UCC financing statements and UCC assignments of financing statements referred to in clause (xiii)
of Exhibit B, with evidence of recording or filing thereon, solely because of a delay caused by the public recording or
filing office where such document or instrument has been delivered for recordation or filing, or because such original recorded
or filed document has been lost or returned from the recording or filing office and subsequently lost, as the case may be, the
delivery requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to have been satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item
shall be deemed to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that a copy of such document or instrument
(without evidence of recording or filing thereon, but certified (which certificate may relate to multiple documents and/or instruments)
by the applicable public recording or filing office, the applicable title insurance company or by the Seller to be a true and complete
copy of the original thereof submitted for recording or filing, as the case may be) has been delivered to the Custodian within
45 days after the Closing Date, and either the original of such missing document or instrument, or a copy thereof, with evidence
of recording or filing, as the case may be, thereon, is delivered to or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent owner
of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee) within 180 days after the Closing Date (or within such
longer period after the Closing Date as the Custodian may consent to, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed so long as the Seller has provided the Custodian with evidence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, or has
certified to the Custodian as to the occurrence of such recording or filing, as the case may be, and is, as certified to the Custodian
no less often than quarterly, in good faith attempting to obtain from the appropriate public recording or filing office such original
or copy, provided such extensions do not exceed 24 months in the aggregate).
 
If the Seller cannot
deliver, or cause to be delivered, as to any Mortgage Loan, the original or a copy of the related lender’s title insurance
policy referred to in clause (vii) of Exhibit B solely because such policy has not yet been issued, the delivery
requirements of Section 2(b) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to such missing item, and such missing item shall
 
5
 
 
be deemed
to have been included in the related Mortgage File, provided that the Seller has delivered to the Custodian a binder marked
as binding and countersigned by the title insurer or its authorized agent (which may be a pro forma or specimen title insurance
policy which has been accepted or approved in writing as binding by the related title insurance company) or an acknowledged closing
instruction or escrow letter, and the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian or at the direction of the Purchaser (or any subsequent
owner of the affected Mortgage Loan, including without limitation the Trustee), promptly following the receipt thereof, the original
related lender’s title insurance policy (or a copy thereof). In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, if there exists with respect to any group of related cross-collateralized Mortgage Loans only one original of
any document referred to in Exhibit B covering all of the Mortgage Loans in such group, then the inclusion of the original
of such document in the Mortgage File for any Mortgage Loan in such group shall be deemed an inclusion of such original in the
Mortgage File for each such Mortgage Loan.
 
Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, with respect to the documents referred to in clause (xix) and clause (xx) on Exhibit B,
the Seller acknowledges that the Master Servicer (or the applicable Other Servicer with respect to any Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan)
will hold the original of each such document in trust on behalf of the Trustee in order to draw on such letter of credit on behalf
of the Trust and the Seller shall be deemed to have satisfied the delivery requirements of this Agreement by delivering the original
of each such document to the Master Servicer. The Seller shall pay any costs of assignment or amendment of such letter of credit
required (which assignment or amendment shall change the beneficiary of the letter of credit to the Trust in care of the Master
Servicer) in order for the Master Servicer to draw on such letter of credit on behalf of the Trust. In the event that the documents
specified in clause (xx) on Exhibit B are missing with respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage
Loan) because the related assignment or amendment documents have not been completed, the Seller shall take all reasonably necessary
steps to enable the Master Servicer to draw on the related letter of credit on behalf of the Trust including, if necessary, drawing
on the letter of credit in its own name pursuant to written instructions from the Master Servicer and immediately remitting such
funds (or causing such funds to be remitted) to the Master Servicer.
 
Contemporaneously with
the execution of this Agreement by the Purchaser and the Seller, the Seller shall deliver a power of attorney substantially in
the form of Exhibit C hereto to each of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, that permits such parties to take
such other action as is necessary to effect the delivery, assignment and/or recordation of any documents and/or instruments relating
to any Mortgage Loan which have not been delivered, assigned or recorded at the time required for enforcement by the Trust Fund.
The Seller will be required to effect at its expense the assignment and, if applicable, recordation of its Loan Documents until
the assignment and recordation of all such Loan Documents has been completed.
 
(e)          Except
as provided below, and except with respect to any Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, all documents and records
in the Seller’s possession (or under its control) relating to the Mortgage Loans that are not required to be a part of a
Mortgage File in accordance with Exhibit B but that are reasonably required to service the Mortgage Loans and copies of
the documents in the Mortgage File (all such other documents and records, including Environmental Reports, as to any Mortgage Loan,
the “Servicing File”), together with
 
6
 
 
all escrow payments, reserve funds and other comparable funds in the possession
of the Seller (or under its control) with respect to the Mortgage Loans, shall (unless they are held by a sub-servicer that shall,
as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the Master Servicer pursuant to a written agreement between such parties) be
delivered by the Seller (or its agent) to the Master Servicer (as the Purchaser’s designee) no later than the Closing Date;
provided, the Seller shall not be required to deliver, and the Servicing File shall not be deemed to include drafts of Loan
Documents, attorney-client or internal communications of the Seller or its affiliates or Seller’s credit underwriting or
due diligence analyses or related data (as distinguished from Environmental Reports, financial statements, credit reports, title
reports, structural and engineering reports, appraisals and other reports, analyses or data provided by the Borrowers or third
parties other than the Seller’s attorneys). If a sub-servicer shall, as of the Closing Date, begin acting on behalf of the
Master Servicer with respect to any Mortgage Loan pursuant to a written agreement between such parties, the Seller or its agent
shall deliver a copy of the related Servicing File to the Master Servicer.
 
(f)           Each
of the Seller and the Purchaser will treat, and their respective records will reflect, the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to the
Purchaser as a sale, including for tax, accounting and any regulatory purposes. Following the transfer of the Mortgage Loans to
the Purchaser, the Seller will not take any action inconsistent with the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser or its
assignees.
 
(g)          Furthermore,
it is the express intent of the parties hereto that the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser as provided in
this Agreement be, and be construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by Seller to Purchaser and not a pledge of the Mortgage Loans
by Seller to Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of Seller. However, in the event that, notwithstanding the intent of
the parties, the Mortgage Loans are held to be property of Seller or if for any reason this Agreement is held or deemed to create
a security interest in the Mortgage Loans:
 
(i)           this
Agreement shall hereby create a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect
in the applicable state;
 
(ii)          the
conveyance provided for in this Agreement shall hereby grant from Seller to Purchaser, and Seller hereby grants to Purchaser,
a security interest in and to all of Seller’s right, title, and interest, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, in and
to the Covered Assets and all proceeds thereof;
 
(iii)         the
possession by Purchaser or its assignee of the Notes and such other goods, letters of credit, advices of credit, instruments,
money, documents, chattel paper or certificated securities shall be deemed to be possession by the secured party or possession
by a purchaser or a Person designated by him or her, for purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the Uniform
Commercial Code (including, without limitation, Sections 9-306, 9-313 and 9-314 thereof) as in force in the relevant jurisdiction;
and
 
(iv)         notifications
to Persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts, confirmations from Persons holding such property, shall be deemed
to be
 
7
 
 
notifications to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, securities intermediaries, bailees or agents of, or
Persons holding for (as applicable), Purchaser or its assignee for the purpose of perfecting such security interest under applicable
law.
 
The Seller at the direction
of the Purchaser or its assignee, shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be reasonably necessary
to ensure that such security interest is a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained
as such. In connection herewith, Purchaser and its assignee shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured party and creditor
under the Uniform Commercial Code as in force in the relevant jurisdiction and may execute and file such UCC Financing Statements
as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to accomplish the foregoing.
 
(h)          It
is further acknowledged and agreed by the Seller that the Purchaser intends to convey all right, title and interest of the Purchaser
from and after the Closing Date in and to the Mortgage Loans and all rights and remedies under this Agreement (excluding the Purchaser’s
rights and remedies under Sections 6(e)-(g), 9 and 11 of this Agreement) to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders,
including, without limitation, all rights and remedies as may be available under Section 6 to the Purchaser in the event
of a Material Breach or a Material Defect, and the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders, as assignee of the Purchaser, or
such other party as may be specified in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall be entitled to enforce any obligations of the
Seller hereunder in connection with a Material Breach or a Material Defect as if the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders
had been an original party to this Agreement.
 
Section
3.     Examination of Mortgage Files and Due Diligence Review.
 
The Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with any examination of the Mortgage Files and Servicing Files that may be undertaken by or on behalf of the Purchaser.
The fact that the Purchaser has conducted or has failed to conduct any partial or complete examination of the Mortgage Files and/or
Servicing Files shall not affect the Purchaser’s right to pursue any remedy available in equity or at law under Section
6 for a breach of the Seller’s representations, warranties and covenants set forth in or contemplated by Section 4.
 
Section
4.     Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Seller.
 
(a)          The
Seller hereby makes, as of the date hereof (or as of such other date specifically provided in the particular representation or
warranty), to and for the benefit of the Purchaser, each of the representations and warranties set forth in Exhibit D with
respect to each Mortgage Loan, subject to the exceptions set forth in Schedule D-1 to Exhibit D.
 
(b)          In
addition, the Seller, as of the date hereof, hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants with, the Purchaser that:
 
(i)           The
Seller is a limited liability company, duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
and is in compliance with the laws of each State in which any Mortgaged Property is located to the extent necessary to ensure
the enforceability of each Mortgage Loan and to perform its obligations under this Agreement.
 
8
 
 
(ii)          The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Seller, and the performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement
by the Seller, do not violate the Seller’s organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice
or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or other instrument
to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or any of its assets, in each case which materially and adversely affects
the ability of the Seller to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
 
(iii)         The
Seller has the full corporate power and authority to enter into and consummate all transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
has duly authorized the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.
 
(iv)         This
Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Purchaser, constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation
of the Seller, enforceable against the Seller in accordance with the terms hereof, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, receivership, conservatorship, liquidation, moratorium and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’
rights generally, including if the Seller is determined to be a “financial company” or an affiliate thereof under
Section 201 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the powers
of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as receiver under Title II (Orderly Liquidation Authority) of the Dodd-Frank Act,
(B) general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law, and
(C) public policy considerations underlying the securities laws, to the extent that such public policy considerations limit the
enforceability of the provisions of this Agreement that purport to provide indemnification for securities laws liabilities.
 
(v)          The
Seller is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of this Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with, the
terms of this Agreement do not constitute a violation of, any law, any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter, or any
order, regulation or demand of any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority, which violation, in the Seller’s
good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to affect materially and adversely either the ability of the Seller to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the Seller.
 
(vi)         No
litigation is pending or, to the best of the Seller’s knowledge, threatened against the Seller the outcome of which, in
the Seller’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to materially and adversely affect the ability of the Seller
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the Seller.
 
(vii)        The
Seller has not dealt with any broker, investment banker, agent or other Person, other than the Purchaser, the Principals, and
their respective affiliates, that may be entitled to any commission or compensation in connection with the sale of the Mortgage
Loans or the consummation of any of the other transactions contemplated hereby.
 
9
 
 
(viii)       No
consent, approval, authorization or order of, registration or filing with, or notice to, any governmental authority or court is
required, under federal or state law (including, with respect to any bulk sale laws), for the execution, delivery and performance
by the Seller of, or compliance by the Seller with, this Agreement, or the consummation by the Seller of any transaction contemplated
hereby, other than (1) the filing or recording of financing statements, instruments of assignment and other similar documents
necessary in connection with the Seller’s sale of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, (2) such
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, registrations, filings or notices as have been obtained, made or given and
(3) where the lack of such consent, approval, authorization, qualification, registration, filing or notice would not have a material
adverse effect on the performance by the Seller under this Agreement.
 
(ix)         Except
for the agreed-upon procedures report obtained from the accounting firm engaged to provide procedures involving a comparison of
information in loan files for the Mortgage Loans to information on a data tape relating to the Mortgage Loans (the “Accountant’s
Due Diligence Report”), the Seller has not obtained (and, through and including the Closing Date, will not obtain) any
“third party due diligence report” (as defined in Rule 15Ga-2 under the Exchange Act) in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein and the Prospectus Supplement; and, except for the accountants with respect to the Accountants’ Due
Diligence Report, the Seller has not employed (and, through and including the Closing Date, will not employ) any third party to
engage in any activity that constitutes “due diligence services” within the meaning of Rule 17g-10 under the Exchange
Act in connection with the transactions contemplated herein and the Prospectus Supplement. The Underwriters and Initial Purchasers
are third-party beneficiaries of the provisions set forth in this Section 4(b)(ix).
 
(c)          Upon
discovery by any of the Seller or the parties to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement of a breach of any of the representations
and warranties made pursuant to and set forth in subsection (b) above which materially and adversely affects the interests
of the Purchaser or a breach of any of the representations and warranties made pursuant to subsection (a) above and set
forth in Exhibit D that materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged
Property or the interests in such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser or the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders,
the party discovering such breach shall (if the discovering party is the Seller), or shall be required pursuant to the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement (if the discovering party is a party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) to, give prompt written notice
of such breach to the Seller and/or the other parties, as applicable.
 
(d)          With
respect to any Mortgage Loan (other than a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan) that is subject to a franchise agreement with a related
comfort letter in favor of the Seller that requires notice to or request of the related franchisor to transfer or assign any related
comfort letter to the Trust or otherwise have a new comfort letter issued in the name of the Trust, the Seller or its designee
shall provide any such required notice or make any such required request to the related franchisor, with a copy of such notice
or request to the Master Servicer, within 45 days of the Closing Date (or any shorter period if required by the applicable comfort
letter), notify the related franchisor that such Mortgage Loan has been transferred to the Trust and
 
10
 
 
request a replacement comfort
letter (or any such new document or acknowledgement as may be contemplated under the existing comfort letter), and the Pooling
and Servicing Agreement shall require the Master Servicer to use reasonable efforts in accordance with the Servicing Standard to
acquire such replacement comfort letter, if necessary (or to acquire any such new document or acknowledgement as may be contemplated
under the existing comfort letter).
 
Section
5.     Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the Purchaser.
 
(a)          The
Purchaser, as of the date hereof, hereby represents and warrants to, and covenants with, the Seller that:
 
(i)           The
Purchaser is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of State of Delaware.
 
(ii)          The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Purchaser, and the performance of, and compliance with, the terms of this Agreement
by the Purchaser, do not violate the Purchaser’s organizational documents or constitute a default (or an event which, with
notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or other
instrument to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or any of its assets.
 
(iii)         The
Purchaser has the full power and authority to enter into and consummate all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has duly
authorized the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement, and has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.
 
(iv)         This
Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Seller, constitutes a valid, legal and binding obligation
of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, receivership, moratorium and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors’ rights generally,
and (B) general principles of equity, regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.
 
(v)          The
Purchaser is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery of this Agreement and its performance of, and compliance with,
the terms of this Agreement will not constitute a violation of, any law, any judgment, order or decree of any court or arbiter,
or any order, regulation or demand of any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority, which violation, in the
Purchaser’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to affect materially and adversely either the ability of the Purchaser
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial condition of the Purchaser.
 
(vi)         No
litigation is pending or, to the best of the Purchaser’s knowledge, threatened against the Purchaser which would prohibit
the Purchaser from entering into this Agreement or, in the Purchaser’s good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely to
materially and adversely affect either the ability of the Purchaser to perform its obligations under this Agreement or the financial
condition of the Purchaser.
 
11
 
 
(vii)        The
Purchaser has not dealt with any broker, investment banker, agent or other Person, other than the Seller, the Principals and their
respective affiliates, that may be entitled to any commission or compensation in connection with the purchase of the Mortgage
Loans or the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.
 
(viii)       No
consent, approval, authorization or order of, registration or filing with, or notice to, any governmental authority or court is
required, under federal or state law, for the Purchaser’s execution, delivery and performance of or compliance by the Purchaser
with this Agreement, or the consummation by the Purchaser of any transaction contemplated hereby, other than (1) such consents,
approvals, authorizations, qualifications, registrations, filings or notices as have been obtained, made or given and (2) where
the lack of such consent, approval, authorization, qualification, registration, filing or notice would not have a material adverse
effect on the performance by the Purchaser under this Agreement.
 
(ix)         The
Purchaser (A) prepared one or more reports on Form ABS-15G (each, a “Form 15G”) containing the findings and
conclusions of the Accountant’s Due Diligence Report and meeting the requirements of that Form 15G, Rule 15Ga-2, any other
rules and regulations of the Commission and the Exchange Act; (B) provided a copy of the final draft of each such Form 15G to
the Principals at least 6 Business Days before the pricing date; and (C) furnished each such Form 15G to the Commission on EDGAR
at least 5 Business Days before the pricing date as required by Rule 15Ga-2.
 
(b)          Upon
discovery by any of the parties hereto of a breach of any of the representations and warranties set forth above which materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Seller, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice of such breach
to the other party or parties hereto.
 
Section
6.     Repurchases; Substitutions.
 
(a)           If
the Purchaser discovers that any document constituting a part of a Mortgage File has not been delivered within the time periods
provided for herein, has not been properly executed, is missing, does not appear to be regular on its face or contains information
that does not conform in any material respect with the corresponding information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (each,
a “Defect”), or discovers or receives notice of a breach of any representation or warranty of the Seller made
pursuant to Section 4(a) of this Agreement with respect to any Mortgage Loan (a “Breach”), and if such
Defect is a Material Defect or such Breach is a Material Breach, then the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage
Loans to the Trust Fund, the Master Servicer, the Special Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Operating Advisor
or the Custodian, on behalf of the Trust Fund) shall give prompt written notice thereof to the Seller. If any such Defect or Breach
materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan, the value of the related Mortgaged Property or the interests in
such Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property of the Purchaser, or causes the related Mortgage Loan to be other than a “qualified
mortgage” (within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, without regard to the rule of Treasury Regulation Section
1.860G-2(f)(2) which causes a defective mortgage loan to be treated as a “qualified mortgage”), then such Defect shall
constitute a “Material Defect” or such Breach shall constitute a “Material
 
12
 
 
Breach,” as the
case may be; provided, that if any of the documents specified in clauses (i), (ii), (vii), (xi)
and (xix) of the definition of “Mortgage File” is (subject to Sections 2(c) and 2(d) hereof) not
delivered, and is certified as missing pursuant to Section 2.02 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, it shall be deemed
a Material Defect. Promptly upon receiving written notice of any Material Defect or Material Breach with respect to a Mortgage
Loan, accompanied by a written demand to take the actions contemplated by this sentence, the Seller shall, not later than 90 days
from the Seller’s receipt from the Purchaser (or, following the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, any other
party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, on behalf of the Trust Fund) of notice of, and demand to take action with respect
to, such Material Defect or Material Breach, as the case may be (or, in the case of a Material Defect or Material Breach relating
to a Mortgage Loan not being a “qualified mortgage” as described in the preceding sentence, not later than 90 days
after the Seller or any party to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement discovers such Material Defect or Material Breach, provided
that the Seller has received notice in accordance with the terms of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) (any such 90-day period,
the “Initial Resolution Period”), (i) cure the same in all material respects, (ii) repurchase the affected Mortgage
Loan at the applicable Repurchase Price or (iii) substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Mortgage Loan
(provided that in no event shall such substitution occur later than the second anniversary of the Closing Date) and pay
to the Master Servicer for deposit into the Collection Account any Substitution Shortfall Amount in connection therewith; provided
that if (i) such Material Defect or Material Breach (other than one relating to a deemed Material Defect under the proviso to the
immediately preceding sentence) is capable of being cured but not within the Initial Resolution Period, (ii) such Material Defect
or Material Breach is not related to any Mortgage Loan’s not being a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning
of the REMIC Provisions and (iii) the Seller has commenced and is diligently proceeding with the cure of such Material Defect or
Material Breach within the Initial Resolution Period, then the Seller shall have an additional period equal to the applicable Resolution
Extension Period to complete such cure or, failing such cure, to repurchase the Mortgage Loan or substitute a Qualifying Substitute
Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan is not secured by a Mortgaged Property that is, in whole or in
part, a hotel, restaurant (operated by a Borrower), healthcare facility, nursing home, assisted living facility, self-storage facility,
theatre or fitness center (operated by a Borrower), then the failure to deliver to the Custodian copies of the UCC financing statements
with respect to such Mortgage Loan shall not be a Material Defect.
 
If the Seller is notified
of a Defect in any Mortgage File that also affects information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Seller shall promptly
correct such Defect and provide a new, corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Purchaser, which corrected Mortgage Loan Schedule
shall be deemed to amend and replace the existing Mortgage Loan Schedule for all purposes. The failure of the Master Servicer,
the Special Servicer, the Operating Advisor, the Certificate Administrator or the Trustee to notify the Seller of a Material Defect
or Material Breach shall not constitute a waiver of any cure or repurchase obligation, provided that the Seller must
receive written notice thereof as described in this Section 6(a) before commencement of the Initial Resolution Period.
 
If (x) there exists a
Breach of any representation or warranty on the part of the Seller as set forth in, or made pursuant to, representation 30 or 32
of Exhibit D to this Agreement relating to fees and expenses payable by the Borrower associated with the exercise of a
 
13
 
 
defeasance
option, a waiver of a “due-on-sale” provision or a “due-on-encumbrance” provision or the release of any
Mortgaged Property, and (y) the related Loan Documents specifically prohibit the Master Servicer or Special Servicer from requiring
the related Borrower to pay such fees and expenses, then, upon receipt of notice from the Master Servicer or Special Servicer,
the Seller may cure such breach by transferring to the Collection Account, within 90 days of the Seller’s receipt of such
notice, the amount of any such fees and expenses borne by the Trust Fund that are the basis of such Breach. Upon its making such
deposit, the Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Breach in all respects. Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes
the sole remedy available to the Purchaser and its assignees regarding any such Breach, regardless of whether it constitutes a
Material Breach, and the Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase or otherwise cure such Breach.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6(a), in lieu of the Seller performing its obligations with respect to any Material Breach or
Material Defect provided in the three preceding paragraphs, to the extent that the Seller and the Purchaser (or, following the
assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund, the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust Fund, and, if no Control Termination
Event has occurred and is continuing, with the consent of the Controlling Class Representative) are able to agree upon a cash payment
payable by the Seller to the Purchaser (or its assignee) that would be deemed sufficient to compensate the Purchaser (or its assignee)
for a Material Breach or Material Defect (a “Loss of Value Payment”), the Seller may elect, in its sole discretion,
to pay such Loss of Value Payment to the Purchaser (or its assignee); provided that a Material Defect or a Material Breach
as a result of a Mortgage Loan not constituting a “qualified mortgage”, within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3),
may not be cured by a Loss of Value Payment. Upon its making such payment, the Seller shall be deemed to have cured such Material
Breach or Material Defect in all respects. Provided such payment is made, this paragraph describes the sole remedy available to
the Purchaser and its assignees regarding any such Material Breach or Material Defect, and the Seller shall not be obligated to
repurchase or replace the related Mortgage Loan or otherwise cure such Material Breach or Material Defect.
 
(b)          In
connection with any repurchase of, or substitution for, a Mortgage Loan contemplated by this Section 6:
 
(i)           the
Custodian, the Master Servicer (with respect to any such Mortgage Loan other than a Specially Serviced Loan) and the Special Servicer
(with respect to any such Mortgage Loan that is a Specially Serviced Loan), pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, shall
each be required to tender to the Seller, and the Seller shall be entitled to receive therefrom, all portions of the Mortgage
File (in the case of the Custodian) and the Servicing File (in the case of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer, as applicable)
and any and all other documents pertaining to such Mortgage Loan possessed by it, upon delivery:
 
(A)          
to the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a trust receipt, and
 
(B)         
to the Custodian by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer, as applicable, of a Request for Release and an acknowledgement
by the Master
 
14
 
 
Servicer or Special Servicer, as applicable, of its receipt of the Repurchase Price or the Substitution Shortfall
Amount from the Seller;
 
(ii)          each
document that constitutes a part of the Mortgage File that was endorsed or assigned to the Trustee shall be endorsed or assigned
without recourse in the form of endorsement or assignment provided to the Custodian by the Seller, as the case may be, to the
Seller as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller the legal and beneficial ownership of each Removed Mortgage Loan to the extent
such ownership was transferred to the Trustee; and
 
(iii)         the
Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall release, or cause the release of, any
escrow payments and reserve funds held by or on behalf of the Trustee, the Certificate Administrator, the Master Servicer or the
Special Servicer, as the case may be, in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan(s) to the Seller.
 
(c)          This
Section 6 provides the sole remedies with respect to the Mortgage Loans available to the Purchaser, and its successors and
permitted assigns (i.e., the Trustee and the holders of the Certificates) in respect of any Defect in a Mortgage File or
any Breach. If the Seller defaults on its obligations to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance
with this Section 6, or disputes its obligation to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance
with Section 6, the Purchaser may take such action as is appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including,
without limitation, the institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings. To the extent the Purchaser prevails in such proceeding,
the Seller shall reimburse the Purchaser for all necessary and reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement
of such obligation of the Seller to cure, to repurchase, or to substitute for, any Mortgage Loan in accordance with this Section
6. To the extent the Seller prevails in such proceeding, the Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all necessary and reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with such proceeding.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if there is a Material Breach or Material Defect with respect to one or more Mortgaged Properties securing a Mortgage Loan, the
Seller shall not be obligated to repurchase the Mortgage Loan if (i) the affected Mortgaged Property may be released pursuant to
the terms of any partial release provisions in the related Loan Documents (and such Mortgaged Property is, in fact, released),
(ii) the remaining Mortgaged Property(ies) satisfy the requirements, if any, set forth in the Loan Documents and the Seller provides
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such release would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur and (iii) each Rating Agency
then rating the Certificates shall have provided a No Downgrade Confirmation with respect to such release.
 
(d)          As
to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, at the direction of the Master Servicer (with respect to Performing Loans) or the Special
Servicer (with respect to Specially Serviced Loans and REO Properties), the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian for such Qualifying
Substitute Mortgage Loan (with a copy to the Master Servicer), the related Mortgage File with the related Note endorsed as required
by Exhibit B hereto. Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualifying Substitute
Mortgage Loans in or prior to the month of substitution shall not be part of the Trust Fund and, if received
 
15
 
 
by the Master Servicer,
shall be remitted by the Master Servicer to the related Seller on the next succeeding Distribution Date. For the month of repurchase
or substitution, distributions to Certificateholders pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will include the Monthly Payment(s)
due on the related Removed Mortgage Loan and received by the Master Servicer or the Special Servicer on behalf of the Trust on
or prior to the related date of repurchase or substitution, as applicable, and the Seller shall be entitled to retain all amounts
received thereafter in respect of such Removed Mortgage Loan.
 
In any month in which
the Seller substitutes one or more Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Removed Mortgage Loans, pursuant to this
Agreement, the Master Servicer will determine the applicable Substitution Shortfall Amount. At the direction of the Certificate
Administrator, the Seller shall deposit, or deliver to the Master Servicer for deposit, into the Collection Account cash equal
to such amount concurrently with the delivery of the Mortgage Files for such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loans, without any
reimbursement thereof. Any Mortgage Loan that is repurchased or replaced by the Seller pursuant to this Section 6 shall
constitute a “Removed Mortgage Loan”.
 
(e)           If
the Seller (i) receives from any Person (other than the Depositor) any Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request; (ii) rejects
any Repurchase Request or is in dispute with the Person making any Repurchase Request as to the merits of such Repurchase Request
(a “Dispute”); or (iii) receives a Repurchase Communication of a Repurchase Request Withdrawal, then the Seller
shall deliver notice thereof (each, a “Rule 15Ga-1 Notice”) to the Depositor within ten (10) Business Days of
the Seller’s receipt (or in the case of a rejection or Dispute, the occurrence or commencement) thereof. Each Rule 15Ga-1
Notice shall include (i) the identity of the related Mortgage Loan, (ii) the date the Repurchase Communication of the Repurchase
Request or the Repurchase Request Withdrawal was received, as applicable, and (iii) in the case of a Repurchase Request, the identity
of the Person making such Repurchase Request and, if known, the basis for the Repurchase Request (as asserted in the Repurchase
Request).
 
“Repurchase
Communication” means, for purposes of this Section 6(e) only, any communication, whether oral or written, which
need not be in any specific form.
 
(f)           The
Seller shall provide to the Depositor relevant portions of any Form ABS-15G that the Seller is required to file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (only to the extent that such portions relate to any Mortgage Loan) on or before the date that is five
(5) Business Days before the date such Form ABS-15G is required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In connection
with such filing, upon the request of the Seller, the Depositor shall provide to the Seller the Trust Fund’s Central Index
Key (CIK) number and such other information regarding the principal balances of the Mortgage Loans as is reasonably necessary for
the Seller to complete and file such Form ABS-15G.
 
(g)          The
Seller agrees that a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider will not, in connection with providing the Seller with any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice
(for purposes of this Section 6(g) only, as defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), be required to provide any
information protected by the attorney-client privilege or attorney work product doctrines. In addition, the Seller hereby acknowledges
that (i) any Rule 15Ga-1 Notice provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement is so provided
only to assist the Seller,
 
16
 
 
the Depositor and its Affiliates to comply with Rule 15Ga-1 under the Exchange Act, Items 1104 and 1121
of Regulation AB and any other requirement of law or regulation and (ii) (A) no action taken by, or inaction of, a Rule 15Ga-1
Notice Provider and (B) no information provided pursuant to Section 2.03(d) of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement by a
Rule 15Ga-1 Notice Provider, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or defense to the exercise of any legal right the Rule 15Ga-1
Notice Provider may have with respect to this Agreement, including with respect to any Repurchase Request that is the subject of
a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice.
 
(h)          Each
party hereto agrees that the receipt of a Rule 15Ga-1 Notice or the delivery of any notice required to be delivered pursuant to
this Section 6 shall not, in and of itself, constitute delivery of notice of, receipt of notice of, or knowledge of the
Seller of, any Material Defect or Material Breach.

and sale of the Mortgage Loans (the “Closing”) shall be held at the offices of Sidley Austin LLP, 787 Seventh

conversion or consolidation to which the Seller is a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all of the business

of this Agreement), to the Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, as may be required to effect the purposes of the

Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Certificate Purchase Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing Agreement), and supersedes
all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, inducements and conditions, express or implied, oral or written, of any
nature whatsoever with respect to the subject matter hereof. The express terms hereof control and supersede any course of performance
or usage of the trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.
 
Section
21.   Obligations of PCPI.
 
For value received, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, PCPI, a limited liability company duly organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware, hereby absolutely and unconditionally guarantees the prompt and complete payment when due of the obligations
and liabilities, whether now in existence or hereafter arising, of the Seller, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of PCPI, to
the Purchaser (i) arising out of or under Section 6 of this Agreement and (ii) that are owed under such Section 6
to the Purchaser or any of its successors and permitted assigns under this Agreement (collectively, the “Obligations”).
The guaranty provided for in this Section 21 is one of payment and not of collection. PCPI hereby waives notice of acceptance
of the guaranty provided for in this Section 21 and notice of any of the Obligations to which it may apply, and waives diligence,
presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of protest, notice of dishonor or non-payment of any Obligation, suit or the taking
of other action by the Purchaser against, and any other notice to, the Seller, PCPI or others.
 
PCPI hereby waives any
and all defenses it may have arising out of: (i) the validity, regularity or enforceability of this Agreement; (ii) the absence
of any action to enforce the same; (iii) the rendering of any judgment against the Seller or any action to enforce the same; (iv)
any waiver or consent by the Purchaser or any amendment or other modification to this Agreement; (v) any defense to payment hereunder
based upon suretyship defenses; (vi) the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Seller, (vii) any defense based on (1) the corporate status
of the Seller, (2) the power and authority of the Seller to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder
or (3) the legality, validity and enforceability of the Seller’s obligation under this Agreement, or (viii) any other defense,
circumstances or limitation of any nature whatsoever that would constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or other
third party obligor.
 
PCPI acknowledges that
it is presently informed of the financial condition of the Seller and of all other circumstances which diligent inquiry would reveal
and which bear upon the risk of nonpayment of the Obligations.
 
23
 
 
When pursuing its rights
and remedies hereunder against PCPI, the Purchaser may, but shall be under no obligation to, pursue such rights and remedies that
the Purchaser may have against the Seller or any other Person or any security or other guarantee for the Obligations or any right
of offset with respect thereto, and any failure by the Purchaser to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments
from the Seller or any such other Person or to realize upon any security or other guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset,
or any release of the Seller or any such other Person or security or other guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve PCPI
of any liability hereunder, and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a
matter of law, of the Purchaser against PCPI.

EXHIBIT D
 
MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
SELLER
REGARDING THE INDIVIDUAL MORTGAGE LOANS
 
(1)     Whole
Loan; Ownership of Mortgage Loans. Except with respect to a Mortgage Loan that is part of a Loan Combination, each Mortgage
Loan is a whole loan and not a participation interest in a Mortgage Loan. At the time of the sale, transfer and assignment to
Purchaser, no Note or Mortgage was subject to any assignment (other than assignments to the Seller), participation or pledge,
and the Seller had good title to, and was the sole owner of, each Mortgage Loan free and clear of any and all liens, charges,
pledges, encumbrances, participations, any other ownership interests on, in or to such Mortgage Loan other than any servicing
rights appointment or similar agreement. Seller has full right and authority to sell, assign and transfer each Mortgage Loan,
and the assignment to Purchaser constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment of such Mortgage Loan free and clear of any
and all liens, pledges, charges or security interests of any nature encumbering such Mortgage Loan.
 
(2)     Loan
Document Status. Each related Note, Mortgage, Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits (if a separate instrument), guaranty
and other agreement executed by or on behalf of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor in connection with such Mortgage
Loan is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the related Borrower, guarantor or other obligor (subject to any non-recourse
provisions contained in any of the foregoing agreements and any applicable state anti-deficiency or market value limit deficiency
legislation), as applicable, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms, except (i) as such enforcement may be limited by
(a) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors’ rights generally and (b) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law) and (ii) that certain provisions in such Loan Documents (including, without limitation, provisions
requiring the payment of default interest, late fees or prepayment/yield maintenance fees, charges and/or premiums) are, or may
be, further limited or rendered unenforceable by or under applicable law, but (subject to the limitations set forth in clause (i)
above) such limitations or unenforceability will not render such Loan Documents invalid as a whole or materially interfere with
the mortgagee’s realization of the principal benefits and/or security provided thereby (clauses (i) and (ii) collectively,
the “Standard Qualifications”).
 
Except as set forth
in the immediately preceding sentences, there is no valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right of rescission available to the
related Borrower with respect to any of the related Notes, Mortgages or other Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any
such valid offset, defense, counterclaim or right based on intentional fraud by Seller in connection with the origination of the
Mortgage Loan, that would deny the mortgagee the principal benefits intended to be provided by the Note, Mortgage or other Loan
Documents.
 
(3)     Mortgage
Provisions. The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan contain provisions that render the rights and remedies of the holder
thereof adequate for the practical
 
D-1
 
 
realization against the Mortgaged Property of the principal benefits of the security intended
to be provided thereby, including realization by judicial or, if applicable, non-judicial foreclosure subject to the limitations
set forth in the Standard Qualifications.
 
(4)     Mortgage
Status; Waivers and Modifications. Since origination and except by written instruments set forth in the related Mortgage File
or as otherwise provided in the related Loan Documents (a) the material terms of such Mortgage, Note, Mortgage Loan guaranty, and
related Loan Documents have not been waived, impaired, modified, altered, satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded in any
respect; (b) no related Mortgaged Property or any portion thereof has been released from the lien of the related Mortgage in any
manner which materially interferes with the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the use or operation of the remaining
portion of such Mortgaged Property; and (c) neither the related Borrower nor the related guarantor has been released from its material
obligations under the Mortgage Loan. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, except as contained in a written document included in
the Mortgage File, there have been no modifications, amendments or waivers, that could be reasonably expected to have a material
adverse effect on such Mortgage Loan consented to by Seller on or after July 13, 2015.
 
(5)     Lien;
Valid Assignment. Subject to the Standard Qualifications, each assignment of Mortgage and assignment of Assignment of Leases,
Rents and Profits to the Trust constitutes a legal, valid and binding assignment to the Trust. Each related Mortgage and Assignment
of Leases, Rents and Profits is freely assignable without the consent of the related Borrower. Each related Mortgage is a legal,
valid and enforceable first lien on the related Borrower’s fee or leasehold interest in the Mortgaged Property in the principal
amount of such Mortgage Loan or allocated loan amount (subject only to Permitted Encumbrances (as defined below) and the exceptions
to paragraph (6) set forth in Schedule D-1 to this Exhibit D (each such exception, a “Title Exception”)), except
as the enforcement thereof may be limited by the Standard Qualifications. Such Mortgaged Property (subject to and excepting Permitted
Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions) as of origination was, and as of the Cut-off Date, to the Seller’s knowledge, is free
and clear of any recorded mechanics’ liens, recorded materialmen’s liens and other recorded encumbrances which are
prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by
a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below), and, to the Seller’s knowledge and subject to the rights of
tenants (as tenants only) (subject to and excepting Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions), no rights exist which under
law could give rise to any such lien or encumbrance that would be prior to or equal with the lien of the related Mortgage, except
those which are bonded over, escrowed for or insured against by a lender’s title insurance policy (as described below). Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, no representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other personal
property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”)
financing statements is required in order to effect such perfection.
 
(6)     Permitted
Liens; Title Insurance. Each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan is covered by an American Land Title Association loan
title insurance policy or a comparable form of loan title insurance policy approved for use in the applicable jurisdiction (or,
if such policy is yet to be issued, by a pro forma policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions or a “marked
up” commitment, in each case binding on the title insurer) (the “Title
 
D-2
 
 
Policy”) in the original principal
amount of such Mortgage Loan (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan secured by multiple properties, an amount equal to at least the
allocated loan amount with respect to the Title Policy for each such property) after all advances of principal (including any advances
held in escrow or reserves), that insures for the benefit of the owner of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage, the first priority
lien of the Mortgage, which lien is subject only to (a) the lien of current real property taxes, water charges, sewer rents and
assessments not yet due and payable; (b) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way, easements and other matters of
public record; (c) the exceptions (general and specific) and exclusions set forth in such Title Policy; (d) other matters to which
like properties are commonly subject; (e) the rights of tenants (as tenants only) under leases (including subleases) pertaining
to the related Mortgaged Property and condominium declarations; and (f) if the related Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized and
cross-defaulted with another Mortgage Loan (each a “Crossed Mortgage Loan”), the lien of the Mortgage for another
Mortgage Loan that is cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted with such Crossed Mortgage Loan, provided that none of which items
(a) through (f), individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely interferes with the value or current use of the Mortgaged
Property or the security intended to be provided by such Mortgage or the Borrower’s ability to pay its obligations when they
become due (collectively, the “Permitted Encumbrances”). Except as contemplated by clause (f) of the preceding
sentence, none of the Permitted Encumbrances are mortgage liens that are senior to or coordinate and co-equal with the lien of
the related Mortgage. Such Title Policy (or, if it has yet to be issued, the coverage to be provided thereby) is in full force
and effect, all premiums thereon have been paid and no claims have been made by the Seller thereunder and no claims have been paid
thereunder. Neither the Seller, nor to the Seller’s knowledge, any other holder of the Mortgage Loan, has done, by act or
omission, anything that would materially impair the coverage under such Title Policy.
 
(7)     Junior
Liens. It being understood that B notes secured by the same Mortgage as a Mortgage Loan are not subordinate mortgages or junior
liens, except for any Crossed Mortgage Loan, there are, as of origination, and to the Seller’s knowledge, as of the Cut-off
Date, no subordinate mortgages or junior liens securing the payment of money encumbering the related Mortgaged Property (other
than Permitted Encumbrances and the Title Exceptions, taxes and assessments, mechanics and materialmen’s liens (which are
the subject of the representation in paragraph (5) above), and equipment and other personal property financing). Except as set
forth in Schedule D-2 to this Exhibit D, the Seller has no knowledge of any mezzanine debt secured directly by interests in the
related Borrower.
 
(8)     Assignment
of Leases, Rents and Profits. There exists as part of the related Mortgage File an Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits
(either as a separate instrument or incorporated into the related Mortgage). Subject to the Permitted Encumbrances and the Title
Exceptions, each related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits creates a valid first-priority collateral assignment of, or a
valid first-priority lien or security interest in, rents and certain rights under the related lease or leases, subject only to
a license granted to the related Borrower to exercise certain rights and to perform certain obligations of the lessor under such
lease or leases, including the right to operate the related leased property, except as the enforcement thereof may be limited by
the Standard Qualifications. The related Mortgage or related Assignment of Leases, Rents and Profits, subject to applicable law,
provides that, upon an event of default under the Mortgage Loan, a receiver is permitted to be appointed for the collection of
rents or for the
 
D-3
 
 
related mortgagee to enter into possession to collect the rents or for rents to be paid directly to the mortgagee.
 
(9)     UCC
Filings. If the related Mortgaged Property is operated as a hospitality property, the Seller has filed and/or recorded or
caused to be filed and/or recorded (or, if not filed and/or recorded, have been submitted in proper form for filing and/or recording),
UCC financing statements in the appropriate public filing and/or recording offices necessary at the time of the origination of
the Mortgage Loan to perfect a valid security interest in all items of physical personal property reasonably necessary to operate
such Mortgaged Property owned by such Borrower and located on the related Mortgaged Property (other than any non-material personal
property, any personal property subject to a purchase money security interest, a sale and leaseback financing arrangement as permitted
under the terms of the related Loan Documents or any other personal property leases applicable to such personal property), to
the extent perfection may be effected pursuant to applicable law by recording or filing, as the case may be. Subject to the Standard
Qualifications, each related Mortgage (or equivalent document) creates a valid and enforceable lien and security interest on the
items of personalty described above. No representation is made as to the perfection of any security interest in rents or other
personal property to the extent that possession or control of such items or actions other than the filing of UCC financing statements
are required in order to effect such perfection.
 
(10)   Condition
of Property. Seller or the originator of the Mortgage Loan inspected or caused to be inspected each related Mortgaged Property
within six months of origination of the Mortgage Loan and within twelve months of the Cut-off Date.
 
An engineering report
or property condition assessment was prepared in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan no more than twelve months
prior to the Cut-off Date. To the Seller’s knowledge, based solely upon due diligence customarily performed in connection
with the origination of comparable mortgage loans, as of the Closing Date, each related Mortgaged Property was free and clear of
any material damage (other than (i) any damage or deficiency that is estimated to cost less than $50,000 to repair, (ii) any deferred
maintenance for which escrows were established at origination and (iii) any damage fully covered by insurance) that would affect
materially and adversely the use or value of such Mortgaged Property as security for the Mortgage Loan.
 
(11)   Taxes
and Assessments. All taxes, governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges (including, without limitation,
water and sewage charges), or installments thereof, that could be a lien on the related Mortgaged Property that would be of equal
or superior priority to the lien of the Mortgage and that prior to the Cut-off Date have become delinquent in respect of each related
Mortgaged Property have been paid, or an escrow of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to cover such payments and
reasonably estimated interest and penalties, if any, thereon. For purposes of this representation and warranty, real estate taxes
and governmental assessments and other outstanding governmental charges and installments thereof shall not be considered delinquent
until the earlier of (a) the date on which interest and/or penalties would first be payable thereon and (b) the date on which enforcement
action is entitled to be taken by the related taxing authority.
 
D-4
 
 
(12)   Condemnation.
As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding pending, and,
to the Seller’s knowledge as of the date of origination and as of the Cut-off Date, there is no proceeding threatened, for
the total or partial condemnation of such Mortgaged Property that would have a material adverse effect on the value, use or operation
of the Mortgaged Property.
 
(13)   Actions
Concerning Mortgage Loan. As of the date of origination and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, there was
no pending or filed action, suit or proceeding, arbitration or governmental investigation involving any Borrower, guarantor, or
Borrower’s interest in the Mortgaged Property, an adverse outcome of which would reasonably be expected to materially and
adversely affect (a) such Borrower’s title to the Mortgaged Property, (b) the validity or enforceability of the Mortgage,
(c) such Borrower’s ability to perform under the related Mortgage Loan, (d) such guarantor’s ability to perform under
the related guaranty, (e) the principal benefit of the security intended to be provided by the Loan Documents or (f) the current
principal use of the Mortgaged Property.
 
(14)   Escrow
Deposits. All escrow deposits and payments required to be escrowed with lender pursuant to each Mortgage Loan are in the possession,
or under the control, of the Seller or its servicer, and there are no deficiencies (subject to any applicable grace or cure periods)
in connection therewith, and all such escrows and deposits (or the right thereto) that are required to be escrowed with lender
under the related Loan Documents are being conveyed by the Seller to Purchaser or its servicer.
 
(15)   No
Holdbacks. The Stated Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date of the Mortgage Loan set forth on the mortgage loan schedule
attached as Exhibit A to this Agreement has been fully disbursed as of the Closing Date and there is no requirement for future
advances thereunder (except in those cases where the full amount of the Mortgage Loan has been disbursed but a portion thereof
is being held in escrow or reserve accounts pending the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to leasing, repairs or other
matters with respect to the related Mortgaged Property, the Borrower or other considerations determined by Seller to merit such
holdback).
 
(16)   Insurance.
Each related Mortgaged Property is, and is required pursuant to the related Mortgage to be, insured by a property insurance policy
providing coverage for loss in accordance with coverage found under a “special cause of loss form” or “all risk
form” that includes replacement cost valuation issued by an insurer meeting the requirements of the related Loan Documents
and having a claims-paying or financial strength rating of any one of the following: (i) at least “A-:VIII” from A.M.
Best Company, (ii) at least “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. or (iii) at least “A-”
from Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (collectively the “Insurance Rating Requirements”), in an
amount (subject to a customary deductible) not less than the lesser of (1) the original principal balance of the Mortgage Loan
and (2) the full insurable value on a replacement cost basis of the improvements, furniture, furnishings, fixtures and equipment
owned by the Borrower and included in the Mortgaged Property (with no deduction for physical depreciation), but, in any event,
not less than the amount necessary or containing such endorsements as are necessary to avoid the operation of any coinsurance provisions
with respect to the related Mortgaged Property.
 
D-5
 
 
Each related Mortgaged
Property is also covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by business interruption or rental
loss insurance which (subject to a customary deductible) covers a period of not less than 12 months (or with respect to each Mortgage
Loan on a single asset with a principal balance of $50 million or more, 18 months).
 
If any material part
of the improvements, exclusive of a parking lot, located on a Mortgaged Property is in an area identified in the Federal Register
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards, the related Borrower is required to maintain insurance
in the maximum amount available under the National Flood Insurance Program.
 
If the Mortgaged Property
is located within 25 miles of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico or the Atlantic coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina or North
Carolina, the related Borrower is required to maintain coverage for windstorm and/or windstorm related perils and/or “named
storms” issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements or endorsement covering damage from windstorm and/or
windstorm related perils and/or named storms.
 
The Mortgaged Property
is covered, and required to be covered pursuant to the related Loan Documents, by a commercial general liability insurance policy
issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements including coverage for property damage, contractual damage and personal
injury (including bodily injury and death) in amounts as are generally required by the Seller for loans originated for securitization,
and in any event not less than $1 million per occurrence and $2 million in the aggregate.
 
An architectural or
engineering consultant has performed an analysis of each of the Mortgaged Properties located in seismic zones 3 or 4 in order to
evaluate the structural and seismic condition of such property, for the sole purpose of assessing either the scenario expected
limit (“SEL”) or the probable maximum loss (“PML”) for the Mortgaged Property in the event
of an earthquake. In such instance, the SEL or PML, as applicable, was based on a 475-year return period, an exposure period of
50 years and a 10% probability of exceedance. If the resulting report concluded that the SEL or PML, as applicable, would exceed
20% of the amount of the replacement costs of the improvements, earthquake insurance on such Mortgaged Property was obtained by
an insurer rated at least “A:VIII” by A.M. Best Company or “A3” (or the equivalent) from Moody’s
Investors Service, Inc. or “A-” by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services in an amount not less than 100% of
the SEL or PML, as applicable.
 
The Loan Documents
require insurance proceeds in respect of a property loss to be applied either (a) to the repair or restoration of all or part of
the related Mortgaged Property, with respect to all property losses in excess of 5% of the then outstanding principal amount of
the related Mortgage Loan (or Loan Combination, if applicable), the lender (or a trustee appointed by it) having the right to hold
and disburse such proceeds as the repair or restoration progresses, or (b) to the payment of the outstanding principal balance
of such Mortgage Loan (or Loan Combination, if applicable) together with any accrued interest thereon.
 
All premiums on all
insurance policies referred to in this section required to be paid as of the Cut-off Date have been paid, and such insurance policies
name the lender under the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns as a loss payee under a mortgagee endorsement
 
D-6
 
 
clause or,
in the case of the general liability insurance policy, as named or additional insured. Such insurance policies will inure to the
benefit of the Trustee (or, in the case of a Mortgage Loan that is a Non-Serviced Mortgage Loan, the applicable Other Trustee).
Each related Mortgage Loan obligates the related Borrower to maintain all such insurance and, at such Borrower’s failure
to do so, authorizes the lender to maintain such insurance at the Borrower’s cost and expense and to charge such Borrower
for related premiums. All such insurance policies (other than commercial liability policies) require at least 10 days’ prior
notice to the lender of termination or cancellation arising because of nonpayment of a premium and at least 30 days prior notice
to the lender of termination or cancellation (or such lesser period, not less than 10 days, as may be required by applicable law)
arising for any reason other than non-payment of a premium and no such notice has been received by Seller.
 
(17)   Access;
Utilities; Separate Tax Lots. Each Mortgaged Property (a) is located on or adjacent to a public road and has direct legal access
to such road, or has access via an irrevocable easement or irrevocable right of way permitting ingress and egress to/from a public
road, (b) is served by or has uninhibited access rights to public or private water and sewer (or well and septic) and all required
utilities, all of which are appropriate for the current use of the Mortgaged Property, and (c) constitutes one or more separate
tax parcels which do not include any property which is not part of the Mortgaged Property or is subject to an endorsement under
the related Title Policy insuring the Mortgaged Property, or in certain cases, an application has been, or will be, made to the
applicable governing authority for creation of separate tax lots, in which case the Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to escrow
an amount sufficient to pay taxes for the existing tax parcel of which the Mortgaged Property is a part until the separate tax
lots are created.
 
(18)   No
Encroachments. To Seller’s knowledge based solely on surveys obtained in connection with origination and the lender’s
Title Policy (or, if such policy is not yet issued, a pro forma title policy, a preliminary title policy with escrow instructions
or a “marked up” commitment) obtained in connection with the origination of each Mortgage Loan, all material improvements
that were included for the purpose of determining the appraised value of the related Mortgaged Property at the time of the origination
of such Mortgage Loan are within the boundaries of the related Mortgaged Property, except encroachments that do not materially
and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements were obtained under
the Title Policy. No improvements on adjoining parcels encroach onto the related Mortgaged Property except for encroachments that
do not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements
were obtained under the Title Policy. No improvements encroach upon any easements except for encroachments the removal of which
would not materially and adversely affect the value or current use of such Mortgaged Property or for which insurance or endorsements
obtained with respect to the Title Policy.
 
(19)   No
Contingent Interest or Equity Participation. No Mortgage Loan has a shared appreciation feature, any other contingent interest
feature or a negative amortization feature (except that an ARD Loan may provide for the accrual of the portion of interest in excess
of the rate in effect prior to the Anticipated Repayment Date) or an equity participation by Seller.
 
D-7
 
 
(20)   REMIC.
The Mortgage Loan is a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3) (but determined without regard
to the rule in the U.S. Department of Treasury Regulations (the “Treasury Regulations”) Section 1.860G-2(f)(2)
that treats certain defective mortgage loans as qualified mortgages), and, accordingly, (A) the issue price of the Mortgage Loan
to the related Borrower at origination did not exceed the non-contingent principal amount of the Mortgage Loan and (B) either:
(a) such Mortgage Loan is secured by an interest in real property (including buildings and structural components thereof, but excluding
personal property) having a fair market value (i) at the date the Mortgage Loan was originated at least equal to 80% of the adjusted
issue price of the Mortgage Loan (or Loan Combination, if applicable) on such date or (ii) at the Closing Date at least equal to
80% of the adjusted issue price of the Mortgage Loan (or Loan Combination, if applicable) on such date, provided that for purposes
hereof, the fair market value of the real property interest must first be reduced by (A) the amount of any lien on the real property
interest that is senior to the Mortgage Loan and (B) a proportionate amount of any lien that is in parity with the Mortgage Loan;
or (b) substantially all of the proceeds of such Mortgage Loan were used to acquire, improve or protect the real property which
served as the only security for such Mortgage Loan (other than a recourse feature or other third-party credit enhancement within
the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(a)(1)(ii) of the Treasury Regulations). If the Mortgage Loan was “significantly modified”
prior to the Closing Date so as to result in a taxable exchange under Section 1001 of the Code, it either (x) was modified as a
result of the default or reasonably foreseeable default of such Mortgage Loan or (y) satisfies the provisions of either sub-clause
(B)(a)(i) above (substituting the date of the last such modification for the date the Mortgage Loan was originated) or sub-clause
(B)(a)(ii), including the proviso thereto. Any prepayment premium and yield maintenance charges applicable to the Mortgage Loan
constitute “customary prepayment penalties” within the meaning of Section 1.860G-1(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations.
All terms used in this paragraph shall have the same meanings as set forth in the related Treasury Regulations.
 
(21)   Compliance
with Usury Laws. The Mortgage Rate (exclusive of any default interest, late charges, yield maintenance charge, or prepayment
premiums) of such Mortgage Loan complied as of the date of origination with, or was exempt from, applicable state or federal laws,
regulations and other requirements pertaining to usury.
 
(22)   Authorized
to do Business. To the extent required under applicable law, as of the Cut-off Date or as of the date that such entity held
the Note, each holder of the Note was authorized to transact and do business in the jurisdiction in which each related Mortgaged
Property is located, or the failure to be so authorized does not materially and adversely affect the enforceability of such Mortgage
Loan by the Trust.
 
(23)   Trustee
under Deed of Trust. With respect to each Mortgage which is a deed of trust, as of the date of origination and, to the Seller’s
knowledge, as of the Closing Date, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, currently so serves and is
named in the deed of trust or has been substituted in accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law or may be substituted in
accordance with the Mortgage and applicable law by the related mortgagee.
 
(24)   Local
Law Compliance. To the Seller’s knowledge, based upon any of a letter from any governmental authorities, a legal opinion,
an architect’s letter, a zoning consultant’s
 
D-8
 
 
report, an endorsement to the related Title Policy, or other affirmative
investigation of local law compliance consistent with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial, multifamily
or, if applicable, manufactured housing community mortgage loans intended for securitization, with respect to the improvements
located on or forming part of each Mortgaged Property securing a Mortgage Loan as of the date of origination of such Mortgage Loan
and as of the Cut-off Date, there are no material violations of applicable zoning ordinances, building codes and land laws (collectively
“Zoning Regulations”) other than those which (i) constitute a legal non-conforming use or structure, as to which
as the Mortgaged Property may be restored or repaired to the full extent necessary to maintain the use of the structure immediately
prior to a casualty or the inability to restore or repair to the full extent necessary to maintain the use or structure immediately
prior to the casualty would not materially and adversely affect the use or operation of the Mortgaged Property, (ii) are insured
by the Title Policy or other insurance policy, (iii) are insured by law and ordinance insurance coverage in amounts customarily
required by the Seller for loans originated for securitization that provides coverage for additional costs to rebuild and/or repair
the property to current Zoning Regulations or (iv) would not have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan. The terms of
the Loan Documents require the Borrower to comply in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, zoning
and building laws.
 
(25)   Licenses
and Permits. Each Borrower covenants in the Loan Documents that it shall keep all material licenses, permits and applicable
governmental authorizations necessary for its operation of the Mortgaged Property in full force and effect, and to the Seller’s
knowledge based upon a letter from any government authorities or other affirmative investigation of local law compliance consistent
with the investigation conducted by the Seller for similar commercial, multifamily or, if applicable, manufactured housing community
mortgage loans intended for securitization, all such material licenses, permits and applicable governmental authorizations are
in effect. The Mortgage Loan requires the related Borrower to be qualified to do business in the jurisdiction in which the related
Mortgaged Property is located.
 
(26)   Recourse
Obligations. The Loan Documents for each Mortgage Loan provide that (a) the related Borrower and at least one individual or
entity shall be fully liable for actual losses, liabilities, costs and damages arising from certain acts of the related Borrower
and/or its principals specified in the related Loan Documents, which acts generally include the following: (i) acts of fraud or
intentional material misrepresentation, (ii) misapplication or misappropriation of rents, insurance proceeds or condemnation awards,
(iii) intentional material physical waste of the Mortgaged Property, and (iv) any breach of the environmental covenants contained
in the related Loan Documents, and (b) the Mortgage Loan shall become full recourse to the related Borrower and at least one individual
or entity, if the related Borrower files a voluntary petition under federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency law.
 
(27)   Mortgage
Releases. The terms of the related Mortgage or related Loan Documents do not provide for release of any material portion of
the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage except (a) a partial release, accompanied by principal repayment, or partial
Defeasance (as defined in paragraph (32)), of not less than a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (i) 110% of
the related allocated loan amount of such portion of the Mortgaged Property and (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan, (b) upon payment in full of such Mortgage Loan, (c) upon a Defeasance (as defined in paragraph (32)), (d)
 
D-9
 
 
releases of out-parcels
that are unimproved or other portions of the Mortgaged Property which will not have a material adverse effect on the underwritten
value of the Mortgaged Property and which were not afforded any value in the appraisal obtained at the origination of the Mortgage
Loan and are not necessary for physical access to the Mortgaged Property or compliance with zoning requirements, or (e) as required
pursuant to an order of condemnation. With respect to any partial release under the preceding clauses (a) or (d), either: (x) such
release of collateral (i) would not constitute a “significant modification” of the subject Mortgage Loan within the
meaning of Section 1.860G-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations and (ii) would not cause the subject Mortgage Loan to fail to be
a “qualified mortgage” within the meaning of Code Section 860G(a)(3)(A); or (y) the mortgagee or servicer can, in accordance
with the related Loan Documents, condition such release of collateral on the related Borrower’s delivery of an opinion of
tax counsel to the effect specified in the immediately preceding clause (x). For purposes of the preceding clause (x), if the fair
market value of the real property constituting such Mortgaged Property after the release is not equal to at least 80% of the principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan (or Loan Combination, if applicable) outstanding after the release, the Borrower is required to make
a payment of principal in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions.
 
In the case of any
Mortgage Loan, in the event of a taking of any portion of a Mortgaged Property by a State or any political subdivision or authority
thereof, whether by legal proceeding or by agreement, the Borrower can be required to pay down the principal balance of the Mortgage
Loan in an amount not less than the amount required by the REMIC Provisions and, to such extent, condemnation proceeds may not
be required to be applied to the restoration of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Borrower, if, immediately after the release
of such portion of the Mortgaged Property from the lien of the Mortgage (but taking into account the planned restoration) the fair
market value of the real property constituting the remaining Mortgaged Property is not equal to at least 80% of the remaining principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan (or Loan Combination, if applicable).
 
No Mortgage Loan that
is secured by more than one Mortgaged Property or that is a Crossed Mortgage Loan permits the release of cross-collateralization
of the related Mortgaged Properties, or a portion thereof, including due to a partial condemnation, other than in compliance with
the loan-to-value ratio and other requirements of the REMIC Provisions.
 
(28)   Financial
Reporting and Rent Rolls. Each Mortgage requires the Borrower to provide the owner or holder of the Mortgage with quarterly
(other than for single-tenant properties) and annual operating statements, and quarterly (other than for single-tenant properties)
rent rolls for properties that have leases contributing more than 5% of the in-place base rent and annual financial statements,
which annual financial statements with respect to each Mortgage Loan with more than one Borrower are in the form of an annual combined
balance sheet of the Borrower entities (and no other entities), together with the related combined statements of operations, members’
capital and cash flows, including a combining balance sheet and statement of income for the Mortgaged Properties on a combined
basis.
 
(29)   Acts
of Terrorism Exclusion. With respect to each Mortgage Loan over $20 million, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy
and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting the Insurance Rating Requirements) do not specifically exclude
 
D-10
 
 
Acts
of Terrorism, as defined in the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization
Act of 2007 and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (collectively referred to as “TRIA”),
from coverage, or if such coverage is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each other
Mortgage Loan, the related special-form all-risk insurance policy and business interruption policy (issued by an insurer meeting
the Insurance Rating Requirements) did not, as of the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, and, to Seller’s knowledge,
do not, as of the Cut-off Date, specifically exclude Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, from coverage, or if such coverage
is excluded, it is covered by a separate terrorism insurance policy. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the related Loan Documents
do not expressly waive or prohibit the mortgagee from requiring coverage for Acts of Terrorism, as defined in TRIA, or damages
related thereto except to the extent that any right to require such coverage may be limited by commercial availability on commercially
reasonable terms; provided, that if TRIA or a similar or subsequent statute is not in effect, then, provided that terrorism insurance
is commercially available, the Borrower under each Mortgage Loan is required to carry terrorism insurance, but in such event the
Borrower shall not be required to spend on terrorism insurance coverage more than two times the amount of the insurance premium
that is payable in respect of the property and business interruption/rental loss insurance required under the related Loan Documents
(without giving effect to the cost of terrorism and earthquake components of such casualty and business interruption/rental loss
insurance) at such time, and if the cost of terrorism insurance exceeds such amount, the Borrower is required to purchase the maximum
amount of terrorism insurance available with funds equal to such amount.
 
(30)   Due
on Sale or Encumbrance. Subject to specific exceptions set forth below, each Mortgage Loan contains a “due on sale”
or other such provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan if, without the
consent of the holder of the Mortgage (which consent, in some cases, may not be unreasonably withheld) and/or complying with the
requirements of the related Loan Documents (which provide for transfers without the consent of the lender which are customarily
acceptable to the Seller lending on the security of property comparable to the related Mortgaged Property, including, without limitation,
transfers of worn-out or obsolete furnishings, fixtures, or equipment promptly replaced with property of equivalent value and functionality
and transfers by leases entered into in accordance with the Loan Documents), (a) the related Mortgaged Property, or any equity
interest of greater than 50% in the related Borrower, is directly or indirectly pledged, transferred or sold, other than as related
to (i) family and estate planning transfers or transfers upon death or legal incapacity, (ii) transfers to certain affiliates as
defined in the related Loan Documents, (iii) transfers of less than, or other than, a controlling interest in the related Borrower,
(iv) transfers to another holder of direct or indirect equity in the Borrower, a specific Person designated in the related Loan
Documents or a Person satisfying specific criteria identified in the related Loan Documents, such as a qualified equityholder,
(v) transfers of stock or similar equity units in publicly traded companies, (vi) a substitution or release of collateral within
the parameters of paragraphs (27) and (32) herein, or (vii) by reason of any mezzanine debt that existed at the origination of
the related Mortgage Loan as set forth on Schedule D-2 to this Exhibit D, or future permitted mezzanine debt as set forth on Schedule
D-3 to this Exhibit D or (b) the related Mortgaged Property is encumbered with a subordinate lien or security interest against
the related Mortgaged Property, other than (i) any Companion Loan or any subordinate debt that existed at origination and is permitted
under the related Loan Documents, (ii) purchase money security interests, (iii)
 
D-11
 
 
any Crossed Mortgage Loan as set forth on Schedule
D-4 to this Exhibit D or (iv) Permitted Encumbrances. The Mortgage or other Loan Documents provide that to the extent any Rating
Agency fees are incurred in connection with the review of and consent to any transfer or encumbrance, the Borrower is responsible
for such payment along with all other reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Mortgagee relative to such transfer or encumbrance.
 
(31)   Single-Purpose
Entity. Each Mortgage Loan requires the Borrower to be a Single-Purpose Entity for at least as long as the Mortgage Loan is
outstanding. Both the Loan Documents and the organizational documents of the Borrower with respect to each Mortgage Loan with a
Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance in excess of $5 million provide that the Borrower is a Single-Purpose Entity, and each Mortgage
Loan with a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance of $20 million or more has a counsel’s opinion regarding non-consolidation
of the Borrower. For this purpose, a “Single-Purpose Entity” shall mean an entity, other than an individual, whose
organizational documents (or if the Mortgage Loan has a Cut-off Date Stated Principal Balance equal to $5 million or less, its
organizational documents or the related Loan Documents) provide substantially to the effect that it was formed or organized solely
for the purpose of owning and operating one or more of the Mortgaged Properties and prohibit it from engaging in any business unrelated
to such Mortgaged Property or Properties, and whose organizational documents further provide, or which entity represented in the
related Loan Documents, substantially to the effect that it does not have any assets other than those related to its interest in
and operation of such Mortgaged Property or Properties, or any indebtedness other than as permitted by the related Mortgage(s)
or the other related Loan Documents, that it has its own books and records and accounts separate and apart from those of any other
person (other than a Borrower for a Crossed Mortgage Loan), and that it holds itself out as a legal entity, separate and apart
from any other person or entity.
 
(32)   Defeasance.
With respect to any Mortgage Loan that, pursuant to the Loan Documents, can be defeased (a “Defeasance”), (i)
the Loan Documents provide for Defeasance as a unilateral right of the Borrower, subject to satisfaction of conditions specified
in the Loan Documents; (ii) the Mortgage Loan cannot be defeased within two years after the Closing Date; (iii) the Borrower is
permitted to pledge only United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 1.860G-2(a)(8)(ii) of
the Treasury Regulations, the revenues from which will, in the case of a full Defeasance, be sufficient to make all scheduled payments
under the Mortgage Loan when due, including the entire remaining principal balance on the maturity date (or on or after the first
date on which payment may be made without payment of a yield maintenance charge or prepayment penalty) or, if the Mortgage Loan
is an ARD Loan, the entire principal balance outstanding on the Anticipated Repayment Date, and if the Mortgage Loan permits partial
releases of real property in connection with partial Defeasance, the revenues from the collateral will be sufficient to pay all
such scheduled payments calculated on a principal amount equal to a specified percentage at least equal to the lesser of (a) 110%
of the allocated loan amount for the real property to be released and (b) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan;
(iv) the Borrower is required to provide a certification from an independent certified public accountant that the collateral is
sufficient to make all scheduled payments under the Note as set forth in clause (iii) above; (v) if the Borrower would continue
to own assets in addition to the Defeasance collateral, the portion of the Mortgage Loan secured by defeasance collateral is required
to be assumed (or the mortgagee may require such assumption) by a Single-Purpose Entity; (vi) the Borrower is required to provide
an opinion of counsel that the mortgagee
 
D-12
 
 
has a perfected security interest in such collateral prior to any other claim or interest;
and (vii) the Borrower is required to pay all rating agency fees associated with Defeasance (if rating confirmation is a specific
condition precedent thereto) and all other reasonable expenses associated with Defeasance, including, but not limited to, accountant’s
fees and opinions of counsel.
 
(33)        Fixed
Interest Rates. Each Mortgage Loan bears interest at a rate that remains fixed throughout the remaining term of such Mortgage
Loan, except in the case of ARD Loans and situations where default interest is imposed.
 
(34)        Ground
Leases. For purposes of this Agreement, a “Ground Lease” shall mean a lease creating a leasehold estate in real
property where the fee owner as the ground lessor conveys for a term or terms of years its entire interest in the land, or with
respect to air rights leases, the air, and buildings and other improvements, if any, comprising the premises demised under such
lease to the ground lessee (who may, in certain circumstances, own the building and improvements on the land), subject to the reversionary
interest of the ground lessor as fee owner and does not include industrial development agency (IDA) or similar leases for purposes
of conferring a tax abatement or other benefit.
 
With respect to any
Mortgage Loan where the Mortgage Loan is secured by a leasehold estate under a Ground Lease in whole or in part, and the related
Mortgage does not also encumber the related lessor’s fee interest in such Mortgaged Property, based upon the terms of the
Ground Lease and any estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor in favor of Seller, its successors and assigns,
Seller represents and warrants that:
 
(a)          The
Ground Lease or a memorandum regarding such Ground Lease has been duly recorded or submitted for recordation in a form that is
acceptable for recording in the applicable jurisdiction. The Ground Lease or an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground
lessor permits the interest of the lessee to be encumbered by the related Mortgage and does not restrict the use of the related
Mortgaged Property by such lessee, its successors or assigns in a manner that would materially adversely affect the security provided
by the related Mortgage;
 
(b)          The
lessor under such Ground Lease has agreed in a writing included in the related Mortgage File (or in such Ground Lease) that the
Ground Lease may not be amended or modified, or canceled or terminated by agreement of lessor and lessee, without the prior written
consent of the lender, and no such consent has been granted by the Seller since the origination of the Mortgage Loan except as
reflected in any written instruments which are included in the related Mortgage File;
 
(c)          The
Ground Lease has an original term (or an original term plus one or more optional renewal terms, which, under all circumstances,
may be exercised, and will be enforceable, by either Borrower or the mortgagee) that extends not less than 20 years beyond the
stated maturity of the related Mortgage Loan, or 10 years past the stated
 
D-13
 
 
maturity if such Mortgage Loan fully amortizes by the
stated maturity (or with respect to a Mortgage Loan that accrues on an actual 360 basis, substantially amortizes);
 
(d)          The
Ground Lease either (i) is not subject to any liens or encumbrances superior to, or of equal priority with, the Mortgage, except
for the related fee interest of the ground lessor and the Permitted Encumbrances, or (ii) is subject to a subordination, non-disturbance
and attornment agreement to which the mortgagee on the lessor’s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property is subject;
 
(e)          The
Ground Lease does not place commercially unreasonable restrictions on the identity of the Mortgagee and the Ground Lease is assignable
to the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent of the lessor thereunder, and in the event
it is so assigned, it is further assignable by the holder of the Mortgage Loan and its successors and assigns without the consent
of the lessor;
 
(f)          The
Seller has not received any written notice of material default under or notice of termination of such Ground Lease. To the Seller’s
knowledge, there is no material default under such Ground Lease and no condition that, but for the passage of time or giving of
notice, would result in a material default under the terms of such Ground Lease and to the Seller’s knowledge, such Ground
Lease is in full force and effect as of the Closing Date;
 
(g)         The
Ground Lease or ancillary agreement between the lessor and the lessee requires the lessor to give to the lender written notice
of any default, and provides that no notice of default or termination is effective against the lender unless such notice is given
to the lender;
 
(h)         A
lender is permitted a reasonable opportunity (including, where necessary, sufficient time to gain possession of the interest of
the lessee under the Ground Lease through legal proceedings) to cure any default under the Ground Lease which is curable after
the lender’s receipt of notice of any default before the lessor may terminate the Ground Lease;
 
(i)           The
Ground Lease does not impose any restrictions on subletting that would be viewed as commercially unreasonable by the Seller in
connection with loans originated for securitization;
 
(j)           Under
the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement received from the ground lessor and the related Mortgage (taken together),
any related insurance proceeds or the portion of the condemnation award allocable to the ground lessee’s interest (other
than (i) de minimis amounts for minor casualties or (ii) in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking as addressed
in clause (k) below) will be applied either to the repair or to restoration of all or part of the related Mortgaged Property with
(so long as such proceeds are in excess of the threshold amount specified in the related Loan Documents) the lender or a trustee
appointed by it having the right to hold and disburse such proceeds as repair or
 
D-14
 
 
restoration progresses, or to the payment of the
outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together with any accrued interest;
 
(k)          In
the case of a total or substantially total taking or loss, under the terms of the Ground Lease, an estoppel or other agreement
and the related Mortgage (taken together), any related insurance proceeds, or portion of the condemnation award allocable to ground
lessee’s interest in respect of a total or substantially total loss or taking of the related Mortgaged Property to the extent
not applied to restoration, will be applied first to the payment of the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, together
with any accrued interest; and
 
(l)           Provided
that the lender cures any defaults which are susceptible to being cured, the ground lessor has agreed to enter into a new lease
with lender upon termination of the Ground Lease for any reason, including rejection of the Ground Lease in a bankruptcy proceeding.
 
(35)        Servicing.
The servicing and collection practices used by the Seller with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been, in all respects, legal and
have met customary industry standards for servicing of commercial loans for conduit loan programs.
 
(36)        Origination
and Underwriting. The origination practices of the Seller (or the related originator if the Seller was not the originator)
with respect to each Mortgage Loan have been, in all material respects, legal and as of the date of its origination, such Mortgage
Loan and the origination thereof complied in all material respects with, or was exempt from, all requirements of federal, state
or local law relating to the origination of such Mortgage Loan; provided that such representation and warranty does not address
or otherwise cover any matters with respect to federal, state or local law otherwise covered in this Exhibit D.
 
(37)        No
Material Default; Payment Record. No Mortgage Loan has been more than 30 days delinquent, without giving effect to any grace
or cure period, in making required payments since origination, and as of the date hereof, no Mortgage Loan is more than 30 days
delinquent (beyond any applicable grace or cure period) in making required payments as of the Closing Date. To the Seller’s
knowledge, there is (a) no material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration existing under the related Mortgage Loan,
or (b) no event (other than payments due but not yet delinquent) which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration
of any grace or cure period, would constitute a material default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, which default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration, in the case of either clause (a) or clause (b), materially and adversely affects the value
of the Mortgage Loan or the value, use or operation of the related Mortgaged Property, provided, however, that this representation
and warranty does not cover any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration that specifically pertains to or arises out
of an exception scheduled to any other representation and warranty made by the Seller in this Exhibit D. No person other than the
holder of such Mortgage Loan may declare any event of default under the Mortgage Loan or accelerate any indebtedness under the
Loan Documents.
 
D-15
 
 
(38)          Bankruptcy.
As of the date of origination of the related Mortgage Loan and to the Seller’s knowledge as of the Cut-off Date, no Borrower,
guarantor or tenant occupying a single-tenant property is a debtor in state or federal bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding.
 
(39)          Organization
of Borrower. With respect to each Mortgage Loan, in reliance on certified copies of the organizational documents of the Borrower
delivered by the Borrower in connection with the origination of such Mortgage Loan, the Borrower is an entity organized under the
laws of a state of the United States of America, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Except with respect
to any Crossed Mortgage Loan, no Mortgage Loan has a Borrower that is an Affiliate of another Borrower. (An “Affiliate”
for purposes of this paragraph (39) means, a Borrower that is under direct or indirect common ownership and control with another
Borrower.)
 
(40)          Environmental
Conditions. A Phase I environmental site assessment (or update of a previous Phase I and or Phase II site assessment) and,
with respect to certain Mortgage Loans, a Phase II environmental site assessment (collectively, an “ESA”) meeting
ASTM requirements conducted by a reputable environmental consultant in connection with such Mortgage Loan within 12 months prior
to its origination date (or an update of a previous ESA was prepared), and such ESA either (i) did not identify the existence of
recognized environmental conditions (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its successor, hereinafter “Environmental
Condition”) at the related Mortgaged Property or the need for further investigation with respect to any Environmental
Condition that was identified, or (ii) if the existence of an Environmental Condition or need for further investigation was indicated
in any such ESA, then at least one of the following statements is true: (A) an amount reasonably estimated by a reputable environmental
consultant to be sufficient to cover the estimated cost to cure any material noncompliance with applicable environmental laws or
the Environmental Condition has been escrowed by the related Borrower and is held or controlled by the related lender; (B) if the
only Environmental Condition relates to the presence of asbestos-containing materials, radon in indoor air, lead based paint or
lead in drinking water, and the only recommended action in the ESA is the institution of such a plan, an operations or maintenance
plan has been required to be instituted by the related Borrower that can reasonably be expected to mitigate the identified risk;
(C) the Environmental Condition identified in the related environmental report was remediated or abated in all material respects
prior to the date hereof, and, if and as appropriate, a no further action or closure letter was obtained from the applicable governmental
regulatory authority (or the Environmental Condition affecting the related Mortgaged Property was otherwise listed by such governmental
authority as “closed” or a reputable environmental consultant has concluded that no further action is required); (D)
a secured creditor environmental policy or a pollution legal liability insurance policy that covers liability for the Environmental
Condition was obtained from an insurer rated no less than A- (or the equivalent) by Moody’s, S&P and/or Fitch; (E) a
party not related to the Borrower was identified as the responsible party for such Environmental Condition and such responsible
party has financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation; or (F) a party related to the Borrower
having financial resources reasonably estimated to be adequate to address the situation is required to take action. To Seller’s
knowledge, except as set forth in the ESA, there is no Environmental Condition (as such term is defined in ASTM E1527-05 or its
successor) at the related Mortgaged Property.
 
D-16
 
 
(41)          Appraisal.
The Servicing File contains an appraisal of the related Mortgaged Property with an appraisal date within 6 months of the Mortgage
Loan origination date, and within 12 months of the Closing Date. The appraisal is signed by an appraiser who is either a Member
of the Appraisal Institute (“MAI”) and/or has been licensed and certified to prepare appraisals in the state
where the Mortgaged Property is located. Each appraiser has represented in such appraisal or in a supplemental letter that the
appraisal satisfies the requirements of the “Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice” as adopted by the
Appraisal Standards Board of the Appraisal Foundation and has certified that such appraiser had no interest, direct or indirect,
in the Mortgaged Property or the Borrower or in any loan made on the security thereof, and its compensation is not affected by
the approval or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan.
 
(42)          Mortgage
Loan Schedule. The information pertaining to each Mortgage Loan which is set forth in the mortgage loan schedule attached as
Exhibit A to this Agreement is true and correct in all material respects as of the Cut-off Date and contains all information required
by this Agreement to be contained therein.
 
(43)          Cross-Collateralization.
No Mortgage Loan is cross-collateralized or cross-defaulted with any mortgage loan that is outside the Trust.
 
(44)          Advance
of Funds by the Seller. After origination, no advance of funds has been made by Seller to the related Borrower other than in
accordance with the Loan Documents, and, to Seller’s knowledge, no funds have been received from any person other than the
related Borrower or an affiliate for, or on account of, payments due on the Mortgage Loan (other than as contemplated by the Loan
Documents, such as, by way of example and not in limitation of the foregoing, amounts paid by the tenant(s) into a lender-controlled
lockbox if required or contemplated under the related lease or Loan Documents). Neither Seller nor any affiliate thereof has any
obligation to make any capital contribution to any Borrower under a Mortgage Loan, other than contributions made on or prior to
the date hereof.
 
(45)          Compliance
with Anti-Money Laundering Laws. Seller has complied in all material respects with all applicable anti-money laundering laws
and regulations, including without limitation the USA Patriot Act of 2001 with respect to the origination of the Mortgage Loan,
the failure to comply with which would have a material adverse effect on the Mortgage Loan.
 
For purposes of these representations and warranties, the phrases
“the Seller’s knowledge” or “the Seller’s belief” and other words and phrases
of like import shall mean, except where otherwise expressly set forth herein, the actual state of knowledge or belief of the Seller,
its officers and employees directly responsible for the underwriting, origination, servicing or sale of the Mortgage Loans regarding
the matters expressly set forth herein.

Most Influential Technology BlogsWhat Is Java DevOps?By Stackify BlogDevOps sees the coming together of practices, philosophies, and tools that allow you to create services and applications very quickly. This means that you can improve on your apps and evolve them at a much faster rate than those developers who are using traditional software development processes.

While the affected individuals and organizations are struggling with the very tangible business impact of the loss of revenue and operations, it’s critical to step back and review what else one could do to mitigate and minimize the damage from such attacks in...Jul. 27, 2017 12:00 PM EDT  Reads: 625How Does Big Data Affect IP Rights?By Larry AltonPatents are a good step towards shielding your IP data, but they’re not a seamless solution. Legal protection regarding intellectual property isn’t definite and has some holes in it. The constant stream of big data has made this problem even worse, obscuring the specifics about original ownership.
Data comes in streams from all over the world. Companies have more information about consumers and t...Jul. 27, 2017 11:26 AM EDT  Reads: 154Low-Code Platforms in the Era of AutomationBy Karthick ViswanathanFrom manual human effort the world is slowly paving its way to a new space where most process are getting replaced with tools and systems to improve efficiency and bring down operational costs.

Although competitive decision-making is not yet an Olympic sport, it affects us all.  Leaders (people) must become trained experts at using digital technologies to make fast decisions.  Leaders must use the right strategies and methodologies (ideas) to make ...Jul. 27, 2017 10:15 AM EDT  Reads: 399American Airlines Adopts Public Cloud ComputingBy Kevin JacksonDid you know that the reservations systems of the biggest carriers mostly run on a specialized IBM operating system known as Transaction Processing Facility (TPF). Designed by IBM in the 1960’s it was designed to process a large numbers of transactions quickly. Although IBM is still updating the code, the last major rewrite was about ten years ago.

This is a topic with which business leaders must become comfortable, especially tomorrow’s business leaders (tip for my next semester University of San Francisco business students!). Machine learning is a key capability that...Jul. 27, 2017 09:45 AM EDT  Reads: 486Benefits of Building a Truly Agile TeamBy Automic BlogSince the emergence of the Agile Manifesto back in 2001, agile quickly established itself as the prevalent software development methodology.

By Automic BlogWith continuous delivery (CD) almost always in the spotlight, continuous integration (CI) is often left out in the cold. Indeed, it's been in use for so long and so widely, we often take the model for granted. So what is CI and how can you make the most of it? This blog is intended to answer those questions.
Before we step into examining CI, we need to look back. Software developers often work in...Jul. 27, 2017 08:00 AM EDT  Reads: 373Brain Change and Digital StrategiesBy Kevin BenedictThe renowned military strategist John Boyd taught that people and institutions collect favorite philosophies, strategies, theories and ideologies over a period of time, and then try to align the future to fit them.  The problem with this is the future is rarely like the past, and trying to fit new data into old paradigms often forces us to perform irrational mental gymnastics, which leaves us fart...Jul. 27, 2017 08:00 AM EDT  Reads: 434Managing Your Hybrid CloudBy Kevin JacksonRunaway cloud computing cost may be causing an information technology industry crisis.

 All the World’s a Cloud
        All of Cloud Is at Cloud Expo!

 Cloud Computing - Big Data | Analytics - Internet of Things 
          Containers - Microservices - WebRTC - DevOps 


Join Us at the Javits Center in New York, NY, June 6-8 

          Cloud computing software is eating the world, and each day is bringing new developments in this world. 

          Yesterday's debate about public vs. private has transformed into the reality of hybrid cloud: a recent survey shows that 74% of enterprises have a hybrid cloud strategy. 

          Meanwhile, 94% of enterprises are using some form of XaaS – software, platform, and Infrastructure as a Service.

          Big Data | Analytics and the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) are driving exponentially increased demands on datacenters and developers alike, as we cross the zettabyte horizon this year.

          Containers and microservices are now part of every PaaS conversation, and IaaS providers are increasingly competing for platform customers. 

          WebRTC continues to reform web communications, and DevOps is pushing its way into an enterprise IT world that is increasingly agile, lean, and continuous.

          Through all this, Cloud Expo remains the single independent event where delegates and technology vendors can meet to experience and discuss the entire world of the cloud.

        Only Cloud Expo brings together all this in a single location: 
        
          •	Cloud Computing
            •	Big Data | Analytics
            •	Internet of Things
            •	Containers | Microservices
            •	WebRTC
            •	DevOps


        Cloud computing budgets worldwide are reaching into the hundreds of billions of dollars, and no organization can survive long without some sort of cloud migration strategy. Each month brings new announcements, use cases, and success stories. 

          Cloud Expo offers the world's most comprehensive selection of technical and strategic Industry Keynotes, General Sessions, Breakout Sessions, and signature Power Panels. The exhibition floor features 100+ exhibitors offering specific solutions and comprehensive strategies. 

          The floor also features a Demo Theater that give delegates the opportunity to get even closer to the technology they want to see and the people who offer it. 

          Attend Cloud Expo. Create your own custom experience. Learn the latest from the world's best technologists. Talk to the vendors you are considering, and put them to the test.

          See you in New York!

Cl. X-A, Affirmed Aa1 (sf); previously on Jul

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The rating on the IO class was affirmed based on the credit quality of 
the referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.6% 
of the current balance, compared to 5.4% at Moody's 
last review. Moody's base expected loss plus realized losses is 
now 4.5% of the original pooled balance, compared 
to 5.3% at the last review. Moody's provides 
a current list of base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions 
on moodys.com at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
(IO) Securities" published in June 2017. Please see the Rating 
Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this 
methodology.




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the June 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 1.5% to $1.37 
billion from $1.39 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 81 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 8.2% of the pool, with the 
top ten loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 50.6% 
of the pool. One loan, constituting 8.2% of 
the pool, has an investment-grade structured credit assessment.




Two loans, constituting 7.3% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full year 2015 operating results for 100% of the 
pool, and full or partial year 2016 operating results for 99% 
of the pool (excluding specially serviced and defeased loans). 
Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 117%, compared 
to 116% at Moody's last review. Moody's conduit 
component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased 
and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 15% to the most recently available net operating income (NOI). 
Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 
9.9%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.53X and 0.93X, 
respectively, compared to 1.54X and 0.93X at the last 
review. Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF 
and the loan's actual debt service. Moody's stressed 
DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and a 9.25% stress rate 
the agency applied to the loan balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Lakewood Center Loan 
($112 million -- 8.2% of the pool), 
which is secured by a super-regional mall located approximately 
20 miles south of downtown Los Angeles in Lakewood, California. 
The total property consists of approximatley 2.1 million square 
feet (SF). The property includes a 1.4 million SF enclosed 
mall with four anchors. The anchor tenants include Target, 
J.C, Penney, Macy's and Forever 21. In addition 
to the mall, the collateral includes free standing big boxes, 
pads and an outparcel strip center. Major tenants outside the enclosed 
mall component include Costco, Home Depot, Albertsons, 
Nordstrom Rack and Best Buy among others. As of December 2016, 
the property was approximately 96% leased. In March 2017, 
the property reported trailing twelve month in-line tenants sales 
of $331 PSF. The loan is componentized into two pari passu 
senior notes totaling $240 million and two pari passu subordinated 
notes totaling $170 million. The non-controlling 
senior Note A-1 is contributed to this trust. Moody's structured 
credit assessment and stressed DSCR are a1(sca.pd) and 1.54X, 
respectively, compared to a1(sca.pd) and 1.49X at 
last review.




The top three conduit loans represent 19% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Eden Roc Loan ($95 million -- 6.9% 
of the pool), which is secured by a 631-room, full-service 
hotel situated along Collins Avenue in Miami Beach, Florida. 
The property is divided into two towers. The 14-story, 
349-room, Historic Tower was built in 1956. The Tower 
underwent a $111 million renovation in 2008. The 21-story, 
282-room Ocean Tower was constructed from 2006 to 2008 for approximately 
$95 million. In 2014, Eden Roc and Nobu Hospitality 
entered into an agreement to rebrand a portion of the Historic Tower as 
the "Nobu Hotel" and overhaul the hotel's food and beverage programs. 
Approximately $36 million was budgeted for renovations at securitization; 
renovations are scheduled to be completed in August 2017. Moody's 
LTV and stressed DSCR are 127% and 0.91X, respectively, 
the same as at last review.




The second largest loan is the Heartland Industrial Portfolio Loan ($95 
million -- 6.9% of the pool), which is secured 
by a portfolio of 22 Class-A warehouses and distribution facilities. 
The properties are located in the Mid-South regional markets spanning 
across IN, IL, KY, TN, NC, SC and OH. 
As of March 2017, the portfolio was 94% leased to 29 tenants. 
On average, the properties are about 19-years old as they 
were developed between 1992 and 2004. The average facility is 304,000 
SF. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 124% and 0.80X, 
respectively, the same as at last review.




The third largest loan is the Palazzo Verdi Loan ($73.5 
million -- 5.4% of the pool), which is secured 
by two of five condominium units that comprise a 15-story, 
Class-A office building located in Greenwood Village, Colorado. 
The property contains approximately 302,000 SF of office space that 
is fully occupied by three tenants as of March 2017. Newmont Mining 
occupies approximately 72% of the net rentable area (NRA). 
The property was developed in 2008 and is LEED Gold certified. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 124% and 0.85X, 
respectively, the same as at last review.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their 
credit ratings from the support provider's credit rating. 
For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.






Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody’s Corporation (“MCO”), hereby discloses that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from $1,500 to approximately $2,500,000. MCO and MIS also maintain policies and procedures to address the independence of MIS’s ratings and rating processes. Information regarding certain affiliations that may exist between directors of MCO and rated entities, and between entities who hold ratings from MIS and have also publicly reported to the SEC an ownership interest in MCO of more than 5%, is posted annually at www.moodys.com under the heading “Investor Relations — Corporate Governance — Director and Shareholder Affiliation Policy.” Additional terms for Australia only: Any publication into Australia of this document is pursuant to the Australian Financial Services License of MOODY’S affiliate, Moody’s Investors Service Pty Limited ABN 61 003 399 657AFSL 336969 and/or Moody’s Analytics Australia Pty Ltd ABN 94 105 136 972 AFSL 383569 (as applicable). This document is intended to be provided only to “wholesale clients” within the meaning of section 761G of the Corporations Act 2001.

MOODY’S credit rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a debt obligation of the issuer, not on the equity securities of the issuer or any form of security that is available to retail investors.

(“MJKK”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of Moody's Group Japan G.K., which is wholly-owned by Moody’s Overseas Holdings Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of MCO. Moody’s SF Japan K.K. (“MSFJ”) is a wholly-owned credit rating agency subsidiary of MJKK. MSFJ is not a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). Therefore, credit ratings assigned by MSFJ are Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings. Non-NRSRO Credit Ratings are assigned by an entity that is not a NRSRO and, consequently, the rated obligation will not qualify for certain types of treatment under U.S. laws. MJKK and MSFJ are credit rating agencies registered with the Japan Financial Services Agency and their registration numbers are FSA Commissioner (Ratings) No. 2 and 3 respectively. MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) hereby disclose that most issuers of debt securities (including corporate and municipal bonds, debentures, notes and commercial paper) and preferred stock rated by MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) have, prior to assignment of any rating, agreed to pay to MJKK or MSFJ (as applicable) for appraisal and rating services rendered by it fees ranging from JPY200,000 to approximately JPY350,000,000.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
