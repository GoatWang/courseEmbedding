Two Redheads and a Wolf expands to new salon

By Rebecca Mariscal
 on Mar 20, 2017  at 3:00 p.m.





Two Redheads and a Wolf stylist Cayla Rouleau, owner Tasia Ashton and stylist Megan Lundgren work out of the new salon in Hudson. Ashton started the product company several years ago and now hosts independent stylists at the new salon. (photo by Rebecca Mariscal)After launching her own hair product line in 2013, Hudson stylist Tasia Ashton is continuing to grow her business Two Redheads and a Wolf with a new salon at 596 Outpost Circle in Hudson.

 
Four years ago, while she owned another salon, Ashton was searching for a better alternative to hair care products."I think things can be more natural than this. I think they can be more simple," she said.The search prompted her to make her own shampoo bars with natural ingredients in sustainable packaging. The products quickly became popular, leading her to sell the salon and launch the Two Redheads business. Since then, the business has continued to expand, outgrowing the home-based, one-room salon she previously ran."My house was totally taken over," Ashton said.Now, the products are manufactured in facilities in Colorado and Oregon, with Ashton doing the development and packaging from the newly opened salon in Hudson."It's all in one place instead of all over my house," she said.The salon is a unique take on the business that's becoming more popular. At Two Redheads, independent stylists rent chairs from Ashton but are not her employees.This setup gives Ashton the camaraderie she often missed while running her product line, without the other details of employees."I was missing having a culture," Ashton said. "I missed having a salon too, having a team and being with people."It also allows Ashton to support local stylists and their businesses. Hudson locals Cayla Rouleau and Megan Lundgren are two of the stylists that work out of Two Redheads.Rouleau said she enjoys the culture that the salon provides, while still allowing her to control her own work."I like the creative freedom and the pressure because you screw up, you screw up," she said. "You can make yourself as successful as you want."Lundgren said the salon provides a unique opportunity for her to have a team while remaining independent, and provides a unique experience to customers as well."We offer something that's not around here. Everything from the independent salon but still team factor to the art on the walls to her building her own line," Lundgren said.Ashton said the salon still has three openings for independent stylists.As the salon gets up and running and the product line continues to grow, Ashton said she's proud looking back at how it has all developed."It's been very grassroots and organic," she said. "It hasn't just been bam, we're huge. It's gotten to grow in baby steps. So it doesn't feel overwhelming. It doesn't feel stressful."

Her success comes from persistency and passion."You gotta just keep at it," Ashton said. "Success and failure, neither one of them happen over night."All of the Two Redheads and a Wolf products are sold in the new salon, at about 20 different local retailers and are also available online at www.tworedheadsandawolf.com.Additional Articles Recommended by Hudson Star ObserverNew Richmond girl, 14, charged with attempted homicide

              by: 
              




  Joe Wilhelm Jr.







Ashton Hudson looks forward to developments in his personal and professional lives.Hudson, 39, is the new board chairman of the JEA, the city’s utility, while it searches for its seventh chief executive. Jim Dickenson, the managing director and CEO, will retire in 2013.“I was very excited to get the opportunity to be a part of JEA. It is a unique City asset that is a multibillion dollar business and it provides nearly a third of the City’s operating budget,” said Hudson.The board also is addressing a generational issue because a large group of employees will reach retirement age soon.“We are going through a transition that will have a generational impact as we look for a new CEO and select Jim Dickenson’s replacement,” he said.“We also have focus on workforce readiness to make sure we have adequate staffing to meet the needs of our customers. It will be a challenge that this board has to grapple with over the coming years,” he said.He recognizes that the board has to replenish the workforce at a time when pensions and salaries are being reduced or restructured because of government budget challenges.“We’ve got to find a way to keep salaries competitive within the industry or we are going to lose some good talent to the private sector,” said Hudson.Hudson also will work with three new board members. Charlie Appleby was recently appointed and Lisa Strange Weatherby and Walt Bussells await City Council approval.Hudson acknowledged there was a lot to learn when he joined the board in 2006.“It’s a very complex business. There is a lot to the electric utility and a lot to the water and sewer business. When you marry the two under one utility, there is a tremendous number of moving parts,” said Hudson.“There is a lot for new members to understand before they start to comprehend what is happening. It’s a steep learning curve, but the management team does a great job of getting us up to speed,” he said.Hudson said he believes he was chosen by former Mayor John Peyton for a seat on the board because of his business background and said Peyton was looking for candidates that were pro-business.Hudson is the president and general counsel for Jacksonville-based Rock Creek Capital, an asset manager.The company invests primarily in land, mainly in the Southeast and Mountain States, for its clients, but it also invests in operating businesses, such as Advanced Disposal, Turner Pest Control and AccuStaff.“Investments in land are very stable and they are attractive to the institutional investor,” said Hudson. “On a risk-adjusted basis, land produces very attractive returns.”His duties involve oversight of the counsel hired by the firm to handle its legal matters. Hudson is licensed to practice law in Georgia, but he is allowed to represent Rock Creek Capital as an authorized house counsel, defined by the Florida Bar as a person licensed to practice outside the state and certified by the state Supreme Court to provide limited legal services in Florida while exclusively employed by a business organization located in Florida.“I practice just enough law to be dangerous,” Hudson quipped. “I prefer the business side.”On the personal side, Hudson and his wife, Mandy, are expecting a baby boy in August.[email protected]356-2466
