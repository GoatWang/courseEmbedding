Pooling and Servicing Agreement incorporated by reference as Exhibit 4 to this

servicing criterion set forth in Item 1122(d).                                  

The assessment of compliance with applicable servicing criteria for the twelve  
months ended December 31, 2013, furnished pursuant to Item 1122 of Regulation AB
by  KeyBank National Association (the "2013 KeyBank Assessment") for its        
commercial real estate mortgage loans platform, discloses that material         
instances of noncompliance occurred with respect to the servicing criteria      
described in Items 1122(d)(4)(i) and 1122(d)(4)(x)(c) of Regulation AB. The 2013
KeyBank Assessment is attached to this Form 10-K as Exhibit 33.1. The material  
instances of noncompliance disclosed in the 2013 KeyBank Assessment are as      
follows:                                                                        

1) KeyBank National Association ("KeyBank") has identified the following        
material instances of noncompliance with servicing criteria 1122(d)(4)(i) and   
1122(d)(4)(x)(c)applicable to the commercial loans securitized during the year  
ended December 31, 2013, as follows:                                            

i) 1122(d)(4)(i) Collateral or security on pool assets is maintained as         
required by the transaction agreements or related pool asset documents.         

ii) 1122(d)(4)(x)(c)-Regarding any funds held in trust for an obligor (such as  
escrow accounts): such funds are returned to the obligor within 30 calendar days
of full repayment of the related pool asset, or such other number of days       
specified in the transaction agreements.                                        

2) KeyBank has implemented the following remediation procedures:                

i) 1122(d)(4)(i)- Regarding UCC filings, it was discovered, upon transfer of the
servicing to KeyBank from the previous servicer, that two loans did not have    
appropriate UCC filings originally filed or continued. The loans have since been
corrected, and KeyBank determined that no liens were filed in front of the UCC  
filing. All loans, for which servicing was transferred to KeyBank during 2013,  
have been reviewed, and, the filings are being maintained in accordance         
with the transaction agreements.                                                

ii) 1122(d)(4)(x)(c)- Escrow funds were not returned to the obligor within 30   
calendar days of repayment. Appropriate steps have been taken, including monthly
status meetings, meeting minutes, and revised procedures to insure that the     
refund of escrows occurs within 30 calendar days of full repayment.

John McCain, R-Ariz., joined two other Republican holdouts and all the Democrats to vote against the measure. McCain stunned several of his fellow Republican senators when he walked onto the Senate floor after midnight and appeared to inform Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, that he couldn’t vote for the “skinny repeal” bill. Just a few days earlier, McCain flew back to the Capitol from Arizona after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer to cast the deciding vote to begin debating it.John McCain statement in full explaining why he killed Donald Trump's 'skinny' healthcare repeal billThe IndependentWatch: Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'WKYC Cleveland9,042Reactions.

John McCain, R-Ariz., joined two other Republican holdouts and all the Democrats to vote against the measure. McCain stunned several of his fellow Republican senators when he walked onto the Senate floor after midnight and appeared to inform Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, that he couldn’t vote for the “skinny repeal” bill. Just a few days earlier, McCain flew back to the Capitol from Arizona after being diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer to cast the deciding vote to begin debating it.John McCain statement in full explaining why he killed Donald Trump's 'skinny' healthcare repeal billThe IndependentWatch: Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'WKYC Cleveland9,042Reactions.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
