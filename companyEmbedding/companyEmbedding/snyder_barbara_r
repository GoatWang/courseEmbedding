Biography[edit]
Barbara Snyder earned a bachelor's degree in sociology from The Ohio State University and a law degree from the University of Chicago.[2] Before Snyder became president of CWRU in July 2007, she was formerly the executive vice president and provost of The Ohio State University.[2] During Snyder's tenure as the university president, CWRU has overcome a $20 million budget deficit, increased fundraising by nearly $60 million, and increased research dollars by more than $15 million.[3]
Following the announcement that Gordon Gee would retire as President of the Ohio State University effective July 1, 2013, speculation arose that Snyder, the former Provost and Executive Vice President of Ohio State, could succeed Gee. In response, Snyder said, "I am proud to be president of Case Western Reserve and intend to continue in this role for many years to come."[4]
Compensation[edit]
In 2011, Cleveland.com reported Barbara R. Snyder's total compensation for the year of 2009 was $778,874.[5]

Barbara R. Snyder: A Short Biography

Barbara R. Snyder became president of Case Western Reserve University on July 1, 2007. A legal scholar who began her academic career on this campus, she returned with a promise to work collaboratively with all constituencies to help the university realize more of its enormous potential. 
In Snyder's first two years in office, Case Western Reserve eliminated a multi-million-dollar deficit three years ahead of schedule, set new fundraising records, and completed its first strategic plan in more than a decade. That plan, Forward Thinking, calls on the university to build on existing strengths through interdisciplinary partnerships. It also urges development of a community culture that nurtures the inherent possibility of all of its members—one that is welcoming, inclusive, and committed to transparency and integrity.
As part of initiatives related to the strategic plan, President Snyder in 2008 appointed the university's inaugural Vice President for Inclusion, Diversity and Equal Opportunity, Marilyn S. Mobley, Ph.D.  She also led the overhaul of the university's Conflict of Interest policy, along with the revision and web publication of its business policies.
Snyder assumed the Case Western Reserve presidency after serving as Executive Vice President and Provost of The Ohio State University. Over a four-year period (the first year as interim provost), Snyder took steps to raise OSU's academic stature and improve the quality of life for members of its community. Her initiatives included the Targeted Investments in Education program, which devoted  $50 million to support 10 innovative proposals in high-impact areas.  Awards ranged from less than $500,000 to more than $11 million, and touched on programs involving Climate, Water and Carbon, Mathematical Biosciences and Music, Media and Enterprise. She championed improved benefits for graduate students, and paid parental leave for faculty, staff and graduate students. 
Prior to becoming provost, Snyder served as Vice Provost for Academic Policy and Human Resources and spent seven months as the university's Interim Vice President for University Relations. Her service at Ohio State included serving on the University Promotion and Tenure Committee, chairing the university Athletic Council, and twice serving on the NCAA Certification Committee.
As a professor at OSU's Moritz College of Law, she also served as Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and as Director of the Center for Socio-Legal Studies. In 1997, the school's third-year students voted to give Snyder the College of Law Outstanding Professor Award.  She held the Joanne W. Murphy / Classes of 1965 and 1973 Professorship.
Snyder joined OSU's Moritz College of Law in 1988, after spending five years as a professor at Case Western Reserve's School of Law. She joined CWRU after serving as an associate at the Sidley & Austin law firm in Chicago. She graduated from the University of Chicago Law School, where she served as executive editor of its law review, and earned her bachelor's degree from Ohio State. 
Her husband is Michael J. Snyder, who earned his Master's in Business Administration from the Weatherhead School of Management. They have three adult children.

President Barbara R. Snyder
Barbara R. Snyder became president of Case Western Reserve University in 2007. Since her arrival, Snyder has encouraged interdisciplinary excellence, catalyzed institutional collaboration and reinvigorated alumni engagement and fundraising. 
During her tenure, the university has tripled undergraduate applications, become twice as selective and dramatically improved the academic credentials of the entering class. Case Western Reserve reached the $1 billion goal of Forward Thinking, the university’s capital campaign, two-and-a-half years ahead of schedule. The Board of Trustees unanimously agreed to expand the campaign to $1.5 billion. Among the highlights of the university’s capital campaign are dramatic increases in the number of endowed professorships and student support, as well as additional new building projects. In 2014, the university opened the $50 million, 89,000-square-foot Tinkham Veale University Center, as well as the 24,000-square-foot Wyant Athletic and Wellness Center. It also began renovations on the space that will be the new home for think[box], a $30 million, 55,000-square-foot innovation hub.
In 2013, Case Western Reserve entered into a historic partnership with Cleveland Clinic to develop a 485,000-square-foot Health Education Campus including the university’s schools of medicine, nursing and dental medicine. In addition to the university’s collaboration with Cleveland Clinic, Case Western Reserve is also engaged in a partnership with the Cleveland Museum of Art to establish a globally recognized institute dedicated to innovative education and training of future curators in the history of art and its practice in art museums.  And, we recently announced an initiative with Cuyahoga Community College to support a humanities pipeline program to develop a targeted and robust pathway for students to pursue a terminal degree in the humanities, which builds on our earlier STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) pipeline programs.
Snyder began her academic career as an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve’s School of Law, then joined the faculty of Moritz College of Law at The Ohio State University. After serving in several leadership positions at Moritz and within the central university, Snyder became OSU’s Interim Executive Vice President and Provost in 2003 before securing the permanent position the following year. She graduated from the University of Chicago School of Law, where she served as executive editor of its law review, and earned her bachelor’s degree from Ohio State.

Office of the President


Welcome to Case Western Reserve University.
Welcome to Case Western Reserve University. We are:

one of the country's nine trendiest colleges;
among 15 where "geek is chic"; and 
ranked 7th nationally for contributing to the common good.

Most of all, we are a community committed to increasing knowledge and deepening understanding. Faculty and student, staff and alumni — we all come together here with a shared sense of mission: to improve the lives of others through research, education, and creative endeavors. 
I have had the privilege to lead this institution since 2007. In that time we have witnessed extraordinary progress. Our undergraduate applications have doubled. Our fundraising has climbed by more than 85 percent. And our faculty have advanced interdisciplinary efforts in areas as diverse as advanced materials and ethics, creative arts and energy innovation. 
Whatever your primary reason for visiting our website today, I hope you will take a few moments to explore our online home. From groundbreaking discoveries to athletic excellence, from innovative teaching to ingenious learning opportunities, Case Western Reserve is a place where we "think beyond the possible" every single day.

Sincerely,Barbara R. SnyderPresident

During her tenure, the university has set all-time records for annual fundraising and total donors,
doubled the number of undergraduate applicants, and significantly strengthened the academic
qualifications of entering students. In 2011 the university launched Forward Thinking, the
university's $1 billion capital campaign, with more than 60 percent of the goal raised during the
quiet phase.
Snyder assumed the Case Western Reserve presidency after serving as Executive Vice President
and Provost of The Ohio State University, and as Professor of Law at the Moritz College of Law
for 19 years. She graduated from the University of Chicago Law School, where she served as
executive editor of its law review, and earned her bachelor's degree from Ohio State.
