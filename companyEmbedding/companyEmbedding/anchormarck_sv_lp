Making Waves in Sound and Vibration
Svantek sound and vibration instruments are making big waves as they enter the North American market. Early adopters have benefitted from advanced instruments with wide capability ranges at price points less than competitor offerings.
Why are so many customers excited about Svantek products?
The Svantek design approach begins with professional users and how they put instruments to work. Product specifications and feature inclusions are designed around their requirements. During design, components are carefully selected then manufactured to strict quality specifications. The software is written to put the user in full control of their instrument and to maximize its capability. The results are precision instruments ready for use in Industry, Engineering, Safety, and Environmental measurements.

General InformationType Tankless Water Heater Product Line Commercial Medium  



Medium refers to the substance that carries heat through the heating system. Systems are either designed to use either Hot Water or Steam as a medium, and components are usually specific to one or the other.


Hot Water Fuel Type  



To create heat, some form of fuel is required. Fuel Type specifies what the product uses as an input to create heat.


Liquid Propane Combustion Type Non-Condensing Vent Type  



Products that use combustion (burning) of fuel to create heat also create potentially dangerous gasses that need to be exhausted (AKA "Vented"). Depending on the product, venting can be done via a chimney, through a side wall, or use a second vent to provide fresh air to the appliance.


Power Vent Storage Type Tankless Mount Type Wall Installation Location Indoor/Outdoor Gas Conversion Kit Not Available UPC 817000010379 Model NC380-SV-ASME-LP PerformanceFlow Rate at 70F Temperature Rise  



Flow rate measures how much hot water your heater can deliver. Click Learn More to determine the appropriate temperature rise to use based on your location. Learn More


8.9 GPMMaximum Input Capacity  



The Maximum Input Capacity describes how quickly the appliance will use fuel when delivering it's maximum capacity. The units may change depending on the fuel being used.


380000 BTUMinimum Input Capacity 22500 BTUEfficiency 80 %Efficiency Type Thermal Low NOx Emissions  



NOx is a byproduct of the combustion process, and it's output is regulated in some jurisdictions. Many regulators mirror SCAQMD rules, which regulate air quality for some parts of Southern California. Low NOx appliances emit less than 40 ng/J, or less than or equal to 55 ppm of NOx (per Rule 1146.2). Learn More
