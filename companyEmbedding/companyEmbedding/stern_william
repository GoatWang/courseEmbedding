MTB RECTANGULAR
MTB-3624

The MTB was designed to fill the need for a mop sink in a lower price range, but with good splash protection. It is normally not equipped with tiling flanges, so sealant should be applied where basin meets the wall. Flanges are available upon request. Each exposed side can be equipped with vinyl or aluminum bumper guards, OR cast integral stainless steel caps. Please see the accessories section for additional information on the bumper guards. We produce the MTB in two sizes, both of which have 3" centered brass drains cast integral and a stainless steel dome strainer and screws.


NOTE:
All dimensions subject to manufacturing variance of plus or minus 1/4" (6 mm). 10" type.

Product Details
THE CORLOW
SBC-1700 - SBC-1750

These units were developed when the need arose to more efficiently drain power-driven floor maintenance equipment. Their drop front styling allows the janitor to automatically dump waste water.

In addition, the HILOW series is also available with caps on all horizontal shoulders. Tiling flange may be added to customize any sink to meet your specifications.


NOTE:
12" corner type w/drop front.

WDA-3600 - WDA-3620


Terrazzo's natural non-slip surface provides better footing and increased safety. Wheelchair shower floors are flanged on three sides for a water tight joint between the wall and shower floor. These shower floors must be set on a level grout or mortar bed.

The intent is to allow a wheelchair patient to lift one’s self onto a transfer seat with the assistance of a grab bar. This transfer type shower floor has an integral cast 12” ramp with a stainless steel cap that covers and protects the leading 6” of the ramp. A floor drain by others at the entrance to the sloped threshold and a collapsible water dam (Option: -RDM) are recommended for added protection.

NOTE:
* Note: Flanges are intended to be used with wall tile applied by others to conform with Federal, state and local shower stall dimensions. Floors can be supplied less flanges (-LF).


Dimensions

        WDA-3600 - 39x39"
        WDA-3610 - 60x30"
