HERZLIYA, Israel, July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --








Optibase Ltd. (NASDAQ:    OBAS) (the "Company" or "Optibase") announces that its subsidiary, Eldista GmbH ("Eldista"), the owner of an office building complex in Geneva, Switzerland, known as Centre des Technologies Nouvelles ("CTN complex"), received an application for conciliation from its largest tenant in Switzerland, LEM Switzerland SA (the "LEM") pursuant to which LEM mainly demands the elimination of certain alleged defects in the CTN Complex and that LEM be authorized to carry out the works at the expense of Eldista if the works are not executed within a specific time frame as well as a 20%-reduction in rent from February 2012 and until the completion of the works.
LEM demands that Eldista be ordered to reimburse a monthly amount of CHF 47,600 as rent overpayment from February 2012 (representing the 20% reduction in rent) until (i) the completion of the works or (ii) the month of the entry into force of the judgment, whichever occurs first and that Eldista be ordered to pay an amount of approximately CHF 147,000 (subject to amplification) plus interest as of May 5, 2017 as consequential damages. LEM further demands to be reserved the right to claim the reimbursement of overpaid ancillary fees. According to the application, the dispute amounts to a total of CHF 3.54 million (approximately $ 3.68 million)
A conciliation hearing will be held on September 1, 2017 before the Commission de conciliation en matière de baux et loyers of the Canton of Geneva.
If no agreement between the parties can be reached at this hearing, LEM Switzerland SA will be granted a 30 days deadline to file its application on the merits before the Tribunal des baux et loyers of the Canton of Geneva.
At this preliminary stage, the Company cannot provide an assessment as to the chances of the application to succeed and the exposure to the Company.

HERZLIYA, Israel, May 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Optibase Ltd. (NASDAQ:    OBAS) today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Revenues from fixed income real estate totaled $4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, compared to revenues of $4 million for the first quarter of 2016. 








Net loss attributable to Optibase Ltd shareholders for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was $515,000 or $0.10 per basic and diluted share compared to net income of $718,000 or $0.14 per basic and diluted share for the first quarter of 2016. 
Weighted average shares outstanding used in the calculation for the periods were approximately 5.1 million basic and diluted shares for each period.
As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.3 million, and shareholders' equity of $76.3 million, compared with $16 million, and $74.1 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2016. 
Amir Philips, Chief Executive Officer of Optibase commented on the first quarter results: "This quarter results are stable compared to the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2016 in our fixed income real estate rent and operating income, while our net income has decreased somewhat due mostly to increased financial expenses and Equity share in losses of associates, net. For the first quarter of 2017 we generated NOI of $3.3 million representing a 3% increase over the same period in 2016. In addition, for the first quarter of 2017, our Recurring FFO decreased to 304,000 compared to the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in our Recurring FFO is primarily due to an increase in our equity share in losses of associates related to our investment in 300 River Holdings, LLC and increase in our financial expenses due to currency rate differences." Mr. Philips concluded: "We are working maintain our basic parameters and increase our financial stability as we progress through 2017."
ACCOUNTING AND OTHER DISCLOSURES
Non-GAAP Net Operating Income, or NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is operating income, which, to calculate NOI, is adjusted to add back real estate depreciation, and amortization, general and administrative expenses and other operation expenses less gain on sale of operating properties. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe that NOI (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense item that are incurred at the property level.
We consider the NOI to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, to understand the core property operations prior to depreciation and amortization expenses and general and administrative costs. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead by acquiring real estate, we consider the NOI to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or groups of assets. 
The metric NOI should only be considered as supplemental to the metric operating income as a measure of our performance. NOI should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions. NOI should also not be used as a supplement to, or substitute for, cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States).
Non-GAAP Funds from operation, or FFO, is a non-GAAP financial measure. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is net income, which, to calculate FFO, is adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated associates. We make certain adjustments to FFO, which it refers to as Non-GAAP recurring FFO or recurring FFO, to account for items we do not believe are representative of ongoing operating results, including transaction costs associated with acquisitions. We use FFO internally as a performance measure and we believe FFO (when combined with the primary GAAP presentations) is a useful, supplemental measure of our operating performance as it's a recognized metric used extensively by the real estate industry. We also believe that Recurring FFO is a useful, supplemental measure of our core operating performance. The company believes that financial analysts, investors and shareholders are better served by the presentation of operating results generated from its FFO and Recurring FFO measures.
We consider the FFO and Recurring FFO to be an appropriate supplemental non-GAAP measure to operating income because it assists management, and thereby investors, in analyzing our operating performance.
The metric's FFO and Recurring FFO should only be considered as supplemental to the metric net income as a measure of our performance. FFO (i) does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, (ii) is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs, including the ability to make distributions, (iii) is not an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity, and (iv) should not be considered as an alternative to net income (which is determined in accordance with GAAP) for purposes of evaluating our operating performance.
