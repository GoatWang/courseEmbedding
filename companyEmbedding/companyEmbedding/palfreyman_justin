                                Report abuseTranscript of The BeaverThe BeaverRcvd. 7 November 1626High and Mighty Lords,Yesterday the ship the Arms of Amsterdam arrived here. It sailed from New Netherland out of the River Mauritius [now Hudson] on the 23d of September. They report that our people are in good spirit and live in peace. The women also have borne some children there. They have purchased the Island Manhattes from the Indians for the value of 60 guilders. It is 11,000 morgens in size [about 22,000 acres]. They had all their grain sowed by the middle of May, and reaped by the middle of August.  They sent samples of these summer grains: wheat, rye, barley, oats, buckwheat, canary seed, beans and flax.                The cargo of the aforesaid ship is:7246 Beaver skins178½ Otter skins675 Otter skins48 Mink skins36 Lynx skins33 Minks34 Muskrat skinsMany oak timbers and nut wood. Herewith, High and Mighty Lords, be commended to the mercy of the Almighty, In Amsterdam, the 5th of November anno 1626.Your High and Mightinesses' obedient, P. SchaghenTranslationNew York's First ExportHenry Hudson probably considered his 1609 voyage to New York a failure - he never found the quick water route to East Asia he was hoping for.  But buried in an entry in a journal kept by Robert Juet, Hudson's first mate, Dutch merchants found something else that piqued their interest.  Look closely at the entry for September 19, 1609:There was, after all, money to be made in New York.Many local Indians seemed more than happy to trade animal pelts for knives, pots, guns, alcohol, and other manufactured goods.  Meanwhile, back in Europe, demand for products made from North American mammals, epsecially the beaver, was skyrocketing.  hats, clothing, and medicines made from North American animals, particularly the beaver Animal pelts, especially beavers, were the largest industry in early New Amsterdam.    This letter, which includes a listing of the cargo carried by a ship returning to Amsterdam in 1626, indicates the scale and importance of the early fur trade. Touch Here to Read the Full TranslationOtter SkinsOtter SkinsMink SkinsLynx SkinsMinksMuskrat SkinsWhat valuable commodities are in the ship's hold? Now it's unclear if local Indians really meant to sell Manhattan Island as we understand it today, and Dutch settlers certainly got a good deal.  But....   There is no doubt that beaver furs meant big money.  How did the first Europeans in New York make money?  They didn't trade stocks.  They traded skins. Henry Hudson came to New York looking for a faster route to the Far East.  Dutch merchants came back to set up a trading post where they could buy animal furs from local Indians.   European traders prized one pelt above all the rest: Castor canadensis, the North American Beaver.    How did New York's first export drive a fashion craze across the Atlantic? Making a Business Out of Beavers:Why Were Europeans So Interested in Beaver Furs?We know beavers like to live near fresh water running downhill.The so-called British Headquarters Map, drawn by English military surveyors during the American Revolution and currently located at the National Archives in England, shows the original natural landscape of Manhattan.  British cartographers were looking for the best places to build fortifications to defend Manhattan, which they occupied throughout most of the Revolutionary War.   Luckily for us, they also paid close attention to the locations of the island's original hills and streams.   But almost all of Manhattan Island has been leveled and built over.How can we know exactly where the hills and streams were? Beaver ProbabilityLocation of Streams From the British Headquarters Map, we can isolate the locations of Manhattan's original running streams.   And based on this data, in addition to similar calculations about other natural elements that attract beavers - including, for example, high concentrations of aspen and alder trees - we can make a safe guess about the most likely locations of beaver habitats.   IntroMotivation: Demand for beaver skins in Europe creates an opportunity to make moneyAction: the beaver pelt tradeConclusion: Beavers are back A Simple Answer:Hats.   Europeans produced and consumed massive amounts of beaver felt hats.  The soft under fur of the beaver was removed from the skins and the hairs formed into a sturdy felt using heat and pressure.  Beaver felt could then be molded into a variety of styles, depending on what was popular at the time.  Three Hundred Years of Beaver Hat Styles1600s 1700s1800sHunting the Beaver: Incidentally, this same document reports that Dutch settlers had "purchased the Island Manhattes from the Indias for the value of 60 guilders.  The BiCorneThe TriCorneThe PilgrimThe LincolnAt least one early observer thought beavers were so important that he proposed this design as the official city seal.  Dutch:"Nota dit waepe(n) was ee(n) concept doch niet goet gevonden"English:"Note: this coat of arms was a draft and was not approved" The directors of the Dutch West India were less than impressed, as this inscription indicates: The Answer?  A very old, but very detailed map.Value of the 8,000 skins on the ship: 45,000 guildersOverhunting decimates the beaver population - there are virtually none left in the New York area by the early 1800s. In 2007, New Yorkers spotted a new resident moving into the Bronx River.  Jose, named after Congressman Jose Serrano, became the first wild beaver to live within city limits in nearly 200 years. By 2010, Jose had a friend - and possibly a mate, though we're not sure of the newcomer's sex.   This time, the Bronx Zoo asked New Yorkers to vote on a name for the newest furry city-dweller.  Here were the options:  A)  Castor B)  BobbieC)  Chompers  D)  Justin BeaverThe winner?

The author of this map was so intrigued that he took the time to emphasize the abundance of fur-bearing animals in interior North America.State of NY: Abundance of beavers[Animated Primary Document][Image Grid?]Fur trade is so succesful and profitable that beavers are hunted to virtual extinction in and around New York by the early 1800sFull transcriptMore presentations by
