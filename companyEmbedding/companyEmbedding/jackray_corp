Gray Manufacturing
                                In 1920, J.H. Gray started his company as nothing more than a simple tire shop. Soon though, Gray began developing innovative equipment to make the heavy work easier and more efficient. By 1921 he was granted his first patent and the rest is history.
    
                                Today, J.H. Gray’s tradition of quality continues. Now with approximately 200 employees, Gray Manufacturing Company, Inc. is recognized around the world for providing the highest quality shop service equipment for the automotive, truck and service vehicle industries.

About This Strain




Sativa
Jh
Jack Herer



Jack Herer


4.4
2385 Reviews




Jack Herer is a sativa-dominant cannabis strain that has gained as much renown as its namesake, the marijuana activist and author of The Emperor Wears No Clothes. Combining a Haze hybrid with a Northern Lights #5 and Shiva Skunk cross, Sensi Seeds created Jack Herer hoping to capture both the cerebral elevation associated with sativas and the heavy resin production of indicas. Its rich genetic background gives rise to several different variations of Jack Herer, each phenotype bearing its own unique features and effects. However, consumers typically describe this 55% sativa hybrid as blissful, clear-headed, and creative.
Jack Herer was created in the Netherlands in the mid-1990s, where it was later distributed by Dutch pharmacies as a recognized medical-grade strain. Since then, the spicy, pine-scented sativa has taken home numerous awards for its quality and potency. Many breeders have attempted to cultivate this staple strain themselves in sunny or Mediterranean climates, and indoor growers should wait 50 to 70 days for Jack Herer to flower.
