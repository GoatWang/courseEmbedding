(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report ". Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception (September 10, 2013) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $95,603 as of November 30, 2015. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company acquiring profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. New management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties, until we acquire an ongoing business, as to which there is no assurance.  THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2015 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  Operating Expenses  During the three months ended November 30, 2015, we incurred expenses of $33,105 compared to $23,515 incurred during the three months ended November 30, 2014. During the current period $32,310 of our expenses were for professional fees and the major reason for the increase over the prior year. Professional fees consist of legal, accounting and audit fees.  Net Loss  Our net loss for the three months ended November 30, 2015 was $33,105, compared to a net loss of $23,515 for the prior period ended November 30, 2014. The increase in net loss is a direct result of the increase in professional fees.  SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30, 2015 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS ENDED NOVEMBER 30,  Operating Expenses  During the six months ended November 30, 2015, we incurred expenses of $59,366 compared to $29,902 incurred during the six months ended November 30, 2014. During the current period $57,737 of our expenses were for professional fees and the major reason for the increase over the prior year. Professional fees consist of legal, accounting and audit fees.  Net Loss  Our net loss for the six months ended November 30, 2015 was $59,366, compared to a net loss of $29,902 for the prior period ended November 30, 2014. The increase in net loss is a direct result of the increase in professional fees.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. During the six months ended November 30, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities was $53,634. For the same period ended November 30, 2014, net cash flows used in operating activities was $29,515.  Cash Flows from Investing Activities  We neither generated, nor used, funds in investing activities during the quarter ended November 30, 2015 or 2014.  Cash Flows from Financing Activities  For the six months ended November 30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $53,612 received by way of related party loans. For the six months ended November 30, 2014, net cash from financing activities was $28,161, consisting of $20,488 received from proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock and $7,673 received by way of a loan from our former sole officer, director and principal shareholder.  PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  Unless and until we acquire an ongoing business, as to which there is no assurance, we expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through related party loans and/or further issuances of securities. There is no assurance that we will be able to meet our working capital requirement from either possible source.  We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, and we might be unable to continue in business.  MATERIAL COMMITMENTS  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any material commitments.  PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT  We do not have any agreements at this time, to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  GOING CONCERN  The independent auditors' report accompanying our May 31, 2015 and 2014 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception (September 10, 2013), resulting in an accumulated deficit of $95,603 as of November 30, 2015, and further losses are anticipated unless and until we acquire an ongoing business, as to which there is no assurance. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company acquiring profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations when they come due. New management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties and/or the private placement of common stock. There is no assurance that funds will be available from either possible source of financing operations.  Jan 13, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

	FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	This annual report contains forward-looking statements. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.





	As used in this annual report, and unless otherwise indicated, the terms "we", "us", "our", "the Company", mean FUTURE WORLD GROUP, INC., formerly known as Betafox Corp.





	All dollar amounts refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated.







	GENERAL








	We were incorporated in Nevada on September 10, 2013, as Betafox Corp. Our limited business until May 11, 2015, when control of our Company changed, was attempting to make candles. Because previous management was unable to raise sufficient capital to enable our Company to develop its intended operations, on that date, Mr. Giorgos Kallides, our previous majority shareholder and sole officer and director, sold his 6,000,000 shares to Future Continental Limited, and resigned all of his positions with our Company. Mr. Pei Lei became our new CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and, as part of the change of control, our previously limited operation was acquired by Mr. Kallides, the former principal, for $1 (see Items 10 and 12 herein).  In November, 2015, we changed our corporate name to Future World Group, Inc.







	As reported in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 8, 2016, Mr. Peis affiliate company Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd. loaned us $1,000,000 (the Loan), pursuant to a three-year, unsecured promissory note bearing interest at 5% (payable in cash or in kind at our option), and convertible into our common shares at $.04 per share (including interest payable in kind).  The proceeds of the Loan are intended to be used for working capital.







	The Loan was made recently; and as yet, management has yet to cause our Company to acquire any assets or a business.  Therefore, notwithstanding the Loan proceeds, we are deemed to be a shell company, as that term is defined pursuant to Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Management is now exploring opportunities in internet service, software development, smartphone apps industries, and block chain technology development on commercial applications.  We are engaged in discussions with various unaffiliated third parties regarding possible acquisitions in those sectors for our Company, with the purpose of enhancing shareholder value. As of the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have not entered into any definitive agreement to acquire any assets or businesses. Unless and until we acquire assets or a business, we will continue to be a shell.







	Our financial statements report no revenue since inception, an accumulated deficit of $

	113,689

	as of May 31, 2016 and a net loss of $

	77,452

	for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016. Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion for our Company, which includes a statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to successfully acquire assets or a business, we may fail. To date, the only operations we have engaged in were the development of a business plan and the purchase of a candle making machine, which business was sold for $1 in May, 2015.







	Employees. Identification of Certain Significant Employees






	We currently have no employees, other than our sole officer and director Mr. Li Pei, who receives no salary. We currently work with other software providers to explore business opportunities in the block chain industry. We intend to hire additional employees only if and when we acquire assets or a business.









	1














	Research and Development Expenditures






	We have not incurred any other research or development expenditures since our incorporation.








	Government Regulation






	Because we have not acquired an asset or a business, we are unable at this time to determine what governmental agencies will have jurisdiction over those assets or businesses, or what effect, if any, those government regulations will have over such assets or businesses.






	Patents and Trademarks






	We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patents or trademarks.

	MARKET INFORMATION






	Our shares of common stock are quoted for trading on OTC Markets under the symbol EGDS. As of the date of this Annual Report we had 37 shareholders of record, and no active trading market has been established.

	SECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS






	We currently do not have any equity compensation plans.






	RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES






	On August 1, 2016, we received proceeds of $1,000,000 from the Loan, described above.

	ITEM 7.  MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.










	The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, including the notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this annual report. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report ". Our audited financial statements are stated in United States Dollars and are prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.











	RESULTS OF OPERATIONS









	FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2016 COMPARED TO FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2015.






	Operating Expenses






	During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we incurred expenses of $2,425 for general and administrative expenses, compared to $18,547 incurred during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015; a decrease of $16,122 or 86.9%. The decrease in the current year can be attributed to a large decrease in transfer agent fees.





	During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, we incurred expenses of $75,027 for professional fees, compared to $17,554 incurred during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015; an increase of $57,473 or 327.4%. The increase in the current year can be attributed to increased legal fees.









	3














	Net Loss






	Our net loss for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016 was $77,452 compared to a net loss of $36,101 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015. The increase


	in net loss is a direct result of increased professional fees as discussed above.









	LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES






	FISCAL YEAR ENDED MAY 31, 2016 and 2016





	As of May 31, 2016, our current assets were $46,755 of cash, and our total liabilities were $124,653 of related party loans.






	Cash Flows from Operating Activities






	We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $77,920, compared to $35,633 for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015.






	Cash Flows from Investing Activities






	We neither generated, nor used, funds in investing activities during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 or May 31, 2015.






	Cash Flows from Financing Activities






	For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $124,653. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $32,160. In the prior year we received $20,488 from the sale of common stock and $11,672 from proceeds by way of loans from our former sole officer, director and principal shareholder. All loans from our former principal were cancelled when the change of control took place on May 11, 2015.





	PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING





	We recently received a loan of $1,000,000 from an affiliated company, which we expect will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for the reasonably near future.





	We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, and we might be unable to continue in business.






	MATERIAL COMMITMENTS






	As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.






	PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT






	We do not have any agreements at this time, to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.






	OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS






	As of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.






	GOING CONCERN






	The independent auditors' report accompanying our May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.









	4













	The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred a loss since inception (September 10, 2013) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $113,689 as of May 31, 2016, and further losses are anticipated unless and until we acquire an ongoing business, as to which there is no assurance. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.





	The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company acquiring profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations arising from normal business operations when they come due. New management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with loans from related parties and/or the private placement of common stock. There is no assurance that funds will be available from either possible source of financing operations.










	ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.








	We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item.

	REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM






	To the Board of Directors


	Future World Group, Inc.





	We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Future World Group, Inc. as of May 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related statements of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the periods then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.





	We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.





	In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Future World Group, Inc. for the years ended May 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America.





	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note #2 to the financial statements, although the Company has limited operations it has yet to attain profitability. This raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan in regard to these matters is also described in Note #2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	FUTURE WORLD GROUP, INC.








	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	May 31, 2016







	NOTE 1  ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS






	Future World Group, Inc. was incorporated 

	  

	in the state of Nevada on September 10, 2013 as Betafox Corp., with the initial intent to manufacture and sell color candles. On April 26, 2015, Giorgos Kallides (the Seller), entered into an Agreement for the Purchase of Common Stock (the Stock Purchase Agreement) with Future Continental Limited, (Purchaser) pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell to Purchaser, six million (6,000,000) shares of common stock of the Company (the Shares) owned by the Seller, constituting approximately 73.8% of the Companys 8,130,000 issued and outstanding common shares, for $340,000. The sale was consummated on May 11, 2015. As a result of the transfer of the shares, there was a change of control of the Company.





	As new management has yet to cause the Company to acquire any assets or a business; we are deemed to be a shell company, as that term is defined pursuant to Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.






	NOTE 2  GOING CONCERN






	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has no revenues to date and an accumulated deficit of $113,689. The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time.





	Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise additional funds through the capital markets. In light of managements efforts, there are no assurances that the Company will be successful in this or any of its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.






	NOTE 3  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFCANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES







	Basis of presentation



	The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Use of Estimates



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.






	Reclassifications



	Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial information to conform to the presentation used in the financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2016.






	Concentrations of Credit Risk



	We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts, the balances of which at times may exceed federally insured limits. We continually monitor our banking relationships and consequently have not experienced any losses in our accounts. We believe we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash.






	Cash Equivalents



	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with the original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents as of May 31, 2016 and 2015.











	11














	Fair Value of Financial Instruments



	The Companys financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and amounts due to shareholder. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these financial statements.





	ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest.





	The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:





	·


	Level 1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;


	·


	Level 2. Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly;


	·


	Level 3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.






	Income Taxes



	The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income in the period that includes the enactment date.





	The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Section 740-10-25) with regards to uncertainty income taxes. Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25.






	Stock-Based Compensation



	We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees under the provisions of ASC Topic No. 505-50, 

	Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees

	(ASC 505-50). ASC 505-50 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract.







	We account for employee stock-based compensation in accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, 

	CompensationStock Compensation,

	which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period during which services are rendered.









	12














	Basic Income (Loss) Per Share



	Net income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially outstanding shares of common stock during the period. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially outstanding common shares assumes that the Company incorporated as of the beginning of the first period presented. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015 there were no potentially dilutive shares.






	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,

	Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes

	. The new guidance requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


	 


	In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting, to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this newly issued guidance to its consolidated financial statements.





	The Company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.






	NOTE 4  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT






	During the year ended May 31, 2014, the Company purchased a candle making machine that was never placed in service. In conjunction with the Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 26, 2015, the property was maintained by the seller. As this was not considered a disposal of an asset no expense was recognized. The $6,000 purchase price of the asset was debited to additional paid in capital.






	NOTE 5  RELATED PARTY LOANS






	In the prior year a former Director loaned the Company a total of $15,304. All funds were used for general operating purposes. The loans were unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. On May 11, 2015, in conjunction with the Stock Purchase Agreement the balance due of $15,304 was forgiven by the seller and credited to additional paid in capital.





	During the year ended May 31, 2016, the CEO loaned the Company a total of $53,913. All funds were used for professional fees and other general operating purposes. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.


	During the year ended February 29, 2016, another company owned by the CEO loaned the Company a total of $70,740. Some of the funds were used for professional fees and other general operating purposes. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.







	All funds were used for general operating purposes. The loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand. On May 11, 2015, in conjunction with the Stock Purchase Agreement the balance due of $15,304 was forgiven by the seller and credited to additional paid in capital.






	NOTE 6  COMMON STOCK






	The Company has 75,000,000, $0.001 par value shares of common stock authorized.





	During the period from June 2014 to February, 2015, the Company issued 2,130,000 shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of $20,488 at $0.01 per share.





	There were 8,130,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of May 31, 2016.






	13














	NOTE 7  INCOME TAXES






	Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

	At May 31, 2016, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $114,000 that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2017 to 2036. No tax benefit has been reported in the May 31, 2016 financial statements since the potential tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.


	 


	Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations.

	In accordance with SFAS 165 (ASC 855-10) management has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through the date that the financial statements were available to be issued, August 22, 2016 and through the date of the filing, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements other than the following.





	On each of August 1, 2016 and August 3, 2016, Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd., a California corporation (Sky Rover) which is 100% owned by Lei Pei, the CEO and principal shareholder, loaned $500,000 to the Company (total of $1,000,000). Sky Rover was issued an unsecured, 5%, convertible promissory note which is due on August 1, 2019, and is convertible into the common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.04 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.).

	ITEM 9.  CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.





	 


	On June 22, 2015, we were informed by the SEC that the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) had revoked the registration of our previous auditing firm, Harris & Gillespie, PLLC. As a result of that revocation, we were required to retain a new auditing firm, and to re-audit our financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014. On June 25, 2015, we filed with the SEC, on Form 8-K, a notification that we had retained the accounting firm of Michael Gillespie & Associates PLLC. That accounting firm has audited our financial statements for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015, and re-audited our financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2014.









	ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES








	EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	The term disclosure controls and procedures (defined in SEC Rule 13a-15(e)) refers to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	The Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report (the Evaluation Date). Based on that evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer noted the deficiencies in internal controls identified in this Item 9A. Accordingly, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, such controls and procedures were not effective.




	 




	Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO").




	 




	A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.




	 



	1.


	We do not have an Audit Committee  While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is management s view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Companys financial statement. Currently the single-member Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over management s activities.





	2.


	We did not maintain appropriate cash controls  As of May 31, 2016, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Company s bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had very few transactions in the bank account.







	3.


	Lack of segregation of dutiesWe are currently a shell corporation, and have no employees other than our CEO and CFOthe same person.  Therefore, all accounting information is currently reviewed only by one person.






	15














	Accordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Companys internal controls.




	 




	As a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework issued by COSO.




	 






	Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting






	 




	There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation we conducted of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2016, that occurred during our fourth fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.




	 




	This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.

	AUDIT COMMITTEE






	We do not have an audit committee financial expert.

	Item 8.01 Other Events.






	On each of August 1, 2016 and August 3, 2016, Sky Rover Holdings, Ltd., a California corporation (Sky Rover) which is 100% owned by Lei (Lester) Pei, the Registrants CEO and principal shareholder, loaned $500,000 to the Registrant, i.e. a total of $1,000,000 was loaned to the Registrant by Sky Rover.





	The terms for the investment are as follows: Sky Rover was issued an unsecured convertible promissory note (the Note) which is due in three years (on August 1, 2019), and is convertible into the Registrants common shares at any time before the due date, at a conversion price of $.04 per share (subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, forward splits, recapitalizations, a merger, etc.).





	If and when Sky Rover converts the entire $1,000,000 Note at the present conversion price of $.04 per share, Sky Rover would be issued 25,000,000 restricted shares of the Registrants common stock.  Those shares, plus the 6,000,000 shares Mr. Pei currently owns, would give him beneficial ownership of 31,000,000 of the Registrants 33,130,000 then-issued and outstanding shares (assuming that no other shares are issued before conversion), which would be approximately 93.6% of the then-outstanding shares.  





	The Note bears interest of 5% per annum, with interest payable quarterly, in cash or, at the Registrants option, the issuance to Sky Rover of restricted shares of the Registrants common stock at the conversion price of $.04 per share.





	The Registrant intends to use the proceeds of the loan for working capital.





	The above descriptions of the terms set forth in the Note are qualified in the entirety by reference to the Note and the Note Agreement, which are Exhibits to this Report on Form 8-K.

	ORIGINAL ISSUE  




	 CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE






	THIS

	UNSECURED CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE

	is a duly authorized and validly issued Unsecured Convertible Promissory Note (this 

	Note

	) of

	FUTURE WORLD GROUP, INC.,

	a Nevada corporation, (the 

	Company

	), having its principal place of business at 301 South Brea Canyon Road Walnut CA 91789.






	FOR VALUE RECEIVED

	, the Company promises to pay to

	SKY ROVER HOLDINGS, LTD

	.

	,

	or its registered assigns (the 

	Holder

	), or shall have paid pursuant to the terms hereunder, the maximum principal sum of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000.00), or such lesser amount as shall have been funded hereunder, on the third year anniversary of the above-referenced Original Issue Date of funding (the 

	Maturity Date

	), or such earlier date as this Note is required or permitted to be repaid or converted as provided hereunder, and to pay interest to the Holder on the aggregate unconverted and then outstanding principal amount of this Note in accordance with the provisions hereof.  

	This Note is issued pursuant to the terms of the Note Agreement by and between the Company, and the Holder, dated as of the date hereof (the Note



	Agreement



	).






	This Note is subject to the following additional provisions:






	Section 1

	.



	Definitions

	.  For the purposes hereof, in addition to the terms defined elsewhere in this Note, capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Note Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated by reference herein.






	Section 2

	.



	Interest; Prepayment

	.





	a)



	Payment of Interest

	. The Company shall pay interest to the Holder on the aggregate unconverted and then outstanding principal amount of this Note at the rate of five (5%) percent






	1










	 





	per annum, subject to the terms hereof. At the option of the Company, the interest may be paid by issuing restricted shares of common stock to the Holder, at the same conversion price per share, i.e. $.04 per share as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 4(b) herein.  Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, consisting of twelve 30 calendar day periods, and shall accrue daily commencing on the Original Issue Date set forth above, until payment in full of the outstanding principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts which may become due hereunder, has been made.  Interest hereunder will be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered on the records of the Company regarding registration and transfers of this Note (the 

	Note Register

	). A


	ll overdue accrued and unpaid interest to be paid hereunder shall entail a late fee at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 12% per annum or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law (the 

	Late Fees

	) which shall accrue daily from the date such interest is due hereunder through and including the date of actual payment in full.





	b)



	Prepayment

	.  At any time upon five (5) days written notice to the Holder, the Company may prepay any portion of the principal amount of this Note and any accrued and unpaid interest.  The Holder may continue to convert the Note from the date notice of the prepayment is given until the date of the prepayment.









	Section 3.




	Registration of Transfers and Exchanges

	.


	 


	This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.  No service charge will be payable for such registration of transfer or exchange.  This Note has been issued subject to certain investment representations of the original Holder set forth in the Subscription Agreement and may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Subscription Agreement and applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations.  Prior to due presentment for transfer to the Company of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the Person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Note Register as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.






	Section 4.




	Conversion

	.





	a)



	Voluntary Conversion

	. At any time after the Original Issue Date until this Note is no longer outstanding, this Note shall be convertible, in whole or in part, into shares of Common Stock at the option of the Holder (the 

	Conversion Shares

	), subject to mechanics of conversion and adjustment provisions set forth herein.  The Holder shall effect conversions by delivering to the Company a Notice of Conversion, the form of which is attached hereto as

	Annex A

	(each, a 

	Notice of Conversion

	), specifying therein the principal amount of this Note to be converted and the date on which such conversion shall be effected (such date, the 

	Conversion Date

	).  If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date shall be the date that such Notice of Conversion is deemed delivered hereunder.  No ink-original Notice of Conversion shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be required.

	 

	To effect conversions hereunder, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless the entire principal amount of this Note, plus all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, has been so converted. Conversions hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding principal amount of this Note in an amount equal to the applicable conversion.  The Holder and the Company shall maintain a Note Schedule showing the principal amount(s) converted and the date of such conversion(s), a copy of which shall be certified by the Company and promptly provided to Holder after each amendment thereto.  The Company may deliver an objection to any Notice of Conversion within one (1) Business Day of delivery of such Notice of Conversion.  In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, the






	2










	 





	records of the Holder shall be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error.

	The Holder, and any assignee by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face of this Note.






	b)



	Conversion Price

	.  Prior to the Maturity Date with respect to any funded amount, the conversion price in effect on any Conversion Date shall be equal to $0.04 per share of common stock, subject to adjustment herein (the 

	Conversion Price

	). All such determinations will be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination, reclassification or similar transaction that proportionately decreases or increases the Common Stock during such measuring period.   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time after the occurrence of any Event of Default the Holder may, at such Holders option and otherwise in accordance with the provisions for conversion herein, convert all or any part of this Note into the number of shares of Common Stock that is a majority of the then issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company.  Nothing herein shall limit a Holders right to pursue actual damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 6 hereof and the Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief and/or remedies under the guarantee and pledge of securities pursuant to the Subscription Agreement.  The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law.






	Section 5

	.



	Events of Default

	.  





	a)

	 means, wherever used herein, any of the following events (whatever the reason for such event and whether such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court, or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):





	i.

	ii.


	the Company shall fail to observe or perform any other covenant or agreement contained in this Note  (other than a breach by the Company of its obligations to deliver shares of Common Stock to the Holder upon conversion, which breach is addressed in clause (xi) below) which failure is not cured, if possible to cure, within


	the earlier to occur of (A) five Business Days after notice of such failure sent by the Holder or by any other Holde


	r to the Company and (B) ten Business Days after the Company has become or should have become aware of such failure;





	iii.


	any repres


	entation or warranty made in this Note, any written statement pursuant hereto or thereto or any other report, financial statement or certificate made or delivered to the Holder or any other Holder shall be untrue or incorrect in any material respect as of the date when made or deemed made;





	iv.


	the Company shall be subject to a bankruptcy or similar insolvency;












	3










	 





	v.


	if the Company shall: (i) apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or liquidator of it or any of its properties, (ii) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts as they mature, (iii) make a general assignment for the benefit of creditors, (iv) be adjudicated bankrupt or insolvent or be the subject of an order for relief under Title 11 of the United States Code or any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation law or statute of any other jurisdiction or foreign country, or (v) file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy, or a petition or an answer seeking reorganization or an arrangement with creditors or to take advantage or any bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation law or statute, or an answer admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any proceeding under any such law, or (vi) take or permit to be taken any action in furtherance of or for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; or





	vi.


	the Company shall fail to maintain sufficient reserved shares pursuant to enable it to issue shares to the Holder upon conversion.





	b)



	Remedies Upon Event of Default

	. If an Event of Default of the Company occurs, then the outstanding principal amount of this Note, plus accrued but unpaid interest, liquidated damages and other amounts owing in respect thereof through the date of acceleration, shall become, at the Holders election by notice in writing to Company, immediately due and payable in cash at the Mandatory Default Amount.  After the occurrence of any Event of Default that results in the eventual acceleration of this Note, the interest rate on this Note shall accrue at an interest rate equal to the lesser of 1% per month (12% per annum) or the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.  Upon the payment in full of the Mandatory Default Amount, the Holder shall promptly surrender this Note to or as directed by the Company.  In connection with such acceleration described herein, the Holder need not provide, and the Company hereby waives, any presentment, demand, protest or other notice of any kind, and the Holder may immediately and without expiration of any grace period enforce any and all of its rights and remedies hereunder and all other remedies available to it under applicable law.  Such acceleration may be rescinded and annulled by Holder at any time prior to payment hereunder and the Holder shall have all rights as a holder of the Note until such time, if any, as the Holder receives full payment pursuant to this Section 5(b).  No such rescission or annulment shall affect any subsequent Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

	

	) is dated as of August 1, 2016 (the

	


	Effective Date


	

	), by and between FUTURE WORLD GROUP, INC. (the

	


	Borrower


	

	) and SKY ROVER HOLDINGS, LTD. (the

	


	Lender


	

	).


	WHEREAS, Lender desires to loan to Borrower, and the Borrower desires to borrow from Lender, upon the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein and in the Promissory Note, a total of One Million United States Dollars ($1,000,000) in the form attached hereto as

	Exhibit A

	(the 

	Note

	), subject to the terms and provisions hereinafter set forth;


	NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants of the parties hereinafter expressed and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, each intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:


	1



	Issuance of Note

	.  Subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Lender agrees to lend to Borrower, and Borrower agrees to borrow from Lender, the sum of $1,000,000, as evidenced by the Note, as more specifically set forth herein, and as set forth in the terms of the Note, the form of which is attached as

	Exhibit A.

	 


	2



	Representations and Warranties of the Undersigned Lender

	.


	The undersigned Lender hereby represents and warrants to the Borrower as follows:


	(a)


	The Lender (i) is over the age of 21 (if an individual); (ii) has adequate means of providing for the Lender's current needs and possible contingencies, and  has no need for liquidity of the Lender's investment in the Borrower; (iii) can bear the economic risk of losing the Lender's entire investment therein; (iv) has such knowledge and experience in business and financial matters, alone or with a purchaser representative, that the Lender is capable of evaluating the relative risks and merits of this investment; (v) understands the speculative nature and uncertainty of the Borrower's business; and (vi) understands that the Lender can lose the entire investment.  









	- 1 -











	(b)


	The Lender acknowledges that the securities offered herein have not been and are not being registered under the Act, and that the stock certificate received by the Lender, if and when the Note is converted into common shares, will bear a legend indicating that transfer of these securities is restricted by reason of the fact that the said securities have not been so registered.


	(c)


	The Lender represents that these Securities are being acquired for his, her or its own account, for investment purposes only and not with a view to resale or other distribution thereof, nor with the intention of selling, transferring or otherwise disposing of all or any part of such Securities (or underlying securities) for any particular event or circumstances, except for selling, transferring or disposing of said Securities in full compliance with all applicable provisions of the Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder.  The Lender further understands and agrees that such Securities may be sold only if they are subsequently registered under the Act or an exemption from such registration is available, and that any routine sales of securities made in reliance upon Rule 144 may be made only after the holding period specified in that Rule, and only in the amounts set forth in and pursuant to the other terms and conditions of that Rule.  The Lender understands that a stop order will be placed on the book and records of the transfer agent regarding the Securities.


	(d)


	The address set forth below is the Lender's (if an individual) true and correct residence, and the Lender has no present intention of becoming a resident of any other state or jurisdiction prior to the date on which payment in full for the Securities will be made.  If the Lender is a partnership, corporation or other entity, such address is such entity's principal place of business.


	(e)


	The Lender's execution and delivery of this Agreement has been duly authorized by all necessary legal action.  If the Lender is a corporation or partnership, the Lender is a duly organized and validly existing legal entity under the laws of its state of organization.  


	(f)


	The Lender has reviewed this Note Agreement.


	(g)


	The Lender is an "ACCREDITED INVESTOR as that term is defined in the SECs Rules and Regulations, by reason that its sole shareholder, Mr. Lei Pei, is an Executive Officer and a Director of the Borrower.  


	(h)


	The Lender has been afforded the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Borrower concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and the business of the Borrower, and to obtain any additional information which the Borrower possesses or could acquire without unreasonable effort or expense that is necessary to verify the accuracy of information contained herein; the Lender desires no more information;









	- 2 -










	(i)  There are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Securities.  Each of the certificates representing shares acquired by the Lender upon conversion of the Note will bear in substance the following legend:



	"These securities have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  They may not be sold or transferred in the absence of an effective Registration Statement under that Act without an opinion of counsel satisfactory to the Borrower that such Registration is not required."



	(j) The Lender will not transfer or assign this Note Agreement, or any interest of the Lender herein, and the assignment and transferability of the Securities acquired pursuant hereto shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Act and Regulations thereunder and applicable state securities laws.


	(k)


	The foregoing representations and warranties are true and accurate as of the date hereof and shall be true and accurate as of the date upon which the Borrower signs this Note Agreement (the "Closing Date").  If, in any respect, such representations and warranties shall not be true and accurate prior to the Closing Date, the Lender shall give written notice of such fact to the Borrower, specifying which representations and warranties are not true and accurate and the reasons therefor, if any.


	5.



	Validity of Shares

	.


	The Borrower represents and warrants to the Lender that upon the issuance of the Borrowers common shares upon conversion of the Note, the shares will be duly authorized, validly issued and fully paid, and the Lender will receive good and valid title to such shares free and clear of any pledges, security interests, liens, charges or encumbrance of any kind (other than the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Note Agreement or under applicable securities laws).


	6.

Face your future with optimism
No matter what financial challenges you face – whether it’s debt, limited savings and investments, or lack of life insurance — they can be resolved successfully. By providing you with a better understanding of your financial situation and access to products and solutions that are appropriate for your specific goals, your WFG associate can help you achieve your dreams.



Common Challenges
WFG believes that having a solid understanding of the challenges families and individuals throughout North America face is an important first step to overcoming them.




Credit Card Debt & Poor Savings
Cost of College
Retirement Savings
Social Security
Rising Cost of Living
Unexpected Loss





Credit Card Debt & Poor Savings
If you have high credit card balances, little to no savings and no understanding of how much savings is enough, you are not alone.
In a recent survey by BankRate.com, nearly 30 percent of Americans say they have more credit card debt than emergency savings; and some 17 percent report having neither emergency savings nor credit card debt.1
TransUnion’s quarterly analysis of Canadian credit trends found that the average consumer’s total debt (excluding mortgage) in Q4 2013 increased to $27,368.2
Too much credit card debt and limited savings can be major threats your family’s current and future prosperity. Since consumer debt can have a negative impact on your future, you have to find ways to avoid it or eliminate it, so that you can build an emergency fund and start saving for your future.
1. Constantine von Hoffman, “Close to half of Americans have more credit card debt than savings,” MoneyWatch, Feb.18, 2014, http://www.cbsnews.com/news/51-percent-have-enough-cash-to-pay-off-credit-card-debt-study/.
2. TransUnion, “Delinquency Rates Drop as Consumer Debt Surprisingly Remains Nearly the Same During Fourth Quarter,” Press release, Feb. 26, 2014, http://newsroom-en.transunion.ca/article/?id=1812220.






Cost of College
If you’re a parent, you’re probably aware that the cost of a college degree has been increasing steadily, year after year, throughout North America.
In the United States, the cost (tuition, fees, books, room and board, and other expenses) for an in-state public college for the 2013–14 academic year averaged $22,826; while the cost of private college averaged $44,750..1
Similarly, in Canada, the cost of a university degree is increasing, with tuition and other compulsory fees expected to triple from 1990 to 2017.2
Trends like these are likely to persist. So you have to start planning for your children’s education now, even as you continue to meet your day-to-day expenses and save for retirement.

Retirement Savings
Many people face an uncertain retirement. According to a recent study, many U.S. workers say they have virtually no savings or investments. Excluding the value of their home and defined benefit plans, 60 percent of the workers surveyed say their household savings and investments is less than $25,000.1
In Canada, although more people are making contributions to their RRSPs, three-quarters (77%) of those with RRSPs indicate they won’t be making the maximum allowable contribution in 2014.2
It may be because they do not know how much money they need to save to cover their expenses once they stop working; or they may not earn enough income to start saving.
Today, people face a different retirement reality. The traditional model that saw your parents or grandparents through their golden years – a company pension, a government-sponsored savings plan like Social Security or the Canadian Pension Plan, and their own personal savings – is in upheaval. There are fewer companies offering pensions and government programs are uncertain. Now, people who want a secure retirement have to rely more heavily on their own personal savings.

Social Security
In the United States, Social Security may not be a reliable source of income in the near future. According to recent projections,1 the program’s key trust fund will be depleted by 2035. That’s why you have to plan for the possibility that you may receive partial Social Security benefits when you retire – or none at all.

Rising Cost of Living
Did you know the amount of money you earn today will have less value tomorrow, and even less 20 years from now? Have you considered the rising cost of
living in your financial strategy? To show how this can affect you, take a look at the following example:
If you and your spouse are each 45 years old, earn $100,000 per year and plan to retire in 20 years, and if inflation averages 4.5% during the next two decades, you will need more than $241,000 a year to equal your current $100,000 annual income.





Unexpected Loss
What if you were to pass away unexpectedly? Without proper planning – whether through life insurance and/or emergency savings – your family could face serious financial issues due to funeral costs, credit card bills, and more. Proper insurance coverage can help you guard against the impact of such losses.

Life Insurance 1
Since different people have different financial needs, licensed WFG Associates offer a variety of life insurance policies to help meet your financial goals. Some policies feature premiums that remain constant for the life of the policy. Cash value policies allow you to access the policy value once it is sufficient through policy loans or withdrawals.
In the United States a variable universal life insurance2 policy combines permanent life insurance with investment options. The policy owner may direct net premiums to a variety of investment options to match his/her investment objectives. These account options have the potential to build cash value over time. However, the return and principal value of the investment options will fluctuate and when redeemed, they may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Policy loans and withdrawals reduce the cash value and death benefit and loans are subject to interest charges. If a policy is surrendered or lapses while a loan is outstanding, adverse tax consequences may result. Consult with your tax advisor regarding the effect of policy loans and withdrawals for your particular situation.
Be sure that you’re aware of and understand the several different fees and charges associated with different types of life Insurance policies.
Speak to your licensed WFG associate, who can help you determine which type of life insurance you need and the optimal coverage level.

Long-Term Care 1
Many people don’t take into consideration the very real possibility that, at some point, they will require long-term care. Although it’s assumed that long-term care is only needed in the latter part of a person’s life, diseases such as Parkinson’s and serious illness from a stroke or heart attack can also cause a need for these types of services.
It pays to be ready in the event that you or someone you love will need help performing basic tasks of daily living. When setting your financial strategy and goals, talk to your WFG licensed associate to see if long-term care insurance is an option for you.

Mutual Funds
Mutual funds* enable you to pool your money with other individual investors to purchase stocks, bonds or other assets. Together, you share the potential risks, rewards and expenses of whatever investment strategy you choose. Every mutual fund has a professional money manager who is responsible for researching, selecting and monitoring the performance of the fund’s assets in accordance with the fund’s stated investment objective.

No matter what your investment goals are – whether saving for college expenses, a new home or retirement – mutual funds can be an excellent addition to your financial portfolio.
A securities-licensed WFG associate** can help you decide if mutual funds should be a part of your financial strategy.

Cash Flow
When you create your financial strategy, it’s important to know how much money you have access to and how, if possible, you can increase that amount. This money is your cash flow and can help you accomplish many things, including reducing or eliminating debt and increasing your savings.
Here are some strategies you can use to increase your cash flow:

Create a budget for your monthly expenses and needs – and stick to it
Spend less than you earn
Raise deductibles on your auto, homeowners and other insurance policies, which can help to lower premium
Look for ways to earn higher interest on money that is currently in low-interest savings accounts
Start a second career or a part-time business to earn additional income

Your WFG associate can help you evaluate your current cash flow and assist you in finding ways to increase it.





Proper Protection
A big part of building a sound financial strategy is life insurance. Life insurance helps protect your loved ones in the event of your death. It not only helps replace lost income, but it can also help preserve your family’s assets.
A basic rule of thumb is to have enough life insurance to provide approximately 10 times your annual family income. For example, if your current household income is $50,000, you may want to consider having $500,000 in life insurance protection.
A WFG associate can evaluate of your financial situation to help you determine how much life insurance you need.
*In the United States, products and services offered through WFG’s affiliated companies, which include World Financial Group Insurance Agency, Inc. and Transamerica Financial Advisors, Inc. Associates must be properly licensed and appointed to sell insurance- and securities-related products.
Only WFG associates who are Registered Representatives and/or Investment Advisor Representatives of Transamerica Financial Advisors, Inc. can offer investment products and/or investment advisory services.

Only WFG associates who are Registered Representatives of WFG Securities Inc. can offer investment products. Securities offered through WFG Securities Inc.
Non-securities products and services are not offered through WFGS.





Debt Management
One of the biggest obstacles to a sound financial future is consumer debt. It’s important to have a strategy that can help reduce and eliminate debt.
Here are some approaches you can take:

Pay more than the minimum, as much as possible within your budget, on the credit card/ loan with the highest interest rate. Once you pay off that credit card/loan, begin paying off the next highest interest rate credit card/loan.
Consider transferring credit card/loan balances to a card with a low interest rate that is offering a promotional, no fee transfer option. Don’t hesitate to call the issuers of all your credit cards to ask for a lower rate.
Quit charging. Put your credit cards away so you don’t consider charging on them while you’re paying down your debt or after it’s paid off.

There are many other things you can do to reduce debt. Work with your WFG associate to find strategies that you can work for you.





Emergency Fund
No matter how much you plan in life, the unexpected happens. To prepare for life’s little “disasters,” set up an emergency fund to help pay for any resulting expenses. A basic rule of thumb for determining how much you should set aside is three- to six-months of your total expenses.
Don’t think you need an emergency fund? Consider these potential expenses and scenarios:

Major car repairs
Major home repairs
Major appliance repairs or replacement
Loss of a job
Serious illness or hospitalization
Extended elder care or long-term care

Having an extra source of funds gives your family peace of mind during a stressful time.





Build Wealth
When developing your financial strategy, it’s important to ensure you put a long-term asset accumulation program in place that strives to outpace inflation and reduce taxation. When determining the best program for you, ask yourself the following questions:

How long do I expect live?
How much it will cost to live comfortably during those years?

There are key financial concepts that can help you as address these questions. For example, the Rule of 72 is an estimation of the time it takes for money to double.* Additionally, understanding the cost of waiting gives you an idea of the financial advantage of starting to save today.
Your WFG associate can explain these and other financial concepts to you, and help you develop a strategy based on your needs.
* The Rule of 72 is a mathematical concept that approximates the number of years it will take to double the principal at a constant rate of return compounded over time. All figures are for illustrative purposes only, and do not reflect the risks, expenses or charges associated with an actual investment. The rate of return of investments fluctuates over time and, as a result, the actual time it will take an investment to double in value cannot be predicted with any certainty. Results are rounded for illustrative purposes. Actual results in each case are slightly higher or lower.





Preserve Wealth
An essential part of your financial strategy is ensuring that the wealth you accumulated over the years is not impacted by taxes or other unintended consequences. A well-designed strategy can:

Eliminate probate costs
Help manage estate taxes
Ensure your legacy reaches your intended heirs, including any life insurance coverage, pensions and annuities
Provide an opportunity to set up medical and financial powers of attorney so that, should you become incapacitated, someone can take care of your finances, make medical decisions for you and more

Please consult with your attorney and/or tax advisor for guidance regarding your specific circumstances.*
* Tax and/or legal advice are not offered by World Financial Group Inc., World Financial Group Canada Inc, their affiliated companies or their independent associates. Please consult with your personal tax and/or legal professional for further guidance.
