Luxury Brand Partners – Artist Driven Beauty Brands












R+CoVisit WebsiteWatch VideoCarry R+Co
R+Co is a collective of some of the most knowledgeable, forward-thinking hairstylists in the business. We are a think tank of top editorial and salon stylists and educators, and we make sure that we have more than one viewpoint on everything we do.We liken ourselves to a “supergroup” that has come together to make a super line of products and to share the collective knowledge garnered over a combined century of hairdressing. In an industry not known for collaboration, we happen to enjoy working together and sharing with one another, so we are turning the old model on its head and bringing a fresh perspective.Stylists are the real heroes of this brand. This is all about creating a dialogue between the broader stylist community. We advocate for stylists—and their clients—to find the point of view and style that best matches their own.We have created unique, functional products—one-of-a-kind true category killers. They make your job easier. And also enhance your relationship with your clients because they are able to actually replicate what you did for them in the chair once they get home.Included in the line is every single product that a hairdresser could possibly need in their kit. And each of those products embodies experimentation, design, artistry, passion and curiosity. It truly is a pro shop for our industry.So thanks for going rogue with us. It’s going to be a lot of fun.SHARE:

Unconditionally, our emotional connection with beauty remains constant. Our individual expression of beauty reflects who we’ve been, are and aspire to become. Our collective passion for seeking what we find to be beautiful is an inherently shared characteristic.
Smith and Cult’s Nailed Lacquer consistently delivers both flawlessly smooth coverage and brilliant shine. While custom tailored to provide high performance, the exclusive 5-Free formula is formulated without Dibutyl, Phthalate, Toluene, Formaldehyde, Formaldehyde Resin and Camphor. The Shining Lip Lacquer’s vibrant shades, cushioned texture, and extended wear formula make the subtly sweetened collection scary addictive. The formula is vegan, gluten, and paraben free.Ever evolving are the ways in which we express and envision that which we define as beautiful. Smith & Cult colors the polarities within our life experiences.SHARE:

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.
