About Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P.


      GSAM is the asset management arm of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 
      (NYSE:GS), and supervises $1.21 trillion as of June 30, 2017.1 
      GSAM has been providing discretionary investment advisory services since 
      1988 and has investment professionals in all major financial centers 
      around the world. The company offers investment strategies across a 
      broad range of asset classes to institutional and individual clients 
      globally. Founded in 1869, Goldman Sachs is a leading global investment 
      banking, securities and investment management firm that provides a wide 
      range of financial services to a substantial and diversified client base 
      that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and 
      high-net-worth individuals.
    

1 Assets Under Supervision (AUS) includes assets under 
      management and other client assets for which Goldman Sachs does not have 
      full discretion.
    

Disclosures


      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (“NAV”), which may increase investors’ risk 
      of loss. At the time of sale, an investor’s shares may have a market 
      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the 
      original investment. There is no assurance that a Fund will meet its 
      investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future 
      results. Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ 
      from investments in common stock, including among others risks related 
      to limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting MLPs, 
      potential conflicts of interest risk, cash flow risks, dilution risks 
      and trading risks.
    

      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a 
      solicitation of an offer to buy any security. Each Fund has completed 
      its initial public offering. Investors should consider their investment 
      goals, time horizons and risk tolerance before investing in a Fund. An 
      investment in a Fund is not appropriate for all investors, and the Funds 
      are not intended to be a complete investment program. Investors should 
      carefully review and consider a Fund’s investment objective, risks, 
      charges and expenses before investing.
    

For additional information, please visit the Funds’ website at www.GSAMFUNDS.com/cef.

Largest MLP Closed-End Fund Initial Public Offering To Date1
 Largest Closed-End Fund Initial Public Offering This Year1 




NEW YORK – For investors seeking to participate in the US Energy Renaissance, Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”) is pleased to announce the public listing of the Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund (the “Fund”), now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “GER.”  
“Further expanding our energy-focused product line continues to be an important strategic initiative for GSAM, and we are pleased to have completed our second successful MLP closed-end fund launch within the last 12 months,” said James McNamara, President of the Goldman Sachs Funds advised by GSAM. 
The Fund will invest primarily in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”) and other energy investments. The Fund currently expects to concentrate its investments in the energy sector, with an emphasis on midstream MLP investments. The Fund will invest in investments across the energy value chain, including upstream, midstream and downstream investments. The Fund seeks a high level of total return with an emphasis on current distributions to shareholders.  There can be no assurance that the Fund will achieve its investment objective or that the Fund's investment program will be successful.  
“We believe the US energy renaissance story is only in its early stages and we see multiple years of growth ahead,” said Kyri Loupis, Managing Director of GSAM and lead portfolio manager for the Fund. “Our midstream MLP focus, combined with an opportunistic approach for selecting energy users and producers, can help make this fund more of a complete product for today’s environment.”
The Fund is managed by GSAM’s Energy & Infrastructure Team, which is among the industry’s largest MLP investment groups. As of August 31, 2014 the team managed approximately $14.1 billion in MLPs and other energy investments.2

The Fund raised $1.4 billion in its common share offering, excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, the Fund will raise $1.61 billion. Underwriters may exercise their option to purchase additional shares up to 45 days after the initial public offering.  
BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS Investment Bank, Wells Fargo Securities and Citigroup were lead underwriters in connection with the offering.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

Overview
The Direxion Daily S&P Oil & Gas Exp. & Prod. Bull and Bear 3X Shares seek daily investment results, before fees and expenses, of 300%, or 300% of the inverse (or opposite), of the performance of the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production Select Industry Index (SPSIOPTR) is provided by Standard & Poor’s Index Provider and includes domestic companies from the oil and gas exploration and production sub-industry. The Index is designed to measure the performance of a sub-industry or group of sub-industries determined based on the Global Industry Classification Standards (GICS). One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The Energy Select Sector Index (IXETR) is provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes domestic companies from the energy sector which includes the following industries: oil, gas and consumable fuels; and energy equipment and services.  One cannot directly invest in an index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

      price that is above or below NAV, and may be worth more or less than the 
      original investment. There is no assurance that a Fund will meet its 
      investment objective. Past performance does not guarantee future 
      results. Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ 
      from investments in common stock, including among others risks related 
      to limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting MLPs, 
      potential conflicts of interest risk, cash flow risks, dilution risks 
      and trading risks.

Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund Raises $1.4 Billion in 
      Initial Public Offering With Aim to Deliver Exposure to America’s 
      Rapidly Expanding Energy Sector




Largest MLP Closed-End Fund Initial Public Offering To Date1


Largest Closed-End Fund Initial Public Offering This Year1






September 26, 2014 08:18 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--For investors seeking to participate in the US Energy Renaissance, 
      Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”) is pleased to announce the 
      public listing of the Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund (the 
      “Fund”), now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker 
      symbol “GER.”
    


      “Further expanding our energy-focused product line continues to be an 
      important strategic initiative for GSAM, and we are pleased to have 
      completed our second successful MLP closed-end fund launch within the 
      last 12 months,” said James McNamara, President of the Goldman Sachs 
      Funds advised by GSAM.
    

      The Fund will invest primarily in Master Limited Partnerships (“MLPs”) 
      and other energy investments. The Fund currently expects to concentrate 
      its investments in the energy sector, with an emphasis on midstream MLP 
      investments. The Fund will invest in investments across the energy value 
      chain, including upstream, midstream and downstream investments. The 
      Fund seeks a high level of total return with an emphasis on current 
      distributions to shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Fund 
      will achieve its investment objective or that the Fund's investment 
      program will be successful.
    

      “We believe the US energy renaissance story is only in its early stages 
      and we see multiple years of growth ahead,” said Kyri Loupis, Managing 
      Director of GSAM and lead portfolio manager for the Fund. “Our midstream 
      MLP focus, combined with an opportunistic approach for selecting energy 
      users and producers, can help make this fund more of a complete product 
      for today’s environment.”
    

      The Fund is managed by GSAM’s Energy & Infrastructure Team, which is 
      among the industry’s largest MLP investment groups. As of August 31, 
      2014 the team managed approximately $14.1 billion in MLPs and other 
      energy investments.2

      eVestment Alliance Search Engine (eASE) Analytics, August 31, 2014.
    

      The Fund raised $1.4 billion in its common share offering, excluding any 
      exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. If 
      the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in 
      full, the Fund will raise $1.61 billion. Underwriters may exercise their 
      option to purchase additional shares up to 45 days after the initial 
      public offering.
    

      BofA Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, UBS Investment Bank, Wells Fargo 
      Securities and Citigroup were lead underwriters in connection with the 
      offering.

      Commission. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or 
      a solicitation of an offer to buy any security. The Fund has completed 
      its initial public offering.
    

Investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and 
      risk tolerance before investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund 
      is not appropriate for all investors, and the Fund is not intended to be 
      a complete investment program. Investors should carefully review and 
      consider the Fund’s investment objective, risks, charges and expenses 
      before investing.


Fund Risk Considerations


The Goldman Sachs MLP and Energy Renaissance Fund invests 
      primarily in master limited partnership (“MLP”) and other energy 
      investments. The Fund’s equity investments are subject to market risk, 
      which means that the value of the securities in which it invests may go 
      up or down in response to numerous factors, including the prospects of 
      individual companies, particular sectors and/or general economic 
      conditions. Investments in MLPs are subject to certain additional 
      risks, including risks related to limited control and limited rights to 
      vote, potential conflicts of interest, cash flow risks, dilution risks, limited 
      liquidity, risks related to the general partner’s right to force 
      sales at undesirable times or prices, interest rate sensitivity and for 
      MLPs with smaller capitalizations, lower trading volume and abrupt or 
      erratic price movements. MLPs are also subject to risks relating to 
      their complex tax structure, including the risk that an MLP could 
      lose its tax status as a partnership, resulting in a reduction in the 
      value of the Fund’s investment in the MLP and lower income to the Fund. 
      MLPs are also subject to the risk that to the extent that a distribution 
      received from an MLP is treated as a return of capital, the Fund’s 
      adjusted tax basis in the MLP interests may be reduced, which may 
      increase the Fund’s tax liability upon the sale of the MLP interests or 
      upon subsequent distributions in respect of such interests. The Fund’s 
      strategy results in its being taxed as a regular corporation, or “C” 
      corporation, which involves complicated accounting, tax and 
      valuation issues. Many MLPs in which the Fund invests operate facilities 
      within the energy sector and are also subject to risks affecting that 
      sector. Because the Fund concentrates its investments in the energy 
      sector, the Fund is subject to greater risk of loss as a result of 
      adverse economic, business or other developments affecting industries 
      within that sector than if its investments were more diversified across 
      different industries. The Fund may invest in private investment in 
      public equities (“PIPEs”) which may be deemed illiquid. The 
      securities of mid- and small-capitalization companies involve 
      greater risks than those associated with larger, more established 
      companies and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements. 
      The Fund may invest in MLPs with smaller capitalizations which 
      may have limited financial resources and less liquidity. The Fund may invest 
      in private companies, or companies prior to their initial public 
      offering, which are not subject to Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (“SEC”) reporting and are more vulnerable to market 
      conditions. The Fund is non-diversified and may invest a larger 
      percentage of its assets in fewer issuers than diversified funds. 
      Accordingly, the Fund may be more susceptible to adverse developments 
      affecting any single issuer held in its portfolio and to greater losses 
      resulting from these developments.
    

      The Fund is newly organized and has no operating history. Shares 
      of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      from their net asset value (“NAV”) and the Fund cannot predict 
      whether its shares will trade at, below or above NAV or the initial 
      public offering price. The Fund is subject to leverage risk, 
      which involves risks and special considerations including the likelihood 
      of greater volatility of NAV, market price and dividend rate of the 
      shares than a comparable portfolio without leverage; the risk that 
      fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings and short-term debt or in 
      the interest or dividend rates on any leverage that the Fund must pay 
      will reduce returns; the effect of leverage in a declining market, which 
      is likely to cause a greater decline in the NAV of the shares than if 
      the Fund were not leveraged, which may result in a greater decline in 
      the market price of the shares. The Fund’s investments in derivative 
      instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, 
      and may have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Investments 
      in derivative instruments may be harder to value, subject to greater 
      volatility and more likely subject to changes in tax treatment than 
      other investments. An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all 
      investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The 
      Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
