Richard P Shea's Experience
Title: 
               Company: Cornell University
Job Details
               Cornell Cooperative Extension of Fulton and Montgomery Counties is a community-based educational outreach agency with state and national networks. The Cooperative Extension System was formally established with the passage of the federal Smith Lever Act in 1914 with a county, state and federal cooperative funding government partnership. Today, through a partnership with USDA, Cornell University, Fulton and Montgomery County Governments, and other funders, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Fulton and Montgomery Counties addresses critical and emerging issues for individuals, families and communities. Extension of research knowledge through learning partnerships is the foundation of the Smith Lever Act preamble that states the purpose of extension work, "to aid in defusing among the people of the United States useful and practical information on agriculture, home economics and subjects relating thereto and to encourage the application of the same." Today, Cornell Cooperative Extension of Fulton and Montgomery Counties' educational outreach programming -- in family and youth development, agricultural profitability, nutrition and food safety, environment and labor force enhancement -- is still true to its core purpose and mission established at the beginning of this century. Cornell Cooperative Extension of Fulton and Montgomery Counties' educational outreach programs are responsive to new research findings, and the social, technological, economic and/or political changes that cause us to look at and respond to situations differently today than yesterday and differently tomorrow than today. As society and community issues become increasingly complex, decision-making and problem-solving skills become increasingly important, CCE-F/MC educational outreach programs focus on helping constituents evaluate alternatives, assess risks and ask the right questions to solve their problems.

, a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing entinostat and SNDX-6352 in multiple cancer indications, today announced that Richard P. Shea is stepping down from his position on the Syndax Board of Directors and is joining the Company as Chief Financial Officer, effective February 13, 2017. Mr. Shea has more than 30 years of experience in a range of financial and advisory roles in the biotechnology industry, most recently serving as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. as well as the chair of the Audit Committee of Syndax's Board of Directors.        









"I am very pleased to welcome Rick to the Syndax executive team at this pivotal time as we advance entinostat and SNDX-6352 in multiple clinical studies. Rick has years of valuable experience building successful public companies and providing strong financial leadership. As a Board member, he has been an active contributor to our growth and he will be instrumental on our leadership team as we build Syndax and work to achieve our vision of advancing effective and safe medicines that address the unmet medical needs of cancer patients," said Briggs W. Morrison, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Syndax.


                                        








Before being named Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Momenta in July 2007, Mr. Shea served as its Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since October 2003. Prior to joining Momenta, he served as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Variagenics Inc., a publicly traded pharmacogenomics company, that was merged with Hyseq Pharmaceuticals Inc., and as Vice President, Finance of Genetics Institute, Inc., a publicly traded biotechnology company, which was acquired by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which was then acquired by Pfizer, Inc. Mr. Shea received an A.B. from Princeton University and an M.B.A. from the Public Management Program at Boston University.


                                        








"I look forward to joining Syndax as a member of its executive team at this exciting time and helping the team deliver on its vision for the future," said Mr. Shea. "In my new operational role with the Company, I am eager to contribute to our mission of realizing a future in which cancer patients live longer and better lives than previously possible."


                                        








Allan L. Shaw, Chief Financial Officer, is leaving the Company to pursue other opportunities and his resignation is effective February 13, 2017. He will work closely with Rick to ensure an orderly transition of finance activities through the end of February.


                                        








"I want to sincerely thank Allan for his contributions as a key member of Syndax's leadership team. Allan helped lead the Company from our initial public offering through the acquisition of our second proprietary asset as we continue to build out our pipeline. We are grateful for his work with Syndax," said Briggs W. Morrison, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Syndax.


                                        








Upon the effective date of his appointment as the Company's Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Shea will resign from his positions as a member of Syndax's Board of Directors and as Chair of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Company's Board of Directors has elected Pierre Legault as the Chair of the Audit Committee to replace Mr. Shea.

Syndax is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing an innovative pipeline of combination therapies in multiple cancer indications. Our lead product candidate, entinostat, which was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA following positive results from our Phase 2b clinical trial, ENCORE 301, is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial for advanced hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer. Syndax is developing entinostat, which has direct effects on both cancer cells and immune regulatory cells, and SNDX-6352, an anti-CSF-1R monoclonal antibody, to enhance the body's immune response on tumors that have shown sensitivity to immunotherapy. Entinostat is being evaluated as a combination therapeutic in Phase 1b/2 clinical trials with Merck & Co., Inc. for non-small cell lung cancer and melanoma; with Genentech, Inc. for TNBC; and with Pfizer Inc. and Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, for ovarian cancer. SNDX-6352 is being evaluated in a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial and is expected to be developed to treat a variety of cancers.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
