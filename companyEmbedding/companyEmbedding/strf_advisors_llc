Advisory












Process Enhancement


Legacy trade management processes and liquidity panels at many asset managers suffer from today's risk-averse bank LPs while failing to capitalize on new LPs and algo execution. Process enhancement through Tixall can save NAV while helping to satisfy the fiduciary responsibilities of the asset manager.









Total Cost of Implementation


Improving on the standard TCA model, Tixall develops a total market view to gauge pre-trade market conditions and to optimize execution across models and platforms.  The net result is minimized NAV slippage, with cost attribution and ongoing process refinements.









Managed Execution


Utilizing an optimized set of the most technologically advanced trading platforms in combination with best-available trading algorithms, Tixall is uniquely positioned to help your firm avoid alpha leakage and reduce risk.









Overlay Management


Tixall can manage the FX risk associated with your international asset portfolio. We have systematic models that span macroeconomic and quantitative factors to manage to a fixed hedge coverage ratio or to dynamically manage currency subject to cross-asset relationships.









Corporate Risk Management


Tixall works with corporate treasury groups on a range of risk managment topics including benchmarking and dynamic hedging. With the significant changes that have and continue to occur in market liquidity, accessing, extending and managing liquidity groups are hot-button issues.







Operating as an SEC-Registered Investment Advisor, Tixall works for clients in a fiduciary capacity without the conflicts of interest endemic to so much of the FX market.










Client Testimonial




"With their depth and breadth of knowledge, Tixall worked as an extension to our team to ensure a successful project.  Their input was impactful and positively affected our project. We will be using them again in the future.â
Robert J. FleschlerPresident and CEO, Seabury Global Markets
