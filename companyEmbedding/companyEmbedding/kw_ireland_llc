Eurostar makes travel fast and convenient.


 


	Eurostar: The Chunnel is just the beginning.
 


	The best way to travel between the heart of London and Paris or Brussels, Eurostar trains carry more travelers between its destinations than all airlines traveling these routes combined. And that’s not surprising, considering Eurostar’s city-center terminals, record-breaking travel times, choice of frequent departures, and classes of service (Economy, Comfort, Premier) catering to all budgets and the unique needs of the modern traveler. New for 2015, take Eurostar directly from London to cities in the south of France including Lyon, Avignon and Marseille.

	Eurostar trains reach top speeds of up to 186mph, keeping journey times at about two hours -- thanks in part to the engineering marvel that is the Channel Tunnel. Fast journey times also make fabulous day-trips possible. Disneyland Paris? Oui! Or imagine taking the train from London to Paris; enjoying breakfast in London, lunch in Paris and dinner back in London!

	Beyond travel from London to Paris, you’ll find seasonal services to the French Alps ski resort of Bourg St Moritz in winter and Avignon in the summer. Don’t forget going from London to Brussels is just as easily. In fact, Eurostar also connects with rail services to over 100 destinations across Europe, so you will arrive at Europe’s favorite cities relaxed and ready to go.

	As if that isn’t incentive enough to trade up to the Eurostar, consider the Eurostar 2 for 1 Cultural Offer. This discount program in London, Paris and Brussels offers holders of Eurostar tickets “2 for 1” entry into 15 museums and galleries within 5 days of arrival at your destination.

Are you traveling with a rail pass?


                    Yes


                    No
 

A rail pass entitles you to travel on European trains in a specific geographic area, for a specific number of days. If you are planning on taking three or more train trips, a rail pass is often more cost effective than individual train tickets.
