Dennis E. Nixon

üîä Listen to this Post

Dennis E. Nixon
CEO, International Bank of Commerce ‚Äì Laredo, Texas
Chairman, International Bancshares Corporation
As the principal architect behind the unprecedented growth of International Bancshares Corporation and International Bank of Commerce, Dennis E. Nixon is widely recognized as one of the nation‚Äôs leading banking authorities and executives.
Since joining IBC in 1975, Nixon has been instrumental in International Bancshares Corporation‚Äôs ranking as the largest minority-owned bank organization in the United States. Nixon‚Äôs knowledge in all areas of banking was pivotal in the development of IBC‚Äôs extensive acquisition and expansion efforts.
The IBC family of banks has assets of $11.9 billion with hundreds of full-service branches, and hundreds more ATMs, throughout communities in Texas and Oklahoma.
 - Advertisement -IBC‚Äôs strategic development designed by Nixon and his leadership team is best summed up in the company‚Äôs credo, ‚ÄúWe Do More.‚Äù The bank‚Äôs outstanding growth and consistent performance with Nixon at the helm is what sets it apart from other institutions.
Internationally, Nixon was instrumental in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In May of 2008, IBC was recognized with the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs Good Neighbor Award for the bank‚Äôs contribution to the passage of NAFTA, on its 15th anniversary. Nixon has also been actively involved in its financial development, which has occurred between the U.S. and Mexico.
Nixon‚Äôs approach to banking, in which all customers large and small are cherished, is that which he describes as¬†‚Äúlocal.‚Äù This unorthodox business environment has been achieved through years of building outstanding rapport with the communities IBC serves. This is clearly visible as he is avidly involved in the community and gives of his time willingly.
Nixon promotes generosity and volunteerism from his employees by encouraging them to participate in charitable events. Through his selfless example, almost 70 percent of IBC employees participate in civic activities with various non-profit organizations. This commitment resulted in IBC receiving the Governor‚Äôs Volunteer Award for the State of Texas.
His myriad of civic involvements, awards and recognitions have been on a national and international level. Other¬†recognitions include the Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame Award, the Paul Harris Fellow Award given by Rotary International for outstanding community service, and the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award given by the State of Israel for outstanding services to humanity.
In 2006, Dennis Nixon was inducted into the prestigious Texas Business Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was elected to serve on the board of directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce, and in 2008 he received the International Citizen Award from the World Affairs Council of San Antonio.
He was selected to be the recipient of the Mr. South Texas 2010 honor by the Washington‚Äôs Birthday Celebration Association. Most recently the Laredo Chamber of Commerce recognized him with their Visionary Award.
Other civic activities that Nixon participates in include the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the Boys and Girls Club of Laredo, United Way of Laredo, Legatus and other similar organizations to improve the health and quality of life for citizens of Laredo and South Texas.
Nixon is Past President of the Laredo Chamber of Commerce as well as the Laredo Development Foundation. He is also a founding member of the Association of South Texas Communities and the Alliance for Security and Trade, bipartisan organizations for the betterment of South Texas. Nixon currently serves on the Board of Visitors of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX.
Nixon is a graduate of the University of Texas. He is married to Elma ‚ÄúBavi‚Äù H. Nixon, and has three children: Denise Nixon Bunk, Jonathan A. Nixon and Kristina E. Nixon Netzer; and five grandchildren, Samantha Rose Bunk, Charles Davis Bunk, Jonathan Dennis Nixon, Sebastian Rolf Nixon and Olivia Katherine Netzer.

					Dennis E. Nixon¬†
				

CEO of International Bank of Commerce, Laredo, Texas  Chairman, International Bancshares Corporation



As the principal architect behind the unprecedented growth of International Bancshares Corporation and International Bank of Commerce, Dennis E. Nixon is widely recognized as one of the nation‚Äôs leading banking authorities and executives. Since joining IBC in 1975, Nixon has been instrumental in International Bancshares Corporation‚Äôs ranking as the largest minority-owned bank organization in the United States, one of the largest independent banks in Texas and Oklahoma. Nixon‚Äôs knowledge in all areas of banking was pivotal in the development of IBC‚Äôs extensive acquisition and expansion efforts. The IBC family of banks has assets of $11.8 billion with hundreds of full-service branches, and hundreds more ATMs, throughout communities in Texas and Oklahoma. 
IBC‚Äôs strategic development designed by Nixon and his leadership team is best summed up in the company‚Äôs credo, ‚ÄúWe Do More.‚Äù The bank‚Äôs outstanding growth and consistent performance with Nixon at the helm is what sets it apart from other institutions. 
Internationally, Nixon was instrumental in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In May of 2008, IBC was recognized with the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce‚Äôs Good Neighbor Award for the bank‚Äôs contribution to the passage of NAFTA on its 15th anniversary. Nixon has also been actively involved in the financial development which has occurred between the U.S. and Mexico. 
Nixon‚Äôs approach to banking, in which all customers large and small are cherished, is that which he describes as ‚Äúlocal.‚Äù This unorthodox business environment has been achieved through years of building outstanding rapport with the communities IBC serves. This is clearly visible as he is deeply involved in the community and gives of his time willingly. Nixon promotes generosity and volunteerism from his employees by encouraging them to participate in community and charitable events. Through his selfless example, almost 70 percent of IBC employees participate in civic activities with various non-profit organizations. This commitment resulted in IBC receiving the Governor‚Äôs Volunteer Award for the State of Texas. 
His myriad of civic involvements, awards and recognitions have been on a national and international level. Other recognitions include the Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame Award, the Paul Harris Fellow Award given by Rotary International for outstanding community service, and the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award given by the State of Israel for outstanding services to humanity. In 2006, Dennis Nixon was inducted into the prestigious Texas Business Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was elected to serve on the board of directors of the United States Chamber of Commerce, and in 2008 he received the International Citizen Award from the World Affairs Council of San Antonio. He was selected to be the recipient of the Mr. South Texas 2010 honor by the Washington‚Äôs Birthday Celebration Association. Most recently the Laredo Chamber of Commerce recognized him with their Visionary Award. In 2016, Nixon and his wife received the Distinguished Community Service Award from the Chabad Center for Jewish Life and Learning at their annual L‚ÄôChaim Event in San Antonio, Texas. 
Other civic activities that Nixon participates in include the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the Boys and Girls Club of Laredo, United Way of Laredo, Legatus and other similar organizations to improve the health and quality of life for citizens of Laredo and South Texas. Nixon is Past President of the Laredo Chamber of Commerce as well as the Laredo Development Foundation. Nixon currently serves as a senior member on the Board of Visitors of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, TX. 
Nixon is a graduate of the University of Texas. He is married to Elma ‚ÄúBavi‚Äù H. Nixon, and has three children: Denise Nixon Bunk, Jonathan A. Nixon and Kristina E. Nixon Netzer; and five grandchildren, Samantha Rose Bunk, Charles Davis Bunk, Jonathan Dennis Nixon, Sebastian Rolf Nixon and Olivia Katherine Netzer.

Dennis Nixon Biography :


As the principal architect behind the unprecedented growth of International Bancshares Corporation and International Bankof Commerce, Dennis E. Nixon is widely recognized as one of the nationÔøΩs leading banking authorities and executives.Since joining IBC in 1975, Nixon has been instrumental in International Bancshares CorporationÔøΩs ranking as the largestminority owned bank organization in the continental United States. NixonÔøΩs knowledge in all areas of banking is pivotal inthe development of IBCÔøΩs extensive acquisition and expansion efforts. The IBC family of banks now has assets of $10.3billion with over 200 full service branches throughout Texas and Oklahoma.IBCÔøΩs strategic development designed by Nixon and his leadership team is best summed up in the companyÔøΩs credo, We DoMore. The bankÔøΩs outstanding growth and consistent performance with Nixon at the helm is what sets it apart from otherinstitutions. Some examples of IBCÔøΩs growth include the 7 day full service In-store banking facilities at grocery stores suchas H.E.B., Wal-Mart, Kroger, RandallÔøΩs and shopping malls in Laredo, Corpus Christi, the Rio Grande Valley, Houston, andSan Antonio. NixonÔøΩs vision is to expand by providing the convenience of banking where people shop. Internationally,Nixon was instrumental in the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement. He has also been actively involved inits financial development, which has occurred between the U.S. and Mexico over the last decade.NixonÔøΩs approach to banking, in which all customers large and small retain the same value, is that which he describes aslocal. This unorthodox business environment has been achieved through years of building outstanding rapport with thecommunities IBC serves. This is clearly visible as he is avidly involved in the community and gives of his time incessantly.Nixon promotes generosity and volunteerism from his employees by encouraging them to participate in charitable events.Through his selfless example, almost 70 percent of IBC employees willingly participate in civic activities with various nonprofitorganizations. As a result, IBC was selected as the winner of the 2001 GovernorÔøΩs Volunteer Award in the corporatebusinesscategory.For his outstanding generosity, United Way honored Nixon with its acclaimed Platinum CorazÔøΩn Award. His myriad ofcivic involvements, awards and recognitions has been on a national and international level. Other recognitions includethe Junior Achievement Business Hall of Fame Award, the Paul Harris Fellow Award given by Rotary International foroutstanding community service and the Eleanor Roosevelt Humanities Award given by the State of Israel for outstandingservices to humanity.Other civic activities Nixon include the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Society, the Boys and GirlsClub of Laredo, United Way of Laredo and other similar organizations to improve the health and quality of life for citizensof Laredo and the South Texas. Nixon is Past President of the Laredo Chamber of Commerce as well as the LaredoDevelopment Foundation. He is also a founding member of the Association of South Texas Communities, a bipartisanorganization for the betterment of South Texas.Nixon is a graduate of the University of Texas. He is married to Elma Bavi H. Nixon, and has three children: DeniseNixon Bunk, Jonathan A. Nixon and Kristina E.
