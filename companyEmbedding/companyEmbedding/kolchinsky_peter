TRANSLATION & HUNTING


Tab 1

WHO WE ARE
RA Capital Management® (“RA Capital”) is a crossover investment manager dedicated to evidence-based investing in public and private healthcare and life science companies that are developing drugs, medical devices, and diagnostics. The flexibility of its strategy allows RA Capital® to lead private, IPO, and follow-on financings for its portfolio companies, both facilitating the crossover process and allowing management teams to drive value creation with fewer capital concerns from inception through commercialization.
At RA Capital’s core is its TechAtlas research division, a scientifically trained team that maps out competitive landscapes in a continual effort to put data into context, identify breakthroughs, and originate conviction in new ideas. TechAtlas provides RA Capital’s investment team and portfolio companies (see Beyond Capital) with strategic intelligence, market research, and other resources. The team’s understanding of industry best practices is derived from an extensive collection of case studies documenting the impact of clinical trial design, partnership structures, public market dynamics, and many other factors on valuation and business viability.
RA Capital offers an Executive-in-Residence (EIR) program for experienced professionals seeking thought partners and a platform from which to survey diverse competitive landscapes in search of worthy projects, though we also have other models for collaborating with experienced “drug hunters” (see Translation and Hunting).


Tab 2

BEYOND CAPITAL
IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL, RA CAPITAL INVESTS CONSIDERABLE TIME AND RESOURCES INTO HELPING ITS PRIVATE AND PUBLIC PORTFOLIO COMPANIES SUCCEED.

We leverage our TechAtlas platform to identify potential indications as well as partners and acquirers that our portfolio companies may not have considered pursuing, as well as complementary drug candidates and technologies for in-licensing consideration.
Members of our Investment Team take board and/or observer seats when appropriate. We also host board meetings at our offices from time to time, providing access to maps to facilitate strategy discussions.
We help identify candidates for key executive positions at portfolio companies.
Portfolio companies are welcome to explore our maps with us; in certain cases, we may license one or more maps to them.


When appropriate, our team can create a custom map that comprehensively aggregates and organizes R&D opportunities as well as competitive and complementary technologies in those indications.
Portfolio companies have access to the TechAtlas team’s primary scientific and market research; we interview clinicians and KOLs, host Advisory Boards, and attend many academic conferences.
Our literature surveillance team flags discoveries that may be important to portfolio companies.
Our graphics design team helps portfolio companies communicate complex concepts with high quality graphics for their slides and websites, sometimes incorporating TechAtlas map elements.
Our communications team can offer assistance with grant writing and preparation of scientific publications.



Tab 3

TRANSLATION & HUNTING
WE ARE INTERESTED IN BOTH THE NOVEL AND THE RE-IMAGINED.

Discoveries and improvements in chemistry, molecular and cell biology, and material science create novel capabilities that open up new possibilities for tackling previously unsolved challenges.
The rules by which we understand biology are also constantly being defined and revised, revealing new applications for existing technologies and partially-developed drug candidates. Programs we consider worthwhile may form the basis for a new venture.
RA Capital’s TechAtlas platform is designed to systematize the translation of novel science and technology into optimal commercial applications, which both helps our portfolio companies with their pipeline prioritization as well as generates ideas for new venture formation.
In those areas that we have mapped, it typically takes us a few hours to go from a mechanism-inspired idea for treating a disease to knowing the companies that might have relevant clinical and preclinical assets to license, the companies from whom a candidate could be commissioned, trial designs and endpoints, competing and complementary agents, current and future standard of care, market size, comparable pricing, financing strategy, and potential acquirers, all meant to enable a thoughtful first-pass assessment of whether an idea could be worth a much deeper assessment.


The size and efficiency of our team allows us to parallelize the first-pass assessment of many ideas sourced from literature, technology transfer offices, pipelines of large pharma as well as small biotechnology companies, as well as discussions with academic researchers and clinicians.
We welcome experienced drug hunters searching for technologies/candidates and looking to start new companies to collaborate with our team and take advantage of the breadth and depth that the TechAtlas platform has to offer, as well as the capital we manage.
We believe that, when a business proposition is framed correctly, the capital markets have the resources and depth of understanding to fund proper experimental design and solution development, without forcing companies to cut corners, and we have collaborated extensively with other funds that share our philosophy to enable ambitious and capital intensive endeavors.




















"WE OWE A DEBT TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTORED US, AND WE IN TURN HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TURN OUR HARD WON LESSONS INTO A SOLID FOUNDATION FOR OUR INDUSTRY'S EMERGING INNOVATORS AND LEADERS."

RA Capital has a particular interest in funding innovation that contributes to the following healthcare themes, which converge on a higher quality and more cost-effective delivery of significant healthcare outcomes. These investment themes may change in the future.



PREVENTION & CURES



Diagnostics and interventions that are demonstrated to prevent and/or cure disease are of greater value than those that ameliorate symptoms and delay disease progression, especially if only incrementally. We are interested in ambitious objectives, hard outcomes measures, and proper controls.





COST-EFFECTIVE DIAGNOSTICS & INTERVENTIONS



Most of the new products coming to market in the next few years will have to compete in a world that increasingly values cost effectiveness. We are interested in seeing data from Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials that inform models of cost effectiveness, especially with endpoints that are recognized by private and public payors.





GENETIC TESTING & PERSONALIZED MEDICINE



We are looking for companies with low-cost technologies that have a competitive advantage in genetic testing and/or other diagnostics, including exclusive access to relevant, well-curated patient samples and healthcare outcomes. We have particular interest in a number of current niche areas, including carrier tests, prenatal tests, and the combination of pre-implantation diagnosis/IVF, because we believe these technologies will increase in importance and availability with the advent of low-cost sequencing.





PATIENT/PHYSICIAN CONVENIENCE



There will continue to be a need for technological improvements that meaningfully transform how healthcare is delivered, converting a treatment that would normally require a hospital admission into an out-patient procedure, allowing a patient to take an oral pill or self-administer a subcutaneous injection at home instead of having to see a physician to receive an IV infusion, or delivering a rapid diagnostic test at the point of care instead of requiring a second appointment to discuss the results. However, until we see more common sense in the way in which physicians and hospitals are compensated for their services and patients are billed for their utilization, companies will need to remain mindful of the myriad ways in which the healthcare system’s incentive schemes cause counterintuitive practices to remain entrenched (e.g., in the US, physicians in private practice have a financial incentive, a.k.a. “ASP+6%”, to prescribe expensive IV-administered drugs and therefore are disincentivized from switching to a cheaper drug or a more convenient subcutaneous form of the same drug for which there may not be the same incentive).





SMALL-MOLECULE REPLACEMENTS FOR BIOLOGICS



Although it is clear from the FDA guidance documents on biosimilars that there will be high barriers to allowing pharmacy substitution of biologics with lower cost biosimilars/biogenerics and therefore biologics are unlikely to ever be commoditized in the same way that small-molecules are when patents expire, it is hard to believe that the global healthcare system will be able to indefinitely tolerate biologic drug cost inflation. We are interested in small-molecule drugs that can deliver comparable efficacy/safety to biologics, ideally with greater convenience to patients (e.g., oral pills vs. injectables). We expect that, all else being equal, public and private payors will favor such “genericizable” small-molecule drugs over “ungenericizable” biologics.

GENERAL
PUBLICATIONS

The biotechnology industry is a vibrant community of researchers, business executives, and investors often charting new territory in the pursuit of innovation. After many years of investing in both public and private companies across the therapeutic, diagnostic, and device landscapes, our team has come to recognize some of the patterns of success and failure. We believe in openly contributing what we know; we have shared our perspective on valuation methods, business models, clinical trial design, and other best practices gleaned from hundreds of case studies in boardrooms, classrooms, conferences, and articles.
For example, we have helped entrepreneurs identify comparables for their businesses, guided management teams in prioritizing their development programs, helped companies gauge when they might be IPO-ready, and informed companies’ decision about how much capital to raise, when to raise it, which banks to work with, and which investors to talk to.
On occasion, we have also had the pleasure of speaking with students near and far (University of Helsinki currently holds the record/tops the charts/is the current leader for furthest distance). We typically discuss trends in innovation, how we invest, and risks in the healthcare and life science industries; we hope they remember us when they someday launch companies and are looking for capital.
We do our best to make time for outreach and welcome all queries –

 Biography




 




June 27, 2015


 May Hedge Funds: Best, Worst, Biggest  Peter Kolchinsky was 4 years old when he arrived in Milwaukee with his parents under a program reuniting Soviet Jews with their relatives in the U.S. His father, a computer engineer, started a quality-control company that scanned CDs for errors. Pressed to excel in school, the younger Kolchinsky earned a bachelor’s degree in biology at Cornell University and then a doctorate in virology at Harvard University.

   Hedge Funds-News  Peter Kolchinsky’s RA Capital Has Been Very Active This Month    Published on November 12, 2013 at 12:03 pm by  
                                Javier Hasse
                                  in Hedge Funds,News                 Since the beginning of November, Peter Kolchinsky‘s RA Capital Management has informed the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it’s increased its positions in two of its holdings: Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ:DVAX) and Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHN). The fund now owns almost 26 million shares from Dynavax Technologies, up from 6 million previously declared. This accounts for a 9.9% stake in the company. RA Capital has also acquired about 3.6 million Achillion Pharmaceuticals shares over the last month. Following the reported transactions, RA now owns almost 20.5 million shares of the pharmaceutical company, valued at approximately $ 51.6 million. Owning about 21.2% of the firm, it stands as the largest bull amongst the hedge funds that we track, followed by Daniel Gold’s Qvt Financial.  RA Capital has also become Dynavax’s largest hedge fund bull, having surpassed Arthur B Cohen and Joseph Healey’s Healthcor Management Lp, which holds about 17.6 million shares, and Samuel Isaly’s Orbimed Advisors, owner of almost 9 million shares. Both of the aforementioned investments fit perfectly into RA Capital’s equity portfolio, composed mostly of life-sciences and drug development companies (more than 90% of the total holdings). The fund looks for companies with promising technologies and/or products. This strategy has helped the fund triple its initial investment -$4 million- in its initial two years; its portfolio is now worth more than $750 million. Dynavax Technologies, for example, provides appealing prospects going forward (especially in terms of product development). The company focuses on the treatment and prevention of allergies, infectious diseases, and chronic inflammatory diseases, usually seeking to alter immune system responses in very specific ways. Recently, it made the design of its next clinical study for its HEPLISAV drug -an investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine- public: “It will be an 8,000 subject, Phase 3, observer-blinded, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter trial of the safety and immunogenicity of HEPLISAV compared with Engerix-B in adults 18 to 70 years of age.” The motivations for RA Capital to invest in Achillion, a pharmaceutical firm focused on innovative treatments for infectious diseases, are not as clear. The FDA recently refused to remove a “hold” on clinical trials of Sovaprevir, an NS3 protease inhibitor in the treatment of hepatitis C. Consequently, the stock plummeted from more than $7 a piece in September to around $2.5 each in November, opening an attractive entry point for RA Capital, which seized the opportunity to make a value play.
