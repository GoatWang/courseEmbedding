FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

About Sandstorm Gold


 
Sandstorm Gold provides financing to gold mining companies through gold stream and royalty agreements. Stream and royalty finance involves Sandstorm making an upfront payment to a mining partner that is in need of capital to build their mine, refinance their obligations, complete an acquisition or for various other reasons. In exchange for that upfront payment, Sandstorm receives the right to purchase a percentage of the gold produced from the mine (in the case of a stream) or a portion of the revenue generated from the mine (in the case of a royalty). Since 2009, Sandstorm has compiled a portfolio of 160 streams and royalties, of which 20 of the underlying assets are currently producing gold. Sandstorm plans to continue growing the company through accretive acquisitions of gold streams and royalties.
 


A Lower Risk Mining Investment


 
Building and operating gold mines is difficult work. Gold mines, in the best of situations, have countless operational processes to coordinate and perform in synchronization in order to function economically. Capital expenditure overruns, sustaining capital requirements and inflating costs are just a few of the challenges that mining companies face when trying to deliver returns to shareholders.
The stream and royalty business model minimizes the typical downside risks in mining investment because there is no obligation for Sandstorm to contribute additional capital after the upfront payment is made. Sandstorm leaves the job of building and operating the gold mines to its partners while using its expertise to supply them with financial support. This allows Sandstorm to focus on accretive growth while creating an attractive gold investment for the public.

Corporate Due Diligence


 
Before completing a gold stream or royalty agreement with a mining partner, Sandstorm undertakes a thorough due diligence process. The process begins with a desktop analysis that evaluates the economics of the mine, assuming that all aspects of the project will work out as planned. Most projects fail this stage. The ones that pass are scrutinized from a technical point of view and management runs sensitivity analysis to search for potential fatal flaw areas. After that step Sandstorm hires geological consultants and technical experts that specialize in the deposit type, location and jurisdiction of the project in question. Those projects that make it this far in the corporate due diligence process are subject to a comprehensive site visit, which assesses metallurgical, engineering and geologic resource issues.

Corporate Responsibility
Sandstorm Gold Ltd.





Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (“Sandstorm Gold”, “Sandstorm” or the “Company”) is in the business of providing financing solutions to companies in the mining sector, principally through stream and royalty transactions, enabling resource companies to further the exploration, development and operations at a mining property. The properties over which the Company holds stream and royalty interests are owned and operated by independent mining companies and Sandstorm does not exercise control or influence over the activities of the property owners. However, Sandstorm is committed to furthering the responsible development of mineral projects and the sustainable extraction of metals through its financial investments, including with respect to environmental factors (e.g., toxic emissions and waste, carbon emissions, biodiversity and land use, water stress), social considerations (e.g., occupational health and safety, labour management) and governance issues (e.g., corruption and instability, corporate governance); collectively (“ESG”).
ESG – INDIRECT EXPOSURE
The Stream & Royalty Business Model
Sandstorm Gold provides an alternative source of capital to the mining industry in the form of stream and royalty financing arrangements. In exchange for upfront capital, Sandstorm receives a portion of the future metal or revenue generated from a mining operation but being a financier, the Company does not directly own or operate the projects and has indirect exposure to ESG issues that can arise during the life cycle of a resource project. Sandstorm’s indirect exposure to ESG risk factors are mitigated in part by the Company’s diversified portfolio of over 150 streams and royalties, over 20 of which are generating cash flow to the Company. There is no evidence of a statistical relationship or positive correlation between the ESG successes and challenges at the various mining projects within the Company’s portfolio of streams and royalties, indicating a clear diversification benefit to Sandstorm’s portfolio approach.
Sandstorm is committed to furthering sustainable development in the mining and metals industry through its investments and seeks to address ESG risks through the Company’s due diligence process that guides its investment decisions.
Investment Due Diligence
While Sandstorm does not control or influence the operations of any of the properties over which it has a stream or royalty interest, the Company recognizes that its financial investments may contribute to ESG factors. The Company’s strategy to mitigate ESG risks involves a thorough investigation and evaluation of the risk factors related to a mineral property prior to making an investment. Once a Sandstorm investment is made, the Company has no control over the project or the various ESG risks that can be associated with a mine. It is therefore the aim of Sandstorm’s due diligence process to successfully identify projects and companies that will act and operate in a responsible and sustainable manner.
Sandstorm’s management team and board of directors use a multi-disciplinary approach when evaluating potential transactions. The due diligence team consists of professionals with experience and expertise in the fields of geology, mining, metallurgy, engineering, and finance. By conducting a robust and detailed due diligence process, Sandstorm endeavours to invest in projects with relatively low ESG risk. The due diligence process involves, among other things, thorough desktop studies, the engagement of expert consultants, extensive interviews with the project management team, site visits as well as in depth deliberation. Elements of Sandstorm’s due diligence process related to ESG factors include, but are not limited to, the following considerations:
Environment

Geology – is the mineralisation located in or near an environmentally sensitive or protected area?
Biodiversity and land use – what is the proposed development footprint and how does that impact the region’s biodiversity? What offsets or mitigation measures are contemplated?
Metallurgy – what are the risks associated with the process flow sheet including potential discharge and reagent use?   
Water usage/management – has the project’s hydrology and hydrogeology been properly studied and understood? Are there appropriate water management/usage plans in place?
Tailings management – what are the risk factors associated with the tailings management plan, both during operations and post-closure?
Assessment – has a proper environmental and social impact assessment been completed?

Social

Management team – is the management team and board of directors of good repute and have they shown integrity and competency in their business?
Community engagement – has the resource company engaged with the community where the project is located, including indigenous peoples where applicable?
Social license – does the resource company have a social license to explore, develop and mine the property?
Health and safety record -  has the operation, or previous operations run by the management team in question, had disruptions caused by workplace accidents?
Labour availability – is there a local workforce available? If not, what are the implications of an outside workforce? Are training programs available for local and indigenous workers?
Labour management – has the operation, or previous operations run by the management team in question, had labour related work stoppages (e.g., strikes and lockouts)?
Child labour – is child labour being employed? Sandstorm is firmly opposed to child labour and forced labour practices. The Company’s Code of Business Conduct & Ethics promotes compliance with Canadian governmental laws, rules and regulations which strictly condemn practices that involve child labour and forced labour.
Compensation – how is the workforce compensated? Are the company, employee, and investor incentives aligned?
Resettlement – are there resettlement requirements to development the project? If so, has the community been dealt with on an open and fair basis with appropriate consultation?
Deal structure – can a stream/royalty transaction be structured in such a way as to mitigate some of the potential social risks?

Governance

Political stability – is the asset located in a politically stable climate? Is the political climate improving or deteriorating?
Regulatory framework – is there a developed regulatory framework for mineral exploration and mine development? Are there permitting risks related to the jurisdiction in question?
Corruption and instability – has the management team been involved in or been accused of corruption?
Corporate governance – does the resource company adhere to corporate governance best practices?
Accounting – does the resource company exhibit a high degree of accounting and operational transparency?

After making an investment, Sandstorm monitors the ESG performance of its counterparties on an ongoing basis. At least annually, where applicable, the Company reviews the corporate and social responsibility reports that are published by its stream and royalty partners.
Sandstorm endorses the ICMM Principals, the IFC Environmental, Health and Safety Guidelines for Mining and the e3Plus Framework for Responsible Exploration.
ESG – DIRECT EXPOSURE
Sandstorm Gold has policies and programs in place to manage the ESG risk factors that are directly related to the Company. The social policies and programs discussed below are reflective of the Company’s commitment to a high standard of employee management practices including a safe and inclusive workplace, competitive compensation and benefits, training and learning opportunities and channels for employee engagement. Sandstorm also seeks to incorporate industry best practices with regards to governance, is committed to conducting its business with integrity, maintaining high ethical standards and contributing to the community in which it operates.
Environment
Sandstorm’s direct environmental impact and carbon footprint is small. The Company operates in an office environment with a small workforce of 17 full-time employees. The Company’s head office is situated in a LEED Gold certified building in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
Social – Health & Safety, Labour Management
Health & Safety
Sandstorm has a health and safety policy in place that provides a guiding framework for ensuring a safe workplace for its employees. The aim of the policy is to ensure compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and to minimize exposure to health and safety risks. As Sandstorm’s principal activity is providing financing to other businesses in the mining industry, the Company’s exposure to health and safety risks is limited.
Click here to review the Health and Safety policy.
Workplace Bullying & Harassment
Sandstorm is committed to creating and maintaining a workplace environment which fosters mutual respect, integrity and professional conduct.  In keeping with this commitment, the Company has established a Workplace Bullying and Harassment Policy and a set of reporting/investigation procedures for all employees relating to the issue of workplace bullying and harassment. The Company will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace and will make every reasonable effort to prevent and eliminate such conduct.
Click here to review the Workplace Bullying & Harassment policy.
Diversity
Sandstorm is committed to creating and maintaining a culture of workplace diversity. In keeping with this commitment, Sandstorm has established a diversity policy. “Diversity” is any dimension which can be used to differentiate groups and people from one another and it means the respect for and appreciation of the differences in gender, age, ethnic origin, religion, education, sexual orientation, political belief or disability.
Sandstorm recognizes the benefits arising from employee and board diversity, including a broader pool of high quality employees, improving employee retention, accessing different perspectives and ideas and benefiting from all available talent.  The Company respects and values the perspectives, experiences, cultures and differences that employees possess.

Compensation and Benefits
Sandstorm offers comprehensive compensation and benefits packages and broad-based professional development and training opportunities for its employees. The following principles guide the Company’s overall compensation philosophy:

An appropriate portion of total compensation is variable and linked to achievements, both individual and corporate;
Internal equity is maintained such that individuals in similar jobs are treated fairly; and
The  Company  supports  reasonable  expenses  in  order  that  employees  continuously  maintain  and enhance their skills.

All Sandstorm employees receive a base salary and are considered for incentive bonus compensation annually, at the board’s discretion. Stock-based compensation, extended health benefits, dental benefits and health and wellness benefits are also provided to all staff.

Canadian  and  United  States  securities  laws  prohibit  “insider  trading”  and  impose  restrictions  on  trading in securities while in possession of material undisclosed information. The rules and procedures outlined in the Company’s stock trading policy have been  implemented  in  order  to  prevent  improper  trading  in  the  securities  of  Sandstorm  or of companies with which the Company has a significant business relationship or with which the Company  is proposing to enter into a business transaction.
Click here to review Stock Trading Policy.
Stock Ownership
The board of directors of Sandstorm believes that it is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to align the financial interests of Sandstorm’s executives and non-employee members of the board with those of the Company’s shareholders.  In this regard, the corporate governance & nominating committee of the board has recommended, and the board has adopted, guidelines for minimum stock ownership.
Click here to review the Stock Ownership Guidelines Policy.
Clawback Policy
The  board  of  directors  of  Sandstorm has  adopted a clawback policy in order to maintain a culture of focused, diligent and responsible management which  discourages  conduct  detrimental  to  the  growth  of  the  Company   and to ensure that incentive-based compensation paid by the Company is based upon accurate financial data. The clawback policy applies in the event of a material restatement of the Company’s financial results as a result of material non-compliance with financial reporting requirements.
Click here to review the Clawback Policy.
Anti-Hedging
The objective of the anti-hedging policy is to prohibit those subject to it from directly or indirectly engaging in hedging against future declines in the market value of any securities of the Company through the purchase of financial instruments designed to offset such risk. The board of directors of Sandstorm believes that it is inappropriate for directors, officers or employees of the Company or its respective subsidiary entities or, to the extent practicable, any other person (or their associates) in a special relationship with the Company, to hedge or monetize transactions to lock in the value of holdings in the securities of the Company.  Such transactions, while allowing the holder to own the Company’s securities without the full risks and rewards of ownership, potentially separate the holder’s interests from those of other stakeholders and, particularly in the case of equity securities, from the public shareholders of the Company.

Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (formerly Sandstorm Resources)[1] provides financing for precious metal mining companies in the form of a 'gold streaming' transaction whereby an upfront cash payment is exchanged for a percentage of gold production from the mine.[2] The finance model has also been called a volumetric production payment transaction and originated in the oil and gas sector.[3]
In April 2017 Sandstorm announced it had reached an agreement to acquire Mariana Resources in a share and cash acquisition valuing Mariana at US$4.04 per share. The business combination would create a mid-tier streaming company with 155 streams and royalties. [4]
In Q1 2017 Sandstorm reported record gold equivalent sales of 15,558 ounces, generating revenue of $18.8 million and a net income of $7.0 million. [5]

History[edit]
Sandstorm Resources (now Sandstorm Gold)[1] was founded in 2008, when Nolan Watson and David Awram decided to create a metal streaming company that would be focused on gold acquisitions.[6] Both Watson and Awram were former employees of Silver Wheaton, the first organization to apply this financial model to the mining industry.[7] Sandstorm Gold is a publicly traded company, listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange under the symbol, SSL.[8]
Sandstorm plans to grow and diversify through the acquisition of additional gold streams.[9]
Royalties & Streams[edit]
In Q1 2017 Sandstorm acquired 22 new net smelter return royalties for US$1.9 million. The Company completed transactions with multiple junior mining companies including Kivalliq Energy, Evrim Resources, Tower Resources, Copper Fox Metals, Millrock Resources and Condor Resources. [10]

(formerly Sandstorm Resources)[1] provides financing for precious metal mining companies in the form of a 'gold streaming' transaction whereby an upfront cash payment is exchanged for a percentage of gold production from the mine.[2] The finance model has also been called a volumetric production payment transaction and originated in the oil and gas sector.[3]
In April 2017 Sandstorm announced it had reached an agreement to acquire Mariana Resources in a share and cash acquisition valuing Mariana at US$4.04 per share. The business combination would create a mid-tier streaming company with 155 streams and royalties. [4]
In Q1 2017 Sandstorm reported record gold equivalent sales of 15,558 ounces, generating revenue of $18.8 million and a net income of $7.0 million. [5]

History[edit]
Sandstorm Resources (now Sandstorm Gold)[1] was founded in 2008, when Nolan Watson and David Awram decided to create a metal streaming company that would be focused on gold acquisitions.[6] Both Watson and Awram were former employees of Silver Wheaton, the first organization to apply this financial model to the mining industry.[7] Sandstorm Gold is a publicly traded company, listed on the Toronto Venture Exchange under the symbol, SSL.[8]
Sandstorm plans to grow and diversify through the acquisition of additional gold streams.[9]
Royalties & Streams[edit]
In Q1 2017 Sandstorm acquired 22 new net smelter return royalties for US$1.9 million. The Company completed transactions with multiple junior mining companies including Kivalliq Energy, Evrim Resources, Tower Resources, Copper Fox Metals, Millrock Resources and Condor Resources. [10]

Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (TSX:SSL)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



VANCOUVER, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Sandstorm Gold Ltd. ("Sandstorm" or the "Company") (NYSE MKT: SAND, TSX: SSL) is pleased to provide development and exploration updates at various projects underlying the Company's streams and royalties. 
Sandstorm President & CEO, Nolan Watson stated, "In addition to a number of projects that are developing toward production, more than 400,000 metres of drilling is expected to be completed on Sandstorm royalty properties during 2017. In a year where financing has been difficult to come by for most exploration companies, this is an encouraging development for Sandstorm shareholders." 
— Development Continues at Cerro Moro, Production Expected in 2018 
Yamana Gold Inc. ("Yamana") has reported that development is on schedule at the Cerro Moro project in Argentina. In the first quarter of 2017, 219 metres of underground development was completed. The detailed engineering is slightly ahead of schedule and the completion of the mechanical installation of the processing plant is on track for the end of 2017. The ball and sag mills are now at site, and an ore stockpile continues to be built up. Contractors have begun construction of the tailings dam and the start-up of production is expected in 2018. 
The 2017 exploration budget of US$8 million is part of a four year, US$30 million program to add ounces to the mineral resource at Cerro Moro. Yamana is continuing to infill drill the core Escondida mineral shoots to expand the mineral resource base with 12,000 metres of drilling. Concurrent to this, they will be mapping, sampling, and developing targets near mine concessions. An additional 9,000 metres is budgeted to follow-up on targets identified for further testing. 
During the first half of 2017, Yamana continued to map and sample prospective targets close to the planned mine complex. Drill testing began in late February and 1,059 metres of drilling distributed in 10 holes was completed testing the Carla, Esperanza channel and Martina cut-back targets. 
For more information visit the Yamana website at www.yamana.com and see press release dated May 3, 2017. 
Beginning in 2019, Sandstorm has a silver stream agreement to purchase an amount of silver from Cerro Moro equal to 20% of the silver produced, up to a maximum of 1.2 million ounces of silver annually, until Yamana has delivered to Sandstorm 7.0 million ounces of silver; then 9.0% of the silver produced thereafter for the life of the mine. Sandstorm will make ongoing payments for each ounce of silver received, equal to 30% of the spot price per ounce of silver. 
— Extension of Piaba Gold Deposit at the Aurizona Gold Mine 
Trek Mining Inc. ("Trek") continues to announce drilling results from the ongoing exploration program at their Aurizona gold mine in Brazil ("Aurizona"). The current gold reserves at Aurizona are contained primarily within the Piaba gold deposit, which remains open along strike and at depth. 
Piaba West is a potential 900-metre long extension of the Piaba gold deposit and is the first of several near-mine targets to be drilled as part of Trek's planned 30,000-metre 2017 exploration program at Aurizona. Approximately 7,000 metres of drilling has been completed at Piaba West this year and has successfully demonstrated that the Piaba gold mineralization extends below and up to 350 metres along strike of the Piaba gold deposit reserve pit. Drilling highlights from step-out and infill drill holes at Piaba west include: 

BRAZD529: 1.9 g/t gold over 25.0 metres
BRAZD534: 1.1 g/t gold over 44.5 metres
BRAZD536: 5.7 g/t gold over 8.7 metres, 1.3 g/t gold over 21.0 metres and 1.0 g/t over 11.0 metres
BRAZD538: 2.3 g/t gold over 5.1 metres, and 1.3 g/t gold over 25.3 metres
BRAZP584: 1.5 g/t gold over 43.0 metres including;

6.1 g/t gold over 6.0 metres 
BRAZP587: 19.7 g/t gold over 1.0 metres and 67.1 g/t gold over 5.0 metres including;

329.0 g/t gold over 1.0 metres 
BRAZP591: 1.2 g/t gold over 39.0 metres
BRAZP596: 1.5 g/t gold over 5.0 metres and 5.1 g/t gold over 20.0 metres 

True widths of the mineralized intervals are interpreted to be 60 to 90 percent of the reported lengths. For more information and for complete drill results visit the Trek website at www.trekmining.com and see the press releases dated May 17, 2017, June 27, 2017 and July 25, 2017. 
Sandstorm has a 3% - 5% sliding scale net smelter returns ("NSR") royalty on the Aurizona project. At gold prices less than or equal to US$1,500 per ounce, the royalty is a 3% NSR. In addition, Sandstorm holds a 2% NSR royalty on the Aurizona Greenfields property, a 190,073 hectare package of exploration ground adjacent to the Aurizona project. Trek recently announced an exploration agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Limited ("AngloGold"), whereby AngloGold may invest US$14 million in exploration to earn a 70% interest in Aurizona Greenfields. 
Rambler Announces Drill Results for 2017 Program at the Ming Mine 
Rambler Metals and Mining plc ("Rambler") announced the start of a surface diamond drilling program targeting the depth extension of both the Lower Footwall Zone ("LFZ") and high grade Ming Massive Sulphides ("MMS") at the Ming Mine in Newfoundland, Canada ("Ming"). 
Since commercial production began in 2012, Rambler has been primarily mining the 1807 Zone and has replaced mined material through exploration. The 2017 exploration drill program has again been successful in achieving this goal with the 1807 Zone still open at depth. 
New drilling in the Ming North Zone ("MNZ") has shown continued mineralization at depth. The MNZ is not included in any of the mineral resources or reserve estimates and Rambler has identified it as a potential new source for high grade massive sulphides. 
Highlighted drill results from 2017 include:

True widths are estimate to range between 40%-80% of core lengths. For more information, visit the Rambler website at www.ramblermines.com and see the press release dated June 27, 2017. 
Sandstorm has a gold stream agreement with Rambler to receive 25% of the first 175,000 ounces of gold produced, and 12% of the gold produced thereafter from the Ming mine. 
Entrée Resources Provides Updates on Oyu Tolgoi Underground Development 
Entrée Resources Ltd. ("Entrée") recently provided an update on underground development at the Hugo North project in Mongolia. Hugo North is part of the Oyu Tolgoi mine complex owned by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. and the Government of Mongolia. The focus of activities during the first quarter of 2017 was lateral development, sinking of Shafts 2 and 5, support infrastructure and the convey-to-surface system. The equivalent of approximately one kilometre of lateral development was completed during the first quarter. In the second half of 2017, the sinking of Shaft 2 is expected to reach its final depth of 1,284 metres. Shaft 5 is expected to be completed in early 2018. 
The first physical development on the Entrée/OTLLC joint venture property will be the sinking of Shaft 4 which is expected to commence in 2018 and to be completed in 2021. 
For more information, visit www.entreeresourcesltd.com and see the press releases dated May 9, 2017 and June 19, 2017. 
Sandstorm has a stream agreement to purchase 5.62% of the gold and silver from the Hugo North Extension, 4.26% of the gold and silver from the Heruga deposits, and 0.42% of the copper produced from both the Hugo North Extension and Heruga deposits. These deposits are the northern-most and southern-most, respectively, in the 12 kilometre-long Oyu Tolgoi series of deposits.
— Erdene Expands Mineralization at Bayan Khundii & Altan Nar 
Erdene Resource Development Corp. ("Erdene") is completing a 20,000 metre exploration drill program at the Bayan Khundii project in Mongolia. The drill program is focusing on expanding areas of gold mineralization at the Gold Hill, Striker, and Midfield zones, and to test new mineralized zones elsewhere in the project area. There are two drill rigs on site; one rig is continuing the exploration program while the second drill rig is dedicated to a closer spaced resource delineation program. 
On June 8, 2017, Erdene announced mineralization discovered under cover north of the Midfield Zone that may be the extension of the high-grade corridor that runs northeast from the Gold Hill zone through Striker and now beyond the Midfield zone. Hole BKD-110, located 60 metres north of Midfield, was one of four previously announced step-out holes where visible gold was observed. On July 17, 2017, Erdene announced additional mineralization intersected west of Midfield in drill hole BKD 166. This hole was drilled 50 metres west of previously reported drill hole BKD-100, along the western edge of the Midfield Zone. BKD-100 did not return significant gold mineralization as the hole intersected a syenite intrusion and was speculated to truncate the western extension of Midfield. BKD-166 suggests the syenite encountered in BKD-100 may be smaller and the Midfield mineralization continues west of BKD-100. A series of holes completed south of BKD-166, and west of the Striker Zone returned multiple gold intersections under younger, post mineral cover. Results included 5.0 metres of 4.5 g/t gold within 28.0 metres of 1.4 g/t gold in hole BKD 172. Additional drilling will be required to confirm the true extent of the mineralization in this area. Drilling highlights from the exploration program include: 

BKD-110: 2.8 g/t gold over 108.3 metres including;

2.8 g/t gold over 55.3 metres
3.6 g/t gold over 42 metres including

7.23 g/t gold over 20 metres 
BKD-111: 3.0 g/t gold over 55.4 metres including;

5.3 g/t gold over 25 metres 
BKD-118: 12.8 g/t gold over 10 metres
BKD-122: 0.8 g/t gold over 14 metres including;

4.4 g/t gold over 2 metres and
0.7 g/t gold over 21 metres 
BKD-118: 12.8 g/t gold over 10 metres
BKD-129: 2.6 g/t gold over 20 metres
BKD-166: 1.1 g/t gold over 36.0 metres
BKD-172: 0.7 g/t gold over 66.0 metres 

In addition to the drilling at Bayan Khundii, a total of 1,326 metres of drilling in six drill holes has been completed at Erdene's Altan Nar Project. The objective of the program is to establish continuity of the high-grade gold-polymetallic zone identified in the fourth quarter of 2016. The drill highlights include: 

TND-105: 9.5 g/t AuEq over 14 metres (7.9 g/t gold, 43.7 g/t silver, and 1.8% combined lead-zinc)
TND-104: 3.1 g/t AuEq over 37 metres (2.2 g/t gold, 29.7 g/t silver, and 0.8% combined lead-zinc) 

Reported intervals are not true width. At this time, there is insufficient data with respect to the shape of the mineralized system to calculate true orientations in space. For more information and for complete drill results visit Erdene's website at www.erdene.com and see the press releases dated May 30, 2017, June 8, 2017 and July 17, 2017. 
Sandstorm holds a 2% NSR royalty on Erdene's Bayan Khundii and Altan Nar projects.
— Tower Reports 247 metres of 0.51% Cu and 0.3 g/t Au at Rabbit North 
Tower Resources Ltd. ("Tower") reported initial drill results from their flagship Rabbit North project in British Columbia, Canada. The results include long intervals of porphyry style copper and gold mineralization in several holes at the Western Magnetite Zone. The 2017 diamond drill program is ongoing at Rabbit North and the remaining assay results are expected in the coming weeks. 
The Rabbit North project comprises over 16,000 hectares in the infrastructure-rich copper and gold porphyry belt of southern British Columbia. The producing New Afton copper-gold mine is located about 14 kilometres east of the main Rabbit North targets, and the Highland Valley Copper Mine operated by Teck Resources Ltd. is located 28 kilometres to the west.

Note: Copper Equivalent (CuEq) is used to express the combined value of copper and gold as a percentage of copper, for illustrative purposes. No allowances have been made for recovery losses that would occur in a mining scenario. CuEq is calculated on the basis of US$2.30 per pound of copper and US$1,240 per troy ounce of gold, using the formula: CuEq = [(%Cu)(22.0462)($lbCu)+(gptAu)(1/31.1035)($ozAu)]/[(22.0462)($lbCu). 

 
Width refers to drill hole intercept. True widths have not been determined. For more information and complete drill results, visit Tower's website at www.towerresources.ca and view the press dated July 11, 2017.

Sandstorm Gold Ltd. (TSX:SSL)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



VANCOUVER, July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ - Sandstorm Gold Ltd. ("Sandstorm" or the "Company") (NYSE MKT: SAND, TSX: SSL) is pleased to provide development and exploration updates at various projects underlying the Company's streams and royalties. 
Sandstorm President & CEO, Nolan Watson stated, "In addition to a number of projects that are developing toward production, more than 400,000 metres of drilling is expected to be completed on Sandstorm royalty properties during 2017. In a year where financing has been difficult to come by for most exploration companies, this is an encouraging development for Sandstorm shareholders." 
— Development Continues at Cerro Moro, Production Expected in 2018 
Yamana Gold Inc. ("Yamana") has reported that development is on schedule at the Cerro Moro project in Argentina. In the first quarter of 2017, 219 metres of underground development was completed. The detailed engineering is slightly ahead of schedule and the completion of the mechanical installation of the processing plant is on track for the end of 2017. The ball and sag mills are now at site, and an ore stockpile continues to be built up. Contractors have begun construction of the tailings dam and the start-up of production is expected in 2018. 
The 2017 exploration budget of US$8 million is part of a four year, US$30 million program to add ounces to the mineral resource at Cerro Moro. Yamana is continuing to infill drill the core Escondida mineral shoots to expand the mineral resource base with 12,000 metres of drilling. Concurrent to this, they will be mapping, sampling, and developing targets near mine concessions. An additional 9,000 metres is budgeted to follow-up on targets identified for further testing. 
During the first half of 2017, Yamana continued to map and sample prospective targets close to the planned mine complex. Drill testing began in late February and 1,059 metres of drilling distributed in 10 holes was completed testing the Carla, Esperanza channel and Martina cut-back targets. 
For more information visit the Yamana website at www.yamana.com and see press release dated May 3, 2017. 
Beginning in 2019, Sandstorm has a silver stream agreement to purchase an amount of silver from Cerro Moro equal to 20% of the silver produced, up to a maximum of 1.2 million ounces of silver annually, until Yamana has delivered to Sandstorm 7.0 million ounces of silver; then 9.0% of the silver produced thereafter for the life of the mine. Sandstorm will make ongoing payments for each ounce of silver received, equal to 30% of the spot price per ounce of silver. 
— Extension of Piaba Gold Deposit at the Aurizona Gold Mine 
Trek Mining Inc. ("Trek") continues to announce drilling results from the ongoing exploration program at their Aurizona gold mine in Brazil ("Aurizona"). The current gold reserves at Aurizona are contained primarily within the Piaba gold deposit, which remains open along strike and at depth. 
Piaba West is a potential 900-metre long extension of the Piaba gold deposit and is the first of several near-mine targets to be drilled as part of Trek's planned 30,000-metre 2017 exploration program at Aurizona. Approximately 7,000 metres of drilling has been completed at Piaba West this year and has successfully demonstrated that the Piaba gold mineralization extends below and up to 350 metres along strike of the Piaba gold deposit reserve pit. Drilling highlights from step-out and infill drill holes at Piaba west include: 

BRAZD529: 1.9 g/t gold over 25.0 metres
BRAZD534: 1.1 g/t gold over 44.5 metres
BRAZD536: 5.7 g/t gold over 8.7 metres, 1.3 g/t gold over 21.0 metres and 1.0 g/t over 11.0 metres
BRAZD538: 2.3 g/t gold over 5.1 metres, and 1.3 g/t gold over 25.3 metres
BRAZP584: 1.5 g/t gold over 43.0 metres including;

6.1 g/t gold over 6.0 metres 
BRAZP587: 19.7 g/t gold over 1.0 metres and 67.1 g/t gold over 5.0 metres including;

329.0 g/t gold over 1.0 metres 
BRAZP591: 1.2 g/t gold over 39.0 metres
BRAZP596: 1.5 g/t gold over 5.0 metres and 5.1 g/t gold over 20.0 metres 

True widths of the mineralized intervals are interpreted to be 60 to 90 percent of the reported lengths. For more information and for complete drill results visit the Trek website at www.trekmining.com and see the press releases dated May 17, 2017, June 27, 2017 and July 25, 2017. 
Sandstorm has a 3% - 5% sliding scale net smelter returns ("NSR") royalty on the Aurizona project. At gold prices less than or equal to US$1,500 per ounce, the royalty is a 3% NSR. In addition, Sandstorm holds a 2% NSR royalty on the Aurizona Greenfields property, a 190,073 hectare package of exploration ground adjacent to the Aurizona project. Trek recently announced an exploration agreement with AngloGold Ashanti Limited ("AngloGold"), whereby AngloGold may invest US$14 million in exploration to earn a 70% interest in Aurizona Greenfields. 
Rambler Announces Drill Results for 2017 Program at the Ming Mine 
Rambler Metals and Mining plc ("Rambler") announced the start of a surface diamond drilling program targeting the depth extension of both the Lower Footwall Zone ("LFZ") and high grade Ming Massive Sulphides ("MMS") at the Ming Mine in Newfoundland, Canada ("Ming"). 
Since commercial production began in 2012, Rambler has been primarily mining the 1807 Zone and has replaced mined material through exploration. The 2017 exploration drill program has again been successful in achieving this goal with the 1807 Zone still open at depth. 
New drilling in the Ming North Zone ("MNZ") has shown continued mineralization at depth. The MNZ is not included in any of the mineral resources or reserve estimates and Rambler has identified it as a potential new source for high grade massive sulphides. 
Highlighted drill results from 2017 include:

True widths are estimate to range between 40%-80% of core lengths. For more information, visit the Rambler website at www.ramblermines.com and see the press release dated June 27, 2017. 
Sandstorm has a gold stream agreement with Rambler to receive 25% of the first 175,000 ounces of gold produced, and 12% of the gold produced thereafter from the Ming mine. 
Entrée Resources Provides Updates on Oyu Tolgoi Underground Development 
Entrée Resources Ltd. ("Entrée") recently provided an update on underground development at the Hugo North project in Mongolia. Hugo North is part of the Oyu Tolgoi mine complex owned by Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. and the Government of Mongolia. The focus of activities during the first quarter of 2017 was lateral development, sinking of Shafts 2 and 5, support infrastructure and the convey-to-surface system. The equivalent of approximately one kilometre of lateral development was completed during the first quarter. In the second half of 2017, the sinking of Shaft 2 is expected to reach its final depth of 1,284 metres. Shaft 5 is expected to be completed in early 2018. 
The first physical development on the Entrée/OTLLC joint venture property will be the sinking of Shaft 4 which is expected to commence in 2018 and to be completed in 2021. 
For more information, visit www.entreeresourcesltd.com and see the press releases dated May 9, 2017 and June 19, 2017. 
Sandstorm has a stream agreement to purchase 5.62% of the gold and silver from the Hugo North Extension, 4.26% of the gold and silver from the Heruga deposits, and 0.42% of the copper produced from both the Hugo North Extension and Heruga deposits. These deposits are the northern-most and southern-most, respectively, in the 12 kilometre-long Oyu Tolgoi series of deposits.
— Erdene Expands Mineralization at Bayan Khundii & Altan Nar 
Erdene Resource Development Corp. ("Erdene") is completing a 20,000 metre exploration drill program at the Bayan Khundii project in Mongolia. The drill program is focusing on expanding areas of gold mineralization at the Gold Hill, Striker, and Midfield zones, and to test new mineralized zones elsewhere in the project area. There are two drill rigs on site; one rig is continuing the exploration program while the second drill rig is dedicated to a closer spaced resource delineation program. 
On June 8, 2017, Erdene announced mineralization discovered under cover north of the Midfield Zone that may be the extension of the high-grade corridor that runs northeast from the Gold Hill zone through Striker and now beyond the Midfield zone. Hole BKD-110, located 60 metres north of Midfield, was one of four previously announced step-out holes where visible gold was observed. On July 17, 2017, Erdene announced additional mineralization intersected west of Midfield in drill hole BKD 166. This hole was drilled 50 metres west of previously reported drill hole BKD-100, along the western edge of the Midfield Zone. BKD-100 did not return significant gold mineralization as the hole intersected a syenite intrusion and was speculated to truncate the western extension of Midfield. BKD-166 suggests the syenite encountered in BKD-100 may be smaller and the Midfield mineralization continues west of BKD-100. A series of holes completed south of BKD-166, and west of the Striker Zone returned multiple gold intersections under younger, post mineral cover. Results included 5.0 metres of 4.5 g/t gold within 28.0 metres of 1.4 g/t gold in hole BKD 172. Additional drilling will be required to confirm the true extent of the mineralization in this area. Drilling highlights from the exploration program include: 

BKD-110: 2.8 g/t gold over 108.3 metres including;

2.8 g/t gold over 55.3 metres
3.6 g/t gold over 42 metres including

7.23 g/t gold over 20 metres 
BKD-111: 3.0 g/t gold over 55.4 metres including;

5.3 g/t gold over 25 metres 
BKD-118: 12.8 g/t gold over 10 metres
BKD-122: 0.8 g/t gold over 14 metres including;

4.4 g/t gold over 2 metres and
0.7 g/t gold over 21 metres 
BKD-118: 12.8 g/t gold over 10 metres
BKD-129: 2.6 g/t gold over 20 metres
BKD-166: 1.1 g/t gold over 36.0 metres
BKD-172: 0.7 g/t gold over 66.0 metres 

In addition to the drilling at Bayan Khundii, a total of 1,326 metres of drilling in six drill holes has been completed at Erdene's Altan Nar Project. The objective of the program is to establish continuity of the high-grade gold-polymetallic zone identified in the fourth quarter of 2016. The drill highlights include: 

TND-105: 9.5 g/t AuEq over 14 metres (7.9 g/t gold, 43.7 g/t silver, and 1.8% combined lead-zinc)
TND-104: 3.1 g/t AuEq over 37 metres (2.2 g/t gold, 29.7 g/t silver, and 0.8% combined lead-zinc) 

Reported intervals are not true width. At this time, there is insufficient data with respect to the shape of the mineralized system to calculate true orientations in space.

Note: Copper Equivalent (CuEq) is used to express the combined value of copper and gold as a percentage of copper, for illustrative purposes. No allowances have been made for recovery losses that would occur in a mining scenario. CuEq is calculated on the basis of US$2.30 per pound of copper and US$1,240 per troy ounce of gold, using the formula: CuEq = [(%Cu)(22.0462)($lbCu)+(gptAu)(1/31.1035)($ozAu)]/[(22.0462)($lbCu).

Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Sandstorm does not undertake to update any forward looking statements that are contained or incorporated by reference, except in accordance with applicable securities laws.
