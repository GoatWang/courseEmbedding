Product Design Achievements

Medical

- Designed and developed the ABRA® Abdominal Wall Closure System.  The system has been clinically proven to allow for the primary closure of complex abdominal wounds in 7 days without the need for mesh, or skin grafts.  It is being used by hundreds of hospitals worldwide and has been proven to save hospitals $12,000 to $45,000 per patient.
- Designed and developed several key components for the ABRA® Surgical Skin Closure system that has been clinically proven to close extremity fasciotomities within 3 days without the use of skin grafts.  It is being used by hospitals worldwide and is currently being used in Iraq by the U.S. Military.
- Designed and developed a portable sterilization storage tray that organizes and secures all of the key components (magnetic and non-magnetic) of the CHESS® surgery system in a footprint small enough to fit in desktop flash autoclaves.  Production costs were minimized by taking advantage of supplier owned tooling.  The final product met all of the design criteria and cost less than having to modify an existing storage tray.
- Designed and developed an inclined base-plate for use with the CHESS® surgery system that has extended the range of procedures from those only requiring a horizontal base-plate by allowing flexion and elevation of the digits and wrist.
- Designed and developed a fully adjustable retractable arm for use with the CHESS® surgery system that extends the range of procedures from extremity based surgery to include head, neck and torso based surgery.
- Developed both the mechanical design and the UI for a medication adherence system.  It includes a programmable multi-alarm watch that provides scheduled haptic feedback and a pocket sized, daily dose pill dispensing device that organizes multiple pill dosages and places them in sequence.  The project was the focus of two articles written in the Ottawa X Press and Carleton University newspapers.

Consumer

- Designed and developed the Thread I.D. ™, a handheld thread identification tool.  Through competitive analysis and manufacturing optimization, production costs were minimized without compromising features or aesthetics.  It is currently in its third round of production due to high market demand.
- Designed and developed a paint can holder for use on step and extension ladders.  It can safely and securely accommodate paint cans in a wide range of shapes and volumes and allow the end user to maintain proper grip on a ladder while painting.  Mechanical engineering and material stress analysis allowed for the reduction of both part size and number of parts.  The part strength, stability and projected unit cost were achieved without the need of complex assemblies or custom tooling.
- Designed and developed the GatorCleat™, a device that secures a tied down load without the use of knots.  Through competitive analysis and creative mechanical engineering, production costs were minimized without compromising tensile strength, operational instruction display and aesthetics.  It is currently in production and is projected to retail for less than its closest market competitor.

Exhibition

- Developed a tradeshow panel lighting system that cost 50% less than an equivalent lighting system sold by our panel support supplier.
- Developed a tradeshow shipping container system that easily converted to display podiums with accessible print media storage.  The system enables the product representatives to setup a 10’ x 30’ booth without needing to store extra shipping containers.  Its real advantage comes at the end of a show where the product representatives can often complete a booth disassembly and be on their way to catch their flight before other booths have received their shipping containers from storage.
- Designed and fabricated interactive abdominal models for product demonstration and sales training.  The life sized abdominal models allowed a product representative to control the expansion and contraction of the abdomen while clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of the ABRA® Dynamic Wound Closure line.

Web Development and Graphic Design

- Designed, developed the UI and art directed the corporate website www.canica.com and the medical retail product site www.suturesafe.com .
- Designed and developed the marketing material for the ABRA® Dynamic Wound Closure product line including procedure guides, product brochures 
- Designed and developed the tradeshow graphic panels for the ABRA® Dynamic Wound Closure product line, SutureSafe®, and DynaCleft® products
- Designed and developed the print advertising campaign the ABRA® Dynamic Wound Closure product line.  The ads were shown in several key surgical journals including the Journal of the American College of Surgeons and American Journal of Surgery
- Designed, developed and created the messaging for the DynaClose® print advertising campaign.
- Designed and developed the product branding for Canica’s Stick and Stretch product line including SutureSafe®, DynaClose®, DynaCleft® and DynaStretch® and Chestnut tool’s GatorCleat™
- Developed the corporate logo for three successful businesses; Algrove Publishing®, Chestnut Tools® and  Misty River Introductions®

Personal

- Designed, developed and fabricated a steel bed frame with an integrated lighting system placed in the headboard.  The lighting system employs a fully adjustable reflector that allows the user to direct the light where needed without having to come in contact with the light source.  User experience, functionality and aesthetics were the main drivers in the design.
- Designed, developed and fabricated an outdoor bench that uses a single wood mould form to produce both concrete legs.  Production cost, user experience, assembly and aesthetics were the main drivers in the design.
