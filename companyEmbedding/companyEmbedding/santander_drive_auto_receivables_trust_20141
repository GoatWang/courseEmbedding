NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the notes issued by 
      Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 2014-1:
    

      --$228,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$85,275,000 class A-2A notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$138,990,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$140,740,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$69,490,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$60,150,000 class E notes 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Weaker Credit Quality: 2014-1 is backed by marginally weaker collateral 
      versus prior 2013 pools and non-Santander Consumer USA (SCUSA) 
      collateral totals 9.4%. The pool exhibits modestly weaker credit scores 
      versus 2013-5, an increase in loans with terms of 60+ months to 90.7% 
      (the highest level to date), a higher WA loan-to-value (LTV), lower new 
      vehicles (35.1%), and more trucks/SUVs (40.5%).
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a sequential 
      pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is unchanged from 
      2013-5.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Performance of SCUSA's 
      portfolio and 2010-2012 securitizations has been strong with low losses, 
      supported by the economic rebound, and strong used vehicle values. 
      However, recent 2013 portfolio and securitization losses have risen and 
      are tracking slightly above the 2012 vintage, driven by marginally 
      weaker collateral underwritten combined with lower recoveries as used 
      vehicle values have softened.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'BBB+/F2' with a Stable Rating Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency, loss experience, and 
      securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITY
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to Santander Drive 
      Auto Receivables Trust 2014-1 to increased credit losses over the life 
      of the transaction. Fitch's analysis found that the transaction displays 
      some sensitivity to increased defaults and credit losses, showing a 
      potential downgrade of one or two categories under Fitch's moderate 
      (1.5x base case loss) scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. 
      The notes could experience downgrades of three or more rating 
      categories, potentially leading to distressed ratings (below Bsf) or 
      possibly default, under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's web site at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

      Fitch's analysis of the Representation and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in 'Santander Drive Auto Receivables Trust 
      2014-1 --Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical R&W for 
      the asset class as detailed in the special report 'Representations, 
      Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in the Global Structured Finance 
      Transactions' dated April 17, 2012.

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Weaker Credit Quality: 2014-1 is backed by marginally weaker collateral 
      versus prior 2013 pools and non-SCUSA collateral totals 8.4%. The pool 
      exhibits modestly weaker credit scores versus 2013-5, an increase in 
      loans with terms of 60+ months (89.8%) - the highest level to date, a 
      higher weighted average (WA) loan-to-value (LTV), lower new vehicles 
      (34.4%), and more trucks/SUVs (43.8%).
    

      Adequate Credit Enhancement: The cash flow distribution is a sequential 
      pay structure. Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is unchanged from 
      2013-5.
    

      Stable Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Performance of SCUSA's 
      portfolio and 2010-2012 securitizations has been strong with low losses, 
      supported by the economic rebound, and strong used vehicle values. 
      However, recent 2013 portfolio and securitization losses have risen and 
      are tracking slightly above the 2012 vintage, driven by marginally 
      weaker collateral underwritten combined with lower recoveries as used 
      vehicle values have softened.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: SCUSA recorded solid financial results recently 
      and has been profitable since 2007. Fitch rates Santander, majority 
      owner of SCUSA, 'BBB+/F2' with a Stable Rating Outlook.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: SCUSA demonstrates 
      adequate abilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by historical portfolio delinquency, loss experience, and 
      securitization performance.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of SCUSA would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case and could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to SDART 2014-1 to 
      increased credit losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the transaction displays some sensitivity to 
      increased defaults and credit losses, showing a potential downgrade of 
      one or two categories under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) 
      scenario, especially for the subordinate bonds. The notes could 
      experience downgrades of up to three or more rating categories, under 
      Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying presale report.

Trust Agreement
(2014-1)






Each of the Owner Trustee and the Administrator,
as applicable, is hereby authorized to engage in the foregoing
activities on behalf of the Issuer. Neither the Issuer nor any
Person acting on behalf of the Issuer shall engage in any activity
other than in connection with the foregoing or other than as
required or authorized by the terms of this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents.

SECTION 2.4. Appointment of the
Owner Trustee. The Seller hereby appoints the Owner Trustee as
trustee of the Issuer effective as of the date hereof, to have all
the rights, powers and duties set forth herein.

SECTION 2.5. Initial Capital
Contribution of Trust Estate . As of the date of the Original
Trust Agreement, the Seller sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed
and set over to the Owner Trustee the sum of $1. The Owner Trustee
hereby acknowledges receipt in trust from the Seller, as of such
date, of the foregoing contribution, which shall constitute the
initial Trust Estate and shall be deposited in the Collection
Account.

SECTION 2.6. Declaration of
Trust . The Owner Trustee hereby declares that it will hold the
Trust Estate in trust upon and subject to the conditions set forth
herein for the use and benefit of the Certificateholders, subject
to the obligations of the Issuer under the Transaction Documents.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a statutory trust under the Statutory Trust Statute and
that this Agreement constitute the governing instrument of such
statutory trust. It is the intention of the parties hereto that,
solely for federal income or state and local income, franchise and
value added tax purposes, so long as there is a single beneficial
owner of the Certificates, the Issuer will be disregarded as an
entity separate from such beneficial owner and the Notes will be
characterized as debt. The parties agree that, unless otherwise
required by appropriate tax authorities, the Issuer will not file
or cause to be filed annual or other necessary returns, reports and
other forms consistent with the characterization of the Issuer as
an entity separate from its owner. In the event that the Issuer is
deemed to have more than one beneficial owner for federal income
tax purposes, the Issuer will file returns, reports and other forms
consistent with the characterization of the Issuer as a partnership
(that is not treated as a publicly traded partnership), and this
Agreement may be amended to include such provisions as may be
required under Subchapter K of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended. Effective as of the date hereof, the Owner Trustee
shall have all rights, powers and duties set forth herein and, to
the extent not inconsistent herewith, in the Statutory Trust
Statute with respect to accomplishing the purposes of the Issuer.
It is the intention of the parties hereto that except as expressly
stated herein, the affairs of the Trust shall be managed by the
Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Owner
Trustee has heretofore filed the Certificate of Trust with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by
Section 3810(a) of the Statutory Trust Statute, such filing
hereby being ratified and approved in all respects. Notwithstanding
anything herein or in the Statutory Trust Statute to the contrary,
it is the intention of the parties hereto that the Issuer
constitute a “business trust” within the meaning of
Section 101(9)(A)(v) of the Bankruptcy Code.

agreements and which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
materially and adversely affect the transactions contemplated by,
or the Seller’s ability to perform its obligations under, the
Transaction Documents to which it is a party).

(c) No Consent Required . No
approval, authorization or other action by, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required in connection with the

its president, its chief financial officer, its chief accounting
officer, any vice president, its secretary, any assistant
secretary, its treasurer or any assistant treasurer, without

Certificate upon surrender thereof to the Owner Trustee accompanied
by the documents required by this Article III . Promptly

of the transferor’s Certificate, the Owner Trustee shall
record the name of such transferee as a Certificateholder and its
Percentage Interest in the Certificate Register and issue, execute
and deliver to such Certificateholder a Certificate evidencing such
Percentage Interest. In the event a transferor transfers only a
portion of its Percentage Interest, the Owner Trustee shall
register and issue to such transferor a new Certificate evidencing
such transferor’s new Percentage Interest and shall issue,
execute and deliver to such transferee a new Certificate evidencing
such transferee’s Percentage Interest. Subsequent to each
transfer of a beneficial interest and upon the issuance of the new
Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and

Certificate is registered as the sole owner of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by such Certificate without regard to any notice
to the contrary.

By accepting and holding a
Certificate (or any interest therein), the holder thereof shall be
deemed to have represented and warranted that it is not, and is not
purchasing the Certificate (or any interest therein) on behalf of
or with any assets of, a Benefit Plan or any governmental,
non-U.S., church or any other employee benefit plan or retirement
arrangement that is subject to Similar Law. Subject to the transfer
restrictions contained herein and in the Certificate, each
Certificateholder may transfer all or any portion of the Percentage
Interest evidenced by such Certificate upon surrender thereof to
the Owner Trustee accompanied by the documents required by this
Section 3.6 . Such transfer may be made by a registered
Certificateholder in person or by his attorney duly authorized in

Certificateholder and its Percentage Interest in the Certificate
Register and issue, execute and deliver to such Certificateholder a
Certificate evidencing such Percentage Interest. In the event a
transferor transfers only a portion of its Percentage Interest, the
Owner Trustee shall register and issue to such transferor a new
Certificate evidencing such transferor’s new Percentage
Interest. Subsequent to a transfer and upon the issuance of the new
Certificate or Certificates, the Owner Trustee shall cancel and
destroy the Certificate surrendered to it in connection with such
transfer. Unless otherwise provided under applicable law, the Owner
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is
registered as the sole owner of the beneficial interest in the
Issuer evidenced by such Certificate, without regard to any notice
to the contrary.

(b) As a condition precedent to any
registration of transfer under this Section 3.6 , the
Owner Trustee may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
the payment of any tax or taxes or other governmental charges
required to be paid in connection with such transfer.

(c) By accepting and holding a
Certificate (or any interest therein), each transferee of a
Certificate (other than a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller) shall be
deemed to have acknowledged, represented and agreed as
follows:

(1) It (and any Person for which it
holds Certificates as agent or nominee) has neither acquired nor
will it transfer any Certificate it purchases (or any interest
therein) or cause any such Certificate (or any interest therein) to
be marketed on or through an “established securities
market” within the meaning of Section 7704(b)(1) of the
Code, including, without limitation, an over-the-counter market or
an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm
buy or sell quotations.

subsequent transfer of the Certificates (or any interest therein)
is permitted unless such transfer is of a Certificate with a
Percentage Interest of more than 2% (or of an interest in a
Certificate representing a Percentage Interest of more than
2%).

(3) Each registered owner of and, if
different, each owner of a beneficial interest in, a Certificate is
a “United States person” (as defined in Code section
7701(a)(30)) and shall deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Administrator and the Certificate Paying Agent two properly
completed and duly executed originals of U.S. Internal Revenue
Service Form W-9 (or applicable successor form) certifying that it
is a United States person and not subject to backup
withholding.

(4) Any attempted transfer that
contravenes any provisions of this (c) of
Section 3.6 shall be a void transfer ab initio
.

(d) Each purchaser, beneficial owner
and subsequent transferee of Certificates or an interest therein
will be required or deemed to acknowledge that the Issuer may
provide any information concerning its investment in the
Certificates to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. In addition,
each purchaser, beneficial owner and subsequent transferee of
Certificates or an interest therein will be required or deemed to
understand and acknowledge that the Issuer has the right,
hereunder, to withhold on any beneficial owner of an interest in a
Certificate that fails to comply with the foregoing
requirements.

AGREEMENT, THE ISSUER AND THE OWNER TRUSTEE MAY CONSIDER THE
ACQUISITION OF THIS CERTIFICATE OR SUCH INTEREST IN SUCH
CERTIFICATE VOID AND REQUIRE THAT THIS CERTIFICATE OR SUCH INTEREST
HEREIN BE TRANSFERRED TO A PERSON DESIGNATED BY THE ISSUER.
TRANSFERS OF THIS CERTIFICATE MUST GENERALLY BE ACCOMPANIED BY
APPROPRIATE TAX TRANSFER DOCUMENTATION AND ARE SUBJECT TO
RESTRICTIONS AS PROVIDED IN THE TRUST AGREEMENT.

(f) If (1) a transfer or
attempted or purported transfer of any Certificate or interest
therein was consummated in compliance with the provisions of this
Section 3.6 on the basis of a materially incorrect
certification from the transferor or purported transferee,
(2) a transferee of a Certificate failed to deliver to the
Owner Trustee a Certificate Investor Representation Letter in the
form of Exhibit B hereto or (3) the Certificateholder
of any Certificate or interest therein is in material breach of any
representation or agreement set forth in any Certificate or any
deemed representation or agreement of such Certificateholder, the
Owner Trustee will, upon actual knowledge of such circumstance,
direct the Certificate Registrar not to register such attempted or
purported transfer and, if a transfer has been registered, such
transfer shall be absolutely null and void ab initio and
shall not operate to transfer any rights to the purported
transferee (such purported transferee, a “Disqualified
Transferee”) and the last preceding Certificateholder of such
Certificateholder that was not a Disqualified Transferee shall be
restored to all rights as a Certificateholder thereof retroactively
to the date of the purported transfer of such Certificate by such
Certificateholder.

(g) Lost, Stolen, Mutilated or
Destroyed Certificates . If (i) any mutilated Certificate
is surrendered to the Owner Trustee, or (ii) the Owner Trustee
receives evidence to its satisfaction that any Certificate has been
destroyed, lost or stolen, and upon proof of ownership satisfactory
to the Owner Trustee together with such security or indemnity as
may be requested by the Owner Trustee to save it harmless, the
Owner Trustee shall execute and deliver a new Certificate for the
same Percentage Interest as the Certificate so mutilated,
destroyed, lost or stolen, of like tenor and bearing a different
issue number, with such notations, if any, as the Owner Trustee
shall determine. Upon the issuance of any new Certificate under
this Section 3.6 , the Issuer or Owner Trustee may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
transfer or exchange of the Certificate and any other reasonable
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Issuer
and the Owner Trustee) connected therewith. Any duplicate
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.6 shall
constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the
Issuer, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

(h) No transfer of the Certificates
(or any interest therein) is permitted unless such transfer is of a
Certificate with a Percentage Interest of more than 2% (or of an
interest in a Certificate representing a Percentage Interest of
more than 2%).

(i) In the case of the first
transfer of a Certificate that will result in the Issuer being
deemed to have more than one beneficial owner for federal income
tax purposes, the Seller shall be entitled, upon request, to
receive from the transferor an Initial Certificate Transfer
Opinion.

SECTION 3.7. Appointment of the
Certificate Paying Agent . The Certificate Paying Agent shall
make distributions to Certificateholders from the Certificate
Distribution Account pursuant to Section 5.2 and shall
report the amounts of such distributions to the Owner Trustee and
the Servicer; provided , however , that no such
reports shall be required so long as the Seller or an affiliate of
the Seller is the sole Certificateholder. Any Certificate Paying
Agent shall have the revocable power to withdraw funds from the
Certificate Distribution Account for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above. The Owner Trustee may revoke such
power and remove the Certificate Paying Agent if the Owner Trustee
determines in its sole discretion that the Certificate Paying Agent
shall have failed to perform its obligations under this Agreement
in any material respect. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
initially be U.S. Bank, and any co-paying agent chosen by the
Certificate Paying Agent. U.S. Bank shall be permitted to resign as
Certificate Paying Agent upon thirty (30) days’ written
notice to the Owner Trustee. If U.S. Bank shall no longer be the
Certificate Paying Agent, the Owner Trustee shall appoint a
successor to act as Certificate Paying Agent (which shall be a bank
or trust company). The Owner Trustee shall cause such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or any additional Certificate Paying Agent
appointed by the Owner Trustee to execute and deliver to the Owner
Trustee an instrument in which such successor Certificate Paying
Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent shall agree with the
Owner Trustee that as Certificate Paying Agent, such successor
Certificate Paying Agent or additional Certificate Paying Agent
shall hold all sums, if any, held by it for payment to the
Certificateholders in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders. The Certificate Paying Agent shall
return all unclaimed funds to the Owner Trustee and upon removal of
a Certificate Paying Agent such Certificate Paying Agent shall also
return all funds in its possession to the Owner Trustee. The
rights, protections, indemnities and immunities of the Owner
Trustee under this Agreement shall apply to the Owner Trustee also
in its role as Certificate Paying Agent or Certificate Registrar
for so long as the Owner Trustee shall act as Certificate Paying
Agent or Certificate Registrar and, to the extent applicable, to
any other paying agent, certificate registrar or authenticating
agent appointed hereunder. Any reference in this Agreement to the
Certificate Paying Agent shall include any co-paying agent unless
the context requires otherwise.

SECTION 3.8. Maintenance of
Office or Agency . As long as any of the Certificates remain
outstanding, the Issuer shall maintain an office or agency where
Certificates may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange, and where notices and demands to or upon the Issuer in
respect of the Certificates and this Agreement may be served. The
Issuer hereby initially designated the Corporate Trust Office of
the Certificate Registrar for the foregoing purposes. The Issuer
shall give prompt written notice to the Certificateholders and the
Owner Trustee of the location, and of any change in the location,
of any such office or agency. If at any time the Issuer shall fail
to maintain any such office or agency or shall fail to furnish the
Owner Trustee with the address thereof, such surrenders, notices
and demands may be made or served at the applicable Corporate Trust
Office of the Owner Trustee, and the Issuer hereby appoints the
Owner Trustee as its agent to receive all such surrenders, notices
and demands.

(2014-1)







interests of the Issuer and whether
the Issuer is insolvent. The Owner Trustee shall have no duty to
give such written consent to a Bankruptcy Event by the Issuer if
the Owner Trustee shall not have been furnished (at the expense of
the Person that requested such letter be furnished to the Owner
Trustee) a letter from an independent accounting firm of national
reputation stating that in the opinion of such firm the Issuer is
then insolvent. The Owner Trustee shall not be personally liable to
any Noteholder or Certificateholder on account of the Owner
Trustee’s good faith reliance on the provisions of this
Section 4.3 and no Noteholder or Certificateholder
shall have any claim for breach of fiduciary duty or otherwise
against the Owner Trustee for giving or withholding its consent to
any such Bankruptcy Event.

(b) The parties hereto stipulate and
agree that no Certificateholder has power to commence any
Bankruptcy Action on the part of the Issuer.

SECTION 4.4. Restrictions on

not direct the Owner Trustee to take or refrain from taking any
action if such action or inaction would be contrary to any
obligation of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee under this Agreement
or any of the Transaction Documents or would be contrary to
Section 2.3 , nor shall the Owner Trustee be obligated
to follow any such direction, if given.

SECTION 4.5. Acts of
Certificateholders; Majority Control .

(a) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by
Certificateholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such
Certificateholders in person or by agents duly appointed in
writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly provided such
action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments
are delivered to the Owner Trustee, and, where it is hereby
expressly required, to the Issuer. Such instrument or instruments
(and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein
sometimes referred to as the “Act” of the
Certificateholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of
execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing any
such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement
and (subject to Article VI ) conclusive in favor of the
Owner Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in
this Section 4.5 .

(b) The fact and date of the
execution by any person of any such instrument or writing may be
proved in any manner that the Owner Trustee deems
sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Certificates
shall be proved by the Certificate Register.

authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action
by any Certificateholder shall bind the Holder of every Certificate

lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to
be done by the Owner Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon,
whether or not notation of such action is made upon such
Certificate.

(e) Except as otherwise provided
herein, to the extent that there is more than one
Certificateholder, any action which may be taken or consent or
instructions which may be given by the Certificateholders under
this Agreement may be taken by the Majority Certificateholders at
the time of such action.

CERTAIN DUTIES

SECTION 5.1. Application of Trust
Funds . Distributions on the Certificates shall be made in
accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, the Sale and
Servicing Agreement and this Agreement. On each Payment Date, the
Certificate Paying Agent shall withdraw from the Certificate
Distribution Account and distribute to the Certificateholders, pro
rata based on the Percentage Interest of each Certificateholder,
all funds received in accordance with the provisions of the
Indenture and this Agreement. Subject to the Lien of the Indenture
and Section 5.5 of this Agreement, the Certificate
Paying Agent shall promptly distribute to the Certificateholders
all other amounts (if any) received by the Certificate Paying Agent
on behalf of the Issuer in respect of the Trust Estate (pro rata
based on the Percentage Interest of each such Certificateholder).
After the termination of the Indenture in accordance with its
terms, the Certificate Paying Agent, in accordance with the written
direction of the Administrator pursuant to
Section 9.1(a), shall distribute all amounts received
(if any) by the Issuer and the Owner Trustee in respect of the
Trust Estate to or at the direction of the Certificateholders
subject to Section 3808(e) of the Statutory Trust
Statute.

SECTION 5.2. Method of
Payment . Subject to the Indenture and the Sale and Servicing
Agreement, distributions required to be made to the
Certificateholders on any Payment Date and all amounts received by
the Issuer or the Owner Trustee on any other date that are payable
to the Certificateholders pursuant to this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document shall be made to the Certificateholders by
wire transfer, in immediately available funds, to the account of
each Certificateholder designated by the Certificateholder to the
Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee in writing.

SECTION 5.3. Reports by Owner
Trustee to Certificateholders . (a) The Administrator
shall prepare, or, at the request and expense of the Administrator,
the Owner Trustee shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) and the
Administrator shall sign on behalf of the Issuer, the
Issuer’s tax returns, if any, unless applicable law requires
a Certificateholder or the Owner Trustee to sign such
documents.

(a) The Administrator shall prepare
and deliver, or, at the request of the Administrator, the Owner
Trustee shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to each
Certificateholder, as may be required by the Code and applicable
Treasury Regulations, such information as may be required
(including Schedule K-1, if applicable) to enable each
Certificateholder to prepare its federal and state income tax
returns.

(b) As long as the Issuer is treated
as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and the Seller or
a U.S. Affiliate is a beneficial owner of a Certificate, to
the

Trust Agreement
(2014-1)







extent allowed by the Code, the
Seller or such U.S. Affiliate shall be designated the “tax
matters partner” of the Trust pursuant to
Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations. If neither the Seller nor an Affiliate of the Seller
is a beneficial owner of a Certificate, then the Certificateholder
with the largest Percentage Interest shall be designated the
“tax matters partner” of the Issuer pursuant to
Section 6231(a)(7) of the Code and applicable Treasury
Regulations.

SECTION 5.4. Certificate
Distribution Account. The Certificate Distribution Account
shall be established pursuant to Section 4.1 of the
Sale and Servicing Agreement. The Certificateholders shall possess
all beneficial right, title and interest in and to all funds on
deposit from time to time in the Certificate Distribution Account
and all proceeds thereof. Except as otherwise provided herein, in
the Indenture or in the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the
Certificate Distribution Account shall be under the sole dominion
and control of the Certificate Paying Agent for the benefit of the
Certificateholders. If, at any time, the Certificate Distribution
Account ceases to be an Eligible Account, the Owner Trustee (or the
Servicer on behalf of the Owner Trustee, if the Certificate
Distribution Account is not then held by the Owner Trustee or an
Affiliate thereof) shall within ten (10) Business Days (or
such longer period) establish a new Certificate Distribution
Account as an Eligible Account and shall transfer any cash then on
deposit in the Certificate Distribution Account to such new
Certificate Distribution Account. -

SECTION 5.5. Withholding . If
any withholding tax is imposed on the Issuer’s payment (or
allocations of income) to a Certificateholder, such tax shall
reduce the amount otherwise distributable to the Certificateholder
in accordance with this Section 5.5 ; provided that the
Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent shall not have an
obligation to withhold any such amount if and for so long as the
Seller or a U.S. Affiliate of the Seller is the sole
Certificateholder. The Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying
Agent is hereby authorized and directed to retain from amounts
otherwise distributable to the Certificateholders sufficient funds
for the payment of any tax that is legally owed by the Issuer (but
such authorization shall not prevent the Owner Trustee or the
Certificate Paying Agent from contesting any such tax in
appropriate proceedings and withholding payment of such tax, if
permitted by law, pending the outcome of such proceedings). The
amount of any withholding tax imposed with respect to a
Certificateholder shall be treated as cash distributed to such
Certificateholder at the time it is withheld by the Issuer and
remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. If there is a
possibility that withholding tax is payable with respect to a
distribution, the Owner Trustee or the Certificate Paying Agent may
in its sole discretion withhold such amounts in accordance with
this Section 5.5 .

ARTICLE VI

execution thereof, and at the written direction of the Seller, to

to the foregoing, the Owner Trustee is authorized, but shall not be

the Transaction Documents. The Owner Trustee is further authorized
from time to time to take such action as the Seller, the
Administrator or a Majority of the Certificateholders direct in
writing with respect to the Transaction Documents, except to the
extent that this Agreement expressly requires the consent of each
Certificateholder for such action.

SECTION 6.2. General Duties .
It shall be the duty of the Owner Trustee to discharge (or cause to
be discharged) all of its express responsibilities pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents in the
interest of the Certificateholders, subject to Transaction
Documents, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to
have discharged its duties and responsibilities hereunder and under
the Transaction Documents to the extent the Administrator has
agreed in the Administration Agreement to perform any act or to
discharge any duty of the Issuer or the Owner Trustee hereunder or
under any Transaction Document, and the Owner Trustee shall not be
liable for the default or failure of the Administrator to carry out
its obligations under the Administration Agreement and shall have
no duty to monitor the performance of the Administrator or any
other Person under the Administration Agreement or any other
document. The Owner Trustee shall have no obligation to administer,
service or collect the Receivables or to maintain, monitor or
otherwise supervise the administration, servicing or collection of
the Receivables.

SECTION 6.3. Action upon
Instruction .

(a) Subject to Article IV ,
and in accordance with the Transaction Documents, the
Certificateholders may, by written instruction, direct the Owner
Trustee or the Administrator in the management of the Issuer. Such
direction may be exercised at any time by written instruction of
the Certificateholders pursuant to Article IV .

(b) Subject to
Section 7.1 , the Owner Trustee shall not be required
to take any action hereunder or under any Transaction Document if
the Owner Trustee shall have reasonably determined or been advised
by counsel that such action is likely to result in liability on the
part of the Owner Trustee or is contrary to the terms hereof or of
any Transaction Document or is otherwise contrary to
law.

(c) Whenever the Owner Trustee is
unable to decide between alternative courses of action permitted or
required by the terms of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
or is unsure as to the application of any provision of this
Agreement or any
 












 



16


 


Amended and Restated

Trust Agreement
(2014-1)







Transaction Document or any such
provision is ambiguous as to its application, or is, or appears to
be, in conflict with any other applicable provision, or in the
event that this Agreement permits any determination by the Owner
Trustee or is silent or is incomplete as to the course of action
that the Owner Trustee is required to take with respect to a
particular set of facts, the Owner Trustee shall promptly give
notice (in such form as shall be appropriate under the
circumstances) to the Certificateholders requesting instruction as
to the course of action to be adopted or application of such
provision, and to the extent the Owner Trustee acts or refrains
from acting in good faith in accordance with any written
instruction of the Majority Certificateholders (or, if specifically
required hereunder, all Certificateholders) received, the Owner
Trustee shall not be liable on account of such action or inaction
to any Person. If the Owner Trustee shall not have received
appropriate instruction within ten days of such notice (or within
such shorter period of time as reasonably may be specified in such
notice or may be necessary under the circumstances) it may, but
shall be under no duty to, take or refrain from taking such action,
not inconsistent with this Agreement or the Transaction Documents,
as it shall deem to be in the best interests of the
Certificateholders, and shall have no liability to any Person for
such action or inaction.

SECTION 6.4. No Duties Except as
Specified in this Agreement or in Instructions . The Owner
Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to manage, make any
payment with respect to, register, record, sell, dispose of, or
otherwise deal with the Trust Estate, or to otherwise take or
refrain from taking any action under, or in connection with, any
document contemplated hereby to which the Issuer or the Owner
Trustee is a party, except as expressly provided by the terms of
this Agreement or in any document or written instruction received
by the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 6.3 ; and no
implied duties (including fiduciary duties existing at law or in
equity) or obligations shall be read into this Agreement or any
Transaction Document against the Owner Trustee. The Owner Trustee
shall have no responsibility for filing any financing or
continuation statement in any public office at any time or to
otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security
interest or Lien granted to it hereunder or to prepare or file any
Commission filing (including any filings required under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) for the Issuer or to record this Agreement or
any Transaction Document. U.S. Bank nevertheless agrees that it
will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take all action as may
be necessary to discharge any Liens on any part of the Trust Estate
that result from actions by, or claims against, U.S. Bank that are
not related to the ownership or the administration of the Trust
Estate or the Trust.

SECTION 6.5. No Action Except
under Specified Documents or Instructions . The Owner Trustee
shall not manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal
with any part of the Trust Estate except (i) in accordance
with the powers granted to and the authority conferred upon the
Owner Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) in accordance
with the Transaction Documents and (iii) in accordance with
any document or instruction delivered to the Owner Trustee pursuant
to Section 6.3 .

SECTION 6.6. Restrictions .
The Owner Trustee shall not take any action (a) that is
inconsistent with the purposes of the Issuer set forth in
Section 2.3 or (b) that, to the actual knowledge
of a Responsible Officer of the Owner Trustee, would
(i) affect the treatment of the Notes as indebtedness for
federal income, state and local income, franchise and value added
tax

Trust Agreement
(2014-1)






purposes, (ii) be deemed to cause a taxable
exchange of the Notes for federal income or state income or
franchise tax purposes or (iii) cause the Issuer or any
portion thereof to be treated as an association or publicly traded
partnership taxable as a corporation for federal income, state and
local income or franchise and value added tax purposes. The
Certificateholders shall not direct the Owner Trustee to take
action that would violate the provisions of this
Section 6.6 .

SECTION 6.7. Relevant Trustee
. Following the payment in full of principal and interest on the
Notes and receipt of written notification from the Servicer, the
Owner Trustee shall assume the role of Relevant Trustee and shall
perform the express obligations of the Relevant Trustee under the
Sale and Servicing Agreement. All of the same rights, protections,
indemnities and immunities of U.S. Bank hereunder (individually and
as Owner Trustee) shall be equally applicable to U.S. Bank in its
role as Relevant Trustee under the Transaction
Documents.

ARTICLE VII

and Duties . The Owner Trustee accepts the trusts hereby

of Section 6.4 or (iv) for taxes, fees or other
charges on, based on or measured by, any fees, commissions or
compensation received by the Owner Trustee. In particular, but not
by way of limitation (and subject to the exemptions set forth in
the preceding sentence):

(a) The Owner Trustee shall not be
liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by any officer
or employee of the Owner Trustee.

(b) Under no circumstances shall the
Owner Trustee be personally liable hereunder for any indebtedness
of the Issuer.

(c) The Owner Trustee shall not be
personally liable for the payment of any tax imposed on the Issuer
or amounts that are includable in the federal gross income of the
Certificateholders.

(d) No provision of this Agreement
shall require the Owner Trustee to expend or risk funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any
of the Owner Trustee’s duties or powers hereunder, if the
Owner Trustee believes or is advised by its legal counsel that
repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or
liability is not assured or provided to its reasonable
satisfaction.

validity or sufficiency of the Transaction Documents or any other
document contemplated thereby to which the Owner Trustee is not a
party.

(h) Notwithstanding anything
contained herein or in any of the Transaction Documents to the

approval or authorization or order of or the giving of notice to,
or the registration with or taking of any action in respect of, any
state or other governmental authority or agency of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Delaware; (ii) result in any fee, tax
