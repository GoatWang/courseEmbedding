Shawn McCormick













Shawn McCormick
creative web developer serving small shops & growing companies







About Shawn


							I love good code, good design, and cats.
						
I'm a web developer based in north Dallas that specializes in what smaller businesses need: websites, email newsletters, blogs, and e-commerce solutions. I've been a graphic designer, a family photographer, and an artist—but I've never stopped enjoying clean, concise code and what it can do for the people who need it.
 
Waxing poetic? Nah. Try running any business in this day and age without a website. Without a good website. Sure, it's possible... but why play the game on hard mode when money's being left on the table?




Code Samples




A tiny sampling of my coding work.
I'd love to show you more, but a lot of it is proprietary.





This Website
I know, it's a bit of a cheat, but still: my own website shawnmccormick.com is a great example of my work.




My Resume
Everybody needs a fancy coded version of their resume, right?






Health & Wellness Email Newsletter
A lot of the work I've done for clients is in hand-coded emails. I can't share the content, but I can share the code here.




Jamberry Landing Page
I made a simple, one-page website for a Jamberry consultant.









Clients





"Shawn always has a positive attitude and is a team player, regardless of the task. He learns quickly and does great work."
Elise, Email Marketing Manager





"Shawn created a website for me in record time! It looks great on my phone, on my iPad, on my laptop."
Ty, Independent Jamberry Consultant





"Shawn never refuses to help. His code is solid and thorough."
Matt, Web Developer
