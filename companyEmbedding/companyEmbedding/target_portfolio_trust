Exchange-Traded Funds

                Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) provide an efficient and simple way to invest in worldwide markets. ETFs offer investors the opportunity to buy and sell an entire basket of securities with a single transaction throughout the trading day. ETFs combine the characteristics of a mutual fund with the convenience and trading flexibility of stocks. ETFs offer investors the potential advantages of low operating costs and improved tax efficiency over traditional, actively-managed mutual funds.

As a result of several factors which may include changing interest rates, refundings, and sales or defaults on the underlying securities, there is no guarantee that distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time. Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trusts estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit. Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust. Returns and prices will fluctuate. Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated net income, estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.





This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.

First Trust has no knowledge of and has not been provided any information regarding any investor.  Financial advisors must determine whether particular investments are appropriate for their clients.

   The First Estimate for Q2 Real GDP Growth is 2.6% at an Annual Rate



Posted Under: Data Watch • GDP


 Implications:  Nothing in today's GDP report, which includes our first look at economic growth in the second quarter as well as quarterly revisions dating back to 2014, alters our view that the economy remains a Plow Horse.  Real GDP grew at a 2.6% annual rate in the second quarter of the year, not much different from the average growth rate of 2.1% dating back to the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009.  The best news in today's report was that for the second straight quarter, we had an increase in each major part of business investment – investment in equipment, commercial construction, and intellectual property.  That change signals greater business optimism about the future and, if it's sustained, will translate into faster measured productivity growth and economic growth in the next few years.  We like to follow "core" real GDP, which excludes inventories, international trade, and government purchases, none of which can generate long-term economic growth.  Core real GDP grew at a solid 2.7% annual pace in Q2, and that includes a drop in home building at a 6.8% rate that's likely to reverse in the quarters to come, given strong fundamentals in that sector.  In the past year, core GDP is up 2.8%.  In terms of the Federal Reserve, nothing in today's report should alter the likely path of monetary policy over the next year or so.  Nominal GDP (real GDP growth plus inflation) rose at a 3.6% annual rate in Q2, is up 3.7% in the past year, and up at a 3.1% annual rate in the past two years.  All of these figures suggest short-term interest rates should be higher than the roughly 1% where they are today.  Look for the Fed to stay on the path to raising rates again by December and initiating reductions to the size of the balance sheet at the next meeting in late September.  Although investors have their doubts about another rate hike later this year, we think those doubts will recede in the next couple of months.  Slow inventory investment has been holding back the economy in the first half of 2017.  We expect inventories to grow in the second half and for real GDP to grow faster as well.  It's early, but right now we're penciling in a real GDP growth rate of 3%+ in the second half.

   New Orders for Durable Goods Rose 6.5% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Durable Goods


 Implications:  Durable goods orders grew at the fastest pace in nearly three years in June, as Boeing had a surge in orders for new commercial aircraft.  Still, take out orders from the consistently volatile transportation sector, and orders rose 0.2% in June.  That was below what the consensus was expecting but upward revisions to May, when added to the June gain, shows ex-transportation orders up 0.5%.  In the past year, orders ex-transportation are up 6.8%, the largest gain since 2012.  The best news in today's report was for shipments of non-defense capital goods ex-aircraft, or "core" shipments.  These rose 0.2% in June and revised upward for May.  As a result, these orders were up at a 4.2% annual rate in Q2 versus the Q1 average, representing the third consecutive quarter of healthy growth following near constant declines from late 2014 to late 2016.  In part, this reflects the fact that energy prices have been more stable since the huge decline in late 2014.  However, it also likely reflects the willingness of businesses to invest more aggressively for efficiency purposes as the labor market gets tighter.  It looks like companies may be tired of waiting for Washington to make progress on tax reform and other issues, and starting to commit to significant longer-term decisions.  In employment news this morning, initial jobless claims rose 10,000 last week to 244,000, which is also the four-week moving average.  Meanwhile continuing claims declined 13,000 to 1.96 million.  It's still early – we will update our models next week as we get more claims data plus the ADP report – but plugging today's figures into our models suggests payrolls are up about 175,000 in July.

   The Road to Normal Starts in September



Posted Under: Government • Fed Reserve • Interest Rates


 The Federal Reserve made no changes to interest rates today and made almost no changes to the text of its statement.  However, the wording changes it did make strongly support our view the Fed will announce the start of balance sheet reductions at the end of its next meeting on September 20.
First, the Fed qualified its reference to maintaining its current policy of rolling over principal payments by saying this was the policy only for the "time being."  
Second, at the last meeting in June, the Fed said renormalization would start "this year."  Now it says "relatively soon," the same language Fed Chief Yellen used at the press conference (but not the Fed's official statement) back in June.   
Third, back in June the Fed said it "currently" expected to start renormalizing the balance sheet.  That left the Fed wiggle room to change its own expectation, as if it anticipated the possibility of making a change to its timing.  Now, by removing "currently," the Fed is essentially saying the likelihood of changing its mind is much lower.
Put it all together and it looks like an announcement about renormalization is very likely to happen at the next meeting.  Moreover, there were no dissents at all from today's statement, unlike in June, when Minneapolis President Neel Kashkari made a dovish dissent.      
We expect the Fed's September announcement about renormalization to follow the path suggested in June.   For the first three months (presumably, October – December) the Fed will reduce its balance sheet by $10 billion per month ($6 billion in Treasury securities, $4 billion in mortgage-related securities).  Then, every three months, the amount of monthly balance sheet reduction will rise by $10 billion (with the same 60/40 proportion between Treasury securities and mortgage-related securities).  That escalation will continue until the Fed is cutting its balance sheet by $50 billion per month (presumably in the last quarter of 2018).  
Meanwhile, the Fed softened language surrounding inflation expectations, but made it clear they still anticipate inflation moving towards their 2% inflation target over the medium term. Given the continued improvements in the labor market and consistent – if modest - inflation, we still anticipate the Fed will raise rates once more in 2017. That may change as markets react to the balance sheet normalization process and additional economic data, but, unlike many in the market, we place the odds of a December rate hike at well over 50%.
While others fret about renormalization and rising rates damaging the economy or financial markets, investors should remain bullish.  Look for faster economic growth and a continuation of the bull market in equities in the years ahead.

   New Single-Family Home Sales Rose 0.8% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Sales • Housing


 Implications:  The trend in new home sales remains upward.  Sales rose 0.8% in June and are up a healthy 9.1% from a year ago.  Although the inventory of unsold new homes rose 3,000 in June, that's not a sign of overbuilding or a reason to be concerned.  The months' supply of new homes – how long it would take to sell all the homes in inventory – is 5.4 months.  By contrast, the average over the past decade is 6.7 months, the average over the past 20 years is 5.6 months.  Moreover, 76% of the current inventory is made up of homes where construction either hasn't started yet or is still underway, meaning these aren't completed homes sitting unsold that will create a headwind for future construction. There are a few key reasons for our positive outlook on housing.  First, job gains continue, which should put continued upward pressure on wage growth.  Second, credit standards in the mortgage market are thawing.  Third, the homeownership rate remains depressed as a larger share of the population is renting, leaving plenty of potential buyers as economic conditions continue to improve.  Look for the upward trend in new home sales to continue in the next few years, which means more room for construction and inventories as well.  On the home price front, the national Case-Shiller index increased 0.2% in May and is up 5.6% in the past year.  That's an acceleration from the 5.0% gain in the year ending in May 2016.  Meanwhile, the FHFA index, which measures prices for homes financed with conforming mortgages, increased 0.4% in May and is up 6.9% in the past year, an acceleration from the 5.9% price gain in the year ending in May 2016.  Faster price gains and more rapid acceleration in the FHFA index are likely due to stricter limits on building middle- and lower-end housing.  Regulations add to the fixed cost of housing, which are easier to absorb on higher priced homes.  On the manufacturing front, the Richmond Fed index, which measures mid-Atlantic factory sentiment, increased to +14 in July from +11 in June.  The +14 for July is the highest for any July since the late 1990s and signals continued health in manufacturing.

   Existing Home Sales Declined 1.8% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Sales • Housing


 Implications:  Existing home sales took a breather in June, giving up ground as median prices reached a new record high for the second consecutive month.  Sales of previously-owned homes fell 1.8% in June to a 5.52 million annual rate, but are still up 0.7% from a year ago.  Going forward, it is important to remember that home sales are volatile from month to month, but we expect the general upward trend of the past several years to keep going.  That being said, tight supply and rising prices remain headwinds.  Inventories have now fallen on a year-over-year basis for 25 consecutive months and are down 7.1% from a year ago.  Inventories are now the lowest for any June since at least the late 1990s.  This has also affected the months' supply of existing homes – how long it would take to sell the current inventory at the most recent sales pace – which was 4.3 months in June, down from 4.6 months a year ago.  According to the NAR, anything less than 5.0 months is considered tight supply, a benchmark which hasn't been exceeded since November 2015.  The good news is that demand for existing homes in June was so strong that 54% of listings were on the market for less than a month.  Higher demand and a shift in the "mix" of homes sold toward more expensive properties has also driven up median prices, which have now risen for 64 consecutive months on a year-over-year basis, and reached a new record high in June.  The strongest growth in sales over the past year is heavily skewed towards the most expensive homes, signaling that supply constraints may be disproportionately hitting the lower end of the market.  Tough regulations on land use raise the fixed costs of housing, tilting development toward higher-end homes.  The NAR suggests that strong demand could also be pushing some properties into higher brackets as multiple offers boost final sales prices.  Although some analysts may be concerned about the impact of higher mortgage rates, it's important to recognize that rates are still low by historical standards, incomes are growing, and the appetite for homeownership is eventually going to move higher again.

   Moderate Growth for Q2






Since the start of the economic recovery in mid-2009, real GDP has grown at an average annual rate of 2.1%.  The second quarter of this year doesn't look much different.  Our calculations suggest real GDP grew at a 2.5% annual rate in Q2, exactly the same as the consensus forecast.
That's an acceleration from the 1.4% pace in Q1 and we expect better growth ahead. But consistently better growth is going to take more than lots of talk from Washington, DC.  Instead, it's going to take some concrete steps, like less regulation, lower tax rates, less spending, and a more free-market approach to health care.        
Here's how we get to 2.5% for Q2.
Consumption:  Automakers reported car and light truck sales dropped at a 12.3% annual rate in Q2.  "Real" (inflation-adjusted) retail sales outside the auto sector grew at a 1.2% rate, but growth in services was strong, in part due to a rebound in (seasonally-adjusted) utility output after unusually mild weather in January and February.  Our models suggest  real personal consumption of goods and services, combined, grew at a 2.9% annual rate in Q2, contributing 2.0 points to the real GDP growth rate (2.9 times the consumption share of GDP, which is 69%, equals 2.0).
Business Investment:  After clicking on all cylinders in Q1, business investment grew more modestly in Q2.  Investment in business equipment and intellectual property both grew at about a 4% rate, but commercial construction fell at about a 7% pace.  Combined, it looks like they grew at a 1.7% rate, which should add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth.  (1.7 times the 13% business investment share of GDP equals 0.2).
Home Building:  While boosting utilities in Q2, the return to more normal weather patterns dampened home construction.  Home building looks like it grew in Q2, but at a 2.5% annualized pace rather than the 12.9% pace in Q1.  The trend is somewhere between the two and we expect continued growth in this sector even if mortgage rates rise, as more jobs and faster wage growth will lead to more demand for housing.  In the meantime, a 2.5% growth rate will add 0.1 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (2.5 times the home building share of GDP, which is 4%, equals 0.1).
Government:  Both military spending and public construction projects look close to trend in Q2.  On net, we're estimating that real government purchases were up at a 1.4% annual rate in Q2, which would add 0.2 points to the real GDP growth rate.  (1.4 times the government purchase share of GDP, which is 17%, equals 0.2).
Trade:  At this point, we only have trade data through May.  Based on what we've seen so far, it looks like net exports should subtract 0.3 points from the real GDP growth rate in Q2.   
Inventories:  We have even less information on inventories than we do on trade, but what we have so far suggests companies are stocking shelves and showrooms at a slightly faster pace in Q2 than they were in Q1, which should add 0.3 points to the real GDP growth rate.
Keep in mind that there are reports on durable goods as well as international trade and inventories the day before the GDP release and those figures could change our forecast as well.  But, for the time being, you can put it all together, and get an estimate of 2.5% for Q2.  
No one should be excited or dismayed by this report.  It is the epitome of the Plow Horse pace of growth we've had for the past eight years.   Hopefully, Washington will now get its act together and make this one of the last Plow Horse reports we have to see.

   Housing Starts Increased 8.3% in June



Posted Under: Data Watch • Home Starts • Housing


 Implications:  After falling for three consecutive months, housing starts rebounded strongly in June, beating the consensus to post their largest monthly gain of the year.  Even though both single-family and multi-unit starts were responsible for the gain in June's headline number, in the past year single-family starts are up 10.3% while multi-unit starts are down 12.9%.  The "mix" of construction has been generally shifting toward single-family building and this is a good sign for the overall economy.  When the housing recovery started, multi-family construction led the way. But the share of all housing starts that are multi-family appears to have peaked in 2015, when 35.7% of all starts were multi-family, the largest since the mid-1980s, when the last wave of Baby Boomers was growing up and moving to cities. In June, the multi-family share of starts was 30.1%.  The shift toward single-family is a positive sign for the economy because, on average, each single-family home contributes to GDP about twice the amount of a multi-family unit.  Based on population growth and "scrappage," housing starts should eventually rise to about 1.5 million units per year. In other words, much of the recovery in home building is still ahead of us.  Another bright spot in today's report was that housing completions rose 5.2% in June and are now up 8.1% in the past year.  Further, building permits for new structures posted their biggest one month jump since 2015 in June.  Expect housing starts to continue to gain steam in the months ahead as more unfinished projects are completed and builders move onto new ones.  In other recent housing news, the NAHB index, which measures sentiment among home builders fell to a still elevated 64 in July from 67 in June.  Expect further strength in the housing sector in the year ahead as more jobs, faster wage growth, and, for at least the time being, optimism about more market-friendly policies from the Trump Administration, continue to encourage both prospective home buyers and builders.  On the factory front, the Empire State index, a measure of manufacturing sentiment in New York, fell to a still healthy 9.8 in July from 19.8 in June. Finally, on inflation, import prices fell 0.2% in June but are up 1.5% from a year ago.  Export prices also fell 0.2% in June, but have increased 0.6% in the past year.  Both figures are a stark contrast to the negative direction of prices in the year ending in June 2016.

Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, Vanguard may exclude any portion of these portfolio holdings from publication on this Site when deemed in the best interest of the fund.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on a delayed basis and will not necessarily represent all of the actual investments held by the relevant Vanguard fund.Portfolio holdings may exclude any temporary cash investments and equity index products.The following additional terms and conditions apply to the publication on this Site of any Vanguard fund's portfolio holdings as described above:By accessing the portfolio holdings, you agree not to reproduce, distribute, or disseminate the portfolio holdings, in whole or in part, in any form without prior written permission of Vanguard.Except with respect to Vanguard Money Market Funds, the portfolio holdings are provided on an "as is" basis, and Vanguard makes no express or implied warranties or representations with respect to the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or fitness of the portfolio holdings or any financial results you may achieve from their use.In no event shall Vanguard or its affiliates have any liability relating to the use of the portfolio holdings.




StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for bond funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for bond funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

Learn more about Zephyr StyleADVISOR
Style advisor charts represent one indicator of a fund's long-term style consistency. They show the fund's investment style, based on analysis of historical performance during rolling three-year time periods. Performance-based style advisor incorporates the correlation of the fund's returns to the returns of four generic benchmark indexes, which represent the four quadrants: Russell 1000 Value, representing large-cap value (upper left); Russell 1000 Growth, representing large-cap growth (upper right); Russell 2000 Value, representing small-cap value (lower left); and Russell 2000 Growth, representing small-cap growth (lower right). The charts represent style in two views: Single point and multiple points (moving windows).

Single-point view
The single-point view represents the manager's average style for the entire time period.


Multiple-points view
The multiple-points view shows whether the fund's returns have remained correlated with a particular market index, or whether they have shifted over time and become more correlated with a different market index. Larger points (or symbols) represent more recent time periods among the series of rolling three-year periods. Points that are tightly clustered—instead of moving around the box—show consistent correlation with a particular index.


Limitations of performance-based style analysis
Performance-based style analysis can be a valuable indicator—one component of a fund's investment style. However, we do not recommend its use in isolation because it represents only a single dimension based on the correlation of historical performance. The term "investment style" has a broader meaning that generally includes the types of stocks preferred by an advisor and the advisor's investment process. We recommend a multidimensional view of style—incorporating analysis of a fund's holdings, aggregate characteristics, relative characteristics, and relative performance versus benchmarks and peer groups over time—to develop an understanding of the investment process.

Product management

Vanguard Target Retirement 2040 Trust Plus uses an asset allocation strategy designed for investors planning to retire between 2038 and 2042. The trust seeks to provide growth of capital and current income consistent with its current target allocation by investing in a gradually more conservative mix of the following Vanguard funds: Total Stock Market Index Fund, Total Bond Market II Index Fund, Total International Bond Index Fund, and Total International Stock Index Fund. The combination of funds produces a portfolio that is diversified by asset class and holdings.Vanguard Target Retirement 2040 Trust Plus is one of a series of Vanguard life-cycle trusts that use a targeted maturity approach as a simplified way to meet investors’ different objectives, time horizons, and changing risk tolerances. As your retirement date approaches, the trust’s allocation will grow more conservative and will begin to invest in the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund to provide a hedge against inflation while dampening the overall volatility of the portfolio. In this regard, the trust diversifies both stock and conventional bond exposure. Within seven years after 2040, the trust’s asset allocation should resemble that of the Target Retirement Income Trust Plus.
