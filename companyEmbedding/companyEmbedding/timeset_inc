The Democrats√¢¬Ä¬ô Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the party√¢¬Ä¬ôs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

While other social media apps focus on the past, timeset looks to the future. Members can set goals like cities they‚Äôd like to visit or skills they‚Äôd like to learn, and share these goals with the world. Other timeset users can weigh in on those aspirations with their own experiences and recommendations- all without intrusive and manipulative advertising.
Timeset appeals to smart phone users of all ages, who want to set short and long-term goals. As social media use continue to climb, timeset is poised to reach millions of people who are ready make their dreams a reality.¬†¬† ¬† 














Throwback Thursdays allow us to hashtag our fourth-grade elementary school portraits, but what social media community enriches our future selves?
The nine-year-old in that old photo was dreaming of big things, and you still do too. Now there‚Äôs a way to quantify and visualize future goals the same way we reminisce about the past. 













With timeset, you share with the world your future plans. Our unique app connects users with similar interests and aspirations, allowing them to make recommendations, encourage each other, and learn from each other.
Timeset allows users to upload images and videos of the places they‚Äôve visited, restaurants they‚Äôve dined at, and the skills they‚Äôve learned. Other users then explore these images and stories to plan their own trips and set their own goals and milestones.
Our location services make us unique. While other social media communities allow users to compile lists, we incorporate those lists into a map of the world, making timeset more relevant to both members and advertisers alike. 













The intuitive timeset format feels familiar to other social media apps, so it‚Äôs easy to use. Every member is able to create ‚Äúbucket lists‚Äù for their goals, which they then populate with images that represent milestones in achieving those goals.
Once a bucket list is created and shared, other users can contribute their related experiences.

In the above example, Archie is a timeset member who aspires to play the ‚ÄúOld Course‚Äù at St. Andrews in Scotland. ¬†He also wants to compete in an off-shore fishing tournament and eat a prime steak at Spark‚Äôs Steakhouse. These are Archie‚Äôs bucket lists.
When Archie finds he will be traveling to South Africa for business and a few days of leisure, he adds a bucket list for this trip. Timeset members enhance Archie‚Äôs visit by recommending spots and activities in Cape Town that he would enjoy based on his other interests. For Archie, this includes golf courses, fishing charters, and fine dining establishments. Archie gets recommendations for his trip based on his interests, and local businesses get to make contact with a likely customer who will be visiting their town. 













Community over Commercialism. Timeset connects its users to other members of the community for a more authentic experience. Banner ads are prohibited, as is unsolicited commercial contact. The feedback you get from timeset is feedback from other people like you. A member only receives an advertisement if he or she requests it.
Accurate Marketing Data. While timeset eliminates intrusive advertising for the user, it allows for more targeted marketing for an advertiser. With locality metrics, local businesses are able to connect with potential customers. Most social media companies predict a user‚Äôs future habits by extrapolating past data. Timeset compiles specific information, provided by the user, about their intended future behavior. This makes our platform far more relevant and useful to both businesses seeking customers and users seeking products and services.
Open Community. Unlike Facebook or WhatsApp, timeset is an open community format. Through timeset, members can connect to others through common interests.
Proactive search engine and passive personal assistant. Timeset allows users to search for information about their goals, while also making recommendations and relaying feedback from other users.
Visualizing the future. With timeset, you‚Äôll quickly accumulate a collection of images that reflect your aspirations. It‚Äôs like looking at a photo album from your future!
Short and Long-Term Goals. With Bucket Lists, users can set weekly, monthly, yearly, and lifetime goals.
Great for all ages, all goals. Timeset appeals to everyone from high school seniors planning their education and career to soon-to-be senior citizens planning their retirement travel. 













In just a year since we released timeset in Google Play, we‚Äôve made some exciting partnerships. We‚Äôve teamed up with New York music festival, Governor‚Äùs Ball. Perhaps our biggest supporter is college basketball coaching legend, John Calipari.


Coach ‚ÄúCal‚Äù is passionate about helping others achieve their goals, and is an enthusiastic champion of timeset. With 600 wins and 17 NCAA Tournament appearances in 24 years of coaching, he knows a thing or two about turning aspirations into success. By using our app, he can share with a worldwide audience his goals and how he works to achieve them. Calipari touts the app‚Äôs ability to make the process behind achieving goals transparent. Through his influence at the University of Kentucky and beyond, he will be an invaluable advocate for timeset. 













Our plans for future development of the app include a virtual reality feature. ¬†We‚Äôre also working on more celebrity marketing partnerships.
