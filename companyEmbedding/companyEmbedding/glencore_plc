BEWARE - Recruitment Scams!Recruitment scams are a type of advance fee fraud in which fraudulent organisations or persons posing as recruitment agents or employers require advance payments from job seekers or ask them to receive and remit payments from/to third parties. Glencore has been informed that on a number of occasions, job seekers have received unsolicited job offers and interview invitations related to Glencore in which advance payments or payment transfers have been required. Any communication received of this kind should be treated as spam and deleted immediately. Genuine communication related to recruitment by Glencore will never require the job seeker to make payments at any point in the recruitment process. Read more...

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018

Glencore plc Reports Production Results for the Second Quarter and Half Year of 2017; Provides Production Guidance for the Full Year of 2017
Jul 27 17
Glencore Plc reported production results for the second quarter and half year of 2017. For the period, the company reported own-sourced copper production of 642,900 tonnes was down 9%, reflecting a transition to mining a greater portion of copper/zinc ores at Antamina (noting concurrent higher zinc grades /production), temporary lower copper grades at Antapaccay, the effects of wet weather at Mutanda resulting in reduced ore throughput, and lower production /pit stability issues at Alumbrera as it nears end of life. Own-sourced zinc production of 570,800 tonnes was up 13%, reflecting the Antamina increase noted above and generally solid performances across the portfolio. Own-sourced nickel production of 51,200 tonnes was down 10%, reflecting scheduled maintenance at Murrin and INO, partly offset by the stabilising and improving performance at Koniambo. Attributable ferrochrome production of 836,000 tonnes was up 10%, reflecting more furnace production time, period over period, and strong furnace operational performances. Coal production of 61.1 million tonnes was up 4% on first half of 2016, mainly reflecting planned increases in the Australian coal portfolio.

For the quarter, the company reported production of copper of 318,800 tonnes against 368,000 tonnes a year ago. Zinc production was 291,600 tonnes against 249,400 tonnes a year ago. Gold production was 265,000 ounces against 257,000 ounces a year ago.

For the full year of 2017, the company expects copper production of 1,330,000 tonnes plus or minus 25, zinc production of 1,130,000 tonnes plus or minus 25, lead production of 285,000 tonnes plus or minus 10, nickel production of 115,000 tonnes plus or minus 4, ferrochrome production of 1,585 plus or minus 25 and coal production of 132 m tonnes plus or minus 3.

Glencore plc (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company with headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, and a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. The current company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013.[3] As of 2015[update], it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[4] It is the world's third-largest family business.[5]
As Glencore International, the company was already one of the world's leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities. It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world's largest commodities trading company, with a 2010 global market share of 60% in internationally tradable zinc, 50% in internationally tradable copper, 9 percent in the internationally tradable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradable oil market.[6][7][8]
Glencore had a number of production facilities all around the world and supplied metals, minerals, crude oil, oil products, coal, natural gas and agricultural products to international customers in the automotive, power generation, steel production and food processing industries.[7] The company was formed in 1994 by a management buyout of Marc Rich + Co AG (itself founded in 1974).[7] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in May 2011 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[9][10] It has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[11] Glencore's shares started trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2013.[12] The Qatar Investment Authority is its biggest shareholder.[13]

History[edit]
1974-1994: Formation and sale[edit]
An Australian Public Radio report said, "Glencore's history reads like a spy novel".[14] The company was founded as Marc Rich & Co. AG in 1974 by billionaire commodity trader Marc Rich. Rich was charged in the US with tax evasion and illegal business dealings with Iran, but pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.[15]
In 1993, commodity trading and marketing company Trafigura was split off from Marc Rich's group of companies.[16] As physical commodities traders like Trafigura, Glencore's main rivals in 2011 were identified as Vitol and Cargill,[17] amongst others.[18] In 1993 and 1994, after failing to take control of the zinc market and losing $172 million, Glencore's founder Marc Rich was forced[15][17] to sell his 51 percent majority share in his own company, Marc Rich & Company AG, to Glencore International, the commodities trading and industrial company.[19]
2015: Recent finances[edit]
Due to weak global prices for the assets Glencore owned, particularly coal and copper producers, and for the commodities in which Glencore traded, the company showed a net operating loss of $676 million for the first half of 2015. As of September 2015 the value of its stock had fallen significantly.[20] Concerns financial analysts cited to explain the falling stock price included a weak global commodity market and Glencore's high level of debt,[21] $30 billion. The company was reducing debt by selling off stock and assets.[20]
2005-2011: Glencore, Dan Gertler and the Congo[edit]
In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).[22]
In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.[23]
In 2011 Reuters called Glencore as "the biggest company you never heard of," and described how Glencore and Dan Gertler partnered in Nikanor from 2007 until it merged with Katanga Mining. Reuters called the Nikanor acquisition an example of Glencore's opportunistic, contrarian, well-funded investment approach—focusing on equity participation, controlling interest, and working upstream from trading relationships.[17][24]

The acquisition was the culmination of 18 months of deal-making in Congo... [including fighting off a counterbid by] former England cricketer Phil Edmonds.... [Starting i]n June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining magnate, paid GB£300 million for a quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga Mining's properties. That deal gave Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output – an "offtake" agreement.... [Then, on Christmas Eve 2008, ... [having] lost 97 percent of its market value over the previous six months ... in the depths of the global financial crisis and ... running out of cash, Katanga accepted a deal for about US$500 million in a convertible loan and rights issue. Katanga agreed to issue more than a billion new shares and hand what would become 74% to Glencore. ... [By early 2011], with copper prices regularly setting records above US$10,000 a ton, Katanga's stock market value [had reached] nearly US$3.2 billion.... After a US$108 million loss in 2009, after acquisition it posted a 2010 annual profit of US$265 million.

In May 2011 the company launched an IPO valuing the business at US$61 billion[25] and creating five new billionaires.[26] Trading was limited to institutional investors for the first week and private investors weren't allowed to buy shares until 24 May 2011.[27]
In early 2011, Reuters reports included speculation from Liberum's Rawlinson that, after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Glencore could develop an interest in London/Kazakh-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.[17] Glencore said that, contrary to recent reports, it was not interested in bidding for the under-fire group.[28]
Associations with other mining companies[edit]
Along with several other major coal producers, Glencore is also a large shareholder in globalCOAL, the online physical coal trading platform. The board of globalCOAL contains a number of power utility shareholders. Relationships also exist with Century Aluminum Co. (CENX; 44% economic ownership interest)[29]) in the US; Glencore partial subsidiary Minara Resources Ltd (AU:MRE), a 70.5% stake in one of Australia’s top three nickel producers[29]);[30] and 8.8% in United Company Rusal (HK:486), the Russian aluminium giant that went public in 2010.[29]
In mid-2011, Century was called "one of the most harrowing stocks of the past few years" but identified as a risky but potentially profitable investment for the future.[31]
2011-2012: Initial public offering[edit]
Glencore was the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2011 in a dual listing in London and Hong Kong valued at about $US60 billion. The 1,637-page document revealed invaluable information about this private company that has remained discreet for thirty-seven years. Ivan Glasenberg's shareholding was diluted from 18.1% before the IPO percent to 15.8% afterwards. Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis, zinc, copper and lead co-directors were diluted from 6.9% to 6%. Glencore went public to raise gross proceeds of around $10 billion. According to Reuters, Glencore is known for its "opportunistic but lucrative acquisition strategy."[32]
In May 2011, United Arab Emirates state-owned Aabar Investments confirmed an investment of $850 million in Glencore International plc as a cornerstone investor with an intention to invest an additional $150 million in the Global Offer. The investment made Aabar the largest cornerstone investor in the initial public offering (IPO) and the largest new shareholder of Glencore after its IPO, giving Aabar a 1.4% stake. The two firms intend to explore areas of co-operation.[33] [34]
In November 2012 Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned United Arab Emirates International Petroleum Investment Company, wrote off more than $392-million of its $1-billion investment into Glencore's IPO less than two years after investing it. Aabar Investments was the largest new shareholder in Glencore.[35]
2012-2013: Merger with Xstrata[edit]
Prior to its merger with Xstrata, Glencore is reported to have served as a marketing partner for the company.[36][37] As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte (de) and Ivan Glasenberg were on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chaired. According to The Sunday Times, by 2006, Glencore controlled 40% of Xstrata stock and appointed Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.[36][38] In February 2012, Glencore International Plc, agreed to buy Xstrata Plc for GB£39.1 billion (US$62 billion) in shares. Glencore offered 2.8 new shares for each Xstrata share in agreed all-share "merger of equal". It is the biggest mining takeover ever, and after approval would create an entity with 2012 sales of US$209 billion.[39] In June 2012, Glencore and Xstrata began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, following shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.[40]
In October 2012, BBC News reported that Glencore had more ships than the British Royal Navy. Glencore's operations in 40 countries handled 3% of the world's oil consumption. Xstrata's operations in more than 20 countries employed 70,000 people. According to mining analyst John Meyer, if the two companies merged into Glencore Xstrata, they would be the 4th largest commodities trader in the world.[41]
Just before completing its forced April 2013 takeover of mining rival Xstrata as it awaited Chinese regulatory approval for its long-planned merger, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, the annual income of Glencore fell 25% percent, as its trading division offset the impact of weak commodity prices. Including the impact of an impairment related to a reclassification of its holding in Russian aluminium producer RUSAL, net income fell 75%.[42] On 2 May 2013, it completed the merger with Xstrata.[3] On 20 May 2014, Glencore Xstrata changed its name to Glencore plc.[43] After the merger with Glencore, Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would no longer work as employee but would become a consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marked a massive shift in the company's strategy and Xstrata was entering a post-Reid era.[44]
2011: Financial and accounting manipulations[edit]
In 2011 five non-government organisations filed a complaint to the OECD against a subsidiary of Glencore over allegations that a mine it owns in Zambia may not be paying enough tax on its profits. The cause for the complaint lay in the financial and accounting manipulations performed by the two companies' subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (MCM), to evade taxation in Zambia.[45][46] A draft Grant Thornton report alleged that tax avoidance by Glencore in Zambia cost the Zambian Government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. The avoidance was alleged to have been facilitated through mechanisms such as transfer pricing and inflated costs at Glencore's Mopani Copper Mine. The Mopani mines are controlled through the British Virgin Islands, a recognised tax haven.[47] Glencore and its own auditor, Deloitte, rejected these allegations.[48][49][50]
2005: Dealings with "rogue states"[edit]
ABC Radio reported in 2005 that Glencore "has been accused of illegal dealings with rogue states: apartheid South Africa, USSR, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein", and has a "history of busting UN embargoes to profit from corrupt or despotic regimes".[14] Specifically, Glencore was reported to have been named by the CIA to have paid $3,222,780 in illegal kickbacks to obtain oil in the course of the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq. The company denied these charges, according to the CIA report quoted by ABC.[14][51]
Investments in Colombia[edit]
Swiss public television (TSR) reported in 2006 that allegations of corruption and severe human rights violations were being raised against Glencore due to the alleged conduct of its Colombian Cerrejón mining subsidiary. Local union president Francisco Ramirez accused Cerrejón of forced expropriations and evacuations of entire villages to enable mine expansion, in complicity with Colombian authorities. A representative of the local Wayuu Indians also accused Colombian paramilitary and military units, including those charged with Cerrejón mining security, of forcibly driving the Wayuu off their land in what she described as a "massacre".[52]
A BBC investigation in 2012 uncovered sale documents showing the company had paid the associates of paramilitary killers in Colombia. In 2011, a Colombian court was told by former paramilitaries that they stole the land so they could sell it to Glencore's subsidiary Prodeco, to start an open-cast coal mine; the court accepted their evidence and concluded that coal was the motive for the massacre. Glencore disputed the court's ruling.[53][54]
Glencore/Xtrata's "huge coal operation in Colombia, Prodeco, was fined a total of nearly $700,000 in 2009 for several environmental violations [running in earlier years], including waste disposal without a permit and producing coal without an environmental management plan."[17]
Glencore/Xtrata's activities in Colombia under their subsidiary, Prodeco, was investigated by the Netherlands-based NGO, Pax for Peace. They found that, "From 1996 to 2006, residents of the Cesar mining region of Colombia, from which European power utilities source most of their coal, have suffered greatly from paramilitary violence ... Prodeco mining companies have supported the paramilitary forces with finance, equipment and information. The mining companies deny any involvement, but those victims of human rights violations who stand up for their rights, are still being threatened." The coal mined by Prodeco is termed "Blood Coal." Pax released a report and included the testimony of victims and the paramilitary that attacked the indigenous population.[55]
Investments in Ecuador[edit]
"In Ecuador, the current government has tried to reduce the role played by middlemen such as Glencore with state oil company Petroecuador" due to questions about transparency and follow-through, according to Fernando Villavicencio, a Quito-based oil sector analyst.[17]
Investments in Zambia[edit]
According to a Reuters article in 2011 "[O]fficials in Zambia believe pollution from Glencore's Mopani mine is causing acid rain and health problems in an area where 5 million people live."[17] The upgrade of the Mopani Mines asset plant was completed in March 2014 eliminating the emissions of 97 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions in line with the recommended international standards by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[56]
An audit report from 2009 revealed an unexplained increase in operating costs in 2007 (+ $380 million), stunningly low reported volumes of extracted cobalt when compared to similar mining companies operating in the region, and manipulations of copper selling prices in favor of Glencore which constitute a violation of OECD’s “arm’s length” principle. The result of those various processes was to lower MCM’s net income for the 2003-2008 period by several hundreds of millions of dollars, hereby substantially lightening the company’s tax burden.[57]
Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo[edit]
The company's Luilu copper refinery uses acid to extract the copper. For three years after taking over the mine it continued to allow the waste acid to flow into a river. The chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, was interviewed for Panorama by John Sweeney and said 'It was impossible to remedy any way faster'[58] Glencore said the pollution started long before the company took over the refinery and that it has now ended.[58] A reporter for The Guardian found children as young as ten underground at the Tilwezembe mine, which the company had said in a 2008 prospectus that it had closed due to falling copper prices. These have since rebounded. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said the company does not profit from child labor, and the child miners were part of artisanal mining by nearby residents that Glencore was trying to prevent. But Panorama tracked a shipment of copper from the mine to Groupe Bazano plant and from that plant to a Glencore smelter in Zambia.[59]
They have also been accused of acquiring illicit "conflict minerals"[60] In a detailed letter sent to Global Witness, the company denied any wrongdoing.[60]
Glencore acquired stakes in the Kansuki mine in Congo's southern Katanga Province in 2012. According to Global Witness, Congo's government transferred a 75 per cent stake in Kansuki mine in secret and at vastly undervalued prices in July 2010 to a company in which Dan Gertler, who is a close friend of President Joseph Kabila, has an interest. Just a month later, in August 2010, Glencore took half the shares of the company that acquired that 75 per cent stake, becoming the operator of the mine. Glencore is financing the entire development of the Kansuki mine, thereby carrying the costs for the other partner companies, which are associated with Mr Gertler.[61] Glencore said at the time "During the period when these transactions took place, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholdings in DRC projects."[62]
Glencore acquired a 50 per cent share in SAMREF Congo SPRL in 2007, a Congolese-registered company holding 80% of the Mutanda Mine.[63] According to Global Witness, SAMREF recommended on 1 March 2011 that Congo's state-run company Gécamines, holding the other 20% share in the Mutanda Mine, sell this share to an entity also associated with Dan Gertler and went on to question the links between Glencore and Dan Gertler.[64] Glencore has been designated operator of the Mutanda Mine.[61] Glencore has responded a number of times to Global Witness regarding these allegations.[65]
Western Sahara[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, a subsidiary of Glencore Xstrata was awarded two offshore drilling licences off the coast of occupied Western Sahara. The licences are awarded in clear violation of international law, as described by the UN in 2002.[66]
Operations[edit]
In May 2014 the company announced it would close its underground Newlands coal mine in Queensland, Australia in late 2015. The mine, begun in 1983, produced 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2013. The company had earlier suspended operations at its Ravensworth underground mine following falling coal prices, escalating production costs, and a higher Australian dollar. [67][68][69]
Board of directors[edit]
As of October 2014:[70]

Tony Hayward (Non-executive Chairman)
Ivan Glasenberg (CEO)
Peter Grauer (Non-executive Director)
Peter Coates (Non-executive Director)
Leonhard Fischer (Non-executive Director)
William Macaulay (Non-executive Director)
John Mack (Non-executive Director)
Patrice Merrin (Non-executive Director)

Women on the board[edit]
In 2011, Glencore was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, chairman Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things", remarks for which he later apologised.[71] By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called "pariah status".[72] Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.[73]

Glencore plc (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company with headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, and a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. The current company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013.[3] As of 2015[update], it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[4] It is the world's third-largest family business.[5]
As Glencore International, the company was already one of the world's leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities. It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world's largest commodities trading company, with a 2010 global market share of 60% in internationally tradable zinc, 50% in internationally tradable copper, 9 percent in the internationally tradable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradable oil market.[6][7][8]
Glencore had a number of production facilities all around the world and supplied metals, minerals, crude oil, oil products, coal, natural gas and agricultural products to international customers in the automotive, power generation, steel production and food processing industries.[7] The company was formed in 1994 by a management buyout of Marc Rich + Co AG (itself founded in 1974).[7] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in May 2011 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[9][10] It has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[11] Glencore's shares started trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2013.[12] The Qatar Investment Authority is its biggest shareholder.[13]

History[edit]
1974-1994: Formation and sale[edit]
An Australian Public Radio report said, "Glencore's history reads like a spy novel".[14] The company was founded as Marc Rich & Co. AG in 1974 by billionaire commodity trader Marc Rich. Rich was charged in the US with tax evasion and illegal business dealings with Iran, but pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.[15]
In 1993, commodity trading and marketing company Trafigura was split off from Marc Rich's group of companies.[16] As physical commodities traders like Trafigura, Glencore's main rivals in 2011 were identified as Vitol and Cargill,[17] amongst others.[18] In 1993 and 1994, after failing to take control of the zinc market and losing $172 million, Glencore's founder Marc Rich was forced[15][17] to sell his 51 percent majority share in his own company, Marc Rich & Company AG, to Glencore International, the commodities trading and industrial company.[19]
2015: Recent finances[edit]
Due to weak global prices for the assets Glencore owned, particularly coal and copper producers, and for the commodities in which Glencore traded, the company showed a net operating loss of $676 million for the first half of 2015. As of September 2015 the value of its stock had fallen significantly.[20] Concerns financial analysts cited to explain the falling stock price included a weak global commodity market and Glencore's high level of debt,[21] $30 billion. The company was reducing debt by selling off stock and assets.[20]
2005-2011: Glencore, Dan Gertler and the Congo[edit]
In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).[22]
In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.[23]
In 2011 Reuters called Glencore as "the biggest company you never heard of," and described how Glencore and Dan Gertler partnered in Nikanor from 2007 until it merged with Katanga Mining. Reuters called the Nikanor acquisition an example of Glencore's opportunistic, contrarian, well-funded investment approach—focusing on equity participation, controlling interest, and working upstream from trading relationships.[17][24]

The acquisition was the culmination of 18 months of deal-making in Congo... [including fighting off a counterbid by] former England cricketer Phil Edmonds.... [Starting i]n June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining magnate, paid GB£300 million for a quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga Mining's properties. That deal gave Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output – an "offtake" agreement.... [Then, on Christmas Eve 2008, ... [having] lost 97 percent of its market value over the previous six months ... in the depths of the global financial crisis and ... running out of cash, Katanga accepted a deal for about US$500 million in a convertible loan and rights issue. Katanga agreed to issue more than a billion new shares and hand what would become 74% to Glencore. ... [By early 2011], with copper prices regularly setting records above US$10,000 a ton, Katanga's stock market value [had reached] nearly US$3.2 billion.... After a US$108 million loss in 2009, after acquisition it posted a 2010 annual profit of US$265 million.

In May 2011 the company launched an IPO valuing the business at US$61 billion[25] and creating five new billionaires.[26] Trading was limited to institutional investors for the first week and private investors weren't allowed to buy shares until 24 May 2011.[27]
In early 2011, Reuters reports included speculation from Liberum's Rawlinson that, after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Glencore could develop an interest in London/Kazakh-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.[17] Glencore said that, contrary to recent reports, it was not interested in bidding for the under-fire group.[28]
Associations with other mining companies[edit]
Along with several other major coal producers, Glencore is also a large shareholder in globalCOAL, the online physical coal trading platform. The board of globalCOAL contains a number of power utility shareholders. Relationships also exist with Century Aluminum Co. (CENX; 44% economic ownership interest)[29]) in the US; Glencore partial subsidiary Minara Resources Ltd (AU:MRE), a 70.5% stake in one of Australia’s top three nickel producers[29]);[30] and 8.8% in United Company Rusal (HK:486), the Russian aluminium giant that went public in 2010.[29]
In mid-2011, Century was called "one of the most harrowing stocks of the past few years" but identified as a risky but potentially profitable investment for the future.[31]
2011-2012: Initial public offering[edit]
Glencore was the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2011 in a dual listing in London and Hong Kong valued at about $US60 billion. The 1,637-page document revealed invaluable information about this private company that has remained discreet for thirty-seven years. Ivan Glasenberg's shareholding was diluted from 18.1% before the IPO percent to 15.8% afterwards. Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis, zinc, copper and lead co-directors were diluted from 6.9% to 6%. Glencore went public to raise gross proceeds of around $10 billion. According to Reuters, Glencore is known for its "opportunistic but lucrative acquisition strategy."[32]
In May 2011, United Arab Emirates state-owned Aabar Investments confirmed an investment of $850 million in Glencore International plc as a cornerstone investor with an intention to invest an additional $150 million in the Global Offer. The investment made Aabar the largest cornerstone investor in the initial public offering (IPO) and the largest new shareholder of Glencore after its IPO, giving Aabar a 1.4% stake. The two firms intend to explore areas of co-operation.[33] [34]
In November 2012 Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned United Arab Emirates International Petroleum Investment Company, wrote off more than $392-million of its $1-billion investment into Glencore's IPO less than two years after investing it. Aabar Investments was the largest new shareholder in Glencore.[35]
2012-2013: Merger with Xstrata[edit]
Prior to its merger with Xstrata, Glencore is reported to have served as a marketing partner for the company.[36][37] As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte (de) and Ivan Glasenberg were on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chaired. According to The Sunday Times, by 2006, Glencore controlled 40% of Xstrata stock and appointed Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.[36][38] In February 2012, Glencore International Plc, agreed to buy Xstrata Plc for GB£39.1 billion (US$62 billion) in shares. Glencore offered 2.8 new shares for each Xstrata share in agreed all-share "merger of equal". It is the biggest mining takeover ever, and after approval would create an entity with 2012 sales of US$209 billion.[39] In June 2012, Glencore and Xstrata began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, following shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.[40]
In October 2012, BBC News reported that Glencore had more ships than the British Royal Navy. Glencore's operations in 40 countries handled 3% of the world's oil consumption. Xstrata's operations in more than 20 countries employed 70,000 people. According to mining analyst John Meyer, if the two companies merged into Glencore Xstrata, they would be the 4th largest commodities trader in the world.[41]
Just before completing its forced April 2013 takeover of mining rival Xstrata as it awaited Chinese regulatory approval for its long-planned merger, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, the annual income of Glencore fell 25% percent, as its trading division offset the impact of weak commodity prices. Including the impact of an impairment related to a reclassification of its holding in Russian aluminium producer RUSAL, net income fell 75%.[42] On 2 May 2013, it completed the merger with Xstrata.[3] On 20 May 2014, Glencore Xstrata changed its name to Glencore plc.[43] After the merger with Glencore, Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would no longer work as employee but would become a consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marked a massive shift in the company's strategy and Xstrata was entering a post-Reid era.[44]
2011: Financial and accounting manipulations[edit]
In 2011 five non-government organisations filed a complaint to the OECD against a subsidiary of Glencore over allegations that a mine it owns in Zambia may not be paying enough tax on its profits. The cause for the complaint lay in the financial and accounting manipulations performed by the two companies' subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (MCM), to evade taxation in Zambia.[45][46] A draft Grant Thornton report alleged that tax avoidance by Glencore in Zambia cost the Zambian Government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. The avoidance was alleged to have been facilitated through mechanisms such as transfer pricing and inflated costs at Glencore's Mopani Copper Mine. The Mopani mines are controlled through the British Virgin Islands, a recognised tax haven.[47] Glencore and its own auditor, Deloitte, rejected these allegations.[48][49][50]
2005: Dealings with "rogue states"[edit]
ABC Radio reported in 2005 that Glencore "has been accused of illegal dealings with rogue states: apartheid South Africa, USSR, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein", and has a "history of busting UN embargoes to profit from corrupt or despotic regimes".[14] Specifically, Glencore was reported to have been named by the CIA to have paid $3,222,780 in illegal kickbacks to obtain oil in the course of the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq. The company denied these charges, according to the CIA report quoted by ABC.[14][51]
Investments in Colombia[edit]
Swiss public television (TSR) reported in 2006 that allegations of corruption and severe human rights violations were being raised against Glencore due to the alleged conduct of its Colombian Cerrejón mining subsidiary. Local union president Francisco Ramirez accused Cerrejón of forced expropriations and evacuations of entire villages to enable mine expansion, in complicity with Colombian authorities. A representative of the local Wayuu Indians also accused Colombian paramilitary and military units, including those charged with Cerrejón mining security, of forcibly driving the Wayuu off their land in what she described as a "massacre".[52]
A BBC investigation in 2012 uncovered sale documents showing the company had paid the associates of paramilitary killers in Colombia. In 2011, a Colombian court was told by former paramilitaries that they stole the land so they could sell it to Glencore's subsidiary Prodeco, to start an open-cast coal mine; the court accepted their evidence and concluded that coal was the motive for the massacre. Glencore disputed the court's ruling.[53][54]
Glencore/Xtrata's "huge coal operation in Colombia, Prodeco, was fined a total of nearly $700,000 in 2009 for several environmental violations [running in earlier years], including waste disposal without a permit and producing coal without an environmental management plan."[17]
Glencore/Xtrata's activities in Colombia under their subsidiary, Prodeco, was investigated by the Netherlands-based NGO, Pax for Peace. They found that, "From 1996 to 2006, residents of the Cesar mining region of Colombia, from which European power utilities source most of their coal, have suffered greatly from paramilitary violence ... Prodeco mining companies have supported the paramilitary forces with finance, equipment and information. The mining companies deny any involvement, but those victims of human rights violations who stand up for their rights, are still being threatened." The coal mined by Prodeco is termed "Blood Coal." Pax released a report and included the testimony of victims and the paramilitary that attacked the indigenous population.[55]
Investments in Ecuador[edit]
"In Ecuador, the current government has tried to reduce the role played by middlemen such as Glencore with state oil company Petroecuador" due to questions about transparency and follow-through, according to Fernando Villavicencio, a Quito-based oil sector analyst.[17]
Investments in Zambia[edit]
According to a Reuters article in 2011 "[O]fficials in Zambia believe pollution from Glencore's Mopani mine is causing acid rain and health problems in an area where 5 million people live."[17] The upgrade of the Mopani Mines asset plant was completed in March 2014 eliminating the emissions of 97 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions in line with the recommended international standards by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[56]
An audit report from 2009 revealed an unexplained increase in operating costs in 2007 (+ $380 million), stunningly low reported volumes of extracted cobalt when compared to similar mining companies operating in the region, and manipulations of copper selling prices in favor of Glencore which constitute a violation of OECD’s “arm’s length” principle. The result of those various processes was to lower MCM’s net income for the 2003-2008 period by several hundreds of millions of dollars, hereby substantially lightening the company’s tax burden.[57]
Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo[edit]
The company's Luilu copper refinery uses acid to extract the copper. For three years after taking over the mine it continued to allow the waste acid to flow into a river. The chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, was interviewed for Panorama by John Sweeney and said 'It was impossible to remedy any way faster'[58] Glencore said the pollution started long before the company took over the refinery and that it has now ended.[58] A reporter for The Guardian found children as young as ten underground at the Tilwezembe mine, which the company had said in a 2008 prospectus that it had closed due to falling copper prices. These have since rebounded. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said the company does not profit from child labor, and the child miners were part of artisanal mining by nearby residents that Glencore was trying to prevent. But Panorama tracked a shipment of copper from the mine to Groupe Bazano plant and from that plant to a Glencore smelter in Zambia.[59]
They have also been accused of acquiring illicit "conflict minerals"[60] In a detailed letter sent to Global Witness, the company denied any wrongdoing.[60]
Glencore acquired stakes in the Kansuki mine in Congo's southern Katanga Province in 2012. According to Global Witness, Congo's government transferred a 75 per cent stake in Kansuki mine in secret and at vastly undervalued prices in July 2010 to a company in which Dan Gertler, who is a close friend of President Joseph Kabila, has an interest. Just a month later, in August 2010, Glencore took half the shares of the company that acquired that 75 per cent stake, becoming the operator of the mine. Glencore is financing the entire development of the Kansuki mine, thereby carrying the costs for the other partner companies, which are associated with Mr Gertler.[61] Glencore said at the time "During the period when these transactions took place, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholdings in DRC projects."[62]
Glencore acquired a 50 per cent share in SAMREF Congo SPRL in 2007, a Congolese-registered company holding 80% of the Mutanda Mine.[63] According to Global Witness, SAMREF recommended on 1 March 2011 that Congo's state-run company Gécamines, holding the other 20% share in the Mutanda Mine, sell this share to an entity also associated with Dan Gertler and went on to question the links between Glencore and Dan Gertler.[64] Glencore has been designated operator of the Mutanda Mine.[61] Glencore has responded a number of times to Global Witness regarding these allegations.[65]
Western Sahara[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, a subsidiary of Glencore Xstrata was awarded two offshore drilling licences off the coast of occupied Western Sahara. The licences are awarded in clear violation of international law, as described by the UN in 2002.[66]
Operations[edit]
In May 2014 the company announced it would close its underground Newlands coal mine in Queensland, Australia in late 2015. The mine, begun in 1983, produced 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2013. The company had earlier suspended operations at its Ravensworth underground mine following falling coal prices, escalating production costs, and a higher Australian dollar. [67][68][69]
Board of directors[edit]
As of October 2014:[70]

Tony Hayward (Non-executive Chairman)
Ivan Glasenberg (CEO)
Peter Grauer (Non-executive Director)
Peter Coates (Non-executive Director)
Leonhard Fischer (Non-executive Director)
William Macaulay (Non-executive Director)
John Mack (Non-executive Director)
Patrice Merrin (Non-executive Director)

Women on the board[edit]
In 2011, Glencore was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, chairman Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things", remarks for which he later apologised.[71] By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called "pariah status".[72] Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.[73]

Glencore plc (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company with headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, and a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. The current company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013.[3] As of 2015[update], it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[4] It is the world's third-largest family business.[5]
As Glencore International, the company was already one of the world's leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities. It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world's largest commodities trading company, with a 2010 global market share of 60% in internationally tradable zinc, 50% in internationally tradable copper, 9 percent in the internationally tradable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradable oil market.[6][7][8]
Glencore had a number of production facilities all around the world and supplied metals, minerals, crude oil, oil products, coal, natural gas and agricultural products to international customers in the automotive, power generation, steel production and food processing industries.[7] The company was formed in 1994 by a management buyout of Marc Rich + Co AG (itself founded in 1974).[7] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in May 2011 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[9][10] It has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[11] Glencore's shares started trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2013.[12] The Qatar Investment Authority is its biggest shareholder.[13]

History[edit]
1974-1994: Formation and sale[edit]
An Australian Public Radio report said, "Glencore's history reads like a spy novel".[14] The company was founded as Marc Rich & Co. AG in 1974 by billionaire commodity trader Marc Rich. Rich was charged in the US with tax evasion and illegal business dealings with Iran, but pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.[15]
In 1993, commodity trading and marketing company Trafigura was split off from Marc Rich's group of companies.[16] As physical commodities traders like Trafigura, Glencore's main rivals in 2011 were identified as Vitol and Cargill,[17] amongst others.[18] In 1993 and 1994, after failing to take control of the zinc market and losing $172 million, Glencore's founder Marc Rich was forced[15][17] to sell his 51 percent majority share in his own company, Marc Rich & Company AG, to Glencore International, the commodities trading and industrial company.[19]
2015: Recent finances[edit]
Due to weak global prices for the assets Glencore owned, particularly coal and copper producers, and for the commodities in which Glencore traded, the company showed a net operating loss of $676 million for the first half of 2015. As of September 2015 the value of its stock had fallen significantly.[20] Concerns financial analysts cited to explain the falling stock price included a weak global commodity market and Glencore's high level of debt,[21] $30 billion. The company was reducing debt by selling off stock and assets.[20]
2005-2011: Glencore, Dan Gertler and the Congo[edit]
In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).[22]
In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.[23]
In 2011 Reuters called Glencore as "the biggest company you never heard of," and described how Glencore and Dan Gertler partnered in Nikanor from 2007 until it merged with Katanga Mining. Reuters called the Nikanor acquisition an example of Glencore's opportunistic, contrarian, well-funded investment approach—focusing on equity participation, controlling interest, and working upstream from trading relationships.[17][24]

The acquisition was the culmination of 18 months of deal-making in Congo... [including fighting off a counterbid by] former England cricketer Phil Edmonds.... [Starting i]n June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining magnate, paid GB£300 million for a quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga Mining's properties. That deal gave Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output – an "offtake" agreement.... [Then, on Christmas Eve 2008, ... [having] lost 97 percent of its market value over the previous six months ... in the depths of the global financial crisis and ... running out of cash, Katanga accepted a deal for about US$500 million in a convertible loan and rights issue. Katanga agreed to issue more than a billion new shares and hand what would become 74% to Glencore. ... [By early 2011], with copper prices regularly setting records above US$10,000 a ton, Katanga's stock market value [had reached] nearly US$3.2 billion.... After a US$108 million loss in 2009, after acquisition it posted a 2010 annual profit of US$265 million.

In May 2011 the company launched an IPO valuing the business at US$61 billion[25] and creating five new billionaires.[26] Trading was limited to institutional investors for the first week and private investors weren't allowed to buy shares until 24 May 2011.[27]
In early 2011, Reuters reports included speculation from Liberum's Rawlinson that, after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Glencore could develop an interest in London/Kazakh-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.[17] Glencore said that, contrary to recent reports, it was not interested in bidding for the under-fire group.[28]
Associations with other mining companies[edit]
Along with several other major coal producers, Glencore is also a large shareholder in globalCOAL, the online physical coal trading platform. The board of globalCOAL contains a number of power utility shareholders. Relationships also exist with Century Aluminum Co. (CENX; 44% economic ownership interest)[29]) in the US; Glencore partial subsidiary Minara Resources Ltd (AU:MRE), a 70.5% stake in one of Australia’s top three nickel producers[29]);[30] and 8.8% in United Company Rusal (HK:486), the Russian aluminium giant that went public in 2010.[29]
In mid-2011, Century was called "one of the most harrowing stocks of the past few years" but identified as a risky but potentially profitable investment for the future.[31]
2011-2012: Initial public offering[edit]
Glencore was the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2011 in a dual listing in London and Hong Kong valued at about $US60 billion. The 1,637-page document revealed invaluable information about this private company that has remained discreet for thirty-seven years. Ivan Glasenberg's shareholding was diluted from 18.1% before the IPO percent to 15.8% afterwards. Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis, zinc, copper and lead co-directors were diluted from 6.9% to 6%. Glencore went public to raise gross proceeds of around $10 billion. According to Reuters, Glencore is known for its "opportunistic but lucrative acquisition strategy."[32]
In May 2011, United Arab Emirates state-owned Aabar Investments confirmed an investment of $850 million in Glencore International plc as a cornerstone investor with an intention to invest an additional $150 million in the Global Offer. The investment made Aabar the largest cornerstone investor in the initial public offering (IPO) and the largest new shareholder of Glencore after its IPO, giving Aabar a 1.4% stake. The two firms intend to explore areas of co-operation.[33] [34]
In November 2012 Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned United Arab Emirates International Petroleum Investment Company, wrote off more than $392-million of its $1-billion investment into Glencore's IPO less than two years after investing it. Aabar Investments was the largest new shareholder in Glencore.[35]
2012-2013: Merger with Xstrata[edit]
Prior to its merger with Xstrata, Glencore is reported to have served as a marketing partner for the company.[36][37] As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte (de) and Ivan Glasenberg were on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chaired. According to The Sunday Times, by 2006, Glencore controlled 40% of Xstrata stock and appointed Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.[36][38] In February 2012, Glencore International Plc, agreed to buy Xstrata Plc for GB£39.1 billion (US$62 billion) in shares. Glencore offered 2.8 new shares for each Xstrata share in agreed all-share "merger of equal". It is the biggest mining takeover ever, and after approval would create an entity with 2012 sales of US$209 billion.[39] In June 2012, Glencore and Xstrata began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, following shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.[40]
In October 2012, BBC News reported that Glencore had more ships than the British Royal Navy. Glencore's operations in 40 countries handled 3% of the world's oil consumption. Xstrata's operations in more than 20 countries employed 70,000 people. According to mining analyst John Meyer, if the two companies merged into Glencore Xstrata, they would be the 4th largest commodities trader in the world.[41]
Just before completing its forced April 2013 takeover of mining rival Xstrata as it awaited Chinese regulatory approval for its long-planned merger, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, the annual income of Glencore fell 25% percent, as its trading division offset the impact of weak commodity prices. Including the impact of an impairment related to a reclassification of its holding in Russian aluminium producer RUSAL, net income fell 75%.[42] On 2 May 2013, it completed the merger with Xstrata.[3] On 20 May 2014, Glencore Xstrata changed its name to Glencore plc.[43] After the merger with Glencore, Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would no longer work as employee but would become a consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marked a massive shift in the company's strategy and Xstrata was entering a post-Reid era.[44]
2011: Financial and accounting manipulations[edit]
In 2011 five non-government organisations filed a complaint to the OECD against a subsidiary of Glencore over allegations that a mine it owns in Zambia may not be paying enough tax on its profits. The cause for the complaint lay in the financial and accounting manipulations performed by the two companies' subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (MCM), to evade taxation in Zambia.[45][46] A draft Grant Thornton report alleged that tax avoidance by Glencore in Zambia cost the Zambian Government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. The avoidance was alleged to have been facilitated through mechanisms such as transfer pricing and inflated costs at Glencore's Mopani Copper Mine. The Mopani mines are controlled through the British Virgin Islands, a recognised tax haven.[47] Glencore and its own auditor, Deloitte, rejected these allegations.[48][49][50]
2005: Dealings with "rogue states"[edit]
ABC Radio reported in 2005 that Glencore "has been accused of illegal dealings with rogue states: apartheid South Africa, USSR, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein", and has a "history of busting UN embargoes to profit from corrupt or despotic regimes".[14] Specifically, Glencore was reported to have been named by the CIA to have paid $3,222,780 in illegal kickbacks to obtain oil in the course of the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq. The company denied these charges, according to the CIA report quoted by ABC.[14][51]
Investments in Colombia[edit]
Swiss public television (TSR) reported in 2006 that allegations of corruption and severe human rights violations were being raised against Glencore due to the alleged conduct of its Colombian Cerrejón mining subsidiary. Local union president Francisco Ramirez accused Cerrejón of forced expropriations and evacuations of entire villages to enable mine expansion, in complicity with Colombian authorities. A representative of the local Wayuu Indians also accused Colombian paramilitary and military units, including those charged with Cerrejón mining security, of forcibly driving the Wayuu off their land in what she described as a "massacre".[52]
A BBC investigation in 2012 uncovered sale documents showing the company had paid the associates of paramilitary killers in Colombia. In 2011, a Colombian court was told by former paramilitaries that they stole the land so they could sell it to Glencore's subsidiary Prodeco, to start an open-cast coal mine; the court accepted their evidence and concluded that coal was the motive for the massacre. Glencore disputed the court's ruling.[53][54]
Glencore/Xtrata's "huge coal operation in Colombia, Prodeco, was fined a total of nearly $700,000 in 2009 for several environmental violations [running in earlier years], including waste disposal without a permit and producing coal without an environmental management plan."[17]
Glencore/Xtrata's activities in Colombia under their subsidiary, Prodeco, was investigated by the Netherlands-based NGO, Pax for Peace. They found that, "From 1996 to 2006, residents of the Cesar mining region of Colombia, from which European power utilities source most of their coal, have suffered greatly from paramilitary violence ... Prodeco mining companies have supported the paramilitary forces with finance, equipment and information. The mining companies deny any involvement, but those victims of human rights violations who stand up for their rights, are still being threatened." The coal mined by Prodeco is termed "Blood Coal." Pax released a report and included the testimony of victims and the paramilitary that attacked the indigenous population.[55]
Investments in Ecuador[edit]
"In Ecuador, the current government has tried to reduce the role played by middlemen such as Glencore with state oil company Petroecuador" due to questions about transparency and follow-through, according to Fernando Villavicencio, a Quito-based oil sector analyst.[17]
Investments in Zambia[edit]
According to a Reuters article in 2011 "[O]fficials in Zambia believe pollution from Glencore's Mopani mine is causing acid rain and health problems in an area where 5 million people live."[17] The upgrade of the Mopani Mines asset plant was completed in March 2014 eliminating the emissions of 97 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions in line with the recommended international standards by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[56]
An audit report from 2009 revealed an unexplained increase in operating costs in 2007 (+ $380 million), stunningly low reported volumes of extracted cobalt when compared to similar mining companies operating in the region, and manipulations of copper selling prices in favor of Glencore which constitute a violation of OECD’s “arm’s length” principle. The result of those various processes was to lower MCM’s net income for the 2003-2008 period by several hundreds of millions of dollars, hereby substantially lightening the company’s tax burden.[57]
Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo[edit]
The company's Luilu copper refinery uses acid to extract the copper. For three years after taking over the mine it continued to allow the waste acid to flow into a river. The chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, was interviewed for Panorama by John Sweeney and said 'It was impossible to remedy any way faster'[58] Glencore said the pollution started long before the company took over the refinery and that it has now ended.[58] A reporter for The Guardian found children as young as ten underground at the Tilwezembe mine, which the company had said in a 2008 prospectus that it had closed due to falling copper prices. These have since rebounded. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said the company does not profit from child labor, and the child miners were part of artisanal mining by nearby residents that Glencore was trying to prevent. But Panorama tracked a shipment of copper from the mine to Groupe Bazano plant and from that plant to a Glencore smelter in Zambia.[59]
They have also been accused of acquiring illicit "conflict minerals"[60] In a detailed letter sent to Global Witness, the company denied any wrongdoing.[60]
Glencore acquired stakes in the Kansuki mine in Congo's southern Katanga Province in 2012. According to Global Witness, Congo's government transferred a 75 per cent stake in Kansuki mine in secret and at vastly undervalued prices in July 2010 to a company in which Dan Gertler, who is a close friend of President Joseph Kabila, has an interest. Just a month later, in August 2010, Glencore took half the shares of the company that acquired that 75 per cent stake, becoming the operator of the mine. Glencore is financing the entire development of the Kansuki mine, thereby carrying the costs for the other partner companies, which are associated with Mr Gertler.[61] Glencore said at the time "During the period when these transactions took place, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholdings in DRC projects."[62]
Glencore acquired a 50 per cent share in SAMREF Congo SPRL in 2007, a Congolese-registered company holding 80% of the Mutanda Mine.[63] According to Global Witness, SAMREF recommended on 1 March 2011 that Congo's state-run company Gécamines, holding the other 20% share in the Mutanda Mine, sell this share to an entity also associated with Dan Gertler and went on to question the links between Glencore and Dan Gertler.[64] Glencore has been designated operator of the Mutanda Mine.[61] Glencore has responded a number of times to Global Witness regarding these allegations.[65]
Western Sahara[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, a subsidiary of Glencore Xstrata was awarded two offshore drilling licences off the coast of occupied Western Sahara. The licences are awarded in clear violation of international law, as described by the UN in 2002.[66]
Operations[edit]
In May 2014 the company announced it would close its underground Newlands coal mine in Queensland, Australia in late 2015. The mine, begun in 1983, produced 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2013. The company had earlier suspended operations at its Ravensworth underground mine following falling coal prices, escalating production costs, and a higher Australian dollar. [67][68][69]
Board of directors[edit]
As of October 2014:[70]

Tony Hayward (Non-executive Chairman)
Ivan Glasenberg (CEO)
Peter Grauer (Non-executive Director)
Peter Coates (Non-executive Director)
Leonhard Fischer (Non-executive Director)
William Macaulay (Non-executive Director)
John Mack (Non-executive Director)
Patrice Merrin (Non-executive Director)

Women on the board[edit]
In 2011, Glencore was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, chairman Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things", remarks for which he later apologised.[71] By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called "pariah status".[72] Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.[73]

Glencore plc (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company with headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, and a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. The current company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013.[3] As of 2015[update], it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[4] It is the world's third-largest family business.[5]
As Glencore International, the company was already one of the world's leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities. It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world's largest commodities trading company, with a 2010 global market share of 60% in internationally tradable zinc, 50% in internationally tradable copper, 9 percent in the internationally tradable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradable oil market.[6][7][8]
Glencore had a number of production facilities all around the world and supplied metals, minerals, crude oil, oil products, coal, natural gas and agricultural products to international customers in the automotive, power generation, steel production and food processing industries.[7] The company was formed in 1994 by a management buyout of Marc Rich + Co AG (itself founded in 1974).[7] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in May 2011 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[9][10] It has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[11] Glencore's shares started trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2013.[12] The Qatar Investment Authority is its biggest shareholder.[13]

History[edit]
1974-1994: Formation and sale[edit]
An Australian Public Radio report said, "Glencore's history reads like a spy novel".[14] The company was founded as Marc Rich & Co. AG in 1974 by billionaire commodity trader Marc Rich. Rich was charged in the US with tax evasion and illegal business dealings with Iran, but pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.[15]
In 1993, commodity trading and marketing company Trafigura was split off from Marc Rich's group of companies.[16] As physical commodities traders like Trafigura, Glencore's main rivals in 2011 were identified as Vitol and Cargill,[17] amongst others.[18] In 1993 and 1994, after failing to take control of the zinc market and losing $172 million, Glencore's founder Marc Rich was forced[15][17] to sell his 51 percent majority share in his own company, Marc Rich & Company AG, to Glencore International, the commodities trading and industrial company.[19]
2015: Recent finances[edit]
Due to weak global prices for the assets Glencore owned, particularly coal and copper producers, and for the commodities in which Glencore traded, the company showed a net operating loss of $676 million for the first half of 2015. As of September 2015 the value of its stock had fallen significantly.[20] Concerns financial analysts cited to explain the falling stock price included a weak global commodity market and Glencore's high level of debt,[21] $30 billion. The company was reducing debt by selling off stock and assets.[20]
2005-2011: Glencore, Dan Gertler and the Congo[edit]
In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).[22]
In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.[23]
In 2011 Reuters called Glencore as "the biggest company you never heard of," and described how Glencore and Dan Gertler partnered in Nikanor from 2007 until it merged with Katanga Mining. Reuters called the Nikanor acquisition an example of Glencore's opportunistic, contrarian, well-funded investment approach—focusing on equity participation, controlling interest, and working upstream from trading relationships.[17][24]

The acquisition was the culmination of 18 months of deal-making in Congo... [including fighting off a counterbid by] former England cricketer Phil Edmonds.... [Starting i]n June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining magnate, paid GB£300 million for a quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga Mining's properties. That deal gave Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output – an "offtake" agreement.... [Then, on Christmas Eve 2008, ... [having] lost 97 percent of its market value over the previous six months ... in the depths of the global financial crisis and ... running out of cash, Katanga accepted a deal for about US$500 million in a convertible loan and rights issue. Katanga agreed to issue more than a billion new shares and hand what would become 74% to Glencore. ... [By early 2011], with copper prices regularly setting records above US$10,000 a ton, Katanga's stock market value [had reached] nearly US$3.2 billion.... After a US$108 million loss in 2009, after acquisition it posted a 2010 annual profit of US$265 million.

In May 2011 the company launched an IPO valuing the business at US$61 billion[25] and creating five new billionaires.[26] Trading was limited to institutional investors for the first week and private investors weren't allowed to buy shares until 24 May 2011.[27]
In early 2011, Reuters reports included speculation from Liberum's Rawlinson that, after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Glencore could develop an interest in London/Kazakh-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.[17] Glencore said that, contrary to recent reports, it was not interested in bidding for the under-fire group.[28]
Associations with other mining companies[edit]
Along with several other major coal producers, Glencore is also a large shareholder in globalCOAL, the online physical coal trading platform. The board of globalCOAL contains a number of power utility shareholders. Relationships also exist with Century Aluminum Co. (CENX; 44% economic ownership interest)[29]) in the US; Glencore partial subsidiary Minara Resources Ltd (AU:MRE), a 70.5% stake in one of Australia’s top three nickel producers[29]);[30] and 8.8% in United Company Rusal (HK:486), the Russian aluminium giant that went public in 2010.[29]
In mid-2011, Century was called "one of the most harrowing stocks of the past few years" but identified as a risky but potentially profitable investment for the future.[31]
2011-2012: Initial public offering[edit]
Glencore was the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2011 in a dual listing in London and Hong Kong valued at about $US60 billion. The 1,637-page document revealed invaluable information about this private company that has remained discreet for thirty-seven years. Ivan Glasenberg's shareholding was diluted from 18.1% before the IPO percent to 15.8% afterwards. Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis, zinc, copper and lead co-directors were diluted from 6.9% to 6%. Glencore went public to raise gross proceeds of around $10 billion. According to Reuters, Glencore is known for its "opportunistic but lucrative acquisition strategy."[32]
In May 2011, United Arab Emirates state-owned Aabar Investments confirmed an investment of $850 million in Glencore International plc as a cornerstone investor with an intention to invest an additional $150 million in the Global Offer. The investment made Aabar the largest cornerstone investor in the initial public offering (IPO) and the largest new shareholder of Glencore after its IPO, giving Aabar a 1.4% stake. The two firms intend to explore areas of co-operation.[33] [34]
In November 2012 Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned United Arab Emirates International Petroleum Investment Company, wrote off more than $392-million of its $1-billion investment into Glencore's IPO less than two years after investing it. Aabar Investments was the largest new shareholder in Glencore.[35]
2012-2013: Merger with Xstrata[edit]
Prior to its merger with Xstrata, Glencore is reported to have served as a marketing partner for the company.[36][37] As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte (de) and Ivan Glasenberg were on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chaired. According to The Sunday Times, by 2006, Glencore controlled 40% of Xstrata stock and appointed Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.[36][38] In February 2012, Glencore International Plc, agreed to buy Xstrata Plc for GB£39.1 billion (US$62 billion) in shares. Glencore offered 2.8 new shares for each Xstrata share in agreed all-share "merger of equal". It is the biggest mining takeover ever, and after approval would create an entity with 2012 sales of US$209 billion.[39] In June 2012, Glencore and Xstrata began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, following shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.[40]
In October 2012, BBC News reported that Glencore had more ships than the British Royal Navy. Glencore's operations in 40 countries handled 3% of the world's oil consumption. Xstrata's operations in more than 20 countries employed 70,000 people. According to mining analyst John Meyer, if the two companies merged into Glencore Xstrata, they would be the 4th largest commodities trader in the world.[41]
Just before completing its forced April 2013 takeover of mining rival Xstrata as it awaited Chinese regulatory approval for its long-planned merger, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, the annual income of Glencore fell 25% percent, as its trading division offset the impact of weak commodity prices. Including the impact of an impairment related to a reclassification of its holding in Russian aluminium producer RUSAL, net income fell 75%.[42] On 2 May 2013, it completed the merger with Xstrata.[3] On 20 May 2014, Glencore Xstrata changed its name to Glencore plc.[43] After the merger with Glencore, Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would no longer work as employee but would become a consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marked a massive shift in the company's strategy and Xstrata was entering a post-Reid era.[44]
2011: Financial and accounting manipulations[edit]
In 2011 five non-government organisations filed a complaint to the OECD against a subsidiary of Glencore over allegations that a mine it owns in Zambia may not be paying enough tax on its profits. The cause for the complaint lay in the financial and accounting manipulations performed by the two companies' subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (MCM), to evade taxation in Zambia.[45][46] A draft Grant Thornton report alleged that tax avoidance by Glencore in Zambia cost the Zambian Government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. The avoidance was alleged to have been facilitated through mechanisms such as transfer pricing and inflated costs at Glencore's Mopani Copper Mine. The Mopani mines are controlled through the British Virgin Islands, a recognised tax haven.[47] Glencore and its own auditor, Deloitte, rejected these allegations.[48][49][50]
2005: Dealings with "rogue states"[edit]
ABC Radio reported in 2005 that Glencore "has been accused of illegal dealings with rogue states: apartheid South Africa, USSR, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein", and has a "history of busting UN embargoes to profit from corrupt or despotic regimes".[14] Specifically, Glencore was reported to have been named by the CIA to have paid $3,222,780 in illegal kickbacks to obtain oil in the course of the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq. The company denied these charges, according to the CIA report quoted by ABC.[14][51]
Investments in Colombia[edit]
Swiss public television (TSR) reported in 2006 that allegations of corruption and severe human rights violations were being raised against Glencore due to the alleged conduct of its Colombian Cerrejón mining subsidiary. Local union president Francisco Ramirez accused Cerrejón of forced expropriations and evacuations of entire villages to enable mine expansion, in complicity with Colombian authorities. A representative of the local Wayuu Indians also accused Colombian paramilitary and military units, including those charged with Cerrejón mining security, of forcibly driving the Wayuu off their land in what she described as a "massacre".[52]
A BBC investigation in 2012 uncovered sale documents showing the company had paid the associates of paramilitary killers in Colombia. In 2011, a Colombian court was told by former paramilitaries that they stole the land so they could sell it to Glencore's subsidiary Prodeco, to start an open-cast coal mine; the court accepted their evidence and concluded that coal was the motive for the massacre. Glencore disputed the court's ruling.[53][54]
Glencore/Xtrata's "huge coal operation in Colombia, Prodeco, was fined a total of nearly $700,000 in 2009 for several environmental violations [running in earlier years], including waste disposal without a permit and producing coal without an environmental management plan."[17]
Glencore/Xtrata's activities in Colombia under their subsidiary, Prodeco, was investigated by the Netherlands-based NGO, Pax for Peace. They found that, "From 1996 to 2006, residents of the Cesar mining region of Colombia, from which European power utilities source most of their coal, have suffered greatly from paramilitary violence ... Prodeco mining companies have supported the paramilitary forces with finance, equipment and information. The mining companies deny any involvement, but those victims of human rights violations who stand up for their rights, are still being threatened." The coal mined by Prodeco is termed "Blood Coal." Pax released a report and included the testimony of victims and the paramilitary that attacked the indigenous population.[55]
Investments in Ecuador[edit]
"In Ecuador, the current government has tried to reduce the role played by middlemen such as Glencore with state oil company Petroecuador" due to questions about transparency and follow-through, according to Fernando Villavicencio, a Quito-based oil sector analyst.[17]
Investments in Zambia[edit]
According to a Reuters article in 2011 "[O]fficials in Zambia believe pollution from Glencore's Mopani mine is causing acid rain and health problems in an area where 5 million people live."[17] The upgrade of the Mopani Mines asset plant was completed in March 2014 eliminating the emissions of 97 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions in line with the recommended international standards by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[56]
An audit report from 2009 revealed an unexplained increase in operating costs in 2007 (+ $380 million), stunningly low reported volumes of extracted cobalt when compared to similar mining companies operating in the region, and manipulations of copper selling prices in favor of Glencore which constitute a violation of OECD’s “arm’s length” principle. The result of those various processes was to lower MCM’s net income for the 2003-2008 period by several hundreds of millions of dollars, hereby substantially lightening the company’s tax burden.[57]
Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo[edit]
The company's Luilu copper refinery uses acid to extract the copper. For three years after taking over the mine it continued to allow the waste acid to flow into a river. The chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, was interviewed for Panorama by John Sweeney and said 'It was impossible to remedy any way faster'[58] Glencore said the pollution started long before the company took over the refinery and that it has now ended.[58] A reporter for The Guardian found children as young as ten underground at the Tilwezembe mine, which the company had said in a 2008 prospectus that it had closed due to falling copper prices. These have since rebounded. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said the company does not profit from child labor, and the child miners were part of artisanal mining by nearby residents that Glencore was trying to prevent. But Panorama tracked a shipment of copper from the mine to Groupe Bazano plant and from that plant to a Glencore smelter in Zambia.[59]
They have also been accused of acquiring illicit "conflict minerals"[60] In a detailed letter sent to Global Witness, the company denied any wrongdoing.[60]
Glencore acquired stakes in the Kansuki mine in Congo's southern Katanga Province in 2012. According to Global Witness, Congo's government transferred a 75 per cent stake in Kansuki mine in secret and at vastly undervalued prices in July 2010 to a company in which Dan Gertler, who is a close friend of President Joseph Kabila, has an interest. Just a month later, in August 2010, Glencore took half the shares of the company that acquired that 75 per cent stake, becoming the operator of the mine. Glencore is financing the entire development of the Kansuki mine, thereby carrying the costs for the other partner companies, which are associated with Mr Gertler.[61] Glencore said at the time "During the period when these transactions took place, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholdings in DRC projects."[62]
Glencore acquired a 50 per cent share in SAMREF Congo SPRL in 2007, a Congolese-registered company holding 80% of the Mutanda Mine.[63] According to Global Witness, SAMREF recommended on 1 March 2011 that Congo's state-run company Gécamines, holding the other 20% share in the Mutanda Mine, sell this share to an entity also associated with Dan Gertler and went on to question the links between Glencore and Dan Gertler.[64] Glencore has been designated operator of the Mutanda Mine.[61] Glencore has responded a number of times to Global Witness regarding these allegations.[65]
Western Sahara[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, a subsidiary of Glencore Xstrata was awarded two offshore drilling licences off the coast of occupied Western Sahara. The licences are awarded in clear violation of international law, as described by the UN in 2002.[66]
Operations[edit]
In May 2014 the company announced it would close its underground Newlands coal mine in Queensland, Australia in late 2015. The mine, begun in 1983, produced 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2013. The company had earlier suspended operations at its Ravensworth underground mine following falling coal prices, escalating production costs, and a higher Australian dollar. [67][68][69]
Board of directors[edit]

Tony Hayward (Non-executive Chairman)
Ivan Glasenberg (CEO)
Peter Grauer (Non-executive Director)
Peter Coates (Non-executive Director)
Leonhard Fischer (Non-executive Director)
William Macaulay (Non-executive Director)
John Mack (Non-executive Director)
Patrice Merrin (Non-executive Director)

Women on the board[edit]
In 2011, Glencore was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, chairman Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things", remarks for which he later apologised.[71] By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called "pariah status".[72] Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.[73]

Glencore plc (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company with headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, and a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. The current company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013.[3] As of 2015[update], it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[4] It is the world's third-largest family business.[5]
As Glencore International, the company was already one of the world's leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities. It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world's largest commodities trading company, with a 2010 global market share of 60% in internationally tradable zinc, 50% in internationally tradable copper, 9 percent in the internationally tradable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradable oil market.[6][7][8]
Glencore had a number of production facilities all around the world and supplied metals, minerals, crude oil, oil products, coal, natural gas and agricultural products to international customers in the automotive, power generation, steel production and food processing industries.[7] The company was formed in 1994 by a management buyout of Marc Rich + Co AG (itself founded in 1974).[7] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in May 2011 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[9][10] It has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[11] Glencore's shares started trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2013.[12] The Qatar Investment Authority is its biggest shareholder.[13]

History[edit]
1974-1994: Formation and sale[edit]
An Australian Public Radio report said, "Glencore's history reads like a spy novel".[14] The company was founded as Marc Rich & Co. AG in 1974 by billionaire commodity trader Marc Rich. Rich was charged in the US with tax evasion and illegal business dealings with Iran, but pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.[15]
In 1993, commodity trading and marketing company Trafigura was split off from Marc Rich's group of companies.[16] As physical commodities traders like Trafigura, Glencore's main rivals in 2011 were identified as Vitol and Cargill,[17] amongst others.[18] In 1993 and 1994, after failing to take control of the zinc market and losing $172 million, Glencore's founder Marc Rich was forced[15][17] to sell his 51 percent majority share in his own company, Marc Rich & Company AG, to Glencore International, the commodities trading and industrial company.[19]
2015: Recent finances[edit]
Due to weak global prices for the assets Glencore owned, particularly coal and copper producers, and for the commodities in which Glencore traded, the company showed a net operating loss of $676 million for the first half of 2015. As of September 2015 the value of its stock had fallen significantly.[20] Concerns financial analysts cited to explain the falling stock price included a weak global commodity market and Glencore's high level of debt,[21] $30 billion. The company was reducing debt by selling off stock and assets.[20]
2005-2011: Glencore, Dan Gertler and the Congo[edit]
In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).[22]
In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.[23]
In 2011 Reuters called Glencore as "the biggest company you never heard of," and described how Glencore and Dan Gertler partnered in Nikanor from 2007 until it merged with Katanga Mining. Reuters called the Nikanor acquisition an example of Glencore's opportunistic, contrarian, well-funded investment approach—focusing on equity participation, controlling interest, and working upstream from trading relationships.[17][24]

The acquisition was the culmination of 18 months of deal-making in Congo... [including fighting off a counterbid by] former England cricketer Phil Edmonds.... [Starting i]n June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining magnate, paid GB£300 million for a quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga Mining's properties. That deal gave Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output – an "offtake" agreement.... [Then, on Christmas Eve 2008, ... [having] lost 97 percent of its market value over the previous six months ... in the depths of the global financial crisis and ... running out of cash, Katanga accepted a deal for about US$500 million in a convertible loan and rights issue. Katanga agreed to issue more than a billion new shares and hand what would become 74% to Glencore. ... [By early 2011], with copper prices regularly setting records above US$10,000 a ton, Katanga's stock market value [had reached] nearly US$3.2 billion.... After a US$108 million loss in 2009, after acquisition it posted a 2010 annual profit of US$265 million.

In May 2011 the company launched an IPO valuing the business at US$61 billion[25] and creating five new billionaires.[26] Trading was limited to institutional investors for the first week and private investors weren't allowed to buy shares until 24 May 2011.[27]
In early 2011, Reuters reports included speculation from Liberum's Rawlinson that, after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Glencore could develop an interest in London/Kazakh-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.[17] Glencore said that, contrary to recent reports, it was not interested in bidding for the under-fire group.[28]
Associations with other mining companies[edit]
Along with several other major coal producers, Glencore is also a large shareholder in globalCOAL, the online physical coal trading platform. The board of globalCOAL contains a number of power utility shareholders. Relationships also exist with Century Aluminum Co. (CENX; 44% economic ownership interest)[29]) in the US; Glencore partial subsidiary Minara Resources Ltd (AU:MRE), a 70.5% stake in one of Australia’s top three nickel producers[29]);[30] and 8.8% in United Company Rusal (HK:486), the Russian aluminium giant that went public in 2010.[29]
In mid-2011, Century was called "one of the most harrowing stocks of the past few years" but identified as a risky but potentially profitable investment for the future.[31]
2011-2012: Initial public offering[edit]
Glencore was the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2011 in a dual listing in London and Hong Kong valued at about $US60 billion. The 1,637-page document revealed invaluable information about this private company that has remained discreet for thirty-seven years. Ivan Glasenberg's shareholding was diluted from 18.1% before the IPO percent to 15.8% afterwards. Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis, zinc, copper and lead co-directors were diluted from 6.9% to 6%. Glencore went public to raise gross proceeds of around $10 billion. According to Reuters, Glencore is known for its "opportunistic but lucrative acquisition strategy."[32]
In May 2011, United Arab Emirates state-owned Aabar Investments confirmed an investment of $850 million in Glencore International plc as a cornerstone investor with an intention to invest an additional $150 million in the Global Offer. The investment made Aabar the largest cornerstone investor in the initial public offering (IPO) and the largest new shareholder of Glencore after its IPO, giving Aabar a 1.4% stake. The two firms intend to explore areas of co-operation.[33] [34]
In November 2012 Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned United Arab Emirates International Petroleum Investment Company, wrote off more than $392-million of its $1-billion investment into Glencore's IPO less than two years after investing it. Aabar Investments was the largest new shareholder in Glencore.[35]
2012-2013: Merger with Xstrata[edit]
Prior to its merger with Xstrata, Glencore is reported to have served as a marketing partner for the company.[36][37] As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte (de) and Ivan Glasenberg were on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chaired. According to The Sunday Times, by 2006, Glencore controlled 40% of Xstrata stock and appointed Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.[36][38] In February 2012, Glencore International Plc, agreed to buy Xstrata Plc for GB£39.1 billion (US$62 billion) in shares. Glencore offered 2.8 new shares for each Xstrata share in agreed all-share "merger of equal". It is the biggest mining takeover ever, and after approval would create an entity with 2012 sales of US$209 billion.[39] In June 2012, Glencore and Xstrata began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, following shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.[40]
In October 2012, BBC News reported that Glencore had more ships than the British Royal Navy. Glencore's operations in 40 countries handled 3% of the world's oil consumption. Xstrata's operations in more than 20 countries employed 70,000 people. According to mining analyst John Meyer, if the two companies merged into Glencore Xstrata, they would be the 4th largest commodities trader in the world.[41]
Just before completing its forced April 2013 takeover of mining rival Xstrata as it awaited Chinese regulatory approval for its long-planned merger, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, the annual income of Glencore fell 25% percent, as its trading division offset the impact of weak commodity prices. Including the impact of an impairment related to a reclassification of its holding in Russian aluminium producer RUSAL, net income fell 75%.[42] On 2 May 2013, it completed the merger with Xstrata.[3] On 20 May 2014, Glencore Xstrata changed its name to Glencore plc.[43] After the merger with Glencore, Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would no longer work as employee but would become a consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marked a massive shift in the company's strategy and Xstrata was entering a post-Reid era.[44]
2011: Financial and accounting manipulations[edit]
In 2011 five non-government organisations filed a complaint to the OECD against a subsidiary of Glencore over allegations that a mine it owns in Zambia may not be paying enough tax on its profits. The cause for the complaint lay in the financial and accounting manipulations performed by the two companies' subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (MCM), to evade taxation in Zambia.[45][46] A draft Grant Thornton report alleged that tax avoidance by Glencore in Zambia cost the Zambian Government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. The avoidance was alleged to have been facilitated through mechanisms such as transfer pricing and inflated costs at Glencore's Mopani Copper Mine. The Mopani mines are controlled through the British Virgin Islands, a recognised tax haven.[47] Glencore and its own auditor, Deloitte, rejected these allegations.[48][49][50]
2005: Dealings with "rogue states"[edit]
ABC Radio reported in 2005 that Glencore "has been accused of illegal dealings with rogue states: apartheid South Africa, USSR, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein", and has a "history of busting UN embargoes to profit from corrupt or despotic regimes".[14] Specifically, Glencore was reported to have been named by the CIA to have paid $3,222,780 in illegal kickbacks to obtain oil in the course of the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq. The company denied these charges, according to the CIA report quoted by ABC.[14][51]
Investments in Colombia[edit]
Swiss public television (TSR) reported in 2006 that allegations of corruption and severe human rights violations were being raised against Glencore due to the alleged conduct of its Colombian Cerrejón mining subsidiary. Local union president Francisco Ramirez accused Cerrejón of forced expropriations and evacuations of entire villages to enable mine expansion, in complicity with Colombian authorities. A representative of the local Wayuu Indians also accused Colombian paramilitary and military units, including those charged with Cerrejón mining security, of forcibly driving the Wayuu off their land in what she described as a "massacre".[52]
A BBC investigation in 2012 uncovered sale documents showing the company had paid the associates of paramilitary killers in Colombia. In 2011, a Colombian court was told by former paramilitaries that they stole the land so they could sell it to Glencore's subsidiary Prodeco, to start an open-cast coal mine; the court accepted their evidence and concluded that coal was the motive for the massacre. Glencore disputed the court's ruling.[53][54]
Glencore/Xtrata's "huge coal operation in Colombia, Prodeco, was fined a total of nearly $700,000 in 2009 for several environmental violations [running in earlier years], including waste disposal without a permit and producing coal without an environmental management plan."[17]
Glencore/Xtrata's activities in Colombia under their subsidiary, Prodeco, was investigated by the Netherlands-based NGO, Pax for Peace. They found that, "From 1996 to 2006, residents of the Cesar mining region of Colombia, from which European power utilities source most of their coal, have suffered greatly from paramilitary violence ... Prodeco mining companies have supported the paramilitary forces with finance, equipment and information. The mining companies deny any involvement, but those victims of human rights violations who stand up for their rights, are still being threatened." The coal mined by Prodeco is termed "Blood Coal." Pax released a report and included the testimony of victims and the paramilitary that attacked the indigenous population.[55]
Investments in Ecuador[edit]
"In Ecuador, the current government has tried to reduce the role played by middlemen such as Glencore with state oil company Petroecuador" due to questions about transparency and follow-through, according to Fernando Villavicencio, a Quito-based oil sector analyst.[17]
Investments in Zambia[edit]
According to a Reuters article in 2011 "[O]fficials in Zambia believe pollution from Glencore's Mopani mine is causing acid rain and health problems in an area where 5 million people live."[17] The upgrade of the Mopani Mines asset plant was completed in March 2014 eliminating the emissions of 97 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions in line with the recommended international standards by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[56]
An audit report from 2009 revealed an unexplained increase in operating costs in 2007 (+ $380 million), stunningly low reported volumes of extracted cobalt when compared to similar mining companies operating in the region, and manipulations of copper selling prices in favor of Glencore which constitute a violation of OECD’s “arm’s length” principle. The result of those various processes was to lower MCM’s net income for the 2003-2008 period by several hundreds of millions of dollars, hereby substantially lightening the company’s tax burden.[57]
Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo[edit]
The company's Luilu copper refinery uses acid to extract the copper. For three years after taking over the mine it continued to allow the waste acid to flow into a river. The chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, was interviewed for Panorama by John Sweeney and said 'It was impossible to remedy any way faster'[58] Glencore said the pollution started long before the company took over the refinery and that it has now ended.[58] A reporter for The Guardian found children as young as ten underground at the Tilwezembe mine, which the company had said in a 2008 prospectus that it had closed due to falling copper prices. These have since rebounded. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said the company does not profit from child labor, and the child miners were part of artisanal mining by nearby residents that Glencore was trying to prevent. But Panorama tracked a shipment of copper from the mine to Groupe Bazano plant and from that plant to a Glencore smelter in Zambia.[59]
They have also been accused of acquiring illicit "conflict minerals"[60] In a detailed letter sent to Global Witness, the company denied any wrongdoing.[60]
Glencore acquired stakes in the Kansuki mine in Congo's southern Katanga Province in 2012. According to Global Witness, Congo's government transferred a 75 per cent stake in Kansuki mine in secret and at vastly undervalued prices in July 2010 to a company in which Dan Gertler, who is a close friend of President Joseph Kabila, has an interest. Just a month later, in August 2010, Glencore took half the shares of the company that acquired that 75 per cent stake, becoming the operator of the mine. Glencore is financing the entire development of the Kansuki mine, thereby carrying the costs for the other partner companies, which are associated with Mr Gertler.[61] Glencore said at the time "During the period when these transactions took place, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholdings in DRC projects."[62]
Glencore acquired a 50 per cent share in SAMREF Congo SPRL in 2007, a Congolese-registered company holding 80% of the Mutanda Mine.[63] According to Global Witness, SAMREF recommended on 1 March 2011 that Congo's state-run company Gécamines, holding the other 20% share in the Mutanda Mine, sell this share to an entity also associated with Dan Gertler and went on to question the links between Glencore and Dan Gertler.[64] Glencore has been designated operator of the Mutanda Mine.[61] Glencore has responded a number of times to Global Witness regarding these allegations.[65]
Western Sahara[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, a subsidiary of Glencore Xstrata was awarded two offshore drilling licences off the coast of occupied Western Sahara. The licences are awarded in clear violation of international law, as described by the UN in 2002.[66]
Operations[edit]
In May 2014 the company announced it would close its underground Newlands coal mine in Queensland, Australia in late 2015. The mine, begun in 1983, produced 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2013. The company had earlier suspended operations at its Ravensworth underground mine following falling coal prices, escalating production costs, and a higher Australian dollar. [67][68][69]

Women on the board[edit]
In 2011, Glencore was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, chairman Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things", remarks for which he later apologised.[71] By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called "pariah status".[72] Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.[73]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Glencore plc (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company with headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, and a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. The current company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013.[3] As of 2015[update], it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[4] It is the world's third-largest family business.[5]
As Glencore International, the company was already one of the world's leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities. It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world's largest commodities trading company, with a 2010 global market share of 60% in internationally tradable zinc, 50% in internationally tradable copper, 9 percent in the internationally tradable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradable oil market.[6][7][8]
Glencore had a number of production facilities all around the world and supplied metals, minerals, crude oil, oil products, coal, natural gas and agricultural products to international customers in the automotive, power generation, steel production and food processing industries.[7] The company was formed in 1994 by a management buyout of Marc Rich + Co AG (itself founded in 1974).[7] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in May 2011 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[9][10] It has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[11] Glencore's shares started trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2013.[12] The Qatar Investment Authority is its biggest shareholder.[13]

History[edit]
1974-1994: Formation and sale[edit]
An Australian Public Radio report said, "Glencore's history reads like a spy novel".[14] The company was founded as Marc Rich & Co. AG in 1974 by billionaire commodity trader Marc Rich. Rich was charged in the US with tax evasion and illegal business dealings with Iran, but pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.[15]
In 1993, commodity trading and marketing company Trafigura was split off from Marc Rich's group of companies.[16] As physical commodities traders like Trafigura, Glencore's main rivals in 2011 were identified as Vitol and Cargill,[17] amongst others.[18] In 1993 and 1994, after failing to take control of the zinc market and losing $172 million, Glencore's founder Marc Rich was forced[15][17] to sell his 51 percent majority share in his own company, Marc Rich & Company AG, to Glencore International, the commodities trading and industrial company.[19]
2015: Recent finances[edit]
Due to weak global prices for the assets Glencore owned, particularly coal and copper producers, and for the commodities in which Glencore traded, the company showed a net operating loss of $676 million for the first half of 2015. As of September 2015 the value of its stock had fallen significantly.[20] Concerns financial analysts cited to explain the falling stock price included a weak global commodity market and Glencore's high level of debt,[21] $30 billion. The company was reducing debt by selling off stock and assets.[20]
2005-2011: Glencore, Dan Gertler and the Congo[edit]
In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).[22]
In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.[23]
In 2011 Reuters called Glencore as "the biggest company you never heard of," and described how Glencore and Dan Gertler partnered in Nikanor from 2007 until it merged with Katanga Mining. Reuters called the Nikanor acquisition an example of Glencore's opportunistic, contrarian, well-funded investment approach—focusing on equity participation, controlling interest, and working upstream from trading relationships.[17][24]

The acquisition was the culmination of 18 months of deal-making in Congo... [including fighting off a counterbid by] former England cricketer Phil Edmonds.... [Starting i]n June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining magnate, paid GB£300 million for a quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga Mining's properties. That deal gave Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output – an "offtake" agreement.... [Then, on Christmas Eve 2008, ... [having] lost 97 percent of its market value over the previous six months ... in the depths of the global financial crisis and ... running out of cash, Katanga accepted a deal for about US$500 million in a convertible loan and rights issue. Katanga agreed to issue more than a billion new shares and hand what would become 74% to Glencore. ... [By early 2011], with copper prices regularly setting records above US$10,000 a ton, Katanga's stock market value [had reached] nearly US$3.2 billion.... After a US$108 million loss in 2009, after acquisition it posted a 2010 annual profit of US$265 million.

In May 2011 the company launched an IPO valuing the business at US$61 billion[25] and creating five new billionaires.[26] Trading was limited to institutional investors for the first week and private investors weren't allowed to buy shares until 24 May 2011.[27]
In early 2011, Reuters reports included speculation from Liberum's Rawlinson that, after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Glencore could develop an interest in London/Kazakh-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.[17] Glencore said that, contrary to recent reports, it was not interested in bidding for the under-fire group.[28]
Associations with other mining companies[edit]
Along with several other major coal producers, Glencore is also a large shareholder in globalCOAL, the online physical coal trading platform. The board of globalCOAL contains a number of power utility shareholders. Relationships also exist with Century Aluminum Co. (CENX; 44% economic ownership interest)[29]) in the US; Glencore partial subsidiary Minara Resources Ltd (AU:MRE), a 70.5% stake in one of Australia’s top three nickel producers[29]);[30] and 8.8% in United Company Rusal (HK:486), the Russian aluminium giant that went public in 2010.[29]
In mid-2011, Century was called "one of the most harrowing stocks of the past few years" but identified as a risky but potentially profitable investment for the future.[31]
2011-2012: Initial public offering[edit]
Glencore was the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2011 in a dual listing in London and Hong Kong valued at about $US60 billion. The 1,637-page document revealed invaluable information about this private company that has remained discreet for thirty-seven years. Ivan Glasenberg's shareholding was diluted from 18.1% before the IPO percent to 15.8% afterwards. Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis, zinc, copper and lead co-directors were diluted from 6.9% to 6%. Glencore went public to raise gross proceeds of around $10 billion. According to Reuters, Glencore is known for its "opportunistic but lucrative acquisition strategy."[32]
In May 2011, United Arab Emirates state-owned Aabar Investments confirmed an investment of $850 million in Glencore International plc as a cornerstone investor with an intention to invest an additional $150 million in the Global Offer. The investment made Aabar the largest cornerstone investor in the initial public offering (IPO) and the largest new shareholder of Glencore after its IPO, giving Aabar a 1.4% stake. The two firms intend to explore areas of co-operation.[33] [34]
In November 2012 Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned United Arab Emirates International Petroleum Investment Company, wrote off more than $392-million of its $1-billion investment into Glencore's IPO less than two years after investing it. Aabar Investments was the largest new shareholder in Glencore.[35]
2012-2013: Merger with Xstrata[edit]
Prior to its merger with Xstrata, Glencore is reported to have served as a marketing partner for the company.[36][37] As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte (de) and Ivan Glasenberg were on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chaired. According to The Sunday Times, by 2006, Glencore controlled 40% of Xstrata stock and appointed Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.[36][38] In February 2012, Glencore International Plc, agreed to buy Xstrata Plc for GB£39.1 billion (US$62 billion) in shares. Glencore offered 2.8 new shares for each Xstrata share in agreed all-share "merger of equal". It is the biggest mining takeover ever, and after approval would create an entity with 2012 sales of US$209 billion.[39] In June 2012, Glencore and Xstrata began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, following shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.[40]
In October 2012, BBC News reported that Glencore had more ships than the British Royal Navy. Glencore's operations in 40 countries handled 3% of the world's oil consumption. Xstrata's operations in more than 20 countries employed 70,000 people. According to mining analyst John Meyer, if the two companies merged into Glencore Xstrata, they would be the 4th largest commodities trader in the world.[41]
Just before completing its forced April 2013 takeover of mining rival Xstrata as it awaited Chinese regulatory approval for its long-planned merger, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, the annual income of Glencore fell 25% percent, as its trading division offset the impact of weak commodity prices. Including the impact of an impairment related to a reclassification of its holding in Russian aluminium producer RUSAL, net income fell 75%.[42] On 2 May 2013, it completed the merger with Xstrata.[3] On 20 May 2014, Glencore Xstrata changed its name to Glencore plc.[43] After the merger with Glencore, Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would no longer work as employee but would become a consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marked a massive shift in the company's strategy and Xstrata was entering a post-Reid era.[44]
2011: Financial and accounting manipulations[edit]
In 2011 five non-government organisations filed a complaint to the OECD against a subsidiary of Glencore over allegations that a mine it owns in Zambia may not be paying enough tax on its profits. The cause for the complaint lay in the financial and accounting manipulations performed by the two companies' subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (MCM), to evade taxation in Zambia.[45][46] A draft Grant Thornton report alleged that tax avoidance by Glencore in Zambia cost the Zambian Government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. The avoidance was alleged to have been facilitated through mechanisms such as transfer pricing and inflated costs at Glencore's Mopani Copper Mine. The Mopani mines are controlled through the British Virgin Islands, a recognised tax haven.[47] Glencore and its own auditor, Deloitte, rejected these allegations.[48][49][50]
2005: Dealings with "rogue states"[edit]
ABC Radio reported in 2005 that Glencore "has been accused of illegal dealings with rogue states: apartheid South Africa, USSR, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein", and has a "history of busting UN embargoes to profit from corrupt or despotic regimes".[14] Specifically, Glencore was reported to have been named by the CIA to have paid $3,222,780 in illegal kickbacks to obtain oil in the course of the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq. The company denied these charges, according to the CIA report quoted by ABC.[14][51]
Investments in Colombia[edit]
Swiss public television (TSR) reported in 2006 that allegations of corruption and severe human rights violations were being raised against Glencore due to the alleged conduct of its Colombian Cerrejón mining subsidiary. Local union president Francisco Ramirez accused Cerrejón of forced expropriations and evacuations of entire villages to enable mine expansion, in complicity with Colombian authorities. A representative of the local Wayuu Indians also accused Colombian paramilitary and military units, including those charged with Cerrejón mining security, of forcibly driving the Wayuu off their land in what she described as a "massacre".[52]
A BBC investigation in 2012 uncovered sale documents showing the company had paid the associates of paramilitary killers in Colombia. In 2011, a Colombian court was told by former paramilitaries that they stole the land so they could sell it to Glencore's subsidiary Prodeco, to start an open-cast coal mine; the court accepted their evidence and concluded that coal was the motive for the massacre. Glencore disputed the court's ruling.[53][54]
Glencore/Xtrata's "huge coal operation in Colombia, Prodeco, was fined a total of nearly $700,000 in 2009 for several environmental violations [running in earlier years], including waste disposal without a permit and producing coal without an environmental management plan."[17]
Glencore/Xtrata's activities in Colombia under their subsidiary, Prodeco, was investigated by the Netherlands-based NGO, Pax for Peace. They found that, "From 1996 to 2006, residents of the Cesar mining region of Colombia, from which European power utilities source most of their coal, have suffered greatly from paramilitary violence ... Prodeco mining companies have supported the paramilitary forces with finance, equipment and information. The mining companies deny any involvement, but those victims of human rights violations who stand up for their rights, are still being threatened." The coal mined by Prodeco is termed "Blood Coal." Pax released a report and included the testimony of victims and the paramilitary that attacked the indigenous population.[55]
Investments in Ecuador[edit]
"In Ecuador, the current government has tried to reduce the role played by middlemen such as Glencore with state oil company Petroecuador" due to questions about transparency and follow-through, according to Fernando Villavicencio, a Quito-based oil sector analyst.[17]
Investments in Zambia[edit]
According to a Reuters article in 2011 "[O]fficials in Zambia believe pollution from Glencore's Mopani mine is causing acid rain and health problems in an area where 5 million people live."[17] The upgrade of the Mopani Mines asset plant was completed in March 2014 eliminating the emissions of 97 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions in line with the recommended international standards by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[56]
An audit report from 2009 revealed an unexplained increase in operating costs in 2007 (+ $380 million), stunningly low reported volumes of extracted cobalt when compared to similar mining companies operating in the region, and manipulations of copper selling prices in favor of Glencore which constitute a violation of OECD’s “arm’s length” principle. The result of those various processes was to lower MCM’s net income for the 2003-2008 period by several hundreds of millions of dollars, hereby substantially lightening the company’s tax burden.[57]
Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo[edit]
The company's Luilu copper refinery uses acid to extract the copper. For three years after taking over the mine it continued to allow the waste acid to flow into a river. The chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, was interviewed for Panorama by John Sweeney and said 'It was impossible to remedy any way faster'[58] Glencore said the pollution started long before the company took over the refinery and that it has now ended.[58] A reporter for The Guardian found children as young as ten underground at the Tilwezembe mine, which the company had said in a 2008 prospectus that it had closed due to falling copper prices. These have since rebounded. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said the company does not profit from child labor, and the child miners were part of artisanal mining by nearby residents that Glencore was trying to prevent. But Panorama tracked a shipment of copper from the mine to Groupe Bazano plant and from that plant to a Glencore smelter in Zambia.[59]
They have also been accused of acquiring illicit "conflict minerals"[60] In a detailed letter sent to Global Witness, the company denied any wrongdoing.[60]
Glencore acquired stakes in the Kansuki mine in Congo's southern Katanga Province in 2012. According to Global Witness, Congo's government transferred a 75 per cent stake in Kansuki mine in secret and at vastly undervalued prices in July 2010 to a company in which Dan Gertler, who is a close friend of President Joseph Kabila, has an interest. Just a month later, in August 2010, Glencore took half the shares of the company that acquired that 75 per cent stake, becoming the operator of the mine. Glencore is financing the entire development of the Kansuki mine, thereby carrying the costs for the other partner companies, which are associated with Mr Gertler.[61] Glencore said at the time "During the period when these transactions took place, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholdings in DRC projects."[62]
Glencore acquired a 50 per cent share in SAMREF Congo SPRL in 2007, a Congolese-registered company holding 80% of the Mutanda Mine.[63] According to Global Witness, SAMREF recommended on 1 March 2011 that Congo's state-run company Gécamines, holding the other 20% share in the Mutanda Mine, sell this share to an entity also associated with Dan Gertler and went on to question the links between Glencore and Dan Gertler.[64] Glencore has been designated operator of the Mutanda Mine.[61] Glencore has responded a number of times to Global Witness regarding these allegations.[65]
Western Sahara[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, a subsidiary of Glencore Xstrata was awarded two offshore drilling licences off the coast of occupied Western Sahara. The licences are awarded in clear violation of international law, as described by the UN in 2002.[66]
Operations[edit]
In May 2014 the company announced it would close its underground Newlands coal mine in Queensland, Australia in late 2015. The mine, begun in 1983, produced 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2013. The company had earlier suspended operations at its Ravensworth underground mine following falling coal prices, escalating production costs, and a higher Australian dollar. [67][68][69]
Board of directors[edit]
As of October 2014:[70]

Tony Hayward (Non-executive Chairman)
Ivan Glasenberg (CEO)
Peter Grauer (Non-executive Director)
Peter Coates (Non-executive Director)
Leonhard Fischer (Non-executive Director)
William Macaulay (Non-executive Director)
John Mack (Non-executive Director)
Patrice Merrin (Non-executive Director)

Women on the board[edit]
In 2011, Glencore was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, chairman Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things", remarks for which he later apologised.[71] By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called "pariah status".[72] Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.[73]

Glencore plc (an acronym for Global Energy Commodity Resources) is an Anglo–Swiss multinational commodity trading and mining company with headquarters in Baar, Switzerland, and a registered office in Saint Helier, Jersey. The current company was created through a merger of Glencore with Xstrata on 2 May 2013.[3] As of 2015[update], it ranked tenth in the Fortune Global 500 list of the world's largest companies.[4] It is the world's third-largest family business.[5]
As Glencore International, the company was already one of the world's leading integrated producers and marketers of commodities. It was the largest company in Switzerland and the world's largest commodities trading company, with a 2010 global market share of 60% in internationally tradable zinc, 50% in internationally tradable copper, 9 percent in the internationally tradable grain market and 3 percent in the internationally tradable oil market.[6][7][8]
Glencore had a number of production facilities all around the world and supplied metals, minerals, crude oil, oil products, coal, natural gas and agricultural products to international customers in the automotive, power generation, steel production and food processing industries.[7] The company was formed in 1994 by a management buyout of Marc Rich + Co AG (itself founded in 1974).[7] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in May 2011 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.[9][10] It has a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[11] Glencore's shares started trading on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange in November 2013.[12] The Qatar Investment Authority is its biggest shareholder.[13]

History[edit]
1974-1994: Formation and sale[edit]
An Australian Public Radio report said, "Glencore's history reads like a spy novel".[14] The company was founded as Marc Rich & Co. AG in 1974 by billionaire commodity trader Marc Rich. Rich was charged in the US with tax evasion and illegal business dealings with Iran, but pardoned by President Bill Clinton in 2001.[15]
In 1993, commodity trading and marketing company Trafigura was split off from Marc Rich's group of companies.[16] As physical commodities traders like Trafigura, Glencore's main rivals in 2011 were identified as Vitol and Cargill,[17] amongst others.[18] In 1993 and 1994, after failing to take control of the zinc market and losing $172 million, Glencore's founder Marc Rich was forced[15][17] to sell his 51 percent majority share in his own company, Marc Rich & Company AG, to Glencore International, the commodities trading and industrial company.[19]
2015: Recent finances[edit]
Due to weak global prices for the assets Glencore owned, particularly coal and copper producers, and for the commodities in which Glencore traded, the company showed a net operating loss of $676 million for the first half of 2015. As of September 2015 the value of its stock had fallen significantly.[20] Concerns financial analysts cited to explain the falling stock price included a weak global commodity market and Glencore's high level of debt,[21] $30 billion. The company was reducing debt by selling off stock and assets.[20]
2005-2011: Glencore, Dan Gertler and the Congo[edit]
In 2005, proceeds from an oil sale to Glencore were seized as fraudulent gains as part of an investigation into corruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Allen-Mills 17 June 2008).[22]
In the course of the Congo events, Nikanor was merged into Katanga in late 2007 in a transaction valued at US$3.3 billion.[23]
In 2011 Reuters called Glencore as "the biggest company you never heard of," and described how Glencore and Dan Gertler partnered in Nikanor from 2007 until it merged with Katanga Mining. Reuters called the Nikanor acquisition an example of Glencore's opportunistic, contrarian, well-funded investment approach—focusing on equity participation, controlling interest, and working upstream from trading relationships.[17][24]

The acquisition was the culmination of 18 months of deal-making in Congo... [including fighting off a counterbid by] former England cricketer Phil Edmonds.... [Starting i]n June 2007, Glencore and partner Dan Gertler, an Israeli mining magnate, paid GB£300 million for a quarter-stake in mining company Nikanor, which was seeking to revive derelict copper mines next to Katanga Mining's properties. That deal gave Glencore exclusive rights to sell all Nikanor's output – an "offtake" agreement.... [Then, on Christmas Eve 2008, ... [having] lost 97 percent of its market value over the previous six months ... in the depths of the global financial crisis and ... running out of cash, Katanga accepted a deal for about US$500 million in a convertible loan and rights issue. Katanga agreed to issue more than a billion new shares and hand what would become 74% to Glencore. ... [By early 2011], with copper prices regularly setting records above US$10,000 a ton, Katanga's stock market value [had reached] nearly US$3.2 billion.... After a US$108 million loss in 2009, after acquisition it posted a 2010 annual profit of US$265 million.

In May 2011 the company launched an IPO valuing the business at US$61 billion[25] and creating five new billionaires.[26] Trading was limited to institutional investors for the first week and private investors weren't allowed to buy shares until 24 May 2011.[27]
In early 2011, Reuters reports included speculation from Liberum's Rawlinson that, after an Initial Public Offering (IPO), Glencore could develop an interest in London/Kazakh-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.[17] Glencore said that, contrary to recent reports, it was not interested in bidding for the under-fire group.[28]
Associations with other mining companies[edit]
Along with several other major coal producers, Glencore is also a large shareholder in globalCOAL, the online physical coal trading platform. The board of globalCOAL contains a number of power utility shareholders. Relationships also exist with Century Aluminum Co. (CENX; 44% economic ownership interest)[29]) in the US; Glencore partial subsidiary Minara Resources Ltd (AU:MRE), a 70.5% stake in one of Australia’s top three nickel producers[29]);[30] and 8.8% in United Company Rusal (HK:486), the Russian aluminium giant that went public in 2010.[29]
In mid-2011, Century was called "one of the most harrowing stocks of the past few years" but identified as a risky but potentially profitable investment for the future.[31]
2011-2012: Initial public offering[edit]
Glencore was the subject of an initial public offering (IPO) in May 2011 in a dual listing in London and Hong Kong valued at about $US60 billion. The 1,637-page document revealed invaluable information about this private company that has remained discreet for thirty-seven years. Ivan Glasenberg's shareholding was diluted from 18.1% before the IPO percent to 15.8% afterwards. Daniel Mate and Telis Mistakidis, zinc, copper and lead co-directors were diluted from 6.9% to 6%. Glencore went public to raise gross proceeds of around $10 billion. According to Reuters, Glencore is known for its "opportunistic but lucrative acquisition strategy."[32]
In May 2011, United Arab Emirates state-owned Aabar Investments confirmed an investment of $850 million in Glencore International plc as a cornerstone investor with an intention to invest an additional $150 million in the Global Offer. The investment made Aabar the largest cornerstone investor in the initial public offering (IPO) and the largest new shareholder of Glencore after its IPO, giving Aabar a 1.4% stake. The two firms intend to explore areas of co-operation.[33] [34]
In November 2012 Abu Dhabi's Aabar Investments, a unit of Abu Dhabi's state-owned United Arab Emirates International Petroleum Investment Company, wrote off more than $392-million of its $1-billion investment into Glencore's IPO less than two years after investing it. Aabar Investments was the largest new shareholder in Glencore.[35]
2012-2013: Merger with Xstrata[edit]
Prior to its merger with Xstrata, Glencore is reported to have served as a marketing partner for the company.[36][37] As of 2006, Glencore leaders Willy Strothotte (de) and Ivan Glasenberg were on the board of Xstrata, which Strothotte chaired. According to The Sunday Times, by 2006, Glencore controlled 40% of Xstrata stock and appointed Xstrata CEO, Mick Davis.[36][38] In February 2012, Glencore International Plc, agreed to buy Xstrata Plc for GB£39.1 billion (US$62 billion) in shares. Glencore offered 2.8 new shares for each Xstrata share in agreed all-share "merger of equal". It is the biggest mining takeover ever, and after approval would create an entity with 2012 sales of US$209 billion.[39] In June 2012, Glencore and Xstrata began to reconsider the proposed retention package for their merger, following shareholder opposition to a huge payout for executives. In total, 73 key executives stood to receive over GBP 170 million under the initial retention package.[40]
In October 2012, BBC News reported that Glencore had more ships than the British Royal Navy. Glencore's operations in 40 countries handled 3% of the world's oil consumption. Xstrata's operations in more than 20 countries employed 70,000 people. According to mining analyst John Meyer, if the two companies merged into Glencore Xstrata, they would be the 4th largest commodities trader in the world.[41]
Just before completing its forced April 2013 takeover of mining rival Xstrata as it awaited Chinese regulatory approval for its long-planned merger, the world's largest diversified commodities trader, the annual income of Glencore fell 25% percent, as its trading division offset the impact of weak commodity prices. Including the impact of an impairment related to a reclassification of its holding in Russian aluminium producer RUSAL, net income fell 75%.[42] On 2 May 2013, it completed the merger with Xstrata.[3] On 20 May 2014, Glencore Xstrata changed its name to Glencore plc.[43] After the merger with Glencore, Xstrata CFO Trevor Reid announced that he would no longer work as employee but would become a consultant. After 11 years of involvement, this marked a massive shift in the company's strategy and Xstrata was entering a post-Reid era.[44]
2011: Financial and accounting manipulations[edit]
In 2011 five non-government organisations filed a complaint to the OECD against a subsidiary of Glencore over allegations that a mine it owns in Zambia may not be paying enough tax on its profits. The cause for the complaint lay in the financial and accounting manipulations performed by the two companies' subsidiary, Mopani Copper Mines Plc (MCM), to evade taxation in Zambia.[45][46] A draft Grant Thornton report alleged that tax avoidance by Glencore in Zambia cost the Zambian Government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenue. The avoidance was alleged to have been facilitated through mechanisms such as transfer pricing and inflated costs at Glencore's Mopani Copper Mine. The Mopani mines are controlled through the British Virgin Islands, a recognised tax haven.[47] Glencore and its own auditor, Deloitte, rejected these allegations.[48][49][50]
2005: Dealings with "rogue states"[edit]
ABC Radio reported in 2005 that Glencore "has been accused of illegal dealings with rogue states: apartheid South Africa, USSR, Iran, and Iraq under Saddam Hussein", and has a "history of busting UN embargoes to profit from corrupt or despotic regimes".[14] Specifically, Glencore was reported to have been named by the CIA to have paid $3,222,780 in illegal kickbacks to obtain oil in the course of the UN oil-for-food programme for Iraq. The company denied these charges, according to the CIA report quoted by ABC.[14][51]
Investments in Colombia[edit]
Swiss public television (TSR) reported in 2006 that allegations of corruption and severe human rights violations were being raised against Glencore due to the alleged conduct of its Colombian Cerrejón mining subsidiary. Local union president Francisco Ramirez accused Cerrejón of forced expropriations and evacuations of entire villages to enable mine expansion, in complicity with Colombian authorities. A representative of the local Wayuu Indians also accused Colombian paramilitary and military units, including those charged with Cerrejón mining security, of forcibly driving the Wayuu off their land in what she described as a "massacre".[52]
A BBC investigation in 2012 uncovered sale documents showing the company had paid the associates of paramilitary killers in Colombia. In 2011, a Colombian court was told by former paramilitaries that they stole the land so they could sell it to Glencore's subsidiary Prodeco, to start an open-cast coal mine; the court accepted their evidence and concluded that coal was the motive for the massacre. Glencore disputed the court's ruling.[53][54]
Glencore/Xtrata's "huge coal operation in Colombia, Prodeco, was fined a total of nearly $700,000 in 2009 for several environmental violations [running in earlier years], including waste disposal without a permit and producing coal without an environmental management plan."[17]
Glencore/Xtrata's activities in Colombia under their subsidiary, Prodeco, was investigated by the Netherlands-based NGO, Pax for Peace. They found that, "From 1996 to 2006, residents of the Cesar mining region of Colombia, from which European power utilities source most of their coal, have suffered greatly from paramilitary violence ... Prodeco mining companies have supported the paramilitary forces with finance, equipment and information. The mining companies deny any involvement, but those victims of human rights violations who stand up for their rights, are still being threatened." The coal mined by Prodeco is termed "Blood Coal." Pax released a report and included the testimony of victims and the paramilitary that attacked the indigenous population.[55]
Investments in Ecuador[edit]
"In Ecuador, the current government has tried to reduce the role played by middlemen such as Glencore with state oil company Petroecuador" due to questions about transparency and follow-through, according to Fernando Villavicencio, a Quito-based oil sector analyst.[17]
Investments in Zambia[edit]
According to a Reuters article in 2011 "[O]fficials in Zambia believe pollution from Glencore's Mopani mine is causing acid rain and health problems in an area where 5 million people live."[17] The upgrade of the Mopani Mines asset plant was completed in March 2014 eliminating the emissions of 97 per cent of sulphur dioxide emissions in line with the recommended international standards by the World Health Organisation (WHO).[56]
An audit report from 2009 revealed an unexplained increase in operating costs in 2007 (+ $380 million), stunningly low reported volumes of extracted cobalt when compared to similar mining companies operating in the region, and manipulations of copper selling prices in favor of Glencore which constitute a violation of OECD’s “arm’s length” principle. The result of those various processes was to lower MCM’s net income for the 2003-2008 period by several hundreds of millions of dollars, hereby substantially lightening the company’s tax burden.[57]
Investments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo[edit]
The company's Luilu copper refinery uses acid to extract the copper. For three years after taking over the mine it continued to allow the waste acid to flow into a river. The chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, was interviewed for Panorama by John Sweeney and said 'It was impossible to remedy any way faster'[58] Glencore said the pollution started long before the company took over the refinery and that it has now ended.[58] A reporter for The Guardian found children as young as ten underground at the Tilwezembe mine, which the company had said in a 2008 prospectus that it had closed due to falling copper prices. These have since rebounded. CEO Ivan Glasenberg said the company does not profit from child labor, and the child miners were part of artisanal mining by nearby residents that Glencore was trying to prevent. But Panorama tracked a shipment of copper from the mine to Groupe Bazano plant and from that plant to a Glencore smelter in Zambia.[59]
They have also been accused of acquiring illicit "conflict minerals"[60] In a detailed letter sent to Global Witness, the company denied any wrongdoing.[60]
Glencore acquired stakes in the Kansuki mine in Congo's southern Katanga Province in 2012. According to Global Witness, Congo's government transferred a 75 per cent stake in Kansuki mine in secret and at vastly undervalued prices in July 2010 to a company in which Dan Gertler, who is a close friend of President Joseph Kabila, has an interest. Just a month later, in August 2010, Glencore took half the shares of the company that acquired that 75 per cent stake, becoming the operator of the mine. Glencore is financing the entire development of the Kansuki mine, thereby carrying the costs for the other partner companies, which are associated with Mr Gertler.[61] Glencore said at the time "During the period when these transactions took place, Glencore had decided in general not to increase its shareholdings in DRC projects."[62]
Glencore acquired a 50 per cent share in SAMREF Congo SPRL in 2007, a Congolese-registered company holding 80% of the Mutanda Mine.[63] According to Global Witness, SAMREF recommended on 1 March 2011 that Congo's state-run company Gécamines, holding the other 20% share in the Mutanda Mine, sell this share to an entity also associated with Dan Gertler and went on to question the links between Glencore and Dan Gertler.[64] Glencore has been designated operator of the Mutanda Mine.[61] Glencore has responded a number of times to Global Witness regarding these allegations.[65]
Western Sahara[edit]
In 2013 and 2014, a subsidiary of Glencore Xstrata was awarded two offshore drilling licences off the coast of occupied Western Sahara. The licences are awarded in clear violation of international law, as described by the UN in 2002.[66]
Operations[edit]
In May 2014 the company announced it would close its underground Newlands coal mine in Queensland, Australia in late 2015. The mine, begun in 1983, produced 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal in 2013. The company had earlier suspended operations at its Ravensworth underground mine following falling coal prices, escalating production costs, and a higher Australian dollar. [67][68][69]
Board of directors[edit]
As of October 2014:[70]

Tony Hayward (Non-executive Chairman)
Ivan Glasenberg (CEO)
Peter Grauer (Non-executive Director)
Peter Coates (Non-executive Director)
Leonhard Fischer (Non-executive Director)
William Macaulay (Non-executive Director)
John Mack (Non-executive Director)
Patrice Merrin (Non-executive Director)

Women on the board[edit]
In 2011, Glencore was listed on the London Stock Exchange. In the same year, chairman Simon Murray opposed quotas for women on boards, claiming that women 'are not so ambitious in business as men because they've got better things to do. Quite often they like bringing up their children and all sorts of other things", remarks for which he later apologised.[71] By 2014, Glencore was the only blue chip company with no female member of the board, giving it what the Financial Times called "pariah status".[72] Following criticism from Government Minister Vince Cable and objections by major shareholders, including Aviva Investors and the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), Glencore promised to appoint a woman director. In June 2014, Glencore appointed Patrice Merrin as its first female director.[73]
