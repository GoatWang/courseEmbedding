L.B. Foster Company’s Conflict Minerals Policy
 
L.B. Foster Company is committed to the 
					highest standards of ethics and business conduct. 
					Accordingly, we fully support the goals and objectives of 
					Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 
					Consumer Protection Act (the “Act”), which aims to prevent 
					the use of certain “Conflict Minerals” that directly or 
					indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in The Democratic 
					Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (as 
					defined in the Act).    
“Conflict Minerals” are defined to 
					include columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, gold, 
					wolframite and three specified derivatives (tin, tantalum 
					and tungsten) and any other mineral or its derivatives 
					(collectively, the “Designated Minerals”) determined by the 
					U.S. Secretary of State to be financing conflict in the DRC 
					or an adjoining country.   
The Act requires manufacturers, 
					like us, who file certain reports with the Securities and 
					Exchange Commission to disclose whether the products they 
					manufacture or contract to manufacture contain “Conflict 
					Minerals” that are “necessary to the functionality or 
					production” of those products.  
L.B. Foster Company supports 
					the humanitarian goal of ending violent conflict in the DRC 
					and surrounding countries and is committed to avoiding the 
					use of “Conflict Minerals” in our products that either 
					directly or indirectly contribute to the ongoing turmoil in 
					the DRC and adjoining countries.   L. B. Foster Company does 
					not directly purchase any Conflict Minerals. We recognize 
					that tracing the origin and chain of custody of the 
					Designated Minerals contained in our products will be a 
					complex process, which will require the cooperation and 
					support of our direct and indirect suppliers. To this end, 
					L.B. Foster Company suppliers of products that contain any 
					Designated Mineral will be required to perform due diligence 
					on the source and chain of custody of such Designated 
					Mineral in order to provide L.B. Foster Company with the 
					source country of the Designated Mineral and a conclusion 
					relative to the mineral’s conflict status.  
 We expect our 
					suppliers  to (both directly and indirectly) source any 
					Designated Minerals from socially responsible sources and we 
					reserve the right to request from any supplier at any time 
					such information, certifications and documentation as we 
					deem necessary to monitor or assess compliance with this 
					policy.   
Any supplier who is found to be in violation of 
					our Conflict Mineral Policy, will be required to promptly 
					implement a remediation plan. L.B. Foster Company reserves 
					the right to conduct audit procedures to assess vendor 
					supply chains and to confirm vendor compliance with our 
					Conflict Mineral Policy. Continued non-compliance or lack of 
					willingness to take steps to address issues of concern may 
					ultimately lead to the termination of the supplier 
					relationship.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  (Dollars in thousands, except share data)  Forward-Looking Statements  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Many of the forward-looking statements are located in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Forward-looking statements provide current expectations of future events based on certain assumptions and include any statement that does not directly relate to any historical or current fact. Sentences containing words such as "believe," "intend," "plan," "may," "expect," "should," "could," "anticipate," "estimate," "predict," "project," or their negatives, or other similar expressions generally should be considered forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may concern, among other things, L.B. Foster Company's (the "Company's") expectations relating to our strategy, goals, projections, and plans regarding our financial position, liquidity, capital resources and results of operations, the outcome of litigation and product warranty claims, decisions regarding our strategic growth initiatives, market position, and product development, all of which are based on current estimates that involve inherent risks and uncertainties. The Company has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events. While the Company considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory, and other risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the Company's control. The Company cautions readers that various factors could cause the actual results of the Company to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Among the factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements are risks and uncertainties related to: a continuation or worsening of the current economic slowdown in the markets we serve; the risk of doing business in international markets; our ability to effectuate our strategy, including cost reduction initiatives, and our ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated benefits; costs of and impacts associated with shareholder activism; a decrease in freight or passenger rail traffic; the timeliness and availability of materials from our major suppliers, including the impact on our access to supplies of customer preferences as to the origin of such supplies, such as customer's concerns about conflict minerals; labor disputes; the continuing effective implementation of an enterprise resource planning system; changes in current accounting estimates and their ultimate outcomes; the adequacy of internal and external sources of funds to meet financing needs, including our ability to negotiate any additional necessary amendments to our credit agreement; the Company's ability to manage its working capital requirements and indebtedness; domestic and international taxes; foreign currency fluctuations; inflation; economic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom's pending exit from the European Union; sustained declines in energy prices; a lack of state or federal funding for new infrastructure projects; increased domestic and foreign government regulation; an increase in manufacturing or material costs; the ultimate number of concrete ties that will have to be replaced pursuant to the previously disclosed product warranty claim of the Union Pacific Railroad ("UPRR") and an overall resolution of the related contract claims as well as the possible costs associated with the outcome of the lawsuit filed by the UPRR; the loss of future revenues from current customers; and risks inherent in litigation. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements prove incorrect, actual outcomes could vary materially from those indicated. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, and results of the Company's business and forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The forward-looking statements in this report are made as of the date of this report and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments, or otherwise, except as required by securities laws.  General Overview  L.B. Foster Company ("Company") is a leading manufacturer and distributor of products and services for the transportation and energy infrastructure. The Company is comprised of three business segments: Rail Products and Services, Construction Products, and Tubular and Energy Services.  Table of Contents  Quarter-to-dateResults  The segment gross profit measures presented within the MD&A tables constitute non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management to provide investors and other users information to evaluate the performance of the Company's segments on a more comparable basis to market trends and peers. The exclusion of significant cost allocations to the reportable segments:   Allows users to understand the operational performance of our reportable segments;   Provides greater comparability to other registrants with similar businesses and avoids possible non-comparability at the reportable segment pre-tax profit level resulting from our specific corporate cost allocations; and   Facilitates a clearer, market-based perspective on the strength or weakness of our reportable segments in their markets to better aid in investment decisions.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures have historically been key metrics utilized by segment managers to monitor selling prices and quantities as well as production and service costs to better evaluate key profitability drivers and trends that may develop due to industry and competitive conditions.

Table of Contents  First Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2016 - Company Analysis  Net sales of $118,702 for the period ended March 31, 2017 decreased by $7,608, or 6.0%, compared to the prior year quarter. The change was attributable to decreases of 17.4% and 12.2%, in Tubular and Energy Services and Rail Products and Services segment sales, respectively. These decreases were offset by an increase of 17.1% within the Construction Products segment.  Gross profit margin for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 was 17.9% or 110 basis points ("bps") lower than the prior year quarter. The decrease was due to reductions of 190 bps and 130 bps, in Rail Products and Services and Construction Products, respectively. These reductions were offset by an increase of 170 bps within the Tubular and Energy Services segment.  Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $3,590 or 15.7% from the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by personnel and discretionary spending reductions of $2,640, reduced litigation costs related to the UPRR matter of $473, and $477 of other strategic expense reductions.  Amortization decreased $1,507, or 46.1%, as a result of the June 1, 2016 interim intangible asset impairment test, which was finalized during the three months ended September 30, 2016, resulting in a $59,786 impairment of definite-lived intangible assets. Interest expense increased by $938, or 80.2%, as a result of the increase in interest rates on outstanding debt. Other expense decreased $710, or 99.3%, which primarily related to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar relative to the Canadian dollar in the three months ended March 31, 2016.  The Company's effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the three-month period ended March, 31, 2017 was (21.6%), compared to 31.7% in the prior year quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded a tax provision of $431, compared to a tax benefit of $1,317 in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Due to the full valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets, the Company's tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2017 does not reflect any tax benefit for domestic pretax losses, and is primarily comprised of taxes related to our Canadian and United Kingdom operations.  Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $2,422, or $0.23 per share, compared to a net loss of $2,832, or $0.28 per share, in the prior year quarter.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations - Segment Analysis Rail Products and Services Three Months Ended Percent March 31, (Decrease)/Increase (Decrease)/Increase 2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016 2017 vs. 2016 Net Sales $ 56,480 $ 64,292 $ (7,812 ) (12.2 )% Segment Profit $ 1,489 $ 741 $ 748 100.9 % Segment Profit Percentage 2.6 % 1.2 % 1.4 % 116.7 %  First Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2016  Rail Products and Services segment sales decreased $7,812, or 12.2%, compared to the prior year period. All of our rail divisions, with the exception of Rail Technologies, experienced a decline in sales. The sales declines were primarily volume driven by the domestic freight rail markets. Our domestic rail distribution business, while shipping more tons compared to the prior year quarter, saw an unfavorable impact due to pricing. This was offset by increases in our international Rail Technologies divisions of $3,342 or 21.1%.  The Rail Products and Services segment profit increased by $748 to 2.6% of net sales. The increase was primarily attributable to a reduction in selling and administrative expenses of $2,198, or 23.1%, and in other expenses, including corporate allocations, of $1,296, or 35.2%. This was offset by a decline in non-GAAP gross profit of $2,746, or 19.7%, which was primarily related to volume reductions within domestic track component products and was heightened by pricing declines in the current year.  During the current quarter, the Rail Products and Services segment had an increase in new orders of 59.7% compared to the prior year period. The increase impacted each of the three business units within the segment and created a 22.3% increase in the ending backlog at March 31, 2017. The Company is encouraged by positive signs from order activity exiting the first quarter but anticipates an annual sales decline within our domestic rail distribution business.  Construction Products Three Months Ended Percent March 31, Increase Increase 2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016 2017 vs. 2016 Net Sales $ 37,322 $ 31,880 $ 5,442 17.1 % Segment Profit $ 1,219 $ 448 $ 771 172.1 % Segment Profit Percentage 3.3 % 1.4 % 1.9 % 135.7 %  First Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2016  Construction Products segment sales increased $5,442, or 17.1%, compared to the prior year period. The increase related to Piling and Fabricated Bridge businesses of $3,185 and $2,996, respectively. The increase in Piling was primarily due to increased success with both pipe piling and h-piling products. Fabricated Bridge saw favorable sales in the current quarter due to several projects, including the continuation of the Peace Bridge project. This was offset by a reduction in Precast Concrete of $739.  The Construction Products segment profit increased $771 to 3.3% of net sales. The increase related to the non-GAAP gross profit increase of $460, or 8.3%, which was attributable to increased operating efficiencies in Precast Concrete, which had a favorable impact on manufacturing variances.  During the quarter, the Construction Products segment had an increase in new orders of 12.1% compared to the prior year period. The increase related to the Piling and Precast Concrete businesses. The increase in Piling orders are due to our more competitive pricing as well as demand from significant civil projects. Precast Concrete orders were favorably impacted from expanded product offerings at our Waverly, WV location.  Table of Contents  Tubular and Energy Services Three Months Ended Percent March 31, (Decrease)/Increase (Decrease)/Increase 2017 2016 2017 vs. 2016 2017 vs. 2016 Net Sales $ 24,900 $ 30,138 $ (5,238 ) (17.4 )%  Segment Loss $ (508) $ (1,927) $ 1,419 73.6 %  Segment Loss Percentage (2.0)% (6.4)% 4.4 % 68.8 %  First Quarter 2017 Compared to First Quarter 2016  Tubular and Energy Services segment sales decreased $5,238, or 17.4%, compared to the prior year period. The decrease related to $6,188 and $1,492 from Precision Measurement Systems and Protective Coatings, respectively, partially offset by an increase in Test and Inspection Services sales. The quarter was negatively impacted by weak conditions within the midstream oil and gas market segment but showed increased demand within the upstream oil and gas market.  Tubular and Energy Services segment loss decreased by $1,419, or 73.6%, compared to the prior year quarter. The quarter was favorably impacted by a reduction in amortization expense of $1,442 from the 2016 long-lived intangible asset impairment charge. Non-GAAP gross profit coupled with selling and administrative expense remained flat compared to the prior year quarter.  The Tubular and Energy Services segment had an increase in new orders of 31.1% compared to the prior year period. Orders for Protective Coatings and Test and Inspection Services increased 149.8% and 95.1%, respectively. While the upstream oil and gas market showed signs of recovery in the current period, consistent with historical cycles, we expect our midstream business to lag our upstream business.  Other Segment Backlog Total Company backlog is summarized by business segment in the following table for the periods indicated: Backlog March 31, December 31, March 31, 2017 2016 2016 Rail Products and Services $ 91,655 $ 62,743 $ 74,917 Construction Products 79,150 71,954 56,991 Tubular and Energy Services 24,497 12,759 22,101 Total Backlog $ 195,302 $ 147,456 $ 154,009  While a considerable portion of our business is backlog-driven, certain product lines within the Rail Products and Services and Tubular and Energy Services segments are not driven by backlog and therefore have insignificant levels throughout the year.  Warranty  As of March 31, 2017, the Company maintained a total product warranty reserve of $10,204 for its estimate of all potential product warranty claims. Of this total, $7,578 reflects the current estimate of the Company's exposure for potential concrete tie warranty claims. While the Company believes this is a reasonable estimate of its potential exposure related to identified concrete tie warranty matters, the Company may incur future charges associated with new customer claims or further development of information of existing customer claims. Thus, there can be no assurance that future potential costs pertaining to warranty claims will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information.  Table of Contents  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Total debt was $155,265 and $159,565 as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, and was primarily comprised of borrowings on the revolving credit facility and the term loan.  Our need for liquidity relates primarily to working capital requirements for operations, capital expenditures, joint venture capital obligations, debt service obligations, and share repurchases as authorized by the Board of Directors and as permitted under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated March 13, 2015.  The change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods ended March 31 are as follows:   March 31, 2017 2016 Net cash provided (used) by operating activities $ 10,748 $ (5,107 ) Net cash used by investing activities (3,315 ) (3,603 ) Net cash (used) provided by financing activities (4,397 ) 5,504 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 369 777 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 3,405 $ (2,429 )  Cash Flow from Operating Activities  During the current 2017 period, cash flows provided by operating activities of $10,748 compared to a use of $5,107 during the prior year period. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, income and adjustments to income from operating activities provided $3,010 compared to $4,033 in the 2016 period. Working capital and other assets and liabilities provided $7,738 in the current period compared to a use of $9,140 in the prior year period.  The Company's calculation for days sales outstanding at March 31, 2017 was 48 days compared to 53 days at December 31, 2016, and we believe our receivables portfolio is strong.  Cash Flow from Investing Activities  Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3,453 and $3,125. The current year expenditures relate to trackside rail lubricator units installed as part of a new long-term service contract and, to a lesser extent, general plant and operational improvements. Expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to the Birmingham, AL inside diameter coating line upgrade and application development of the Company's new enterprise resource planning system. The Company also loaned $575 to its LB Pipe JV as of March 31, 2016.  Cash Flow from Financing Activities  During the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company had a decrease in outstanding debt of $4,300, primarily related to payments against the revolving credit facility as well as a quarterly payment against the term loan. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company had an increase in outstanding debt of $6,162, primarily related to drawings against the revolving credit facility to fund working capital requirements. Treasury stock acquisitions represent income tax withholdings from employees in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards. Cash outflows related to dividends were $414 for the period ended March 31, 2016.  Financial Condition  As of March 31, 2017, we had $33,768 in cash and cash equivalents and a domestic credit facility with $44,208 of net availability while carrying $155,265 in total debt. We believe this liquidity will provide the flexibility to operate the business in a prudent manner, and continue to service our revolving credit facility and term loan.  Our cash management priority continues to be short-term maturities and the preservation of our principal balances. Approximately $29,315 of our cash and cash equivalents was held in non-domestic bank accounts, and, under current law, . . .  May 03, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
