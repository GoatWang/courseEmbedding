Home > About Us 

About Us: We're Full Service Banking
"Our commitment is to be large enough to help customers achieve their financial
aspirations and small enough to care that they do." Jim Cherry, CEO of Park Sterling Corporation
At Park Sterling, our entire organization was built on a foundation that emphasizes listening, understanding, and personalizing our customers' banking experiences to provide both individuals and businesses with answers they can bank on. We're committed to understanding each client's particular needs and then building a solution around them. It's a culture that permeates our organization and a philosophy that extends well beyond traditional banking solutions to better serve the needs of the individuals, families, and businesses we serve throughout the Southeast.

Park Sterling's History



"Our executive management team shares a common motivation: to create something special in the communities we serve."
Jim Cherry, CEO of Park Sterling Corporation

Park Sterling Bank was founded in 2006 to provide customers in the Southeast with a viable alternative to what can be limited resources offered by small community banks and the limited flexibility of large national banks. In 2010, Park Sterling raised $150 million in equity capital through an Initial Public Offering and embarked on an accelerated growth strategy focused on building long-term value for customers, shareholders, and employees. In 2015, Fortune Magazine named Park Sterling Bank to its list of Fastest Growing Publicly Held Companies.
Park Sterling's two-pronged growth strategy includes both organic growth and expansion through partnerships with existing community banks located in attractive regional markets, ensuring a shared commitment of service to the region. Our recent merger with Richmond, VA-based First Capital Bank validates the success of this strategy, deepening our collective depth of talent and commitment to the communities we serve. Today, we are a regionally-focused financial services company with more than $3.2 billion in total assets and 55 banking offices stretching across the Carolinas, Virginia, and northern Georgia (at 2016Q1).

"At that time, our financial performance goals, adjusted for merger-related costs, were to surpass a 1% return on average assets and a 10% return on average equity, and to lower our efficiency ratio below 60% by the end of 2018. We are very pleased to report that we achieved these results in the second quarter 2017 as our annualized adjusted return on average assets was 1.10% and our adjusted return on average equity was 10.08%. Additionally, our adjusted efficiency ratio was 59%. These results reflect the very fine work of all of my colleagues at Park Sterling in supporting existing customers and winning new customers with exceptional service and market leading products. Looking forward, we are excited about our announced strategic partnership with South State Bank and the opportunity to more completely fulfill our original vision of creating the premier regional banking franchise in the southeast."Financial ResultsIncome Statement - Three Months Ended June 30, 2017Park Sterling reported net income of $8.5 million, or $0.16 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2017 ("2017Q2"). This compares to net income of $7.5 million, or $0.14 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 ("2017Q1") and net income of $5.6 million, or $0.11 per share, for the three months ended June 30, 2016 ("2016Q2"). The increase in net income from 2017Q1 resulted primarily from an increase in interest income on loans and lower provision for loan losses, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on borrowed funds, professional fees related to the South State merger and income tax expense on higher pretax income. The increase in net income from 2016Q2 was primarily a result of the increase in interest income described above, as well as a decrease in provision for loan losses and a decrease in merger-related expenses, partially offset by increased income taxes on higher pretax income in 2017Q2.Net interest income totaled $28.6 million in 2017Q2, which represents a $1.5 million, or 6%, increase from $27.1 million in 2017Q1 and a $2.5 million, or 10%, increase from $26.1 million in 2016Q2. Average total earning assets increased $63 million in 2017Q2 to $3.05 billion, compared to $2.98 billion in 2017Q1 and increased $205 million, or 7%, compared to $2.84 billion in 2016Q2. The increase in average total earning assets in 2017Q2 from 2017Q1 included an increase in average loans (including loans held for sale) of $55 million, or 9% annualized, an increase in average marketable securities of $3.3 million, and an increase in average other interest-earning assets of $4.3 million. The increase in average total earning assets in 2017Q2 from 2016Q2 resulted primarily from a $180 million, or 8%, increase in average loans (including loans held for sale), a $4.5 million, or 1%, increase in average marketable securities and a $19.6 million, or 42%, increase in average other interest-earning assets.Net interest margin was 3.77% in 2017Q2, representing a 9 basis point increase from 3.68% in 2017Q1 and an 8 basis point increase from 3.69% in 2016Q2. The increase in net interest margin from 2017Q1 resulted primarily from an 18 basis point increase in loan yields, partially offset by a 29 basis point increase in the cost of borrowed funds, both of which reflect the increase in the prime lending rate. The increase in net interest margin from 2016Q2 was primarily the result of a 10 basis point increase in loan yields and an improved yield on investment securities, partially offset by an increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The Company reported no provision for loan losses expense in 2017Q2, compared to $678 thousand of provision recorded in 2017Q1, and $882 thousand of provision recorded in 2016Q2. Allowance for loan loss levels decreased to 0.51% of total loans at 2017Q2 compared to 0.52% at 2017Q1. Noninterest income totaled $5.4 million in 2017Q2, compared to $5.5 million in 2017Q1 and $5.4 million in 2016Q2. The decrease from 2017Q1 is primarily the result of a $186 thousand decrease in mortgage banking income from the first quarter, partially offset by increases in service charges, wealth and capital markets income. The $43 thousand increase in noninterest income from 2016Q2 reflects increases in service charge income and other noninterest income, partially offset by decreases in mortgage banking, wealth and capital markets income.Noninterest expense increased $0.8 million, or 4%, to $21.4 million in 2017Q2 from $20.6 million in 2017Q1, and decreased $0.5 million, or 2%, compared to $21.9 million in 2016Q2. The increase in noninterest expense from 2017Q1 resulted from $0.9 million in merger-related expenses incurred in the second quarter as compared to no merger-related expenses in the first quarter. The decrease in noninterest expenses from 2017Q1 was due primarily to a decrease in merger-related expenses of $0.4 million and decreases in all other categories of noninterest expense reflecting expense saving following the First Capital merger systems conversion completed in May 2016.The Company's effective tax rate was 32.2% in 2017Q2, compared to 33.2% in 2017Q1 and 35.4% in 2016Q2. The decrease in the effective tax rate compared to 2017Q1 was the result of excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation.Balance SheetTotal assets increased $32.2 million, or 4% annualized, to $3.34 billion at 2017Q2, compared to total assets of $3.31 billion at 2017Q1. Total securities, including non-marketable securities, decreased $21.4 million, to $511.5 million. Total loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $41.5 million, or 7% annualized, to $2.50 billion at 2017Q2.The mix of commercial and consumer loans remained largely consistent with 2017Q1. Total commercial loans increased $28.4 million and represent 79% of the loan portfolio. Commercial and industrial and commercial real estate owner occupied increased $25.6 million and represent 32.6% of the portfolio, up from 32.1% at 2017Q1, reflecting an increased focus on commercial and industrial and commercial real estate owner occupied lending. Acquisition, construction and development loans decreased $31.5 million and represent 13.5% of the portfolio, down from 15.0% at 2017Q1. Total consumer loans increased $13.2 million and remain flat as a percentage of total loans at 21% of the portfolio. Total deposits increased $28 million, or 4% annualized, to $2.54 billion at 2017Q2. Noninterest bearing demand deposits increased $30 million, or 23% annualized, to $554.4 million from 2017Q1. Money market, NOW and savings deposits were up $13.1 million from 2017Q1 and represent 51% of total deposits. Time deposits decreased $15.2 million to $691.7 million at 2017Q2. Total borrowings increased $5.2 million, or 5% annualized, to $408.6 million at 2017Q2 compared to $403.4 million at 2017Q1. At 2017Q2, FHLB borrowings totaled $345 million, the senior unsecured term loan at the holding company totaled $29.8 million, and acquired subordinated debt, net of acquisition accounting fair value marks, totaled $33.8 million. Total shareholders' equity increased $7.6 million to $369.3 million at 2017Q2 compared to $361.7 million at 2017Q1, driven by a $6.4 million increase in retained earnings and an increase of $0.9 million in accumulated other comprehensive income. The change in accumulated other comprehensive income was caused by the effect of market interest rates on the fair value of available for sale investment securities.The Company's capital ratios remain strong at June 30, 2017 with the Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET1") ratio at 11.10% and the Tier 1 leverage ratio at 10.05%.Asset QualityAsset quality remains strong. Nonperforming assets were $15.1 million at 2017Q2, or 0.45% of total assets, compared to $15.3 million at 2017Q1, or 0.46% of total assets. Nonperforming loans were $12.0 million at 2017Q2, and represented 0.48% of total loans, compared to $12.1 million at 2017Q1, or 0.49% of total loans. The Company reported net charge-offs of $131 thousand, or 0.02% of average loans (annualized), in 2017Q2, compared to net recoveries of $30 thousand, or 0.01% of average loans (annualized), in 2017Q1. The allowance for loan losses decreased $131 thousand, or 1%, to $12.7 million, or 0.51% of total loans, at 2017Q2, compared to $12.8 million, or 0.52% of total loans, at 2017Q1. The decrease in the allowance from 2017Q1 is primarily attributable to a change in qualitative factors reducing the required reserve, partially offset by an increase in the allowance related to loan growth for the period.

Home > About Us 

About Us: We're Full Service Banking
"Our commitment is to be large enough to help customers achieve their financial
aspirations and small enough to care that they do." Jim Cherry, CEO of Park Sterling Corporation
At Park Sterling, our entire organization was built on a foundation that emphasizes listening, understanding, and personalizing our customers' banking experiences to provide both individuals and businesses with answers they can bank on. We're committed to understanding each client's particular needs and then building a solution around them. It's a culture that permeates our organization and a philosophy that extends well beyond traditional banking solutions to better serve the needs of the individuals, families, and businesses we serve throughout the Southeast.

Park Sterling's History



"Our executive management team shares a common motivation: to create something special in the communities we serve."
Jim Cherry, CEO of Park Sterling Corporation

Park Sterling Bank was founded in 2006 to provide customers in the Southeast with a viable alternative to what can be limited resources offered by small community banks and the limited flexibility of large national banks. In 2010, Park Sterling raised $150 million in equity capital through an Initial Public Offering and embarked on an accelerated growth strategy focused on building long-term value for customers, shareholders, and employees. In 2015, Fortune Magazine named Park Sterling Bank to its list of Fastest Growing Publicly Held Companies.
Park Sterling's two-pronged growth strategy includes both organic growth and expansion through partnerships with existing community banks located in attractive regional markets, ensuring a shared commitment of service to the region. Our recent merger with Richmond, VA-based First Capital Bank validates the success of this strategy, deepening our collective depth of talent and commitment to the communities we serve. Today, we are a regionally-focused financial services company with more than $3.2 billion in total assets and 55 banking offices stretching across the Carolinas, Virginia, and northern Georgia (at 2016Q1).

Kitchen Sinks FAQs



Q: 
What is Vikrell®?


Solid Vikrell material by Sterling offers exceptional strength combined with resistance to chipping, cracking and peeling. Vikrell is a solid composite material made of resins, fiberglass and filler that is exclusive to Kohler Company. The material is compression molded in large presses to form baths and wall surrounds that are structurally rigid yet lightweight and feature a non-porous surface that is easy to clean. Click here to learn more about Vikrell material. 



Q: 
Is higher or lower gauge steel better?


The lower the gauge, the thicker the steel. Thick steel is less likely to dent and is more sound resistant.



Q: 
What is SilentShield® technology?


SilentShield sound-deadening pads are applied to all STERLING sinks creating a quieter sink (from clanging disposal or silverware) versus many competitors. The sound-deadening technology was borrowed from the auto industry.

Bathtubs FAQs



Q: 
What is the difference between a right-hand and left-hand bath?


When looking at a whirlpool or bath, you must establish the reference point, which is the entry side or threshold. From the entry side of the whirlpool or bath, the drain location determines whether the unit is right-hand or left-hand.  An right-hand bath has its drain on the right side and a left-hand bath has its drain on the left side.



Q: 
What is the removable apron option?


The apron or skirt, covers the front of a bath or whirlpool.  A removable apron allows limited access to the pump/motor and to plumbing system components on the apron side of the unit.



Q: 
The bathtub in my home measures 58" but I cannot find a STERLING bathtub for that size?


The standard size for bathtubs is 60" and are installed in the rough stage of construction (against the studs). After rough installation a 1/2" of wall board and a 1/2" of tile is typically added on top of the studs at each end of the bath making a finished installation roughly 58".

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
