WATERBURY, Conn., May 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Webster Financial Corporation (NYSE:   WBS), parent of Webster Bank, announced today that Executive Vice Chairman Joseph J. Savage will retire effective June 30 following a distinguished 40-year career in banking, culminating in 15 years of outstanding service to Webster.










 







							 		Joseph J. Savage, executive vice chairman at Webster Bank, will retire effective June 30 following a distinguished 40-year career in banking, culminating in 15 years of outstanding service to Webster.
							  



 

 
 



Savage joined Webster in April 2002 as executive vice president, Commercial Banking. He was promoted to president in 2014 and to the board of directors of Webster Bank. He was appointed executive vice chairman in October 2015. He has overseen Private Banking and Human Resources, and has developed and guided the bank's programs for leadership development and employee engagement in recent years. 
"Joe has been a cornerstone of Webster Bank's growth and progress, having made significant contributions on many fronts during his distinguished career, at first in Commercial Banking and then ever more broadly across Webster.  Joe is a steward and champion of our values, known as the Webster Way, and our differentiated culture, and has continually brought them to life for customers and the bankers he leads," said James C. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer. "Joe's ceaseless focus on relationship value and his dedication to mentoring future leaders will help keep us 'strong at the core,' as Joe would say, for years to come."   
Savage was instrumental in the early growth of Webster's Commercial Banking business.  He guided Webster's successful entries into Fairfield County in 2002, the Boston market in 2009, and the metro New York City area in 2013.  "Under Joe's leadership, Commercial Banking has grown five-fold in footings and revenue and is today Webster's most profitable business," Smith said.  
Savage also has spent considerable time living up to the communities we serve. He is chairman of the MetroHartford Alliance, director of the Connecticut Bankers Association, and director emeritus for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. He is a director of the Travelers Championship Committee, a member of the board of the Bushnell and a previous campaign chair for United Way of Central and Northeastern Connecticut.
Prior to joining Webster, Savage was executive vice president of the Communications and Energy banking group for CoBank in Denver from 1996 to 2002. Earlier in his career, he worked at the Bank of New York. He earned a bachelor's degree from Manhattan College and an MBA at Seton Hall University.

By HOWARD FRENCH
Special to The Republican
Webster Financial Corp., which operates Webster Bank, has appointed Joseph J. Savage as president, effective Jan. 1, bank officials said.
Savage replaces Gerald P. Plush, who resigned Sept. 30 as president and chief operating officer without elaboration.
Bank officials said then that Plush made a “personal decision to pursue other career interests.”
Plush had been with Webster since July 2006, moving up through the executive ranks, and was named vice chairman and chief operating officer in January 2011, and president in December 2011.
Joseph J. Savage was recently named president of Webster Bank.Handout  
Savage, who is Webster’s executive vice president and head of commercial banking, will oversee commercial and private banking units, as well as human resources. He will report to Chairman and CEO James C. Smith.
“In his 11 years at Webster, Joe and his team have grown commercial banking to the point that it now accounts for more than half of our total loan portfolio and half of Webster’s net income.” Smith said.
Prior to joining Webster in 2002, Savage was executive vice president and head of the Communications and Energy Banking Group for CoBank in Denver, Colo.
Webster also promoted John Ciulla, executive vice president and head of middle market banking, to Savage’s former post.
Ciulla joined Webster in 2004 and has filled a variety of management positions, including chief credit risk officer and senior vice president for commercial banking, Smith said.
Before coming to Webster, Ciulla was managing director of The Bank of New York.
Webster Bank has 169 branches in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York. It also operates the commercial lending firm Webster Business Credit Corp. and the equipment finance firm Webster Capital Finance Corp.

STATE OF WISCONSIN��� 


IN COURT OF
  APPEALS




 


DISTRICT III




 


 




 


 




State of Wisconsin ex rel.
  Joseph J. Savage, 
 
����������������������� Petitioner-Appellant,
 
������������� v.
 
David H. Schwarz,
  Administrator, Department of 
Corrections, Probation and
  Parole, 
 
����������������������� Respondent-Respondent.
 




 


 











 
����������� APPEAL
from an order of the circuit court for St. Croix County:� SCOTT
R. NEEDHAM, Judge.� Affirmed.� 
����������� Before Cane, C.J., Hoover, P.J., and Peterson, J. 
�1������� PER CURIAM.   Joseph Savage appeals an order
affirming his probation revocation and quashing his writ of certiorari.� The Department of Corrections began
proceedings to revoke Savage�s probation after he violated several
conditions.� At Savage�s revocation
hearing, the administrative law judge (ALJ) found Savage had violated
conditions of his probation, but determined a program to which Savage had
already been accepted was a viable alternative to revocation.� The alternative program, however, was in
Minnesota and the ALJ concluded he did not have the authority to transfer
Savage to an out of state program.� The
ALJ determined there was no other appropriate alternative to revocation and revoked
Savage�s probation.� Savage appealed to
the Division of Hearings and Appeals, which upheld the ALJ�s decision, but
determined the Minnesota program was not a viable alternative to Savage�s
revocation.� Savage filed for certiorari
review, and the trial court affirmed the division�s decision.� 
�2������� On appeal, Savage argues the division�s decision is
arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable because it did not explain why the
Minnesota program was not a reasonable alternative to revocation.� He further contends the evidence does not
support the division�s decision that there were no reasonable alternatives to
revocation.� We determine the division�s
decision was not arbitrary, oppressive or unreasonable and therefore affirm the
judgment.
BACKGROUND
�3������� Savage was convicted of attempted burglary in July 2000.� He was sentenced to five years�
incarceration and two and one-half years� extended supervision.� The court stayed this sentence and placed
Savage on probation for seven years.�
His probation conditions included 120 days in jail.� In addition, the court required him to
complete and follow the recommendations from an Alcohol and Other Drug Assessment
(AODA) and a �male issues� assessment.� 
�4������� Savage failed to report to jail or to his probation
agent.� He also did not complete his
treatment requirements.� He was arrested
in Duluth, Minnesota, in February 2001 for a hit-and-run violation and was
turned over to the Wisconsin Department of Corrections.� At the time of his arrest, Savage was facing
a criminal charge in St. Croix County and was under investigation for
possession of methamphetamine in Duluth. 
�5������� The DOC moved to revoke Savage�s probation, alleging five
condition violations.� At his revocation
hearing, Savage admitted to three of the violations, specifically that he
failed to report to jail, failed to report to his probation agent, and that he
had used methamphetamine.� In addition,
the ALJ determined Savage had failed to attend his �male-issues� group. 
�6������� At the hearing, Savage asked to be placed in the Minnesota
Teen Challenge Program for treatment of his drug addiction.� The ALJ said Savage was a good candidate for
the program and determined the program would provide Savage with the necessary
supervision and treatment.� However, the
ALJ concluded he did not have the authority to send Savage to the program
because it was in Minnesota and required the approval of that state�s
authorities.� Because he found no other
alternative to revocation, the ALJ revoked Savage�s probation.
�7������� Savage appealed to the Division of Hearings and Appeals,
arguing the ALJ had incorrectly concluded he had no authority to place Savage
in the Minnesota program. �The division
affirmed, concluding even if Savage could be placed in the program, it was not
a viable alternative to revocation.� The
division administrator ruled:
I am not convinced that the Minnesota Teen Challenge
Program is a viable alternative to the revocation of Mr. Savage�s
Wisconsin probation.� This is true even
if I conclude that he is eligible for admission to the program and that the
requisite approval can be obtained from both Wisconsin and Minnesota
authorities.� His violations are
significant and raise substantial questions about his commitment to supervision
and the appropriateness of continued community supervision.� They suggest that he does not take
supervision seriously and give me little reason to believe that he would
cooperate with supervision in the future or that he would comply with any rules
promulgated by a treatment program.� In
the final analysis, I find that he is simply not a good risk for continued
community supervision.� I also believe
that a continuation of his supervision, even under the terms and conditions
proposed on this appeal, would unduly depreciate the seriousness of these
violations and make a mockery of the probation process.� As a result, I agree with the ultimate
conclusion that the violations justify revocation of his probation and I
sustain the underlying order.
�8������� Savage filed a writ of certiorari with the trial court, which
affirmed the division�s decision.� He
now appeals.
DISCUSSION
�9������� In a review of a decision to revoke probation, we defer to
the decision of the Division of Hearings and Appeals, applying the same
standard as the circuit court.� State
ex rel. Simpson v. Schwarz, 2002 WI App 7, �10, 250 Wis. 2d 214, 640
N.W.2d 527.� Our review is limited to
the following questions: (1) whether the division kept within its jurisdiction;
(2) whether the division acted according to law; (3) whether the division�s
actions were arbitrary, oppressive or unreasonable and represented its will
rather than its judgment; and (4) whether the evidence was such that the
division might reasonably make the decision in question.� Id.�
We may not substitute our judgment for that of the division; we
inquire only whether substantial evidence supports the division�s
decision.� Von Arx v. Schwarz,
185 Wis. 2d 645, 656, 517 N.W.2d 540 (Ct. App. 1994).� If substantial evidence supports the division�s determination, it
must be affirmed even though the evidence may support a contrary determination.� Id.�
�Substantial evidence is evidence that is relevant, credible,
probative, and of a quantum upon which a reasonable fact finder could base a
conclusion.�� Id.
�10����� Savage argues the division erroneously exercised its discretion
and that the result was arbitrary, oppressive and unreasonable.� Specifically, he contends the division
offered no explanation why the Minnesota Teen Challenge Program was not a
feasible alternative to revocation.�� He
correctly notes that in the exercise of its discretion, the division must at
least consider the feasibility and availability of alternatives to revocation,
and these alternatives cannot be rejected without some logical
explanation.� See State ex rel.
Warren v. Schwarz, 211 Wis. 2d 710, 726, 566 N.W.2d 173 (Ct. App.
1997), aff�d, 219 Wis. 2d 615, 579 N.W.2d 698 (1998).�� 
�11����� Savage contends the division�s decision fails to explain its
rejection of the Minnesota Teen Challenge Program and instead was improperly
explained by reasons favoring revocation.�
See Van Ermen v. H&SS Dept., 84 Wis. 2d 57,
64-65, 267 N.W.2d 17 (1978).� He further
argues that an ab initio review of the record, which we are allowed to conduct
if we determine the division erroneously exercised its discretion, would reveal
no basis to support the division�s conclusion there was no viable alternative
to revocation.� See State ex rel.
Macemon v. Christie, 216 Wis. 2d 337, 340-41, 576 N.W.2d 84 (Ct. App.
1998).�� We disagree.
�12����� The division�s decision was reasonable and supported by
substantial evidence.� The district
administrator assumed Savage was eligible for the program and there were no
jurisdictional barriers to his entry.�
He disagreed, however, with the ALJ�s determination that Savage was a
good candidate for the program, and concluded it was not a viable alternative
to revocation for Savage.� The
administrator rejected the program because he determined that Savage�s repeated
probation violations called into question his commitment and ability to cooperate
with community supervision and its applicable rules, something that would be
necessary in the program.� In addition,
the administrator found Savage�s behavior made him a poor risk for continued
community supervision.� These findings
are reasonable in light of the record.
�13����� Further, the division�s decision is supported by substantial
evidence.� The record reveals Savage has
serious drug problems, a lengthy criminal record, and that by his own admission
committed several probation violations and has failed to comply with previous
opportunities for community supervision.�
While we acknowledge the record also presents evidence that Savage is
committed to receiving treatment in the Minnesota Teen Challenge Program, we
must defer to the division�s characterization of the evidence.� See Von Arx, 185
Wis. 2d at 656.� The division
administrator could reasonably conclude the program was not a viable
alternative to Savage�s probation revocation.�
Because we conclude the division�s decision was reasonable and supported
by the evidence, we need not conduct an ab initio review of the record.� See Sweet v. Berge, 113 Wis.
2d 61, 67, 334 N.W.2d 559 (Ct. App. 1983).
