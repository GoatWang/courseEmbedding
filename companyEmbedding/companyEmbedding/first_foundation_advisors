Investment Management | First Foundation Inc.















































Skip to main content











Investment Management








Our investment team follows a disciplined, value based approach that strives to capitalize on stock market inefficiencies with rigorous fundamental research. We take great care in being stewards of capital and in providing our clients with durable portfolios that have favorable risk and reward characteristics.

 Risk Control


Protection of capital is a principal consideration.
Consistency of returns is key.
We define risk differently than most. Volatility is not a risk.
		
Risk is a permanent loss of capital.




 Inefficient Markets


Prices in the short run move for many reasons, including emotional reasons – fear and greed.
Our skilled team seeks to use these inefficiencies:
		
to purchase undervalued assets when others are selling; and
to sell over valued assets when others are buying.




 Valuation Discipline


Paying a fair valuation is more critical than investing in the right assets.
We aim to buy with a margin of safety and sell when that margin has been eroded.
Price is what you pay; value is what you get


 Rigorous Analysis


We conduct in-depth research to make informed investment decisions.
Provides foundation for investment selection even when the decisions are contrarian in nature.
Diligently seeking to identify future opportunities, yet remain patient to realize value over time.
Measure our results using rigorous, third-party standards.


 Partnership


We do business with institutions which share our values.
We focus on listening and collaborating with firms to ensure that we honor their values.


 Stewardship


We represent our profession and ourselves with the integrity as fiduciaries.
Ethics, accountability, and transparency are ingrained in our culture.
We listen, collaborate, and innovate.



Our Approach

 Flexible Open Architecture:
Our flexible open architecture approach allows us to identify which investment options we believe offer powerful and innovative solutions for your situation. This involves developing portfolios that leverage third-party managers along with our internal investment management capabilities. As your needs change, we have the flexibility to change with you, recommending appropriate solutions to meet your financial goals.
 Asset Class Expertise
As we strive to meet your investment objectives, First Foundation Advisors investment management team develops portfolios that use investments in equities, fixed income, and alternatives.
 Measured Results

We believe that we need to track the recommendations we provide our clients, as judging a firm by its investment performance track record is only as good as the reporting standards by which they are measured.
The Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) is a trustworthy and rigorous process that First Foundation follows.
