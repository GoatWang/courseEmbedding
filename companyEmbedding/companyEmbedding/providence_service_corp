Item 8.01 Other Events.
The Providence Service Corporation (the "Company") announced today that its
subsidiary LogistiCare Solutions, LLC ("LogistiCare", which comprises the
Company's NET Services segment ("NET Services")), has been informed by the State
of New Jersey that it intends to award to LogistiCare a contract with the N.J.
Department of Human Services Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services
("NJ DMAHS") to continue providing non-emergency medical transportation
management services to Medicaid-eligible individuals residing in New Jersey. The
contract will have an initial term of five years, as well as three one-year
contract renewal options, each of which must be agreed to by both parties. While
this award may be protested by other bidders, the protest period has ended and
LogistiCare has been notified that no protests have been filed. However, until
the State of New Jersey executes the agreement, there can be no assurance that
LogistiCare will ultimately be awarded the contract.
NET Services derived 13.1% of its total revenue, or $161.1 million, for the year
ended December 31, 2016 from its existing contract with NJ DMAHS.  Under the
renewal contract with NJ DMAHS, NET Services is expected to generate, on
average, approximately $170 million of annual revenue. However, given the
capitated nature of this contract, the actual amount of revenue generated under
this contract in a given year will be ultimately dependent upon the actual
monthly censuses of the Medicaid populations eligible to receive services under
the contract during a given year.  In addition, annual revenue under the renewed
contract may fluctuate based upon certain profitability metrics.
Certain statements in this Current Report on Form 8-K constitute
"forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as "believe," "demonstrate," "expect,"
"estimate," "forecast," "anticipate," "should" and "likely" and similar
expressions identify forward-looking statements. In addition, statements that
are not historical should also be considered forward-looking statements. Readers
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on those forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date the statement was made. Such forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations that involve a number of known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual events to
be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. These factors include, but are not limited to, the Company's
continuing relationship with government entities and our ability to procure
business from them, the Company's ability to manage growing and changing
operations, the implementation of healthcare reform law, government budget
changes and legislation related to the services that the Company provides, the
Company's ability to renew or replace existing contracts that have expired or
are scheduled to expire with significant clients, and other risks detailed in
the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its
Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Company is under no obligation to (and expressly
disclaims any such obligation to) update any of the information in this Current
Report on Form 8-K if any forward-looking statement later turns out to be
inaccurate whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
