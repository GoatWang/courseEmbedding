Gary R. Stevenson (born 1957 or 1958) is an American sports marketing executive.[1] A graduate of Duke University and George Washington University, he helped start The Golf Channel, developed the business plan for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), and launched Pac-12 Networks. He built a consulting firm, OnSport, that crafted the Wachovia Championship and put together the NASCAR Nationwide Series. After 10 years, he sold OnSport to Wasserman Media Group for a reported $25 million. Since 2013, he has been president and managing director of MLS Business Ventures, a division of Major League Soccer. Stevenson has also served as an independent director for Kilroy Realty Corporation, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, since 2014.[2]

Background and education[edit]
Gary Stevenson, the youngest of Robert and Eleanor Stevenson's four children, grew up in Elyria, Ohio, a bedroom community of Cleveland. He graduated from Elyria High School, where he was a two-sport athlete in football and basketball, in 1974.[3] He earned his BA from Duke University and completed an MBA from George Washington University in 1982.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Stevenson started his sports marketing career in Houston in 1980 at ProServ, one of the earliest sports management firms.[6] When two partners in the company, Frank Craighill and Lee Fentress, left in 1983 to form competitor Advantage International, taking about 50 clients with them,[7] Stevenson followed. As vice president in charge of marketing at Advantage International, he developed business opportunities for clients John Elway, John McEnroe, Moses Malone, Hana Mandlíková, and Dan Marino, among others.[6][8]
Golf and basketball[edit]
Stevenson left Advantage International in 1987 for his first in-house role with a sports league, the PGA Tour. There he eventually became executive vice president of business affairs.[4] At the end of 1994, Stevenson moved to The Golf Channel as executive vice president and chief operating officer, responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations.[9] The channel debuted in January 1995, but struggled to get cable systems to carry it. In August it abandoned its original $6.95-a-month subscriber fee for a price structure that allowed cable operators to sell it bundled with basic cable, as part of a tier, or as premium channel at a cost of $3.95 to $6.95 a month.[10] In September, with the channel forecasting a $40 million loss for the year, and its long-term future uncertain, Stevenson resigned to pursue other business opportunities.[11]
In February 1996, David Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), brought Stevenson in as a consultant on two projects, a summer league and a women's league.[12][13] Stevenson co-drafted the original business plan for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), pitched the projects to owners, and, said Stern, was "instrumental in getting the WNBA off the ground".[6] In August, NBA Properties, the marketing arm of the NBA, tapped Stevenson for president of its marketing and media group, located in New York City. For the next year he oversaw marketing, sponsorship, and media sales for the NBA, WNBA, and USA Basketball.[14]
OnSport[edit]
Raleigh, North Carolina businessman Frank Daniels III, a friend of Stevenson since their Duke University undergraduate days, was forming Total Sports, an online sports information venture. He persuaded Stevenson to join its board of directors in May 1997.[6][15]
In August, Stevenson left NBA Properties. He moved his family to Raleigh and parlayed his industry knowledge, experience, and contacts into his own media and sponsorship consultancy.[6] Stevenson and his agency, which eventually settled on the name OnSport, had a reputation for forthrightness. Rick Welts, a colleague of his at the NBA and a partner in the agency before he left to be president and chief operating officer of the Phoenix Suns, said "He's never shy about offering an opinion, even if it's not politically correct".[16] This assessment was echoed by Frank Daniels III, who said, "His great talent is that he is very direct ... He gives recommendations based on what he feels, not what he thinks clients want to hear."[6]
Total Sports, with flat revenues and heavy startup costs, foundered as the dot-com bubble collapsed,[15] but OnSport continued to grow. Casey Wasserman joined as a partner in 2001, then left a year later to found Wasserman Media Group.[17] OnSport's employee count rose to 18 and revenue approached the mid-seven figures in 2004.[16]
OnSport specialized in strategic planning around TV sports rights and sponsorship packages.[16][15] It worked with Stevenson's former employers, the PGA Tour and the NBA, as well as with other sports properties such as Major League Soccer (MLS), the Pac-10 conference, and the U.S. Tennis Association.[16][17] Among its corporate clients were American Express, Coke, Nationwide, and Wachovia. For the latter, OnSport built a PGA Tour event, the Wachovia Championship, from the ground up.[16] OnSport also put together the NASCAR Nationwide Series.[4]
In June 2007, Stevenson sold OnSport to his former partner's company, Wasserman Media Group, reportedly for $25 million.[17] He remained with the combined company until September 2010.[18]
At the same time as running OnSport, Stevenson taught a course on the business of sport at his alma mater, Duke University.[16]
Collegiate sports and soccer[edit]
The collegiate Pac-10 added two schools to become the Pac-12 Conference in July 2011. Later the same month they announced plans to launch a national TV network and six regional cable networks. Commissioner Larry Scott, impressed with what Stevenson had done with OnSport, turned to him in August to head a new subsidiary, Pac-12 Enterprises. It would oversee three companies: Pac-12 Networks, which would be responsible for the national TV network, six regional cable networks, and relationships with existing network partners ESPN and Fox Sports; Pac-12 Digital Network, which would cover streaming, mobile, and internet presence; and Pac-12 Properties, which would handle all sponsorship, licensing and event management.[19]
Stevenson moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to be near Pac-12 headquarters in Walnut Creek.[19][20] The first employee of Pac-12 Enterprises, he assembled a staff of 130.[21] They found 70,000 square feet of space in San Francisco, and by August 2012 built a network studio and offices there (using over 100 different contractors), developed broadcasting infrastructure on 12 campuses, scheduled up to 850 broadcasts for the first year, and negotiated carriage agreements with cable providers that made the content available to 48 million homes at launch.[20][22][23]
In April 2013, eight months after the successful launch of Pac-12's seven networks, Stevenson stepped down.[23] In June, he was named president and managing director of MLS's new business unit, New York-based MLS Business Ventures.[24] There he "oversees the domestic and international commercial business of MLS which includes Soccer United Marketing (SUM), media and broadcasting, digital, club services, marketing, consumer products, special events and content creation and distribution."[4]

Gary R. Stevenson (born 1957 or 1958) is an American sports marketing executive.[1] A graduate of Duke University and George Washington University, he helped start The Golf Channel, developed the business plan for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), and launched Pac-12 Networks. He built a consulting firm, OnSport, that crafted the Wachovia Championship and put together the NASCAR Nationwide Series. After 10 years, he sold OnSport to Wasserman Media Group for a reported $25 million. Since 2013, he has been president and managing director of MLS Business Ventures, a division of Major League Soccer. Stevenson has also served as an independent director for Kilroy Realty Corporation, a publicly traded real estate investment trust, since 2014.[2]

Background and education[edit]
Gary Stevenson, the youngest of Robert and Eleanor Stevenson's four children, grew up in Elyria, Ohio, a bedroom community of Cleveland. He graduated from Elyria High School, where he was a two-sport athlete in football and basketball, in 1974.[3] He earned his BA from Duke University and completed an MBA from George Washington University in 1982.[4][5]
Career[edit]
Stevenson started his sports marketing career in Houston in 1980 at ProServ, one of the earliest sports management firms.[6] When two partners in the company, Frank Craighill and Lee Fentress, left in 1983 to form competitor Advantage International, taking about 50 clients with them,[7] Stevenson followed. As vice president in charge of marketing at Advantage International, he developed business opportunities for clients John Elway, John McEnroe, Moses Malone, Hana Mandlíková, and Dan Marino, among others.[6][8]
Golf and basketball[edit]
Stevenson left Advantage International in 1987 for his first in-house role with a sports league, the PGA Tour. There he eventually became executive vice president of business affairs.[4] At the end of 1994, Stevenson moved to The Golf Channel as executive vice president and chief operating officer, responsible for overseeing day-to-day operations.[9] The channel debuted in January 1995, but struggled to get cable systems to carry it. In August it abandoned its original $6.95-a-month subscriber fee for a price structure that allowed cable operators to sell it bundled with basic cable, as part of a tier, or as premium channel at a cost of $3.95 to $6.95 a month.[10] In September, with the channel forecasting a $40 million loss for the year, and its long-term future uncertain, Stevenson resigned to pursue other business opportunities.[11]
In February 1996, David Stern, the commissioner of the National Basketball Association (NBA), brought Stevenson in as a consultant on two projects, a summer league and a women's league.[12][13] Stevenson co-drafted the original business plan for the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), pitched the projects to owners, and, said Stern, was "instrumental in getting the WNBA off the ground".[6] In August, NBA Properties, the marketing arm of the NBA, tapped Stevenson for president of its marketing and media group, located in New York City. For the next year he oversaw marketing, sponsorship, and media sales for the NBA, WNBA, and USA Basketball.[14]
OnSport[edit]
Raleigh, North Carolina businessman Frank Daniels III, a friend of Stevenson since their Duke University undergraduate days, was forming Total Sports, an online sports information venture. He persuaded Stevenson to join its board of directors in May 1997.[6][15]
In August, Stevenson left NBA Properties. He moved his family to Raleigh and parlayed his industry knowledge, experience, and contacts into his own media and sponsorship consultancy.[6] Stevenson and his agency, which eventually settled on the name OnSport, had a reputation for forthrightness. Rick Welts, a colleague of his at the NBA and a partner in the agency before he left to be president and chief operating officer of the Phoenix Suns, said "He's never shy about offering an opinion, even if it's not politically correct".[16] This assessment was echoed by Frank Daniels III, who said, "His great talent is that he is very direct ... He gives recommendations based on what he feels, not what he thinks clients want to hear."[6]
Total Sports, with flat revenues and heavy startup costs, foundered as the dot-com bubble collapsed,[15] but OnSport continued to grow. Casey Wasserman joined as a partner in 2001, then left a year later to found Wasserman Media Group.[17] OnSport's employee count rose to 18 and revenue approached the mid-seven figures in 2004.[16]
OnSport specialized in strategic planning around TV sports rights and sponsorship packages.[16][15] It worked with Stevenson's former employers, the PGA Tour and the NBA, as well as with other sports properties such as Major League Soccer (MLS), the Pac-10 conference, and the U.S. Tennis Association.[16][17] Among its corporate clients were American Express, Coke, Nationwide, and Wachovia. For the latter, OnSport built a PGA Tour event, the Wachovia Championship, from the ground up.[16] OnSport also put together the NASCAR Nationwide Series.[4]
In June 2007, Stevenson sold OnSport to his former partner's company, Wasserman Media Group, reportedly for $25 million.[17] He remained with the combined company until September 2010.[18]
At the same time as running OnSport, Stevenson taught a course on the business of sport at his alma mater, Duke University.[16]
Collegiate sports and soccer[edit]
The collegiate Pac-10 added two schools to become the Pac-12 Conference in July 2011. Later the same month they announced plans to launch a national TV network and six regional cable networks. Commissioner Larry Scott, impressed with what Stevenson had done with OnSport, turned to him in August to head a new subsidiary, Pac-12 Enterprises. It would oversee three companies: Pac-12 Networks, which would be responsible for the national TV network, six regional cable networks, and relationships with existing network partners ESPN and Fox Sports; Pac-12 Digital Network, which would cover streaming, mobile, and internet presence; and Pac-12 Properties, which would handle all sponsorship, licensing and event management.[19]
Stevenson moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to be near Pac-12 headquarters in Walnut Creek.[19][20] The first employee of Pac-12 Enterprises, he assembled a staff of 130.[21] They found 70,000 square feet of space in San Francisco, and by August 2012 built a network studio and offices there (using over 100 different contractors), developed broadcasting infrastructure on 12 campuses, scheduled up to 850 broadcasts for the first year, and negotiated carriage agreements with cable providers that made the content available to 48 million homes at launch.[20][22][23]
In April 2013, eight months after the successful launch of Pac-12's seven networks, Stevenson stepped down.[23] In June, he was named president and managing director of MLS's new business unit, New York-based MLS Business Ventures.[24] There he "oversees the domestic and international commercial business of MLS which includes Soccer United Marketing (SUM), media and broadcasting, digital, club services, marketing, consumer products, special events and content creation and distribution."[4]

Background

		Mr. Gary R. Stevenson has been the President and Managing Director at MLS Business Ventures at Major League Soccer, LLC since August 2013. Mr. Stevenson oversees the domestic and international commercial business of MLS which includes Soccer United Marketing (SUM), media and broadcasting, digital, club services, marketing, consumer products, special events and content creation and distribution. Mr. Stevenson served as the Principal of Consulting of Wasserman Media Group, ... LLC since June 2007. He founded OnSport, Inc. in 1997 and served as its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman from 1997 to 2007. Mr. Stevenson built his consultancy business into one of the most respected and effective forces in the industry. As part of WMG, he served his clients with a increased capacity to reach global partners and audiences and led its growing consultancy practice. In this role with WMG, Mr. Stevenson has over 25 years of sports and marketing expertise and is widely regarded as one of the most important strategists and leaders in his field. Before OnSport, he served as the President at NBA Properties, Inc. and was responsible for corporate marketing and television revenues for the NBA, WNBA and USA Basketball. In this capacity, Stevenson also was a chief architect of the business plan and launch of the Women’s National Basketball Association in 1996. During his tenure, the NBA was recognized as BrandWeek's Marketer of the Year. Prior to coming to MLS, Mr. Stevenson was President of Pac-12 Enterprises. From 1987 to 1994, Mr. Stevenson propelled growth and innovation at the PGA TOUR as executive vice president of business affairs, where he was responsible for all television and marketing initiatives, including the creation of the TOUR Championship, the President Cup, the Champions TOUR and what is known as the Web.com TOUR today. Mr. Stevenson’s career in sports marketing began in 1980 when he joined the pioneering sports management firm ProServ. He later moved to Advantage International where he served as vice president of marketing from 1983 to 1987, managing the business strategies of many prominent athletes. Prior to the NBA, Mr. Stevenson served as an Executive Vice President of Business Affairs at PGA TOUR, Inc. While there, he managed the revenue generating divisions for the PGA TOUR including broadcasting, PGA TOUR Productions, marketing and promotions, retail licensing, title sponsorship and championship management. Mr. Stevenson played a major role in the creation of the President's Cup, the Nike Tour, the PGA TOUR Partners Program, the Cadillac Series on the Senior Tour, the season-ending TOUR Championship and the PGA TOUR retail licensing division including video games. Previously, at the inception of The Golf Channel, he served as President and Chief Operating Officer and oversaw the launch, brand positioning and daily operations of the channel. Mr. Stevenson was instrumental in The Golf Channel's successful positioning as the sports industry's first niche programming. He has been a Director of Kilroy Realty Corp. since May 23, 2014. Civic engagement and community service are an important part of Mr. Stevenson’s life and he has endowed a permanent scholarship in his hometown of Elyria, Ohio to honor his parents’ service to their community. His civic involvements have included serving on the board of directors for the National Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and on numerous advisory boards at Duke University. He is a retired member of the USGA Executive Committee and served on the President’s Council for the 2014 Men’s and Women’s United States Opens at Pinehurst. He was inducted into The George Washington University School of Business Sports Hall of Fame in April 2013. Mr. Stevenson holds an MBA from George Washington University taught “The Business of Sport” at Duke University from 2000 to 2007 and a BA from Duke University.Read Full Background

I did like learning more about disproving the letter than "disproves" the Shroud, that he was jealous for position, but I already knew the image wasn't made by paint. Overall still great after 40 years, and I still use things in this book to this day. God bless.Read more22 comments|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsTHESE EVANGELICAL AUTHORS SUPPORT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SHROUDBySteven H ProppTOP 100 REVIEWERon September 12, 2013Kenneth Stevenson was, from 1978 to 1981, the official spokesperson for the the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP); he is currently pastor of a church. Gary Habermas (born 1950) is Professor of Apologetics and Philosophy and chairman of the department of philosophy and theology at Liberty University, and is a foremost evangelical apologist who has written many books such as The Case for the Resurrection of Jesus,The Historical Jesus: Ancient Evidence for the Life of Christ, etc.They wrote in the first chapter of this 1981 book, "We wrote this book to provide a serious but popular presentation of the scientific data about the Shroud, as well as carefully researched conclusions about its possible significance... It is the only book about the Shroud which incorporates the results of the scientific testing and analysis conducted since 1978 by the Shroud of Turin Research Project... Both the authors are associated with the team; Stevenson is a full member, and Habermas is a research consultant to it. In addition, the authors lay great stress on the possible significance of the Shroud for a deeper understanding of the Christian faith." (Pg. 11-12)They note, "The complex history of the Shroud of Turin poses a problem for historians. If Christ's burial cloth, imprinted with an image of his crucified body, had survived throughout the centuries, it would have been famous. The Shroud would be the most awesome relic in all of Christian history; one would expect its existence to be well documented. This is not the case. There is little historical record of the existence of Jesus' burial shroud before the mid-fourteenth century." (Pg. 15) They add, "Jeanne de Vergy and other members of the de Charny family never explained how Geoffrey de Charny managed to come into possession of so fabulous a relic..." (Pg. 16)They admit, "The very first question is why the disciples of Jesus would have allowed their Lord's burial shroud to leave their possession. We cannot know for sure, but it is likely that the disciples regarded Jesus' burial garment somewhat differently than we might do today... Anyone who touched it was rendered ritually unclean... In short, Jesus' disciples had good reason not to talk much about his burial shroud; they could have hidden it away carefully." (Pg. 24)Significantly, they point out, "The Shroud has not been dated by means of the carbon-14 dating procedure... Improvements in the technique have made it possible to date small samples of material... Questions have also been raised about the ability of scientists to purify a sample well enough to date it accurately. However, most experts believe these obstacles will eventually be overcome." (Pg. 35-36)They recount that "Ray Rogers, an American chemist employed at Los Alamos National Laboratory... said that if organic molecules, applied naturally or artificially, were responsible for the image on the Shroud, they would have changed color or burned at different rates during the [1532] fire, depending on their distance from the flames. A difference should be noticeable. However, no variation in the intensity of the image can be observed." (Pg. 77)They argue, "Before concluding that the man of the Shroud is Jesus, we must consider the possibility that he is some else... We will now make our own calculations... We have estimated the probability that they happened to someone other than Jesus, deliberately using skeptical and conservative estimates. Yet, multiplying these probabilities, we have 1 chance in 82,944,000 that the man buried in the Shroud is not Jesus... There is no practical possibility that someone other than Jesus Christ was buried in the Shroud of Turin." (Pg. 162, 164, 167-168)This book was "must reading" for persons interested in the Shroud; however, anyone seriously studying the Shroud or reading this book needs to read their book written since the Carbon-14 dating of the Shroud: The Shroud and the Controversy.Read more0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsTHESE EVANGELICAL AUTHORS SUPPORT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THE SHROUDBySteven H ProppTOP 100 REVIEWERon September 12, 2013Kenneth Stevenson was, from 1978 to 1981, the official spokesperson for the the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP); he is currently pastor of a church.

Item Description: Servant Books, 1981. Hardcover. Book Condition: Used; Very Good. Dust Jacket Condition: Very Good. No marks or writing observed in text. Binding tight and square. Gently read. DJ is VG . . . . 'This was one of the first 'Shroud' books and is still an excellent information source. The STURP (Shroud of Turin Research Project) tests were performed in 1978 and so for its time this book was groundbreaking. However, subsequent research has shown that its fundamental conclusion is flawed, which is the idea that the image was caused by some sort of radiation. Nevertheless, it does address and refute a number of explanations commonly offered and those refutations remain valid. The book also discusses the history of the Shroud and contains excellent images.' -- Joseph T. Reinckens II . . . . TOC: xii, 224 pages, [16] pages of plates : illustrations (some color) ; 21 cm Contents: I. Facts about the shroud. The phenomenon of the shroud. The shroud and history. The man buried in the shroud. The New Testament and the shroud. Science and the shroud: pre-1978. Science and the shroud: post-1978 -- II. Conclusions from the facts. Fraud and the shroud. The authenticity of the shroud. Is it Jesus? -- III. The significance of the shroud. The death of Jesus: new insights? The resurrection of Jesus: new evidence? The naturalism-supernaturalism debate. Conclusion: Jesus' burial shroud.  Bookseller Inventory # 49953
