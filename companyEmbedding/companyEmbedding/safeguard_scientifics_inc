FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

T-REX Raises $10M Series B Financing to Enhance Liquidity in Structured Product Markets


November 17, 2016
Platform leverages SaaS analytics and marketplace to increase customer revenue, decrease costs, and mitigate regulatory risk and compliance issues

New York, NY, November 17, 2016 — T-REX Group, Inc. (“T-REX”), a financial services technology company, today announced a $10 million Series B financing. The round was led by Safeguard Scientifics (NYSE:SFE) with $6 million, with participation from existing investor Ecosystem Integrity Fund (EIF). Approximately $3 million of the round has been earmarked for strategic investors. Proceeds will be used to expand product capabilities and scale T-REX’s client development team.
Founded in 2012 and headquartered in New York City, T-REX’s secure, enterprise SaaS-based analytics, risk, and portfolio management platform standardizes and provides transparency to the complex structured products evaluation process, increasing liquidity and creating significant investment opportunities for the hundreds of billions of dollars of capital across various esoteric, non-commoditized asset classes.
“In 2016, we have attained more than 150 end users and established influential industry partnerships, including Morningstar Credit Ratings and Renovate America,” said T-REX Founder and CEO, Benjamin Cohen. “In addition, we have achieved key product milestones and developed a repeatable go-to market strategy that has already helped facilitate hundreds of millions of dollars of new capital for our clients. The T-REX platform increases standardization, promotes efficiency, prioritizes transparency and enhances compliance, all while lowering costs for our customers, which include a global set of investors, bankers, and finance professionals.”
By 2021, the market for structured product analytics tools is expected to exceed $1.4 billion. T-REX is addressing this opportunity by aggressively targeting global financial institutions, asset managers, developers, etc. Today, at major financial institutions, there are fragmented, non-standardized software solutions that are currently being used across the majority of asset classes, giving T-REX a meaningful opportunity to streamline and diversify its initial product offering. As software spend on financial markets infrastructure for structured products increases, additional asset classes will be targeted for development.
“To date, T-REX has demonstrated proof-of-concept in its beachhead markets — solar and Property Assessed Clean Energy (“PACE”) — which we believe is instrumental as the company looks to replicate its technology on a much broader scale,” said Tina Aufiero, Managing Director at Safeguard, who will join T-REX’s Board of Directors. “T-REX was founded with the mission to alleviate critical pain points in building valuation models and enabling more efficient and informed decisions in financing starting in esoteric, non-commoditized asset classes.  With Safeguard’s refined focus on deploying capital in technology-enabled businesses, particularly within financial services, Safeguard recognizes the opportunity to close the gap for financial markets infrastructure and SaaS-based analytics in a rapidly-evolving structured products landscape.” 
About T-REX Group
T-REX is an industry-leading financial services software technology company that specializes in valuation, risk analysis, and structuring tools to unlock investment opportunities for various asset classes. Founded in 2012, T-REX has developed partnerships with some of the leading investment banking institutions. By using T-REX’s secure, proprietary platform, investors, asset managers, and developers are empowered to efficiently and transparently finance, securitize, and manage their assets. For more information, visit www.trexgroup.com or connect with the company on Twitter and LinkedIn.
About Ecosystem Integrity Fund
Ecosystem Integrity Fund (“EIF”) is a sustainability-focused venture capital fund, targeting sectors including renewable energy, green chemistry, and resource efficiency. EIF takes a systems-based approach to sustainability investment, primarily investing in more capital-efficient opportunities than the typical clean technology fund. EIF seeks out niches within “cleantech” that have not received the investor attention they deserve, resulting in better investment opportunities and greater impact with less capital. EIF believes small venture funds are better aligned with client interests and ensure a more disciplined approach to investment. For more information, visit ecosystemintegrity.com.

Safeguard Scientifics (NYSE:SFE) provides capital and relevant expertise to fuel the growth of technology-driven businesses in healthcare, financial services and digital media. Safeguard targets companies that are capitalizing on the next wave of enabling technologies with a particular focus on the Internet of Everything, enhanced security and artificial intelligence, which includes predictive analytics and machine learning. Safeguard typically deploys between $5 million and $25 million over the course of its partnership with a company, initially investing in a Series A or B Round and opportunistically in a Seed Round.

Our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, among others, our ability to make good decisions about the deployment of capital, the fact that our partner companies may vary from period to period, our substantial capital requirements and absence of liquidity from our partner company holdings, fluctuations in the market prices of our publicly traded partner company holdings, competition, our inability to obtain maximum value for our partner company holdings, our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, market valuations in sectors in which our partner companies operate, our inability to control our partner companies, our need to manage our assets to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and risks associated with our partner companies, including the fact that most of our partner companies have a limited history and a history of operating losses, face intense competition and may never be profitable, the effect of economic conditions in the business sectors in which Safeguard's partner companies operate, and other uncertainties described in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many of these factors are beyond the Company's ability to predict or control. As a result of these and other factors, the Company's past financial performance should not be relied on as an indication of future performance.

Radnor, PA, April 27, 2017 — Safeguard Scientifics, Inc. (NYSE:SFE) today announced financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as well as continued achievement of developmental milestones for its 28 partner companies. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, Safeguard's net loss was $22.1 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with a net loss of $15.5 million, or $0.76 per share, for the same period in 2016.
"Safeguard's key objective for 2017 is to increase the number of exit transactions at meaningful cash-on-cash returns to drive shareholder value," said Stephen T. Zarrilli, Safeguard President and CEO. "We continue to build momentum and value in our partner companies. We believe there are a number of additional opportunities for further value creation events this year."
FIRST QUARTER 2017 HIGHLIGHTS
