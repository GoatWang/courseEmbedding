(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other reports filed by Source Financial, Inc. ("we," "us," "our," or the "Company") from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") contain or may contain forward-looking statements (collectively the "Filings") and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company's management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company's management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the filings, the words "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "expect," "future," "intend," "plan," or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company's management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.  Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments, and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments, and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments, and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management's judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management's judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  Our Business  On June 30, 2016, Source Financial, Inc. ("Source Financial" or "the Company") entered into a Share Exchange Agreement with Venture Track. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Venture Track agreed to exchange 100% of its outstanding common stock for 3,089,360 shares of common stock and 4,500 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), of Source Financial. The 4,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into 6,893,100 shares of the Company's common stock, at the rate of 1,531.80 per share. The share exchange is accounted for as a reverse merger with Venture Track being the accounting acquirer as it retained control of Source Financial, Inc. after the exchange. Source Financial is the legal parent company; the share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of Venture Track.  Venture Track, Inc. was originally incorporated in the state of Delaware in February 2014 as Songstress, Inc. On May 13, 2015, the Company changed its name to Scoocher, Inc. and then to Venture Track, Inc. in February 2016.  The Company is focused on app development and deployment and intends to offer an innovation accelerator program (the "Venture Track Program") designed to provide early-stage technology companies (the "Innovators") with bridge loans, support in all areas of business development, and access to equity crowdfunding as designated under the JOBS Act.  The Company was founded by Edward C. DeFeudis, a serial entrepreneur and venture investor, with 20-plus years of experience in the financial industry. Since 1995, he has helped launch numerous private and public companies, including Wiki Technologies, Inc., and has received major financing commitments to help fund companies, startups and product launches. WikiTechnologies, Inc. is a technology company dedicated to making financial transactions simple, secure, social and affordable. WikiTechnologies is comprised of (i) WikiPay(R), a Money Services Business, that provides a simple, low-cost alternative to existing mobile and online money transfer and payment solutions; and (ii) WikiLoan(R), a low-cost peer-to-peer lending solution. The apps use industry-leading privacy and payment security systems. Throughout his career, Mr. DeFeudis has primarily been engaged in the development of strategic partnerships and financial strategies.  Through the Company, Mr. DeFeudis is leveraging his experience and resources in capital markets and Internet marketing to provide an innovative accelerator program and crowdfunding platform for early-stage disruptive technology companies.  The Company focuses on financing, developing, and deploying apps. We own www.scoocher.com, an online content monetization engine, and have an additional app in development. The Company's initial focus is to develop and deploy these apps as in-house projects ("Phase 1").  The Company recognizes the unique opportunity that exists in today's app market. There are thousands of apps that have been financed, built and deployed, but the founders of these apps do not possess the wherewithal to market the apps successfully. In many cases, the apps are available for sale at a fraction of the development cost. It is the Company's intention to identify, purchase and deploy select apps with the greatest market potential ("Phase 2").  The Venture Track Program first aims to fund the launch of revenue ready Innovators through bridge loans. Then the Venture Track Program aims to market the apps, determine the true customer acquisition cost, fine-tune their projections and use of proceeds, and set them on a track for a public offering facilitated through equity crowdfunding. We intend to provide office space to Innovators with receptionist coverage, mail services, conference rooms, as well as access to on-site legal and accounting, advertising and marketing services, networking events, investor presentations, business plan competitions, and more ("Phase 3").  Spin-Out Transaction  On June 30, 2016 (the "Closing Date"), prior to the merger with Venture Track, Inc., Source Financial, Inc. entered into that certain Share Exchange Agreement (the "Moneytech Agreement") by and among Source Financial, Moneytech Group Pty Ltd., an Australian Corporations ("Moneytech") and certain shareholders of Source Financial. Pursuant to the terms of the Moneytech Agreement, Moneytech acquired from Source Financial all of the outstanding shares and equity interests in Moneytech Limited and mPayments Pty Ltd., as well as its 95% equity interests in Moneytech POS Pty Ltd. and its 37.5% equity interests in 360 Markets Pty Ltd. (collectively, the "Moneytech Entities" and the shares and equity interests of the Moneytech Entities are referred to herein as the "Moneytech Interests"), in exchange for the return to Source Financial 6,076,679 shares of Source Financial's common stock from certain stockholders of Source Financial (the "Spin-Out Stockholders") and 5,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of Source Financial. In connection with the transaction, Moneytech issued to the Spin-Out Stockholders one fully paid ordinary shares in the capital of Moneytech as consideration for every one share of Source Financial's common stock returned by the Spin-Out Stockholders.  As a result, the Moneytech Entities become subsidiaries of Moneytech and Source Financial has no further relationship with the Moneytech Entities. Immediately after the transaction, an aggregate of 6,076,679 shares of the Company's common stock and 5,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock were cancelled, and a total of 2,714,957 shares of the Company's common stock were still outstanding. In addition, stock options to purchase 3,750,000 shares of the Company's common stock were relinquished immediately prior to closing and after the closing; the Company has outstanding stock options to purchase 25,000 shares of the Company's common stock.  In connection with the transaction, Hugh Evans resigned as the President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company. Brian M. Pullar resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Klaus Selinger and John Wolfgang resigned from the director position with the Company. Effective on the same date, Edward C. DeFeudis was appointed as the President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company.  Share Exchange Transaction  On June 30, 2016, Source Financial entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with Venture Track, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Venture Track") and the shareholders of Venture Track (the "Venture Track Shareholders"). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, Source Financial agreed to exchange the outstanding common stock of Venture Track held by the Venture Track Shareholders for 3,089,360 shares of common stock and 4,500 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"), of the Company. The 4,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into 6,893,100 shares of the Company's common stock, at the rate of 1,531.80 per share.  The share exchange is accounted for as a reverse merger with Venture Track being the accounting acquirer as it retained control of Source Financial, Inc. after the exchange. Although Source Financial is the legal parent company, the share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of Venture Track. As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, Venture Track becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  Immediately after the transaction, the Company had 5,804,317 shares of common stock and 4,500 shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. We are now a holding company engaging in app development and deployment, as well as to provide innovative accelerator program for start-up companies.  Binding Memorandum of Understanding  On September 20, 2016, the Company entered into a Binding Memorandum of Understanding (the "MOU") with CSES Group, Inc. ("Alltemp") and William Lopshire and Kjell Nesen, solely as officers of Alltemp (collectively, are herein referred to as the "Parties" and each, individually, is a "Party").  Pursuant to the terms of the MOU, the Company will provide a minimum of $250,000 in bridge loans ("Bridge Loans") to Alltemp. The Bridge Loans shall be evidenced by a demand convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $250,000 (the "Note") bearing interest only at a rate of 10% per annum, interest payable quarterly commencing on January 15, 2016. In the event the merger is not consummated by the date the first quarterly payment is due (January 15, 2017), or in the event that the MOU is terminated by the Company pursuant to the terms as stated therein, Alltemp has agreed to issue common stock in Alltemp to the Company upon the Company's request equal to five percent (5%) of Alltemp's then issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis at the time of exercise. Upon exercise of this right by the Company, the Note shall be canceled.  The Parties intend to promptly begin negotiating to reach a written definitive agreement, subject to the approval of each Party's board of directors, containing comprehensive representations, warranties, indemnities, conditions and agreements by the Parties. In the event the Parties fail to reach a final binding written agreement within thirty days of the date of the MOU, the MOU shall remain in effect, except that all further advances under the Bridge Loan, or otherwise, shall be in the Company's sole discretion and the Company shall not be obligated to proceed with the merger, although the Company may elect to do so. The MOU was extended until November 19, 2016 and remains in effect.  The obligation of the Company to fully fund the Bridge Loan and to complete other obligations required under the MOU is subject to completion of a due diligence review of Alltemp, its assets and business. Upon satisfactory completion of the Company's due diligence investigation, the Parties will collaboratively act to adopt and execute a Plan of Merger for the two corporate entities.  CSES Group has developed a proprietary refrigerant technology after years of research and development called alltemp(R). alltemp(R) is a proven replacement for many worldwide refrigerants that have detrimentally affected the global environment. CSES Group's alltemp(R) refrigerants are environmentally friendly, sustainable and cost-efficient energy solutions for the residential and commercial marketplace. alltemp(R) refrigerants have broad applications ranging from Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning ("HVAC"), refrigeration, and foam insulation to industrial solvents. alltemp(R) is the ideal solution for replacement of HCFC-22, better known as R-22, which is the world's most commonly used refrigerant, R-410a, R-134a and R-404a. R-22 is rapidly being phased out in all developed countries due to environmental concerns over its strong effect on the depletion of the Earth's ozone layer.  Plan of Operation  If the Company does not consummate the merger with CSES, Inc., we intend to continue to follow the short term business goals:  ? Raise capital to fund operations and provide bridge loans;  ? Attract high-performing talent; and  ? Finance high performance/profile Innovators that grow our brand and bottom-line.  We have the following long-term goals for our business operations:  ? Build our brand to become a market leader;  ? Leverage partners that allow us to provide more value than peers; and  ? Continuously innovate to deliver value to our customers.  We intend to establish a culture recognized for excellence, attract high performing team members and execution will be the foundation of which we will grow our company.  In order to move forward it is critical that we raise capital to fund our operations. Raising capital is our primary goal and we are focusing most of our attention to identify prospective investors and strategic partners.  If we do not obtain additional funding, we will continue to operate on a reduced budget until such time as more capital is raised.  We are focused on securing $2-6 million in financing, which would accelerate our business plan and allow us to hire up to 6 to 8 more staff members, increase our office space and operations, and increase our advertising and marketing budget, all of which would directly affect the performance and business operation of the company.  Results of Operation  Comparison for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  Revenues  The Company did not generate any revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Operating Expenses  Our expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of general and administrative expenses in the amount of $153,692 and 6,087, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to legal and accounting fees and $108,000 loss on settlement.  Net Loss  We are currently operating at a loss and we have a net loss of $153,999 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $9,357 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the $108,000 loss on settlement.  Comparison for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  Revenues  The Company did not generate any revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Operating Expenses  Our expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 consisted of general and administrative expenses in the amount of $167,987 and $11,475, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to legal and accounting fees and $108,000 loss on settlement.  Net Loss  We are currently operating at a loss and we have a net loss of $168,624 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $20,745 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was primarily due to the $108,000 loss on settlement.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital September 30, 2016 December 31, 2015 Current Assets $ 214,818 $ 452 Current Liabilities (385,191 ) - Working Capital (Deficiency) $ (170,373 ) $ 452  Current assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to September 30, 2015 primarily due to convertible note receivable of $200,000.  Current liabilities for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to September 30, 2015 primarily due to increased accounts payable and convertible notes of $250,000.  Cash Flows Nine months Nine months Ended Ended September 30, 2016 September 30, 2015 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $ (53,958 ) $ (11,475 ) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities (203,256 ) (4,000 ) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 266,580 15,080 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash $ 9,366 $ (395 )  Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  Our cash used in operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $53,958 as compared to $11,475 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase is attributable to legal and accounting fees.  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  Our cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $203,256 as compared to $4,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase is attributable to convertible notes receivable.  Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  Our cash provided by financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $266,580 as compared to $15,080 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. The increase is attributable to convertible notes payable.  Going Concern  At September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $278,952 and incurred a net loss of $168,624 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. We have generated minimal revenues and have incurred losses since inception. We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Nov 17, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited and unaudited financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this Report that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.  Overview  Upon completion of the merger with CSES, the business overview is highly probably to change.  The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Venture Track, focuses on identifying, financing, developing, and deploying technology. We own www.scoocher.com, an online content monetization engine and we have a definitive agreement in place to merge with CSES Group, Inc., owner and producer of Alltemp(R), an eco-friendly refrigerant replacement for R-22, 410a and others. The Company's initial focus is to finalize the merger with CSES Group, and continues to develop and deploy the Scoocher app as an in-house project ("Phase 1").  The Company recognizes the unique opportunity that exists in today's app market. There are thousands of apps that have been financed, built and deployed, but the founders of these apps do not possess the wherewithal to market the apps successfully. In many cases, the apps are available for sale at a fraction of the development cost. It is the Company's intention to identify, purchase and deploy select apps with the greatest market potential ("Phase 2").  The Venture Track Program first aims to fund the launch of revenue ready apps and start-ups ("Innovators") through bridge loans. Then the Venture Track Program aims to market the apps, determine the true customer acquisition cost, fine-tune their projections and use of proceeds, and set them on a track for a public offering facilitated through equity crowdfunding ("Phase 3").  The Venture Track Program  The Company intends on offering a three-phase, two-year program, for revenue ready Innovators. The three stages are: 1) Market Preparation, 2) Public Crowdfunding, and 3) Graduation.  In order for Innovators to be accepted into the program, each must: 1) solve an obvious problem or make an existing solution much more efficient; 2) be scalable; 3) have a focused team; and 4) be ready to generate revenue with a small capital infusion.  We are seeking to accept 29 Innovators into the program over the course of our first three (3) years: five (5) Innovators in year one (1), eight (8) in year two (2), and sixteen (16) in year three (3).  Source Financial will receive approximately 10-30% seed-stage sweat-equity in each Innovator, a portion of which may be distributed as dividends to shareholders based upon rules to be determined by the Board of Directors.  Investment capital offered by the Company in the Market Preparation stage shall be in the form of a 506c Regulation A+ offering and bridge loan. The bridge loan amount is expected average $200,000, which shall be used by Innovators for general operating, legal, accounting, advertising, marketing expenses related to filing a Regulation A+ offering.  Upon approval of the Regulation A+ offering, the Innovator will move to the Public Crowdfunding stage. We will advertise and market the offering to the public through equity crowdfunding, primarily to accredited investors, angels, venture capital firms, and broker dealers. The Regulation A+ registration statement will offer a maximum of $50,000,000 in equity to investors. We will retain the first right to sell its holdings in the Regulation A+ offering.  Upon the completion of the Regulation A+ offering, the Innovator will move to the Graduation stage. In this stage, we will continue to mentor the Innovator to manage its growth and begin the process of introducing the company to 1) registered broker dealers with the intent of uplisting the Innovator to a national exchange, 2) strategic acquirers and/or merger candidates, and 3) strategic buyers.  Target Market  Our target market is focused on early-stage technology companies that are seeking funding, business development, and access to equity crowdfunding as designated under the JOBS Act.  Revenue Sources  We plan on generating most of our revenue from the Venture Track Program as set forth above.  We plan on revamping the Venturetrack.net website within the next few months.  Competition  Today, incubators and accelerators are a fixture in the tech community and there are more than 200 programs across the US. We are unique, and are keenly focused on leveraging the opportunities offered under the JOBS Act to bring Innovators to market as fast as possible.  The incubators and accelerators industry is highly competitive, and continues to evolve as a result of changes in regulation, technology, product delivery systems, and the general market and economic climate. Our competitors include other incubators and accelerators, banks, debt funds and specialty and diversified financial services intermediaries that offer lending, leasing, payments, investment, foreign currency exchange, advisory and other financial products and services to our target client base. We also compete with other lenders, such as "marketplace" lenders, peer-to-peer lenders and other non-traditional lenders that have merged in recent years. In addition, we compete with hedge funds and private equity funds. The principal competitive factors in our markets include product offerings, service, pricing, and transaction size and structure.  There are many companies who compete directly with our products and services, for example, AngelPad, MuckerLab, TechStars and StartX, etc. These companies may already have an established market in our industry. Most of these companies have significantly greater financial and other resources than us and have been developing their products and services longer than we have been developing ours. Additionally, there are no significant barriers to entry in our industry and new companies may be created that will compete with us and other, more established companies who do not now directly compete with us, may choose to enter our markets and compete with us in the future.  Intellectual Property  Domain Names  Source Financial owns various domain names, including but not limited to www.scoocher.com and www.venturetrack.net.  Patent  Source Financial filed a patent on its Scoocher platform technology with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on March 19, 2014. The application is currently pending.  Plan of Operation  If the Company does not consummate the merger with CSES, Inc., we intend to continue to implement the following business goals:  ? Raise capital to fund operations and provide bridge loans;  ? Attract high-performing talent; and  ? Finance high performance/profile Innovators that grow our brand and bottom-line.  We have the following long-term goals for our business operations:  ? Build our brand to become a market leader;  ? Leverage partners that allow us to provide more value than peers; and  ? Continuously innovate to deliver value to our customers.  We intend to establish a culture recognized for excellence, attract high performing team members and execution will be the foundation of which we will grow our company.  In order to move forward it is critical that we raise capital to fund our operations. Raising capital is our primary goal and we are focusing most of our attention to identify prospective investors and strategic partners.  If we do not obtain additional funding, we will continue to operate on a reduced budget until such time as more capital is raised.  We are focused on securing $2-6 million in financing, which would accelerate our business plan and allow us to hire up to 6 to 8 more staff members, increase our office space and operations, and increase our advertising and marketing budget, all of which would directly affect the performance and business operation of the company.  Results of Operations  Comparison for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015  Revenues  The Company did not generate any revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.  Operating Expenses  Our expenses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted of general and administrative expenses in the amount of $511,557 and $10,740, respectively. The increase in general and administrative expenses is attributable to legal and accounting fees of $54,202, stock-based compensation of $325,246 and $108,000 loss on settlement.  Net Loss  We are currently operating at a loss and we have a net loss of $516,176 for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $18,538 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in net loss was primarily due to legal and accounting fees of $54,202, stock-based compensation of $325,246 and $108,000 loss on settlement.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Working Capital December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015 Current Assets $ 288,979 $ 452 Current Liabilities (636,612 ) - Working Capital (Deficiency) $ (347,633 ) $ 452  Current assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to convertible note receivable of $250,000.  Current liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to convertible notes of $350,000 and stock payable of $264,536.  Cash Flows Year Year Ended Ended December December 31, 2016 31, 2015 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities $ (96,326 ) $ (10,066 ) Net Cash Used in Investing Activities (253,255 ) - Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 364,775 10,000 Net Increase (Decrease) in Cash $ 15,194 $ (66 )  Net Cash Used in Operating Activities  Our cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $96,326 as compared to $10,066 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to accounting fees of $31,479 and legal of $22,723.  Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  Our cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $253,255 as compared to $0 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to the investment in convertible notes receivable of $250,000.  Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities  Our cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $364,775 as compared to $10,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase is attributable to the issuance of convertible notes payable $350,000.  Going Concern  At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $626,504 and incurred a net loss of $516,176. We have generated no revenues and have incurred losses since inception. We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  As of December 31, 2016, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Policies  We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our management periodically evaluates the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different assumptions or conditions.  The methods, estimates, and judgment we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The SEC has defined "critical accounting policies" as those accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based upon this definition, our most critical estimates relate to the fair value of warrant liabilities, impairment of long-lived assets, commitments and contingencies, and revenue recognition. We also have other key accounting estimates and policies, but we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective, or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period. For additional information see Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available, and actual results may differ significantly from these estimates.

The Source Manifesto: Feeling Financially Inspired.
	        The single biggest shift you will make on the journey to Financial Freedom.


This isn’t about perfection.
This isn’t about getting it ‘right’ or ‘wrong.’
This is a purposeful, emotional shift.
A shift from anxiety to excitement for what’s to come. From being overwhelmed to feeling prepared.


It is the liberation of moving from ‘I Can’t’ to ‘I’m Ready.’
The empowerment to move from being ashamed to taking control.
It is the realization that because you haven’t been in financial control doesn’t mean you can’t be fiscally savvy.
The commitment to education and gaining confidence through knowledge.


The ability to care for your money…as well as you care for people.
Financial inspiration is an energy, a passion, and a creative mindset. It is the transformative tool that brings clarity to what once felt outof reach.
It is the incredible force that will power you through the enormous responsibility you feel to shelter your money when faced with important financial choices and personal decisions.
This is not your father’s money management. This is not your husband’s money management. This is your financial freedom.



Inspiration is everywhere.
In fact…we built a business dedicated to it.
And to you.
--- Source Financial Advisors. Your Source of Inspiration.

Delivering the Best


BETTER SERVICE… IT MATTERS
BRANCH TRANSFORMATION

We’ve all heard it… Bank branches are coming to an end. Despite what some may think, study after study
has proven this notion is simply not true. Although branch traffic may be declining, the presence of
branches is still vital to the process of acquiring new customers. In a recent study by CFI Group, the
number one reason consumers cited for choosing their current financial services provider was
convenience in branch location. That being said, Financial Institutions (FIs) must recognize the
importance of having a strong, well-run branch presence. Though customers may not visit brick-and-
mortar locations as much as they have in the past, due to the rise of web-based and digitally-enhanced
banking, the experience they have when they do visit is crucial to ensuring satisfaction and loyalty. The
perplexing question remains… How do FIs keep current customers engaged, while attracting new (and
younger) customers? The answer… Branch Transformation. Branch transformation is more than a simple
adjustment to the look and feel of your branches. It’s all about discovering how your institution is different
from the one across the street, and leveraging these differences to better serve your clients through your
products and solutions. Branch transformation is a long-term commitment that involves not only a physical
makeover, but a behind the scenes technology transformation as well. It may sound complicated, but in
order to remain competitive in your market, branch transformation is essential for long-term success.
NuSource has the tools to help you through the branch transformation process.
THE ATM EXPERTS

We are your local ATM experts, offering solutions that fit your specific desires. At NuSource, we
understand the constantly changing ATM world, your ever-changing business needs and offer our
customized, personal touch approach to every relationship. For nearly 20 years, we have focused on
providing our customers ATMs of the highest quality, at competitive prices. In an industry that is
continually evolving, we look for ATM solutions that deliver advanced security and innovative features.
With years of experience, our certified technicians will service “Any ATM, Anytime, Anywhere.” Our ATM
technicians are trained at the highest levels and hit the field each day with the expectation of fixing your
ATM on the first visit. Additionally, our dispatch department is available 24 hours, 7 days a week,
ensuring rapid response time if your ATM channel is ever awry. Keeping your ATM network running at its
optimal condition is of utmost importance to the experts at NuSource Financial. NuSource services all
major ATM brands including Nautilus Hyosung, NCR, Diebold, Triton, Wincor, GRG, and more. Providing
our customers quality multi-vendor ATM solutions and maintenance services, as well as leading-edge
technology, are top of mind for NuSource Financial.
ATM MANAGED SERVICES

As new technology hits the market and compliance standards continue to evolve, the cost of owning an
ATM is on a steady incline. The gradually increasing complexity of the ATM channel has amplified over
time and this is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. Due to these factors and many more,
the industry is transitioning into a Managed Services – Outsourcing – environment. ATM Outsourcing
allows Financial Institutions (FIs) to hand over the reins of their ATM channel to the experts. Managed
Services Partners provide scale and focus that a single FI cannot match on its own. They deliver the
infrastructure and skills required to maintain an ATM network because ATMs are their core business, not
a sideline and necessary nuisance. Owning and managing ATM operations can be stressful, time
consuming and expensive for any Financial Institution. Why not eliminate the headache and let an expert
take control? NuSource Financial’s “Freedom ATM Program” was designed to eliminate the many
challenges of ATM ownership for our customers. We custom tailor the program based on a common
sense approach to ATM Outsourcing, allowing us to meet the individual needs of each FI we work with.
Our Freedom ATM Program takes care of various operational and service burdens, including hardware
maintenance, software upgrades, cash replenishment, supplies and daily operations. While we
concentrate on upkeep, uptime, return on investment and delivering continual improvements to the ATM
channel, our customers can put their focus back on gaining market share and a competitive advantage.
ATM SECURITY SOLUTIONS
Increased skimming attacks, evolving malware, what’s next? It seems your ATM channel is facing threats
from every direction. Fraud at the ATM is on the rise, and the losses associated with it continue to
escalate. According to FICO, a credit scoring and analytics firm, criminals are stealing card data from
ATMs in the United States at the highest rate in two decades. From January 1 to April 9, 2015, FICO
tracked such incidents through its Card Monitoring Services for financial institutions (FIs), which
represents more than 65% of all U.S. debit cards. Debit card compromises at ATMs located on bank
property jumped 174% from January to April, compared to the same period the year prior. Furthermore,
successful attacks at non-bank machines soared by 317%, as recorded by FICO. These incidents come
as FIs are racing to issue new chip-enabled credit and debit cards that will make it more difficult for
thieves to create counterfeits. Despite ongoing efforts to speed up EMV migration, it will be some time
until the U.S. is completely EMV-ready. Between distributing chip-enabled cards to the general population
and upgrading or installing new equipment that is EMV-compliant, there is still a lot of work to be done.
Criminals in the U.S. have recognized this and are taking their last shot at ATM cashout opportunities via
counterfeited cards and stolen PINs. When it comes to ensuring security at the ATM, Financial Institutions
need to familiarize themselves with current threats in the market, and implement forward-thinking
strategies to prevent compromises. NuSource offers a suite of Security Solutions that beat fraud at the
ATM including Anti-Skimming Protection, Anti-Malware Solutions, and Patch Management Services.
SECURITY SOLUTIONS

At NuSource, we believe customers are at the core of every Financial Institution’s purpose. In this belief,
we recognize the need to provide security solutions that help FIs better protect and serve their customers.
A Financial Institution’s success is dependent on the quality of equipment they have in place. Be it
pneumatics, under-counter steel, vaults, and safe deposit boxes, or surveillance systems, access control
or alarms, both your employees and customers are seeing and using these security solutions on a daily
basis. For that reason, it is imperative to provide equipment that can be relied on. Because we are
dedicated to offering best-in-class products to our customers, we have partnered with the most
experienced and renowned banking equipment manufacturers in the market today.
DELIVERING THE BEST

From the start, having the right team has been imperative to our success. Our team comes from a variety
of backgrounds and expertise, ensuring that our customers are constantly delivered the best and most
efficient service in the industry. At NuSource, finding the right individuals to take care of our valued
customers is a top priority. What began as five employees providing regional services to Minnesota and
its surrounding states has evolved exponentially over the past 17+ years. We now have territory coverage
in 20 states and our team consists of over 80 highly-specialized and motivated employees. At NuSource,
our growth is service-based and customer-focused. High contract renewal rates and geographic
expansion are evidence of our customer appreciation and quality of service. When it comes to taking care
of our customers, we’re serious about providing the best services available in the markets we serve.
Through a combination of quality products, outstanding customer service and a commitment to
excellence, over 99% of our clients renew their business with us each year.

ATM Managed Services





ATM Managed Services







ATM Managed Services
In a recent study by Aite Group, 73% of bank executives indicated that managing their operations was their greatest challenge, and 31% said that it’s important or extremely important to outsource ATM operations.
Do you agree?
As new technology hits the market and compliance standards continue to evolve, the cost of owning an ATM is on a steady incline. The gradually increasing complexity of the ATM channel has amplified over time and this is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. Due to these factors and many more, the industry is transitioning into a Managed Services – Outsourcing – environment. ATM Outsourcing allows Financial Institutions (FIs) to hand over the reins of their ATM channel to the experts. Managed Services Partners provide scale and focus that a single FI cannot match on its own. They deliver the infrastructure and skills required to maintain an ATM network because ATMs are their core business, not a sideline and necessary nuisance. Owning and managing ATM operations can be stressful, time consuming and expensive for any Financial Institution. Why not eliminate the headache and let an expert take control? NuSource Financial’s “Freedom ATM Program” was designed to eliminate the many challenges of ATM ownership for our customers. We custom tailor the program based on a common sense approach to ATM Outsourcing, allowing us to meet the individual needs of each FI we work with. Our Freedom ATM Program takes care of various operational and service burdens, including hardware maintenance, software upgrades, cash replenishment, supplies and daily operations. While we concentrate on upkeep, uptime, return on investment and delivering continual improvements to the ATM channel, our customers can put their focus back on gaining market share and a competitive advantage.
Why Outsource?
For today’s ATM consumers, convenience and efficiency are of utmost importance. Although the ATM channel is widely used and highly valued by consumers, it is often neglected or loosely managed. The cost of owning an ATM is on the rise as new technology hits the market and compliance standards continue to evolve. The gradually increasing complexity of the transaction delivery channel has amplified over time and this is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. Due to these factors, and many more, the industry is transitioning into a Managed Services environment in order to eliminate some of the hassle. Managed Services help improve customer interactions, reduce operational and service costs, generate revenue and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the self-service channel.
Top Five Reasons to Consider Our Managed Services:
REDUCED OPERATING COSTS
Outsourcing to an expert gives you best-in-class service at an affordable monthly fee. While the outsourcing company focuses solely on your ATM fleet, FIs are able to take advantage of collective buying power, which dramatically reduces operating costs.
LESS STRESS ON BACK OFFICE RESOURCES
The way customers interact with Financial Institutions is undergoing a fundamental change. With the proliferation of internet, mobile devices, smartphones, tablets and social media, branch banking is now facing competition like never before. Based on cardholder trends, it is quite likely your financial institution is focusing heavily on developing mobile applications and other online banking tools. With so much money and effort going into these digitally-enhanced strategies, resources to manage ATMs and related concerns, such as EMV, PCI-DSS compliance standards, ADA regulations, Windows 7 migration and software integration, becomes very limited. This is where ATM outsourcing can save you time and money. With the headaches of ATM management and regulation out of sight and mind, your back office staff can focus on developing programs that will allow your institution to attract new customers.
IMPROVED CUSTOMER SERVICE
Providing superior financial services to customers is at the core of every FI’s purpose. Although ATMs play a huge role in customer satisfaction, this service is only a fraction of what your financial institution delivers in quality programs. Managing you ATM operations does not have to be an extra burden for your front line staff. By outsourcing your ATMs, your staff can focus on what really matters – providing the best service possible.
FEWER REGULATORY COMPLIANCE HEADACHES
With ATM fraud in the U.S. costing an estimated $1 billion, and with EMV and PCI deadlines on the horizon, enhanced ATM security and regulatory compliance is more important than ever before. One of the greatest benefits of ATM outsourcing is your institution’s ability to eliminate its responsibility in these areas. Keeping ATMs PCI-DSS compliant is a task many Financial Institutions are having a difficult time tackling. Additionally, new viruses, zero-day malware, targeted attacks, persistent threats and other forms of malicious software are attacking the ATM channel every day. Remove the headaches of fraud and regulatory compliance by outsourcing your ATMs.
ACCESS TO TOP-DRAWER ATM CAPABILITIES
The top ATM outsourcing companies use customized services that improve the daily management of ATMs. These services might include ATM transaction processing and reconciliation; maintenance alerts; vault cash forecasting and management; surcharge-free network access; and state-of-the-art ATM marketing that can expand your brand and increase consumer awareness. When you outsource your ATMs, you gain access to these tools for a fraction of the cost it would take to develop them in-house or purchase them through expensive run-of-the-mill platforms.
Key Benefits of the Freedom ATM Program

Reduces operational overhead and servicing costs
Protects against supplementary costs associated with PCI-DSS compliance
Allows FIs to keep surcharge income
Improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the self-service channel
