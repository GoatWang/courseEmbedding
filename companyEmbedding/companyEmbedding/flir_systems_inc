History[edit]
FLIR took its name from the acronym for forward-looking Infrared.[4] The company began in 1978 with airborne IR systems, and developed from 1978 to 2004 through product development and acquisitions of related companies.[5] Originally based in Tigard, Oregon,[6] the company relocated to Portland in the mid-1990s.[7] FLIR teamed up with Hughes Aircraft Company in 1990, with Hughes taking part ownership of FLIR.[6]
The company became publicly traded in a June 1993 IPO[8] which raised $11.5 million for the company with shares offered at $12.50.[9] In 1994, the company had grown to sales of $47 million annually.[7] The next year, J. Kenneth Stringer III was named as president of the company.[7] The company bought Sweden's Agema Infrared System in 1997,[10] which doubled the size of the company.[11] Acquisitions continued the following year when they purchased Inframetrics Inc. of Massachusetts for $48 million.[12]
The company's president and chief executive officer Kenneth Stringer III was fired by the board of directors in May 2000 due to errors in the company's accounting practices.[13] In September 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued FLIR over accounting irregularities.[14] The next year, three executives at the company were charged with fraudulent accounting related to the SEC case that included claims of inflated sales.[14] Sales at FLIR grew to $311 million in fiscal year 2003.[15] In 2004, the company bought a building in Wilsonville from Mentor Graphics for $10.3 million for use as a new headquarters.[16]
In 2003, FLIR acquired Indigo Systems, a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products, including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, camera cores, and finished cameras.
Beginning in 2005, the company began supplying BMW with imaging technology for use on the luxury automaker's vehicles.[17] Also in 2005, FLIR was named the 55th fastest-growing company on CNNMoney's list of the 100 fastest-growing tech companies.[18] In 2006, FLIR was listed as the 83rd best small business by Forbes. The previous year they were ranked 39th.[19] That July, FLIR announced a seven-year contract worth up to $250 million with the United States Army for cameras to be installed on helicopters.[20]




Entrance to company headquarters in Wilsonville, Oregon, which is adjacent to the Mentor Graphics campus.


In March 2007, the company reported that it would restate its financial statements for the period from 1995 to 2005, primarily to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants.[21] FLIR was also sued by investors over these same allegations.[22]
The company purchased Extech Instruments Corp. in October 2007 for $40 million.[23] The next month FLIR executed its third stock split.[23] FLIR made another acquisition in April 2008 when it purchased Ifara Tecnologias of Spain for about $11 million.[24] For the 2008 fiscal year, the company recorded $1.1 billion in sales, a record for the company.[25] On January 1, 2009, FLIR was added to the S&P 500 stock index, replacing National City Corporation.[26] FLIR was named as the Northwest's top company by the Seattle Times in 2009, the third time the company was at the top (2002 and 2003).[27] It sold Extech Data Systems, a division of Extech which made portable printers, in December 2009,[28] and bought the security hardware maker Directed Perception that month for $20 million.[29] FLIR continued to grow via acquisitions when it purchased bankrupt Raymarine in May 2010 for $180 million.[30] In December of 2012 FLIR acquired Lorex Technology Inc. for approximately $60 million[31]. On November 30, 2015 FLIR announced that it had acquired DVTEL, Inc, a leader in software and hardware technologies for advanced video surveillance, for approximately $92 million in cash.[32]
In December 2016, FLIR acquired Prox Dynamics, the makers of the Black Hornet, a nano-drone used by the military and law enforcement for surveillance and reconnaissance, for $134 million.[33]
Operations[edit]
Headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, the company also has manufacturing and R&D facilities in Goleta (near Santa Barbara, California), North Billerica (a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts), Tel Aviv (Israel), Bozeman (Montana), Stillwater (Oklahoma), Freeport (Pennsylvania), Oak Ridge (Tennessee), West Lafayette (Indiana), Tallinn (Estonia), Täby (Sweden), Fareham (UK) and West Malling (UK).[5] Worldwide, FLIR employs in excess of 2,700 people, with more than 1,600 located in the United States.[34][35]
The company is structured to focus on six specific business segments.[36] The Surveillance group addresses high-end military and other governmental thermal imaging markets.[36] The Instruments segment produces thermography cameras for building inspection, predictive maintenance, and R&D, as well as test and measurement tools.[36][37] Development of OEM camera cores and components, new technologies, and new applications for existing technologies are served by the OEM & Emerging Markets group.[36] Marine electronics including thermal cameras under both the FLIR and Raymarine brands fall under the Maritime segment.[36] Thermal and visible light cameras for industrial, commercial, and residential security are serviced under the Lorex by FLIR brands by the Security segment.[36][37] The Detection segment produces sensors for chemical, biological, radiation, and explosive detection.[36][37]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

History[edit]
FLIR took its name from the acronym for forward-looking Infrared.[4] The company began in 1978 with airborne IR systems, and developed from 1978 to 2004 through product development and acquisitions of related companies.[5] Originally based in Tigard, Oregon,[6] the company relocated to Portland in the mid-1990s.[7] FLIR teamed up with Hughes Aircraft Company in 1990, with Hughes taking part ownership of FLIR.[6]
The company became publicly traded in a June 1993 IPO[8] which raised $11.5 million for the company with shares offered at $12.50.[9] In 1994, the company had grown to sales of $47 million annually.[7] The next year, J. Kenneth Stringer III was named as president of the company.[7] The company bought Sweden's Agema Infrared System in 1997,[10] which doubled the size of the company.[11] Acquisitions continued the following year when they purchased Inframetrics Inc. of Massachusetts for $48 million.[12]
The company's president and chief executive officer Kenneth Stringer III was fired by the board of directors in May 2000 due to errors in the company's accounting practices.[13] In September 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued FLIR over accounting irregularities.[14] The next year, three executives at the company were charged with fraudulent accounting related to the SEC case that included claims of inflated sales.[14] Sales at FLIR grew to $311 million in fiscal year 2003.[15] In 2004, the company bought a building in Wilsonville from Mentor Graphics for $10.3 million for use as a new headquarters.[16]
In 2003, FLIR acquired Indigo Systems, a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products, including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, camera cores, and finished cameras.
Beginning in 2005, the company began supplying BMW with imaging technology for use on the luxury automaker's vehicles.[17] Also in 2005, FLIR was named the 55th fastest-growing company on CNNMoney's list of the 100 fastest-growing tech companies.[18] In 2006, FLIR was listed as the 83rd best small business by Forbes. The previous year they were ranked 39th.[19] That July, FLIR announced a seven-year contract worth up to $250 million with the United States Army for cameras to be installed on helicopters.[20]

In March 2007, the company reported that it would restate its financial statements for the period from 1995 to 2005, primarily to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants.[21] FLIR was also sued by investors over these same allegations.[22]
The company purchased Extech Instruments Corp. in October 2007 for $40 million.[23] The next month FLIR executed its third stock split.[23] FLIR made another acquisition in April 2008 when it purchased Ifara Tecnologias of Spain for about $11 million.[24] For the 2008 fiscal year, the company recorded $1.1 billion in sales, a record for the company.[25] On January 1, 2009, FLIR was added to the S&P 500 stock index, replacing National City Corporation.[26] FLIR was named as the Northwest's top company by the Seattle Times in 2009, the third time the company was at the top (2002 and 2003).[27] It sold Extech Data Systems, a division of Extech which made portable printers, in December 2009,[28] and bought the security hardware maker Directed Perception that month for $20 million.[29] FLIR continued to grow via acquisitions when it purchased bankrupt Raymarine in May 2010 for $180 million.[30] In December of 2012 FLIR acquired Lorex Technology Inc. for approximately $60 million[31]. On November 30, 2015 FLIR announced that it had acquired DVTEL, Inc, a leader in software and hardware technologies for advanced video surveillance, for approximately $92 million in cash.[32]
In December 2016, FLIR acquired Prox Dynamics, the makers of the Black Hornet, a nano-drone used by the military and law enforcement for surveillance and reconnaissance, for $134 million.[33]
Operations[edit]
Headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, the company also has manufacturing and R&D facilities in Goleta (near Santa Barbara, California), North Billerica (a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts), Tel Aviv (Israel), Bozeman (Montana), Stillwater (Oklahoma), Freeport (Pennsylvania), Oak Ridge (Tennessee), West Lafayette (Indiana), Tallinn (Estonia), Täby (Sweden), Fareham (UK) and West Malling (UK).[5] Worldwide, FLIR employs in excess of 2,700 people, with more than 1,600 located in the United States.[34][35]
The company is structured to focus on six specific business segments.[36] The Surveillance group addresses high-end military and other governmental thermal imaging markets.[36] The Instruments segment produces thermography cameras for building inspection, predictive maintenance, and R&D, as well as test and measurement tools.[36][37] Development of OEM camera cores and components, new technologies, and new applications for existing technologies are served by the OEM & Emerging Markets group.[36] Marine electronics including thermal cameras under both the FLIR and Raymarine brands fall under the Maritime segment.[36] Thermal and visible light cameras for industrial, commercial, and residential security are serviced under the Lorex by FLIR brands by the Security segment.[36][37] The Detection segment produces sensors for chemical, biological, radiation, and explosive detection.[36][37]

History[edit]
FLIR took its name from the acronym for forward-looking Infrared.[4] The company began in 1978 with airborne IR systems, and developed from 1978 to 2004 through product development and acquisitions of related companies.[5] Originally based in Tigard, Oregon,[6] the company relocated to Portland in the mid-1990s.[7] FLIR teamed up with Hughes Aircraft Company in 1990, with Hughes taking part ownership of FLIR.[6]
The company became publicly traded in a June 1993 IPO[8] which raised $11.5 million for the company with shares offered at $12.50.[9] In 1994, the company had grown to sales of $47 million annually.[7] The next year, J. Kenneth Stringer III was named as president of the company.[7] The company bought Sweden's Agema Infrared System in 1997,[10] which doubled the size of the company.[11] Acquisitions continued the following year when they purchased Inframetrics Inc. of Massachusetts for $48 million.[12]
The company's president and chief executive officer Kenneth Stringer III was fired by the board of directors in May 2000 due to errors in the company's accounting practices.[13] In September 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued FLIR over accounting irregularities.[14] The next year, three executives at the company were charged with fraudulent accounting related to the SEC case that included claims of inflated sales.[14] Sales at FLIR grew to $311 million in fiscal year 2003.[15] In 2004, the company bought a building in Wilsonville from Mentor Graphics for $10.3 million for use as a new headquarters.[16]
In 2003, FLIR acquired Indigo Systems, a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products, including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, camera cores, and finished cameras.
Beginning in 2005, the company began supplying BMW with imaging technology for use on the luxury automaker's vehicles.[17] Also in 2005, FLIR was named the 55th fastest-growing company on CNNMoney's list of the 100 fastest-growing tech companies.[18] In 2006, FLIR was listed as the 83rd best small business by Forbes. The previous year they were ranked 39th.[19] That July, FLIR announced a seven-year contract worth up to $250 million with the United States Army for cameras to be installed on helicopters.[20]

In March 2007, the company reported that it would restate its financial statements for the period from 1995 to 2005, primarily to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants.[21] FLIR was also sued by investors over these same allegations.[22]
The company purchased Extech Instruments Corp. in October 2007 for $40 million.[23] The next month FLIR executed its third stock split.[23] FLIR made another acquisition in April 2008 when it purchased Ifara Tecnologias of Spain for about $11 million.[24] For the 2008 fiscal year, the company recorded $1.1 billion in sales, a record for the company.[25] On January 1, 2009, FLIR was added to the S&P 500 stock index, replacing National City Corporation.[26] FLIR was named as the Northwest's top company by the Seattle Times in 2009, the third time the company was at the top (2002 and 2003).[27] It sold Extech Data Systems, a division of Extech which made portable printers, in December 2009,[28] and bought the security hardware maker Directed Perception that month for $20 million.[29] FLIR continued to grow via acquisitions when it purchased bankrupt Raymarine in May 2010 for $180 million.[30] In December of 2012 FLIR acquired Lorex Technology Inc. for approximately $60 million[31]. On November 30, 2015 FLIR announced that it had acquired DVTEL, Inc, a leader in software and hardware technologies for advanced video surveillance, for approximately $92 million in cash.[32]
In December 2016, FLIR acquired Prox Dynamics, the makers of the Black Hornet, a nano-drone used by the military and law enforcement for surveillance and reconnaissance, for $134 million.[33]
Operations[edit]
Headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, the company also has manufacturing and R&D facilities in Goleta (near Santa Barbara, California), North Billerica (a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts), Tel Aviv (Israel), Bozeman (Montana), Stillwater (Oklahoma), Freeport (Pennsylvania), Oak Ridge (Tennessee), West Lafayette (Indiana), Tallinn (Estonia), Täby (Sweden), Fareham (UK) and West Malling (UK).[5] Worldwide, FLIR employs in excess of 2,700 people, with more than 1,600 located in the United States.[34][35]
The company is structured to focus on six specific business segments.[36] The Surveillance group addresses high-end military and other governmental thermal imaging markets.[36] The Instruments segment produces thermography cameras for building inspection, predictive maintenance, and R&D, as well as test and measurement tools.[36][37] Development of OEM camera cores and components, new technologies, and new applications for existing technologies are served by the OEM & Emerging Markets group.[36] Marine electronics including thermal cameras under both the FLIR and Raymarine brands fall under the Maritime segment.[36] Thermal and visible light cameras for industrial, commercial, and residential security are serviced under the Lorex by FLIR brands by the Security segment.[36][37] The Detection segment produces sensors for chemical, biological, radiation, and explosive detection.[36][37]

                FLIR Systems PathFindIR - Driving Thermal Imager Camera Systems — 6 products / 9 models
 — Page 1










FLIR PathFindIR is a revolutionary solution to night time driving. Your car can easily outrun your headlights, making them ineffective at giving you enough warning time to stop or react to an animal, a pedestrian, cyclist, or a broken down car. The FLIR thermal imaging technology doesn't read light, like night vision cameras - it read the heat emitted by objects. Cooler objects such as cars, trees, and building are dark. Warmer objects like people and animals are bright. This allows you to peer through the dark in fog or smoke and react to potential hazards before they can a dangerous situation. FLIR PathFindIR Thermal Imager can be easily mounted behind the car radiator grill and connected to the in-car monitor.At OpticsPlanet, we are proud of our great line of FLIR PathFindIR products, and we back it by offering FREE SHIPPING on orders over $49. We also make shopping easy by having product experts standing by to answer any questions you may have, and offering great How-To Guides and Blog Posts for information at your fingertips! Drive with more confidence with the FLIR PathFindIR Series.

                FLIR Systems PathFindIR - Driving Thermal Imager Camera Systems — 6 products / 9 models
 — Page 1










FLIR PathFindIR is a revolutionary solution to night time driving. Your car can easily outrun your headlights, making them ineffective at giving you enough warning time to stop or react to an animal, a pedestrian, cyclist, or a broken down car. The FLIR thermal imaging technology doesn't read light, like night vision cameras - it read the heat emitted by objects. Cooler objects such as cars, trees, and building are dark. Warmer objects like people and animals are bright. This allows you to peer through the dark in fog or smoke and react to potential hazards before they can a dangerous situation. FLIR PathFindIR Thermal Imager can be easily mounted behind the car radiator grill and connected to the in-car monitor.At OpticsPlanet, we are proud of our great line of FLIR PathFindIR products, and we back it by offering FREE SHIPPING on orders over $49. We also make shopping easy by having product experts standing by to answer any questions you may have, and offering great How-To Guides and Blog Posts for information at your fingertips! Drive with more confidence with the FLIR PathFindIR Series.

FLIR began by making thermal imagers that mounted on vehicles to help conduct energy audits in the late 70s. These audits helped homeowners find spots where hot or cold air was escaping. From their original focus of measuring tiny temperature changes from a distance, FLIR has expanded into markets where seeing in adverse conditions is vital. When there are contaminants in the air, the image from normal night vision devices can be obscured, but thermal imaging units pierce the fog to find heat signatures. Because of their amazing versatility and consistent performance, FLIR thermal imagers are a popular choice among firefighters, police officers and soldiers who have to rely on thermal vision units in life threatening situations. To narrow your search for just the right equipment from FLIR, use the handy category and product line filters below on the left. Read through reviews of FLIR products written by people like you. Remember, a FLIR warranty ensures your satisfaction with your purchase. For more help choosing durable, reliable FLIR products, check our informative blogs
and our article about the differences between thermal imaging and night vision.
Optics Planet proudly supplies needed equipment to military and law enforcement personnel. We offer Free Shipping on all orders over $49 as well as FREE Shipping to APOs and FPOs. Please refer to our APO/FPO Shipping and Export Restrictions for more information on export to APO/FPO addresses. Make OpticsPlanet.com your trusted procurement source for FLIR and all other military gear!

                FLIR Systems - FLIR Infrared Cameras, FLIR Night Vision, FLIR Thermal Imaging Monoculars & More — 85 products / 121 models
 — Page 1























FLIR began by making thermal imagers that mounted on vehicles to help conduct energy audits in the late 70s. These audits helped homeowners find spots where hot or cold air was escaping. From their original focus of measuring tiny temperature changes from a distance, FLIR has expanded into markets where seeing in adverse conditions is vital. When there are contaminants in the air, the image from normal night vision devices can be obscured, but thermal imaging units pierce the fog to find heat signatures. Because of their amazing versatility and consistent performance, FLIR thermal imagers are a popular choice among firefighters, police officers and soldiers who have to rely on thermal vision units in life threatening situations. To narrow your search for just the right equipment from FLIR, use the handy category and product line filters below on the left. Read through reviews of FLIR products written by people like you. Remember, a FLIR warranty ensures your satisfaction with your purchase. For more help choosing durable, reliable FLIR products, check our informative blogs
and our article about the differences between thermal imaging and night vision.

History[edit]
FLIR took its name from the acronym for forward-looking Infrared.[4] The company began in 1978 with airborne IR systems, and developed from 1978 to 2004 through product development and acquisitions of related companies.[5] Originally based in Tigard, Oregon,[6] the company relocated to Portland in the mid-1990s.[7] FLIR teamed up with Hughes Aircraft Company in 1990, with Hughes taking part ownership of FLIR.[6]
The company became publicly traded in a June 1993 IPO[8] which raised $11.5 million for the company with shares offered at $12.50.[9] In 1994, the company had grown to sales of $47 million annually.[7] The next year, J. Kenneth Stringer III was named as president of the company.[7] The company bought Sweden's Agema Infrared System in 1997,[10] which doubled the size of the company.[11] Acquisitions continued the following year when they purchased Inframetrics Inc. of Massachusetts for $48 million.[12]
The company's president and chief executive officer Kenneth Stringer III was fired by the board of directors in May 2000 due to errors in the company's accounting practices.[13] In September 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued FLIR over accounting irregularities.[14] The next year, three executives at the company were charged with fraudulent accounting related to the SEC case that included claims of inflated sales.[14] Sales at FLIR grew to $311 million in fiscal year 2003.[15] In 2004, the company bought a building in Wilsonville from Mentor Graphics for $10.3 million for use as a new headquarters.[16]
In 2003, FLIR acquired Indigo Systems, a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products, including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, camera cores, and finished cameras.
Beginning in 2005, the company began supplying BMW with imaging technology for use on the luxury automaker's vehicles.[17] Also in 2005, FLIR was named the 55th fastest-growing company on CNNMoney's list of the 100 fastest-growing tech companies.[18] In 2006, FLIR was listed as the 83rd best small business by Forbes. The previous year they were ranked 39th.[19] That July, FLIR announced a seven-year contract worth up to $250 million with the United States Army for cameras to be installed on helicopters.[20]




Entrance to company headquarters in Wilsonville, Oregon, which is adjacent to the Mentor Graphics campus.


In March 2007, the company reported that it would restate its financial statements for the period from 1995 to 2005, primarily to record non-cash charges for compensation expense relating to past stock option grants.[21] FLIR was also sued by investors over these same allegations.[22]
The company purchased Extech Instruments Corp. in October 2007 for $40 million.[23] The next month FLIR executed its third stock split.[23] FLIR made another acquisition in April 2008 when it purchased Ifara Tecnologias of Spain for about $11 million.[24] For the 2008 fiscal year, the company recorded $1.1 billion in sales, a record for the company.[25] On January 1, 2009, FLIR was added to the S&P 500 stock index, replacing National City Corporation.[26] FLIR was named as the Northwest's top company by the Seattle Times in 2009, the third time the company was at the top (2002 and 2003).[27] It sold Extech Data Systems, a division of Extech which made portable printers, in December 2009,[28] and bought the security hardware maker Directed Perception that month for $20 million.[29] FLIR continued to grow via acquisitions when it purchased bankrupt Raymarine in May 2010 for $180 million.[30] In December of 2012 FLIR acquired Lorex Technology Inc. for approximately $60 million[31]. On November 30, 2015 FLIR announced that it had acquired DVTEL, Inc, a leader in software and hardware technologies for advanced video surveillance, for approximately $92 million in cash.[32]
In December 2016, FLIR acquired Prox Dynamics, the makers of the Black Hornet, a nano-drone used by the military and law enforcement for surveillance and reconnaissance, for $134 million.[33]
Operations[edit]
Headquartered in Wilsonville, Oregon, the company also has manufacturing and R&D facilities in Goleta (near Santa Barbara, California), North Billerica (a suburb of Boston, Massachusetts), Tel Aviv (Israel), Bozeman (Montana), Stillwater (Oklahoma), Freeport (Pennsylvania), Oak Ridge (Tennessee), West Lafayette (Indiana), Tallinn (Estonia), Täby (Sweden), Fareham (UK) and West Malling (UK).[5] Worldwide, FLIR employs in excess of 2,700 people, with more than 1,600 located in the United States.[34][35]
The company is structured to focus on six specific business segments.[36] The Surveillance group addresses high-end military and other governmental thermal imaging markets.[36] The Instruments segment produces thermography cameras for building inspection, predictive maintenance, and R&D, as well as test and measurement tools.[36][37] Development of OEM camera cores and components, new technologies, and new applications for existing technologies are served by the OEM & Emerging Markets group.[36] Marine electronics including thermal cameras under both the FLIR and Raymarine brands fall under the Maritime segment.[36] Thermal and visible light cameras for industrial, commercial, and residential security are serviced under the Lorex by FLIR brands by the Security segment.[36][37] The Detection segment produces sensors for chemical, biological, radiation, and explosive detection.[36][37]

BENEFITS
How We Take Care Of You...
At FLIR, our people are the source of our energy. Our team members have established FLIR as the market leader in the infrared industry, which is why we reward them well and have built an environment of creativity, continuous learning, and professional freedom – ideal for flourishing careers. 


As a member of the FLIR team, you will always have the opportunity to make a substantial contribution to this principle, because we recognize everyone has the ability to drive our future achievements. We offer competitive, performance-based packages which include base salary, the chance to earn cash bonuses and, in some cases, participation in our long-term incentive program.


All our teams enjoy generous benefits, as we believe it is important to provide a comprehensive rewards system to support your professional growth, wellbeing, and financial future. 










US Benefits
Our benefit plans are designed to keep our people healthy, happy, and moving ahead.

          FLIR benefits are generous and personalized. From our fitness subsidy to comprehensive health and vision care programs, we let you select the options that are right for you. Maybe you need braces, are planning to adopt a child, or have a need for family counselling - whatever your situation, we have you covered. Some benefits may depend on the place you live, but we keep the choices as equitable as possible. 





 Investment Benefits 




 FLIR provides many options to help you establish a financially secure future. These include a rich 401(k) plan that allows you to defer up to 60% of your pre-tax salary. We supplement your retirement savings by making a discretionary matching contribution of 50 cents on every dollar, up to the IRS allowable annual maximum. While our discretionary matching contributions may change from year to year, our commitment to helping you save for a secure retirement future won’t.  You can choose from our traditional pre-tax 401(k) plan or the Roth 401(k) plan, where your contributions are made on an after-tax basis. 

                    We also offer you an employee stock purchase plan, allowing you to contribute up to 10% of your salary to buy FLIR stock at a 15% discount. Many of our locations also offer credit union membership that includes a checking account, bank cards and competitive interest rates. 






 Health Benefits 




 Through FLIR, you'll have a selection of medical plans for you and your family, which includes coverage for domestic partners. These plans include a Health Savings Plan and two levels of PPOs with several tiers of coverage. In addition, just in case you can’t get to your doctor when you need to, we offer telemedicine through MDLive where you can videoconference or talk by phone with a physician 24/7. We also offer generous vision benefits and our dental insurance program provides comprehensive coverage including orthodontia for adults and children. 






 Income Protection/Enhancement Benefits 


 We offer many benefits to protect you and your family, and give you the opportunity to save money. Many of these are provided without cost to you, including: a life insurance benefit equal to twice your base salary, short-term and long-term disability coverage, and health and dependent care flexible spending accounts. 

                We also offer a unique spouse disability program that provides cash benefits if your spouse becomes disabled. 

                Additional voluntary life and AD&D insurance is also available for you, your spouse or domestic partner and eligible children. Just to make sure you are fully covered, we also offer voluntary accident insurance and critical illness insurance. 




 Family and Parenting Benefits 


 As well as Short Term Disability and all Federal and State Family Medical Leave Policies, each new parent receives two paid “Baby Days.” We also provide assistance for the costs associated with adoption. 




 Time Off Benefits 


 Time away from work to be with your family and friends is important. As a new team member you will enjoy four weeks of Personal Time Off (PTO) per year. One additional day is then added for each year of service over five years. Your maximum annual PTO will be 30 days. 

                FLIR also observes 10 holidays each calendar year. 




 FLIR Extras 


 Our Education Assistance Program reimburses your tuition fees for approved, work-related programs of study. 

                Some FLIR facilities have onsite fitness centers and wellness programs. We also offer a fitness subsidy that will help you pay for exercise and wellness programs. 

                Our team members have access to an Employee Assistance Program that provides confidential counselling and other personal services 24/7. 

                We encourage our employees to refer amazing candidates to FLIR through our employee referral program and reward them with referral bonuses. 

                Community and charitable involvement is an important part of our culture. Our Giving Program provides a matching gift of up to $500 per employee, per year, to a charity of your choice. This is in addition to our many site-sponsored outreach and charitable activities.

REVIEWS






FLIR ONE for iOS
Thermal Mobile Accessory





Good device at this price point


I have had my FLIR One for over 6 months now - and I really like it. I have used my camera to check for heat leaks in my house insulation - to check my in-floor electric heat for hot spots - to check for critters in my attic - and to look at my electrical panels to see if I had any hot breakers. I have even used it to check to make sure a carpet wasn't wet after an accident during a dinner party.
 






FLIR C2
Pocket-Sized Infrared Camera





Exactly what I needed!


The C2 with its MSX technology is just perfect for my needs as a home inspector. It's reasonably priced. It's compact and easy to use. I can carry it with me at all times during my inspections.

                        About us
                    


FLIR was established in 1978 to pioneer the development of high-performance, low-cost infrared (thermal) imaging systems for airborne applications. Thermal imaging systems detect the infrared energy (heat) that is emitted by all people, objects and materials. Infrared cameras allow the operator to see in total darkness, adverse weather and through such air pollutants as smoke and haze.
Toward the end of the 1980s, FLIR began to leverage its experience in infrared imaging technology to develop hand-held and laboratory systems for a variety of commercial applications that required not only superior image quality, but also the ability to detect and measure temperature differences. This effort accelerated with the acquisition of the industrial infrared imaging group from the Hughes Aircraft Co. in 1990.
The acquisition of Agema (Sweden) in 1998 and of Inframetrics (Boston, MA) in mid-1999 provided FLIR engineering teams and sales and support infrastructure that accelerated FLIR’s success in commercial thermal imaging markets. Together, Agema and Inframetrics represented over 60 years of significant infrared camera development and thermography applications expertise. Agema developed the first commercial infrared scanner, designed for powerline inspections, in 1965, the first battery-operated portable infrared scanner in 1973, the first dual-wavelength system capable of real-time analog recording for R&D markets in 1978, and the first uncooled infrared camera, the Agema 570, and 1997. Inframetrics, also a pioneer in commercial infrared cameras and thermography training, developed the first TV-compatible infrared system in 1975 and the first full-featured camcorder-style focal plane array (FPA) infrared camera in 1995.
In 2003, FLIR acquired Indigo Systems, a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products, including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, camera cores, and finished cameras.
Ever since, FLIR has invested in numerous adjacent markets, technologies, and products to expand its sensor solution set and its ability to service a broader set of customers. These investments have enabled significant growth in revenue and unit volumes, which has helped reduce the cost, and thus end user prices, of the products. This has resulted in dramatic increases in customers as well as increased global awareness of the power of thermal technology.
Currently, FLIR operates in many locations around the globe and employs a total of over 2,800 dedicated employees.

                        About us
                    


FLIR was established in 1978 to pioneer the development of high-performance, low-cost infrared (thermal) imaging systems for airborne applications. Thermal imaging systems detect the infrared energy (heat) that is emitted by all people, objects and materials. Infrared cameras allow the operator to see in total darkness, adverse weather and through such air pollutants as smoke and haze.
Toward the end of the 1980s, FLIR began to leverage its experience in infrared imaging technology to develop hand-held and laboratory systems for a variety of commercial applications that required not only superior image quality, but also the ability to detect and measure temperature differences. This effort accelerated with the acquisition of the industrial infrared imaging group from the Hughes Aircraft Co. in 1990.
The acquisition of Agema (Sweden) in 1998 and of Inframetrics (Boston, MA) in mid-1999 provided FLIR engineering teams and sales and support infrastructure that accelerated FLIR’s success in commercial thermal imaging markets. Together, Agema and Inframetrics represented over 60 years of significant infrared camera development and thermography applications expertise. Agema developed the first commercial infrared scanner, designed for powerline inspections, in 1965, the first battery-operated portable infrared scanner in 1973, the first dual-wavelength system capable of real-time analog recording for R&D markets in 1978, and the first uncooled infrared camera, the Agema 570, and 1997. Inframetrics, also a pioneer in commercial infrared cameras and thermography training, developed the first TV-compatible infrared system in 1975 and the first full-featured camcorder-style focal plane array (FPA) infrared camera in 1995.
In 2003, FLIR acquired Indigo Systems, a leading developer and supplier of a wide range of infrared imaging products, including cooled and uncooled infrared detectors, camera cores, and finished cameras.
Ever since, FLIR has invested in numerous adjacent markets, technologies, and products to expand its sensor solution set and its ability to service a broader set of customers. These investments have enabled significant growth in revenue and unit volumes, which has helped reduce the cost, and thus end user prices, of the products. This has resulted in dramatic increases in customers as well as increased global awareness of the power of thermal technology.
Currently, FLIR operates in many locations around the globe and employs a total of over 2,800 dedicated employees.

This past weekend, FLIR brought the Bring the Heat Hacker & Maker Challenge back to the Big Apple by teaming up once again with our friends from AngelHack for their 10th Global Hackathon Series: Commit to Your Code. 
We are excited to welcome four new teams as part of our FLIR ONE developer community—BeerPong.com, for their application to test intoxication levels; Heat Check, a human detection app; RescuER, a search and rescue aid app for first responders; as well as our ultimate grand prize winners, Sunscreen Checkr, for their application to let you know where you missed a spot when applying sunscreen. Our winners, Sunscreen Checkr, will be traveling to visit FLIR Santa Barbara to pitch their app ideas to the FLIR team!  Thanks again to everyone who made this event possible, and a very special thanks to all participants.

It’s that time of year again, and time is running out and you have made no progress in learning mind-reading since last year. We have some good news. While we don’t have a crystal ball, we have something better: our annual FLIR Father’s Day Gift Guide!  Check out this year’s gift ideas and special savings below for insights to what Dad wants, and this Father’s Day transform your Dad from a regular Dad, to a Dad by FLIR.  
 Professional Dad (by FLIR)

Save more than 30% on closeout on professional grade Ex and Exx- series models and give Dad a leg up on the competition. Also, with any purchase of a FLIR Ex or Exx camera, score a free MR40 Moisture Pen to verify suspected moisture issues. Dad an electrician? Save 20% on two of FLIR’s popular IGM™ products, the DM284 Thermal Imaging Multimeter, or the CM174 AC/DC Clamp Meter, EC&M’s Product of the Year winner!
Handyman Dad (by FLIR)

For the ultimate, serious, on-the-go handyman Dad, buy him a CAT® S60 smart phone, powered by FLIR Lepton®. If he doesn’t want to part with his iPhone or Android smartphone, then get him a FLIR ONE or FLIR ONE Pro thermal camera attachment instead. We’re taking FLIR ONE & FLIR ONE Pro preorders now, and while he won’t have it in time for Father’s Day, there’s nothing like getting him first in line for the latest thermal imaging tool from FLIR.
BBQ Dad (by FLIR)

For Dad’s who like to cook, BBQ, grill or even homebrew, the Extech TM55 Pocket Fold-Up Food Thermometer is now just $29.99. BBQ Pro Shop deemed the TM55 a “five star” thermometer in their recent hands-on review, perfect for taking quick and convenient temperature measurements on the spot!
Drone Dad (by FLIR)














 

For the serious hobbyist, videographer, or more casual, “I just bought a drone because they are cool” Dad, FLIR has thermal cameras for drones that are now 20% off. Give Dad the power to shoot still images and record video in both thermal and visible with the dual-payload FLIR Duo. For the more advanced drone Dad, impress him with the FLIR Vue Pro R – a higher resolution, higher frame rate camera with the ability to read temperature data. This way he can check if the coals are out on the campfire from 100 feet in the air.  
Outdoor Dad (by FLIR)














 
Save now on any of our Scout thermal handheld monocular units for your next camping trip or wildlife adventure with Dad! And, for the professional or casual fisherman or boating-enthusiast Dad, save up to $5000 on refurbished Raymarine electronics. Picking up one of these gifts for Dad, or have a question? let us know in the comments below.

Local Heroes: Texas HAZMAT Crew Uses FLIR in Response to Industrial Leak

In our LOCAL HEROES series, FLIR likes to highlight the stories of law enforcement and first responders using FLIR products in their day-to-day lives by highlighting them as our “local heroes.”
On a Monday morning in early June, the Corpus Christi Fire Department HAZMAT Crews in Southern Texas were called to a scene after receiving reports of a strong ammonia smell throughout a wide-spread area. The CCFD HAZMAT Crew used a FLIR thermal camera capable of visualizing a leak that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.The plume of ammonia was made visible to the HAZMAT Crew allowing them to locate and evaluate the source of the leak, and stop the flow of ammonia to avert a larger crisis. Watch the video below, and head here to see the full story!

The Ultimate Father's Day Gift
         Monday, June 12, 2017

 According to some accounts of Greek mythology, Zeus – the king of the gods – fathered a total of 92 children, making for some epic Father’s Days, no doubt, around the confines of Mount Olympus.While it’s unlikely that your own father enjoys a progeny as prodigious as that of Zeus, you can still make him feel like an immortal on Father’s Day, while reclaiming your rightful, favored status. How? By giving him the power of Zeus: the gift of unrivaled vision in any conditions, from full sunlight to total darkness.For the shooting or tactical-oriented dad, the Armasight by FLIR Zeus Pro Thermal Weapon Sight represents the ultimate expression of appreciation; it’s FLIR’s most versatile and sophisticated targeting product available for the consumer market. This isn’t night vision; Armasight by FLIR Zeus Pro is built with industry-leading FLIR thermal-imaging technology. When mounted to Dad’s gun or used as a handheld spotting scope, Zeus Pro detects minute differences in the temperatures of both live and inert objects and amplifies these differences to project amazingly clear images onto the unit’s screen. Utilizing FLIR’s field-proven Tau® 2 thermal camera core, the Zeus Pro is available in 336x256 or 640x512 pixel formats with professional-grade 50mm or 100mm Germanium (Ge) objective lenses. The result is a wide variety of optical magnifications and the ability to detect an average-sized person up to 1,000 yards away. Eight distinct models optimized for both medium- and long-range performance are available.Dad will definitely appreciate the Armasight by FLIR Zeus Pro Thermal Weapon Sight’s simple and intuitive controls, functions and features. Zeus Pro models mount and dismount quickly and easily via a MIL-STD-1913 rail, and feature ballistic reticles, an electronic compass and an inclinometer for finer range estimation and target orientation. An included multi-pin connector provides video-out/video-in capability, external power supply and support of accessories like an optional DVR or modular range finder. Operation and functions are also supported by an included wireless remote.Think Dad already has everything? Think again. Say thanks this Father’s Day by presenting him with the unrivaled vision of Zeus. We can’t predict his reaction, but one thing’s for certain: even if he does have 92 kids, you just became his favorite again.

We’re s’not kidding when we say this is a whale of a story!
The Massachusetts-based Ocean Alliance has been using a unique and innovative thermal imaging-equipped research drone with a a series of petri dishes that collect whale blow, or, snot. Cleverly named the ‘SnotBot,’this modified DJI Inspire drone is equipped with a FLIR Vue Pro thermal imaging camera and is flown into the blow from whales to collect samples. The whale blow collected by SnotBot contains DNA, micro biomes, pregnancy hormones, and stress hormones and helps researchers to better understand these massive mammals.Interestingly, with the Vue Pro on the aircraft, the team was able to spot hotspots on the whales bodies, and observe how the whales bring cool water to the surface by their tail flukes as they swim. Using small drones equipped with both thermal and visible cameras allows the Ocean Alliance researchers to  collect comparative data without harming or disturbing the animals in their natural habitats.Learn more about the SnotBot and how FLIR is used on the Ocean Alliance website. Photos Courtesy of Ocean Alliance

We know thermal cameras can see heat, but how are FLIR Optical Gas Imaging Cameras able to see gas? In visible light, gas is completely transmissive - light goes right through the molecules. However, many gases have infrared absorption characteristics that can be targeted with specially designed thermal imaging cameras. Watch this great video on how Optical Gas Imaging Cameras work:





 
Gain a greater understanding of optical gas imaging technology, and how you can use it to find and repair gas leaks quickly by downloading our free professional guide.

Local Heroes: Texas HAZMAT Crew Uses FLIR in Response to Industrial Leak
         Monday, July 3, 2017

In our LOCAL HEROES series, FLIR likes to highlight the stories of law enforcement and first responders using FLIR products in their day-to-day lives by highlighting them as our “local heroes.”
On a Monday morning in early June, the Corpus Christi Fire Department HAZMAT Crews in Southern Texas were called to a scene after receiving reports of a strong ammonia smell throughout a wide-spread area. The CCFD HAZMAT Crew used a FLIR thermal camera capable of visualizing a leak that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.The plume of ammonia was made visible to the HAZMAT Crew allowing them to locate and evaluate the source of the leak, and stop the flow of ammonia to avert a larger crisis. Watch the video below, and head here to see the full story!

This past weekend, FLIR brought the Bring the Heat Hacker & Maker Challenge back to the Big Apple by teaming up once again with our friends from AngelHack for their 10th Global Hackathon Series: Commit to Your Code. 
We are excited to welcome four new teams as part of our FLIR ONE developer community—BeerPong.com, for their application to test intoxication levels; Heat Check, a human detection app; RescuER, a search and rescue aid app for first responders; as well as our ultimate grand prize winners, Sunscreen Checkr, for their application to let you know where you missed a spot when applying sunscreen. Our winners, Sunscreen Checkr, will be traveling to visit FLIR Santa Barbara to pitch their app ideas to the FLIR team!  Thanks again to everyone who made this event possible, and a very special thanks to all participants.

We know thermal cameras can see heat, but how are FLIR Optical Gas Imaging Cameras able to see gas? In visible light, gas is completely transmissive - light goes right through the molecules. However, many gases have infrared absorption characteristics that can be targeted with specially designed thermal imaging cameras. Watch this great video on how Optical Gas Imaging Cameras work:





 
Gain a greater understanding of optical gas imaging technology, and how you can use it to find and repair gas leaks quickly by downloading our free professional guide.

The Ultimate Father's Day Gift
         Monday, June 12, 2017

 According to some accounts of Greek mythology, Zeus – the king of the gods – fathered a total of 92 children, making for some epic Father’s Days, no doubt, around the confines of Mount Olympus.While it’s unlikely that your own father enjoys a progeny as prodigious as that of Zeus, you can still make him feel like an immortal on Father’s Day, while reclaiming your rightful, favored status. How? By giving him the power of Zeus: the gift of unrivaled vision in any conditions, from full sunlight to total darkness.For the shooting or tactical-oriented dad, the Armasight by FLIR Zeus Pro Thermal Weapon Sight represents the ultimate expression of appreciation; it’s FLIR’s most versatile and sophisticated targeting product available for the consumer market. This isn’t night vision; Armasight by FLIR Zeus Pro is built with industry-leading FLIR thermal-imaging technology. When mounted to Dad’s gun or used as a handheld spotting scope, Zeus Pro detects minute differences in the temperatures of both live and inert objects and amplifies these differences to project amazingly clear images onto the unit’s screen. Utilizing FLIR’s field-proven Tau® 2 thermal camera core, the Zeus Pro is available in 336x256 or 640x512 pixel formats with professional-grade 50mm or 100mm Germanium (Ge) objective lenses. The result is a wide variety of optical magnifications and the ability to detect an average-sized person up to 1,000 yards away. Eight distinct models optimized for both medium- and long-range performance are available.Dad will definitely appreciate the Armasight by FLIR Zeus Pro Thermal Weapon Sight’s simple and intuitive controls, functions and features. Zeus Pro models mount and dismount quickly and easily via a MIL-STD-1913 rail, and feature ballistic reticles, an electronic compass and an inclinometer for finer range estimation and target orientation. An included multi-pin connector provides video-out/video-in capability, external power supply and support of accessories like an optional DVR or modular range finder. Operation and functions are also supported by an included wireless remote.Think Dad already has everything? Think again. Say thanks this Father’s Day by presenting him with the unrivaled vision of Zeus. We can’t predict his reaction, but one thing’s for certain: even if he does have 92 kids, you just became his favorite again.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
