Rite Aid Corporation is a drugstore chain in the United States and a Fortune 500 company. It is headquartered in East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, near Camp Hill.[2][3] Rite Aid is the largest drugstore chain on the East Coast and the third largest in the U.S.
Rite Aid began in 1962 as a single store opened in Scranton, Pennsylvania called Thrift D Discount Center. After several years of growth, Rite Aid adopted its current name and debuted as a public company in 1968. Today, Rite Aid is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RAD. Its major competitors are CVS and Walgreens. In late 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid for $9.4 billion pending approval. But as of June 29th, 2017, over fear of antitrust regulations, Walgreens Boots Alliance will instead buy half of Rite Aid's stores for $5.18 billion.[4][5]

History[edit]
Alex Grass founded the Rite Aid chain in Scranton, Pennsylvania in September 1962.[6] The first store was called Thrift D Discount Center, a health and beauty aids store, without a pharmacy. It was an offshoot of Rack Rite Distributors, a subsidiary of his father-in law’s Lehrman & Sons which Alex Grass launched in 1958. The company rented and stocked racks with health and beauty aids in grocery stores. In 1965, Thrift D's 23rd store added a pharmacy and the company name was changed to Rite Aid.[7] Through acquisitions and new stores, Rite Aid quickly expanded into 5 northeast states by 1965. The chain was officially named Rite Aid Corporation in 1968 and made its debut on the American Stock Exchange. It moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1970. In 2011, Rite Aid was ranked #100 on Fortune 500 Largest U.S. Corporations.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]




Rite Aid in Tawas City, Michigan


Ten years after its first store opened, Rite Aid operated 267 locations in 10 states. 1983 marked a sales milestone of $1 billion. A 420-store acquisition along the east coast expanded Rite Aid's holdings beyond 2,000 locations, as did the acquisition of Gray Drug in 1987. Among the companies acquired was Baltimore, Maryland's Read's Drug Store. On April 10, 1989, Peoples Drug's 114 unit Lane Drug of Ohio was purchased by Rite Aid.[8]
Rite Aid acquired twenty-four Hook's Drug stores from Revco in 1994, selling nine of those stores to Perry Drug Stores, a Michigan-based pharmacy chain. One year later, in turn, the 224-store Perry chain was acquired by Rite Aid.[9][10] The 1,000-store West Coast chain Thrifty PayLess was later acquired in 1996. The acquisition of Thrifty PayLess included the Northwest-based Bi-Mart membership discount stores, which was sold off in 1998. Acquisitions of Harco, Inc. and K&B, Inc. brought Rite Aid into the Gulf Coast area.
In the 1990s, Rite Aid partnered with Carl Paladino's Ellicott Development Co. to expand the company's presence in Upstate New York.[11]
In 2015, Rite Aid purchased EnvisionRx, a pharmacy benefit manager, which owns subsidiary PBMs MedTrak, Connect Health Solutions, and Smith Premier Services.[12]
Partnership with GNC[edit]
General Nutrition Corporation (GNC) and Rite Aid formed a partnership in January 1999, bringing GNC mini-stores within the Rite Aid pharmacies. A partnership with drugstore.com in June 1999 allowed customers of Rite Aid to place medical prescription orders online for same-day, in-store pickup.
Company troubles[edit]




Rite Aid in Scott Depot, West Virginia


Rite Aid had a major accounting scandal that led to the departure (and subsequent jail time) of several top ranking executives, including CEO Martin Grass. Former Rite Aid vice chairman Franklin C. Brown is serving a 10-year sentence in a medium-security facility at Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, near Raleigh, North Carolina.[13] After serving six years in prison, Martin Grass was released on January 18, 2010.[14] Founder Alex Grass died of cancer on August 27, 2009.[15]
At the time, Rite Aid had just acquired Thrifty PayLess and was integrating the stores into the company. As a result, Leonard Green, who ran the investment firm that had sold those stores to Rite Aid, took control of the company and installed Mary Sammons from Fred Meyer as CEO.
In July 2001, Rite Aid agreed to improve their pharmacy complaint process by implementing a new program to respond to consumer complaints.[16]
On July 25, 2004, Rite Aid agreed to pay $7 million to settle allegations that the company had submitted false prescription claims to United States government health insurance programs.[17]
In August 2007, Rite Aid acquired approximately 1,850 Brooks/Eckerd Stores throughout the United States in hopes of improving their accessibility to a wider range of consumers. On December 21, 2007, The New York Times reported that Rite Aid had record-breaking losses that year, despite the acquisition of the Brooks and Eckerd chains.[18] The following fiscal quarter saw an increase in revenue but a sharp fall in net income as Rite Aid began the integration process. Rite Aid shares fell over 75% between September 2007 and September 2008, closing at a low of $0.98 on September 11, 2008. Rite Aid shares subsequently dropped to $0.20 on March 6, 2009, the all-time low as of 8 December 2011[update].[19]
Scott Cole & Associates, APC filed a class action lawsuit against Rite Aid Corporation on behalf of its salaried California Store Managers. It was alleged that Rite Aid failed to pay overtime to these workers and denied them their meal and rest periods. In 2009, the action settled for $6.9 million. Scott Cole & Associates - Rite Aid Class Action
In June 2010 John Standley was promoted from Chief Operating Officer to Chief Executive Officer, with former CEO Mary Sammons retaining her position as Chairperson;[20] Ken Martindale, previously co-President of Pathmark, was named Chief Operating Officer.[21]
Customer loyalty and rewards programs[edit]
The Wellness Plus card (officially rendered as wellness+) is Rite Aid's shopping rewards card that started nationwide on April 18, 2010. Membership is free, and benefits include free health and wellness benefits as well as shopping and prescription drug discounts and special prices. Earlier, in March 1984, Rite Aid had introduced Living More, a seniors' loyalty program which offered similar discounts and benefits. This program was very similar to the former Revco program which was called "Senior Shoppers" (Rite Aid had attempted to purchase Revco in 1996). The Living More program was being discontinued as of October 31, 2010, having been essentially superseded by the Wellness Plus card. However, as of 2013[update], the Wellness+ Plus card allows seniors to upgrade to the Wellness 65+ card, basically reintroducing the previous Living More benefits along with the newly created Wellness card. For example, seniors can receive 20% off on non-sale items every first Wednesday of each month. Rite Aid also offers free prescription delivery in select locations and holds some surveys for their loyal customers to share praise and complaints. Surveys are just like a platform where good and bad estimations are mingled together. Upon the completion of the customer satisfaction survey, customers are invited to try to win the grand prize and monthly prize as a feedback.[22]
In May 2015, Wellness Plus was integrated into the new American Express-backed Plenti rewards card, which Rite Aid shares with AT&T Mobility, Direct Energy, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, ExxonMobil, Hulu, Macy's, and Nationwide Insurance; Rite Aid was the only one of the group that had an existing loyalty program before the creation of Plenti. The new system requires Wellness Plus cardholders to receive new cards displaying both the Wellness Plus and Plenti logos.[23]
Merger with Eckerd and Brooks[edit]




A map of all Rite Aid stores as of September 2015


On August 23, 2006 the Wall Street Journal announced that Rite Aid would be buying the Eckerd Pharmacy and Brooks Pharmacy chains (Brooks Eckerd Pharmacy) from the Quebec-based Jean Coutu Group for US$3.4 billion, and merging the two chains into one dominant pharmacy system. The company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger on January 18, 2007.[2] After some store closures and the conversion of the two chains was completed, Rite Aid became the dominant drug store retailer in the Eastern U.S., and the third largest drug retailer nationwide (behind the faster-growing Walgreens and CVS chains).
Similar to what CVS experienced in the Chicago metropolitan area after its purchase of Albertsons drug store chains, the deal gave Rite Aid some locations that were too close to each other. (Only 23 store locations nationally were sold off to Walgreens, The Medicine Shoppe, or independent owners to meet federal regulations.) In many situations, especially Pennsylvania, where both chains were dominant and had roots in those states (Rite Aid originated in Scranton, while Eckerd has roots in western Pennsylvania via Erie for itself and Pittsburgh for converted Thrift Drug locations), there were now two Rite Aids as close as right next door to each other. However, in March 2008 some of these overlapping stores were closed, with the locations saying that they "moved" to a new address, when, in fact, they "moved" to the other Rite Aid that was nearby. Most of these stores that closed were pre-existing Rite Aids from before the Eckerd deal, since Eckerd had built newer, more modern locations with drive-thru pharmacies and larger space under ownership of both JCPenney and Jean Coutu Group, and the "moved to" sites were converted Eckerds. Employees at the closed stores were transferred to the nearby locations, so no layoffs were necessary.
Rite Aid had sold some locations to JCPenney's Thrift Drug chain in the mid-1990s shortly before JCPenney's acquisition of Eckerd, and had also sold all of their Massachusetts stores to Brooks in 1995, bringing some existing Eckerd and Brooks stores that were once Rite Aids full circle.
Because Eckerd was previously owned by JCPenney, Eckerd stores accepted JCPenney charge cards. Since the merger, all Rite Aids take JCPenney charge cards, a policy also followed by competitor CVS/pharmacy, which had earlier acquired most of the Eckerd chain in the southeastern United States.
Today, New York with 600 stores is home to the largest number of Rite Aids, followed by California and Pennsylvania with 583 and 540 respectively.[24]
Market exits[edit]
On January 4, 2008, Rite Aid Corporation announced that it would terminate operation of its 28 Rite Aid stores in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area and had signed an agreement to sell patient prescription files from that metro market to Walgreens. The company said Las Vegas was a non-core market that had not been contributing to overall results, and it had not opened a new store there since 1999. One Nevada store would remain open in Gardnerville, close to the border of California, where Rite Aid had more than 600 stores.[25]
On February 5, 2009, Rite Aid announced that it would terminate operations of 7 Rite Aid stores in San Francisco, California, along with 5 stores in Eastern Idaho through a sale to Walgreens.[26]
Failed merger with Walgreens[edit]
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid in a deal valued at $9.4 billion ($9 per share), pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal would result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains.[27] Walgreens plans to keep the Rite Aid name on existing locations when the deal goes through,[28] though the long term plans for the Rite Aid name are unknown. On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Fred's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for the price of $950 million for antitrust reasons.[29] In January 2017, Rite Aid and Walgreens cut the price of the merger to approximately $6.8 billion and delayed the closing date six months.[30] On January 31, 2017, it was reported that the workers' union 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, representing 6,000 Rite Aid Corp workers, was opposed to the sale of 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc.[31] However, the chances of preventing Walgreens from the acquisition because of Rite Aid employees protests and their pushing on the FTC are low.
On June 29th, 2017 Walgreens (WBA) announced the merger was cancelled. Walgreens further added that it would be purchasing 2,186 stores from Rite Aid for a total $5.2 Billion and pay-out a $325 Million dollar penalty for cancelling. Most experts thought that the merger would be completed within a few weeks. Both companies would have about 46% of the market share.[32] The revised deal--now not including Fred's at all--effectively will see Rite Aid exit the Southeastern United States.[33]

Rite Aid Corporation is a drugstore chain in the United States and a Fortune 500 company. It is headquartered in East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, near Camp Hill.[2][3] Rite Aid is the largest drugstore chain on the East Coast and the third largest in the U.S.
Rite Aid began in 1962 as a single store opened in Scranton, Pennsylvania called Thrift D Discount Center. After several years of growth, Rite Aid adopted its current name and debuted as a public company in 1968. Today, Rite Aid is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RAD. Its major competitors are CVS and Walgreens. In late 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid for $9.4 billion pending approval. But as of June 29th, 2017, over fear of antitrust regulations, Walgreens Boots Alliance will instead buy half of Rite Aid's stores for $5.18 billion.[4][5]

History[edit]
Alex Grass founded the Rite Aid chain in Scranton, Pennsylvania in September 1962.[6] The first store was called Thrift D Discount Center, a health and beauty aids store, without a pharmacy. It was an offshoot of Rack Rite Distributors, a subsidiary of his father-in law’s Lehrman & Sons which Alex Grass launched in 1958. The company rented and stocked racks with health and beauty aids in grocery stores. In 1965, Thrift D's 23rd store added a pharmacy and the company name was changed to Rite Aid.[7] Through acquisitions and new stores, Rite Aid quickly expanded into 5 northeast states by 1965. The chain was officially named Rite Aid Corporation in 1968 and made its debut on the American Stock Exchange. It moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1970. In 2011, Rite Aid was ranked #100 on Fortune 500 Largest U.S. Corporations.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]




Rite Aid in Tawas City, Michigan


Ten years after its first store opened, Rite Aid operated 267 locations in 10 states. 1983 marked a sales milestone of $1 billion. A 420-store acquisition along the east coast expanded Rite Aid's holdings beyond 2,000 locations, as did the acquisition of Gray Drug in 1987. Among the companies acquired was Baltimore, Maryland's Read's Drug Store. On April 10, 1989, Peoples Drug's 114 unit Lane Drug of Ohio was purchased by Rite Aid.[8]
Rite Aid acquired twenty-four Hook's Drug stores from Revco in 1994, selling nine of those stores to Perry Drug Stores, a Michigan-based pharmacy chain. One year later, in turn, the 224-store Perry chain was acquired by Rite Aid.[9][10] The 1,000-store West Coast chain Thrifty PayLess was later acquired in 1996. The acquisition of Thrifty PayLess included the Northwest-based Bi-Mart membership discount stores, which was sold off in 1998. Acquisitions of Harco, Inc. and K&B, Inc. brought Rite Aid into the Gulf Coast area.
In the 1990s, Rite Aid partnered with Carl Paladino's Ellicott Development Co. to expand the company's presence in Upstate New York.[11]
In 2015, Rite Aid purchased EnvisionRx, a pharmacy benefit manager, which owns subsidiary PBMs MedTrak, Connect Health Solutions, and Smith Premier Services.[12]
Partnership with GNC[edit]
General Nutrition Corporation (GNC) and Rite Aid formed a partnership in January 1999, bringing GNC mini-stores within the Rite Aid pharmacies. A partnership with drugstore.com in June 1999 allowed customers of Rite Aid to place medical prescription orders online for same-day, in-store pickup.
Company troubles[edit]




Rite Aid in Scott Depot, West Virginia


Rite Aid had a major accounting scandal that led to the departure (and subsequent jail time) of several top ranking executives, including CEO Martin Grass. Former Rite Aid vice chairman Franklin C. Brown is serving a 10-year sentence in a medium-security facility at Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, near Raleigh, North Carolina.[13] After serving six years in prison, Martin Grass was released on January 18, 2010.[14] Founder Alex Grass died of cancer on August 27, 2009.[15]
At the time, Rite Aid had just acquired Thrifty PayLess and was integrating the stores into the company. As a result, Leonard Green, who ran the investment firm that had sold those stores to Rite Aid, took control of the company and installed Mary Sammons from Fred Meyer as CEO.
In July 2001, Rite Aid agreed to improve their pharmacy complaint process by implementing a new program to respond to consumer complaints.[16]
On July 25, 2004, Rite Aid agreed to pay $7 million to settle allegations that the company had submitted false prescription claims to United States government health insurance programs.[17]
In August 2007, Rite Aid acquired approximately 1,850 Brooks/Eckerd Stores throughout the United States in hopes of improving their accessibility to a wider range of consumers. On December 21, 2007, The New York Times reported that Rite Aid had record-breaking losses that year, despite the acquisition of the Brooks and Eckerd chains.[18] The following fiscal quarter saw an increase in revenue but a sharp fall in net income as Rite Aid began the integration process. Rite Aid shares fell over 75% between September 2007 and September 2008, closing at a low of $0.98 on September 11, 2008. Rite Aid shares subsequently dropped to $0.20 on March 6, 2009, the all-time low as of 8 December 2011[update].[19]
Scott Cole & Associates, APC filed a class action lawsuit against Rite Aid Corporation on behalf of its salaried California Store Managers. It was alleged that Rite Aid failed to pay overtime to these workers and denied them their meal and rest periods. In 2009, the action settled for $6.9 million. Scott Cole & Associates - Rite Aid Class Action
In June 2010 John Standley was promoted from Chief Operating Officer to Chief Executive Officer, with former CEO Mary Sammons retaining her position as Chairperson;[20] Ken Martindale, previously co-President of Pathmark, was named Chief Operating Officer.[21]
Customer loyalty and rewards programs[edit]
The Wellness Plus card (officially rendered as wellness+) is Rite Aid's shopping rewards card that started nationwide on April 18, 2010. Membership is free, and benefits include free health and wellness benefits as well as shopping and prescription drug discounts and special prices. Earlier, in March 1984, Rite Aid had introduced Living More, a seniors' loyalty program which offered similar discounts and benefits. This program was very similar to the former Revco program which was called "Senior Shoppers" (Rite Aid had attempted to purchase Revco in 1996). The Living More program was being discontinued as of October 31, 2010, having been essentially superseded by the Wellness Plus card. However, as of 2013[update], the Wellness+ Plus card allows seniors to upgrade to the Wellness 65+ card, basically reintroducing the previous Living More benefits along with the newly created Wellness card. For example, seniors can receive 20% off on non-sale items every first Wednesday of each month. Rite Aid also offers free prescription delivery in select locations and holds some surveys for their loyal customers to share praise and complaints. Surveys are just like a platform where good and bad estimations are mingled together. Upon the completion of the customer satisfaction survey, customers are invited to try to win the grand prize and monthly prize as a feedback.[22]
In May 2015, Wellness Plus was integrated into the new American Express-backed Plenti rewards card, which Rite Aid shares with AT&T Mobility, Direct Energy, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, ExxonMobil, Hulu, Macy's, and Nationwide Insurance; Rite Aid was the only one of the group that had an existing loyalty program before the creation of Plenti. The new system requires Wellness Plus cardholders to receive new cards displaying both the Wellness Plus and Plenti logos.[23]
Merger with Eckerd and Brooks[edit]




A map of all Rite Aid stores as of September 2015


On August 23, 2006 the Wall Street Journal announced that Rite Aid would be buying the Eckerd Pharmacy and Brooks Pharmacy chains (Brooks Eckerd Pharmacy) from the Quebec-based Jean Coutu Group for US$3.4 billion, and merging the two chains into one dominant pharmacy system. The company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger on January 18, 2007.[2] After some store closures and the conversion of the two chains was completed, Rite Aid became the dominant drug store retailer in the Eastern U.S., and the third largest drug retailer nationwide (behind the faster-growing Walgreens and CVS chains).
Similar to what CVS experienced in the Chicago metropolitan area after its purchase of Albertsons drug store chains, the deal gave Rite Aid some locations that were too close to each other. (Only 23 store locations nationally were sold off to Walgreens, The Medicine Shoppe, or independent owners to meet federal regulations.) In many situations, especially Pennsylvania, where both chains were dominant and had roots in those states (Rite Aid originated in Scranton, while Eckerd has roots in western Pennsylvania via Erie for itself and Pittsburgh for converted Thrift Drug locations), there were now two Rite Aids as close as right next door to each other. However, in March 2008 some of these overlapping stores were closed, with the locations saying that they "moved" to a new address, when, in fact, they "moved" to the other Rite Aid that was nearby. Most of these stores that closed were pre-existing Rite Aids from before the Eckerd deal, since Eckerd had built newer, more modern locations with drive-thru pharmacies and larger space under ownership of both JCPenney and Jean Coutu Group, and the "moved to" sites were converted Eckerds. Employees at the closed stores were transferred to the nearby locations, so no layoffs were necessary.
Rite Aid had sold some locations to JCPenney's Thrift Drug chain in the mid-1990s shortly before JCPenney's acquisition of Eckerd, and had also sold all of their Massachusetts stores to Brooks in 1995, bringing some existing Eckerd and Brooks stores that were once Rite Aids full circle.
Because Eckerd was previously owned by JCPenney, Eckerd stores accepted JCPenney charge cards. Since the merger, all Rite Aids take JCPenney charge cards, a policy also followed by competitor CVS/pharmacy, which had earlier acquired most of the Eckerd chain in the southeastern United States.
Today, New York with 600 stores is home to the largest number of Rite Aids, followed by California and Pennsylvania with 583 and 540 respectively.[24]
Market exits[edit]
On January 4, 2008, Rite Aid Corporation announced that it would terminate operation of its 28 Rite Aid stores in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area and had signed an agreement to sell patient prescription files from that metro market to Walgreens. The company said Las Vegas was a non-core market that had not been contributing to overall results, and it had not opened a new store there since 1999. One Nevada store would remain open in Gardnerville, close to the border of California, where Rite Aid had more than 600 stores.[25]
On February 5, 2009, Rite Aid announced that it would terminate operations of 7 Rite Aid stores in San Francisco, California, along with 5 stores in Eastern Idaho through a sale to Walgreens.[26]
Failed merger with Walgreens[edit]
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid in a deal valued at $9.4 billion ($9 per share), pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal would result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains.[27] Walgreens plans to keep the Rite Aid name on existing locations when the deal goes through,[28] though the long term plans for the Rite Aid name are unknown. On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Fred's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for the price of $950 million for antitrust reasons.[29] In January 2017, Rite Aid and Walgreens cut the price of the merger to approximately $6.8 billion and delayed the closing date six months.[30] On January 31, 2017, it was reported that the workers' union 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, representing 6,000 Rite Aid Corp workers, was opposed to the sale of 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc.[31] However, the chances of preventing Walgreens from the acquisition because of Rite Aid employees protests and their pushing on the FTC are low.
On June 29th, 2017 Walgreens (WBA) announced the merger was cancelled. Walgreens further added that it would be purchasing 2,186 stores from Rite Aid for a total $5.2 Billion and pay-out a $325 Million dollar penalty for cancelling. Most experts thought that the merger would be completed within a few weeks. Both companies would have about 46% of the market share.[32] The revised deal--now not including Fred's at all--effectively will see Rite Aid exit the Southeastern United States.[33]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Walgreens terminates Rite Aid merger, replaces with agreement to buy 2,186 stores
Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday that it has terminated its merger agreement with Rite Aid Corp.  and has instead agreed to buy 2,186 Rite Aid stores and related assets. The consideration for the deal will be $5.175 billion in cash and the option for Rite Aid to become a member of the Walgreens group purchasing organization, an option that can be exercised through May 2019 and is subject to certain conditions. This new agreement replaces the merger agreement announced October 2015 and amended January 2017, along with the agreement to divest some Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc. , which was announced in December 2016. The agreement with Fred's has also been terminated and Walgreens will pay a $325 million termination fee. After the new transaction is approved, Walgreens will acquire the Rite Aid stores and assets over about six months and will eventually convert them to the Walgreens brand. Walgreens expects the transaction to be "modestly accretive" to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year after the initial closing, and expects synergies totaling $400 million that will be fully realized within three to four years. Walgreens shares are up 1.7% in premarket trading, Rite Aid shares are down 6.1%, and Fred's shares are down 27%. Walgreens shares are down nearly 7% for the year so far while Rite Aid shares are down more than 52% and Fred's are down 33.6% for the period. The S&P 500 index  is up 9% for 2017 to date.

Fred's stock plunges after deal to buy some Rite Aid stores was terminated
Shares of Fred's Inc.  plunged 27% in premarket trade Thursday, after the agreement to buy 865 Rite Aid Corp.  was terminated. The agreement was originally announced on Dec. 20, 2016. The termination comes after Rite Aid agreed to sell 2,186 stores to Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. , which also terminates the companies' merger agreement. Fred's said it will receive a $25 million termination fee. "This is a disappointing outcome; however, the termination of the transaction has no impact on the Company's transformation strategy or our ability to execute," said Chief Executive Michael Bloom. The pharmacy and general merchandise chain's stock selloff puts it on track to open at the lowest level seen since Nov. 16, 2016. The stock had tumbled 34% year to date through Wednesday, while the S&P 500  had gained 9.0%.

Walgreens Boots Alliance tops earnings estimates, lifts low end of 2017 guidance
Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc.  said Thursday it had net income of $1.162 billion, or $1.07 a share, in the second quarter, up from $1.103 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the year-earlier period. Adjusted per-share earnings came to $1.33, ahead of the FactSet consensus of $1.30. Sales rose to $30.1 billion from $29.5 billion, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $29.7 billion. "Our results this quarter continued to meet our expectations as strategic partnerships brought more patients to our U.S. pharmacies," Chief Executive Stefano Pessina said in a statement. Separately, the company also unveiled a new agreement with Rite Aid Inc. , replacing a 2015 merger agreement. The company raised the lower end of its 2017 EPS guidance to $4.98 to $5.08 from a prior $4.90 to $5.08. Shares rose 1.8% premarket, but are down 7% in 2017, while the S&P 500  has gained 9%.

Fred's adopts poison pill following increased 'volatility' in share price
Fred's Inc.  said Wednesday that it has adopted a short-term shareholder rights plan, also known as a "poison pill," which will expire on Sept. 25. The general merchandise and pharmacy retailer said it has adopted the plan as a result of "increased trading volatility" in its shares, and in anticipation of activity related to its associated asset purchase agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.  and Rite Aid Corp. , pending those companies' merger. The plan is designed to reduce the likelihood that an entity would gain control of the company. "It was not adopted in response to any specific takeover bid or other proposal to acquire control of the company," Fred's said in a statement. The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, had lost 4.3% on Tuesday after soaring 23% on Monday. It has plunged 35% year to date, while the SPDR S&P Retail ETF  has lost 8.7% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.1%.

Rite Aid Corporation is a drugstore chain in the United States and a Fortune 500 company. It is headquartered in East Pennsboro Township, Cumberland County, Pennsylvania, near Camp Hill.[2][3] Rite Aid is the largest drugstore chain on the East Coast and the third largest in the U.S.
Rite Aid began in 1962 as a single store opened in Scranton, Pennsylvania called Thrift D Discount Center. After several years of growth, Rite Aid adopted its current name and debuted as a public company in 1968. Today, Rite Aid is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker RAD. Its major competitors are CVS and Walgreens. In late 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid for $9.4 billion pending approval. But as of June 29th, 2017, over fear of antitrust regulations, Walgreens Boots Alliance will instead buy half of Rite Aid's stores for $5.18 billion.[4][5]

History[edit]
Alex Grass founded the Rite Aid chain in Scranton, Pennsylvania in September 1962.[6] The first store was called Thrift D Discount Center, a health and beauty aids store, without a pharmacy. It was an offshoot of Rack Rite Distributors, a subsidiary of his father-in law’s Lehrman & Sons which Alex Grass launched in 1958. The company rented and stocked racks with health and beauty aids in grocery stores. In 1965, Thrift D's 23rd store added a pharmacy and the company name was changed to Rite Aid.[7] Through acquisitions and new stores, Rite Aid quickly expanded into 5 northeast states by 1965. The chain was officially named Rite Aid Corporation in 1968 and made its debut on the American Stock Exchange. It moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1970. In 2011, Rite Aid was ranked #100 on Fortune 500 Largest U.S. Corporations.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]




Rite Aid in Tawas City, Michigan


Ten years after its first store opened, Rite Aid operated 267 locations in 10 states. 1983 marked a sales milestone of $1 billion. A 420-store acquisition along the east coast expanded Rite Aid's holdings beyond 2,000 locations, as did the acquisition of Gray Drug in 1987. Among the companies acquired was Baltimore, Maryland's Read's Drug Store. On April 10, 1989, Peoples Drug's 114 unit Lane Drug of Ohio was purchased by Rite Aid.[8]
Rite Aid acquired twenty-four Hook's Drug stores from Revco in 1994, selling nine of those stores to Perry Drug Stores, a Michigan-based pharmacy chain. One year later, in turn, the 224-store Perry chain was acquired by Rite Aid.[9][10] The 1,000-store West Coast chain Thrifty PayLess was later acquired in 1996. The acquisition of Thrifty PayLess included the Northwest-based Bi-Mart membership discount stores, which was sold off in 1998. Acquisitions of Harco, Inc. and K&B, Inc. brought Rite Aid into the Gulf Coast area.
In the 1990s, Rite Aid partnered with Carl Paladino's Ellicott Development Co. to expand the company's presence in Upstate New York.[11]
In 2015, Rite Aid purchased EnvisionRx, a pharmacy benefit manager, which owns subsidiary PBMs MedTrak, Connect Health Solutions, and Smith Premier Services.[12]
Partnership with GNC[edit]
General Nutrition Corporation (GNC) and Rite Aid formed a partnership in January 1999, bringing GNC mini-stores within the Rite Aid pharmacies. A partnership with drugstore.com in June 1999 allowed customers of Rite Aid to place medical prescription orders online for same-day, in-store pickup.
Company troubles[edit]




Rite Aid in Scott Depot, West Virginia


Rite Aid had a major accounting scandal that led to the departure (and subsequent jail time) of several top ranking executives, including CEO Martin Grass. Former Rite Aid vice chairman Franklin C. Brown is serving a 10-year sentence in a medium-security facility at Federal Correctional Complex, Butner, near Raleigh, North Carolina.[13] After serving six years in prison, Martin Grass was released on January 18, 2010.[14] Founder Alex Grass died of cancer on August 27, 2009.[15]
At the time, Rite Aid had just acquired Thrifty PayLess and was integrating the stores into the company. As a result, Leonard Green, who ran the investment firm that had sold those stores to Rite Aid, took control of the company and installed Mary Sammons from Fred Meyer as CEO.
In July 2001, Rite Aid agreed to improve their pharmacy complaint process by implementing a new program to respond to consumer complaints.[16]
On July 25, 2004, Rite Aid agreed to pay $7 million to settle allegations that the company had submitted false prescription claims to United States government health insurance programs.[17]
In August 2007, Rite Aid acquired approximately 1,850 Brooks/Eckerd Stores throughout the United States in hopes of improving their accessibility to a wider range of consumers. On December 21, 2007, The New York Times reported that Rite Aid had record-breaking losses that year, despite the acquisition of the Brooks and Eckerd chains.[18] The following fiscal quarter saw an increase in revenue but a sharp fall in net income as Rite Aid began the integration process. Rite Aid shares fell over 75% between September 2007 and September 2008, closing at a low of $0.98 on September 11, 2008. Rite Aid shares subsequently dropped to $0.20 on March 6, 2009, the all-time low as of 8 December 2011[update].[19]
Scott Cole & Associates, APC filed a class action lawsuit against Rite Aid Corporation on behalf of its salaried California Store Managers. It was alleged that Rite Aid failed to pay overtime to these workers and denied them their meal and rest periods. In 2009, the action settled for $6.9 million. Scott Cole & Associates - Rite Aid Class Action
In June 2010 John Standley was promoted from Chief Operating Officer to Chief Executive Officer, with former CEO Mary Sammons retaining her position as Chairperson;[20] Ken Martindale, previously co-President of Pathmark, was named Chief Operating Officer.[21]
Customer loyalty and rewards programs[edit]
The Wellness Plus card (officially rendered as wellness+) is Rite Aid's shopping rewards card that started nationwide on April 18, 2010. Membership is free, and benefits include free health and wellness benefits as well as shopping and prescription drug discounts and special prices. Earlier, in March 1984, Rite Aid had introduced Living More, a seniors' loyalty program which offered similar discounts and benefits. This program was very similar to the former Revco program which was called "Senior Shoppers" (Rite Aid had attempted to purchase Revco in 1996). The Living More program was being discontinued as of October 31, 2010, having been essentially superseded by the Wellness Plus card. However, as of 2013[update], the Wellness+ Plus card allows seniors to upgrade to the Wellness 65+ card, basically reintroducing the previous Living More benefits along with the newly created Wellness card. For example, seniors can receive 20% off on non-sale items every first Wednesday of each month. Rite Aid also offers free prescription delivery in select locations and holds some surveys for their loyal customers to share praise and complaints. Surveys are just like a platform where good and bad estimations are mingled together. Upon the completion of the customer satisfaction survey, customers are invited to try to win the grand prize and monthly prize as a feedback.[22]
In May 2015, Wellness Plus was integrated into the new American Express-backed Plenti rewards card, which Rite Aid shares with AT&T Mobility, Direct Energy, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, ExxonMobil, Hulu, Macy's, and Nationwide Insurance; Rite Aid was the only one of the group that had an existing loyalty program before the creation of Plenti. The new system requires Wellness Plus cardholders to receive new cards displaying both the Wellness Plus and Plenti logos.[23]
Merger with Eckerd and Brooks[edit]




A map of all Rite Aid stores as of September 2015


On August 23, 2006 the Wall Street Journal announced that Rite Aid would be buying the Eckerd Pharmacy and Brooks Pharmacy chains (Brooks Eckerd Pharmacy) from the Quebec-based Jean Coutu Group for US$3.4 billion, and merging the two chains into one dominant pharmacy system. The company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger on January 18, 2007.[2] After some store closures and the conversion of the two chains was completed, Rite Aid became the dominant drug store retailer in the Eastern U.S., and the third largest drug retailer nationwide (behind the faster-growing Walgreens and CVS chains).
Similar to what CVS experienced in the Chicago metropolitan area after its purchase of Albertsons drug store chains, the deal gave Rite Aid some locations that were too close to each other. (Only 23 store locations nationally were sold off to Walgreens, The Medicine Shoppe, or independent owners to meet federal regulations.) In many situations, especially Pennsylvania, where both chains were dominant and had roots in those states (Rite Aid originated in Scranton, while Eckerd has roots in western Pennsylvania via Erie for itself and Pittsburgh for converted Thrift Drug locations), there were now two Rite Aids as close as right next door to each other. However, in March 2008 some of these overlapping stores were closed, with the locations saying that they "moved" to a new address, when, in fact, they "moved" to the other Rite Aid that was nearby. Most of these stores that closed were pre-existing Rite Aids from before the Eckerd deal, since Eckerd had built newer, more modern locations with drive-thru pharmacies and larger space under ownership of both JCPenney and Jean Coutu Group, and the "moved to" sites were converted Eckerds. Employees at the closed stores were transferred to the nearby locations, so no layoffs were necessary.
Rite Aid had sold some locations to JCPenney's Thrift Drug chain in the mid-1990s shortly before JCPenney's acquisition of Eckerd, and had also sold all of their Massachusetts stores to Brooks in 1995, bringing some existing Eckerd and Brooks stores that were once Rite Aids full circle.
Because Eckerd was previously owned by JCPenney, Eckerd stores accepted JCPenney charge cards. Since the merger, all Rite Aids take JCPenney charge cards, a policy also followed by competitor CVS/pharmacy, which had earlier acquired most of the Eckerd chain in the southeastern United States.
Today, New York with 600 stores is home to the largest number of Rite Aids, followed by California and Pennsylvania with 583 and 540 respectively.[24]
Market exits[edit]
On January 4, 2008, Rite Aid Corporation announced that it would terminate operation of its 28 Rite Aid stores in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area and had signed an agreement to sell patient prescription files from that metro market to Walgreens. The company said Las Vegas was a non-core market that had not been contributing to overall results, and it had not opened a new store there since 1999. One Nevada store would remain open in Gardnerville, close to the border of California, where Rite Aid had more than 600 stores.[25]
On February 5, 2009, Rite Aid announced that it would terminate operations of 7 Rite Aid stores in San Francisco, California, along with 5 stores in Eastern Idaho through a sale to Walgreens.[26]
Failed merger with Walgreens[edit]
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid in a deal valued at $9.4 billion ($9 per share), pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal would result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains.[27] Walgreens plans to keep the Rite Aid name on existing locations when the deal goes through,[28] though the long term plans for the Rite Aid name are unknown. On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Fred's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for the price of $950 million for antitrust reasons.[29] In January 2017, Rite Aid and Walgreens cut the price of the merger to approximately $6.8 billion and delayed the closing date six months.[30] On January 31, 2017, it was reported that the workers' union 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, representing 6,000 Rite Aid Corp workers, was opposed to the sale of 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc.[31] However, the chances of preventing Walgreens from the acquisition because of Rite Aid employees protests and their pushing on the FTC are low.
On June 29th, 2017 Walgreens (WBA) announced the merger was cancelled. Walgreens further added that it would be purchasing 2,186 stores from Rite Aid for a total $5.2 Billion and pay-out a $325 Million dollar penalty for cancelling. Most experts thought that the merger would be completed within a few weeks. Both companies would have about 46% of the market share.[32] The revised deal--now not including Fred's at all--effectively will see Rite Aid exit the Southeastern United States.[33]

The Wellness Plus card (officially rendered as wellness+) is Rite Aid's shopping rewards card that started nationwide on April 18, 2010. Membership is free, and benefits include free health and wellness benefits as well as shopping and prescription drug discounts and special prices. Earlier, in March 1984, Rite Aid had introduced Living More, a seniors' loyalty program which offered similar discounts and benefits. This program was very similar to the former Revco program which was called "Senior Shoppers" (Rite Aid had attempted to purchase Revco in 1996). The Living More program was being discontinued as of October 31, 2010, having been essentially superseded by the Wellness Plus card. However, as of 2013[update], the Wellness+ Plus card allows seniors to upgrade to the Wellness 65+ card, basically reintroducing the previous Living More benefits along with the newly created Wellness card. For example, seniors can receive 20% off on non-sale items every first Wednesday of each month. Rite Aid also offers free prescription delivery in select locations and holds some surveys for their loyal customers to share praise and complaints. Surveys are just like a platform where good and bad estimations are mingled together. Upon the completion of the customer satisfaction survey, customers are invited to try to win the grand prize and monthly prize as a feedback.[22]
In May 2015, Wellness Plus was integrated into the new American Express-backed Plenti rewards card, which Rite Aid shares with AT&T Mobility, Direct Energy, Enterprise Rent-A-Car, ExxonMobil, Hulu, Macy's, and Nationwide Insurance; Rite Aid was the only one of the group that had an existing loyalty program before the creation of Plenti. The new system requires Wellness Plus cardholders to receive new cards displaying both the Wellness Plus and Plenti logos.[23]
Merger with Eckerd and Brooks[edit]




A map of all Rite Aid stores as of September 2015


On August 23, 2006 the Wall Street Journal announced that Rite Aid would be buying the Eckerd Pharmacy and Brooks Pharmacy chains (Brooks Eckerd Pharmacy) from the Quebec-based Jean Coutu Group for US$3.4 billion, and merging the two chains into one dominant pharmacy system. The company's shareholders overwhelmingly approved the merger on January 18, 2007.[2] After some store closures and the conversion of the two chains was completed, Rite Aid became the dominant drug store retailer in the Eastern U.S., and the third largest drug retailer nationwide (behind the faster-growing Walgreens and CVS chains).
Similar to what CVS experienced in the Chicago metropolitan area after its purchase of Albertsons drug store chains, the deal gave Rite Aid some locations that were too close to each other. (Only 23 store locations nationally were sold off to Walgreens, The Medicine Shoppe, or independent owners to meet federal regulations.) In many situations, especially Pennsylvania, where both chains were dominant and had roots in those states (Rite Aid originated in Scranton, while Eckerd has roots in western Pennsylvania via Erie for itself and Pittsburgh for converted Thrift Drug locations), there were now two Rite Aids as close as right next door to each other. However, in March 2008 some of these overlapping stores were closed, with the locations saying that they "moved" to a new address, when, in fact, they "moved" to the other Rite Aid that was nearby. Most of these stores that closed were pre-existing Rite Aids from before the Eckerd deal, since Eckerd had built newer, more modern locations with drive-thru pharmacies and larger space under ownership of both JCPenney and Jean Coutu Group, and the "moved to" sites were converted Eckerds. Employees at the closed stores were transferred to the nearby locations, so no layoffs were necessary.
Rite Aid had sold some locations to JCPenney's Thrift Drug chain in the mid-1990s shortly before JCPenney's acquisition of Eckerd, and had also sold all of their Massachusetts stores to Brooks in 1995, bringing some existing Eckerd and Brooks stores that were once Rite Aids full circle.
Because Eckerd was previously owned by JCPenney, Eckerd stores accepted JCPenney charge cards. Since the merger, all Rite Aids take JCPenney charge cards, a policy also followed by competitor CVS/pharmacy, which had earlier acquired most of the Eckerd chain in the southeastern United States.
Today, New York with 600 stores is home to the largest number of Rite Aids, followed by California and Pennsylvania with 583 and 540 respectively.[24]
Market exits[edit]
On January 4, 2008, Rite Aid Corporation announced that it would terminate operation of its 28 Rite Aid stores in the Las Vegas, Nevada, area and had signed an agreement to sell patient prescription files from that metro market to Walgreens. The company said Las Vegas was a non-core market that had not been contributing to overall results, and it had not opened a new store there since 1999. One Nevada store would remain open in Gardnerville, close to the border of California, where Rite Aid had more than 600 stores.[25]
On February 5, 2009, Rite Aid announced that it would terminate operations of 7 Rite Aid stores in San Francisco, California, along with 5 stores in Eastern Idaho through a sale to Walgreens.[26]
Failed merger with Walgreens[edit]
On October 27, 2015, Walgreens announced that it would acquire Rite Aid in a deal valued at $9.4 billion ($9 per share), pending regulatory and shareholder approval. The deal would result in a merger of two of the United States' three largest pharmacy chains.[27] Walgreens plans to keep the Rite Aid name on existing locations when the deal goes through,[28] though the long term plans for the Rite Aid name are unknown. On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Fred's would acquire 865 Rite Aid stores as a result of the merger for the price of $950 million for antitrust reasons.[29] In January 2017, Rite Aid and Walgreens cut the price of the merger to approximately $6.8 billion and delayed the closing date six months.[30] On January 31, 2017, it was reported that the workers' union 1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, representing 6,000 Rite Aid Corp workers, was opposed to the sale of 865 Rite Aid stores to Fred's Inc.[31] However, the chances of preventing Walgreens from the acquisition because of Rite Aid employees protests and their pushing on the FTC are low.
On June 29th, 2017 Walgreens (WBA) announced the merger was cancelled. Walgreens further added that it would be purchasing 2,186 stores from Rite Aid for a total $5.2 Billion and pay-out a $325 Million dollar penalty for cancelling. Most experts thought that the merger would be completed within a few weeks. Both companies would have about 46% of the market share.[32] The revised deal--now not including Fred's at all--effectively will see Rite Aid exit the Southeastern United States.[33]

Its retail stores provide pharmacy services and sell prescription drugs and front-end products.

On June 29, 2017, Rite Aid entered into an agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to sell 2,186 Rite Aid Stores and related assets for $5.175 Billion. The transaction is expected to close within six months but is subject to antitrust clearance. The 2,186 stores included in the agreement are primarily located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States. The three distribution centers included in the agreement are located in Dayville, Conn., Philadelphia and Spartanburg, S.C. The company also announced the termination of the agreement, announced on October 27, 2015 under which WBA would have acquired all outstanding shares of Rite Aid on account of not receiving regulatory approval.   

Rite Aid acquired EnvisionRX in 2015.

•Rite Aid corporation is considering a move onto virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and is managing an ongoing server virtualization effort.
•The company has begun a move onto cloud computing, and cost is the primary concern for all future cloud projects.
•The company maintains a consistent focus on data analysis, point of sales systems (POS), and telemedicine services, largely managed by the Pharmacy and Store Systems groups.
•The IT department is working to maintain its current systems, pending the enterprise roll out of an up to date Windows OS in 2014.
•Rite Aid is nearing the completion of a bring your own device (BYOD) platform to its retail stores.  The project began in 2012 with an implementation for corporate employees.

IT Structure:
•Personnel working in the Supply Chain group handle IT procurement and vendor relations. All of Rite Aid's possible vendors must be authorized through the Vendor Management Office, which can be contacted at vendormgmt@riteaid.com.
•The IT department's staff is spread across three locations in Pennsylvania: Etters, Shiremans Town, and the headquarters in Camp Hill.

IT Intelligence:
2013:
•The company completed an Avaya VoIP implementation project that began in 2012.
•The Rite Aid network environment is primarily run on Cisco and Nortel equipment.

2012:
•Rite Aid selected WorkPlace OnLine, a schedule and attendance cloud-based platform from WorkPlace Systems Inc. that will be utilized within the company's pharmacy division.

CPSC, Rite Aid Corp. Announce Recall of Two Flying Dolls

































FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


Company Phone Number: (888) 468-4356, ext. 8302 




February 17, 1998


 




Release # 98-067





WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Rite Aid Corp. of Camp Hill, Pa., is recalling about 12,000 Cyber Fighter and Flying Angel dolls. During use, the wings of these flying dolls can break off, and possibly cause serious eye injuries to consumers.CPSC and Rite Aid have received one report of a doll's wing breaking off during use,resulting in a laceration above the eye of a nearby child.The Cyber Fighter doll, measuring about 5 1/2 inches tall, is made of plastic, and has black pants, silver arms, a helmet with black goggles, gold boots and a yellow lightning bolt on a red vest. Its arms are strapped onto black wings with red tips, which are outstretched from the doll's body. The doll can be attached to a blue plastic launcher with gold trim by a stand under its feet. The words, "CHAP MEI CHINA" are printed on the launcher. The Flying Angel doll, measuring about 6 inches tall, is dressed in a blue and purple tutu with gold trim. The doll has pink stockings and a purple bow in its orange hair. Its outstretched arms are attached to pink wings with red tips. The launcher is pink with the words, "Flying Angel" written in the white trim. The handle that pulls the string is gold.Both dolls are packaged on colorful cardboad backers with their launcher and are covered with clear plastic. "Agglo" and "MADE IN CHINA" are printed on the bottom front of the packages.Rite Aid drug stores in the eastern U.S. sold the dolls from February 1997 through January 1998 for about $3.Consumers should stop using the dolls immediately and return them to any Rite Aid store for a refund. For more information about this recall, consumers should call Rite Aid Corp. toll-free at (888) 468-4356, ext. 8302 between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. EST Monday through Friday.




The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is charged with protecting the public from unreasonable risks of injury or death associated with the use of
          thousands of types of consumer products under the agency’s jurisdiction. Deaths, injuries, and property damage from consumer product incidents cost the
          nation more than $1 trillion annually. CPSC is committed to protecting consumers and families from products that pose a fire, electrical, chemical or
          mechanical hazard. CPSC's work to help ensure the safety of consumer products - such as toys, cribs, power tools, cigarette lighters and household
          chemicals -– contributed to a decline in the rate of deaths and injuries associated with consumer products over the past 40 years.
Federal law bars any person from selling products subject to a publicly-announced voluntary recall by a manufacturer or a mandatory recall ordered by the
          Commission.
To report a dangerous product or a product-related injury go online to www.SaferProducts.gov or call CPSC's Hotline at 800-638-2772 or teletypewriter at
          301-595-7054 for the hearing impaired. Consumers can obtain news release and recall information at www.cpsc.gov, on Twitter @USCPSC or by subscribing
          to CPSC's free e-mail newsletters.

What is wellness+ with Plenti? 

wellness+ with Plenti enhances Rite Aid's wellness+ program by partnering with Plenti to deliver even more value to our customers.
Through wellness+ with Plenti, our customers can use one card and earn two kinds of points. 

Members will continue to earn wellness+ points toward various benefits at Rite Aid including discounts of up to 20% off storewide, exclusive sale prices and 24/7 access to a pharmacist. 
+UP Rewards are transitioning to Plenti points. Members will be able to earn Plenti points whenever they make qualifying purchases at Rite Aid and other Plenti partners. Plenti points can be used for up to two years at Rite Aid and at certain other Plenti partners. 




What are Plenti points? 

Plenti points are rewards earned and used with Plenti partners. Members of wellness+ with Plenti can earn Plenti points when they make eligible purchases at Rite Aid and other Plenti partners. 
What Rite Aid currently calls +UP Rewards have transitioned to Plenti points. Plenti points give you even more ways to save since they can be used for savings at Rite Aid as well as certain other Plenti partners. Customers have at least two years to use them.


What is the difference between wellness+ points and Plenti points? Are wellness+ points going away? 

wellness+ points are points earned toward Bronze, Silver and Gold status discounts exclusively at Rite Aid. Members can earn one wellness+ point for one dollar spent on eligible front-end purchases and up to 25 wellness+ points for every eligible prescription.
Effective January 1, 2016, members with 0 - 499 points will be Bronze status and earn (1) 10% off one-time savings pass with every 100 wellness+ points earned until they reach 499 points. With 500 wellness+ points, members earn Silver status and qualify for 10% off nearly the entire Rite Aid store for a year. And with 1,000 wellness+ points, members earn Gold status and qualify for 20% off nearly the entire Rite Aid store for a year.
Plenti points are a new, additional set of points that can be earned at Rite Aid and other Plenti partners including AT&T, Exxon, Mobil, Macy's, Nationwide, Direct Energy and Hulu. Members can then use those points for savings at certain Plenti partners.



What is happening to +UP Rewards?  

+UP rewards have transitioned to Plenti points. Members of wellness+ with Plenti can earn Plenti points when they make eligible purchases at Rite Aid and other Plenti partners. 
Plenti points offer the same savings as +UPs. Additionally, Plenti points offer even more value to customers since they can be used for savings at Rite Aid as well as certain other Plenti partners and customers have at least two years to use them.



And what about my other wellness+ benefits? 

Any existing wellness+ points and status discounts you already earned will carry over to wellness+ with Plenti as soon as you link your new card.
In addition to exclusive members-only sale pricing and earning points toward savings of up to 20% storewide, both existing wellness+ members and new wellness+ with Plenti members will enjoy the following wellness+ benefits:

24/7 access to a Rite Aid Pharmacist,
Exclusive money-saving offers and information by email, and
The option to load coupons direct to card.
 Members will continue to earn:
            
1 wellness+ point for one dollar spent on eligible purchases they make at Rite Aid when they scan their new Plenti card at the register,
25 wellness+ points for every non-government funded prescription purchased when using their Plenti card,
And 1 wellness+ point for every dollar spent on copays (not to exceed 25 points per prescription) for government-funded prescriptions.



wellness+ points will continue to reset at the end of each year, but all earned Bronze, Silver, and Gold status discounts remain active through the end of the next calendar year.



When can I sign up for wellness+ with Plenti? 

wellness+ with Plenti sign up is available now. Visit riteaid.com/wellness to learn more and sign up today.



I'm a current wellness+ member, will I be automatically enrolled in wellness+ with Plenti? 

All current wellness+ members will need to sign up for the wellness+ with Plenti program so they can earn Plenti points (while enjoying all existing wellness+ benefits) on items they buy every day at Plenti partners and can use them to save at Rite Aid and certain other Plenti partners for at least two years.
