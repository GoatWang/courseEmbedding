In a rare criminal indictment of a health care executive, a Texas grand jury has charged the chief executive of a large Minnesota med-tech firm with conspiring to sell a varicose-vein treatment device for unapproved uses.
Howard Root, 53, longtime CEO of Maple Grove-based Vascular Solutions, was indicted Thursday by a San Antonio grand jury on one felony count of conspiracy and eight misdemeanor charges of selling unapproved and adulterated medical devices. Prosecutors filed the same charges against the corporation, which has grown into one of Minnesota’s biggest device makers.
Prosecutors say the company marketed a device called the Vari-Lase to seal off veins deep in the leg, even though the device was approved only to treat superficial blood vessels near the surface of the skin. The company marketed the device for use on the deeper perforator veins even after a clinical trial recorded numerous adverse results in patients, according to the indictment.


“These charges involve a deceptive sales campaign led by the CEO of a public company,” Joyce Branda, acting assistant attorney general for the Justice Department Civil Division, said in a prepared statement. “We will take action to hold corporations and their leaders responsible when they violate laws intended to protect public health.”
Root, a lawyer and entrepreneur who co-founded the company in 1997, said he intends to plead not guilty.
“Allegations that we conducted an off-label campaign resulting in almost no sales are absurd and will not stand,” Root said in a prepared statement. “We welcome the chance to demonstrate the truth before the court.”
The Vari-Lase “short kit,” as it is referred to by the company, was supposed to revolutionize vericose-vein treatment and generate major revenue for the company because it eliminated the need to surgically strip out diseased veins. Doctors simply insert a fiber-optic cable through a catheter to deliver laser energy inside a vein, sealing it off.

But the device was voluntarily pulled from the market in July after the company paid $520,000 to settle a civil whistleblower lawsuit alleging the same off-label marketing at issue in the new criminal case.
The Food and Drug Administration approved use of the Vari-Lase short kit in 2007, but only to treat superficial veins that lie near the surface of the skin. Although it is often legal for doctors to put devices to unapproved uses, it’s generally illegal for companies to specifically promote any unapproved uses.
Vascular Solutions employs about 400 people and its $110.5 million in sales in 2013 placed it 64th in the Star Tribune 100 list of biggest publicly held companies in Minnesota.
While vowing to fight the charges in court, the company didn’t hold back in public statements about the case. “The indictment is the profoundly flawed product of government attorneys who have conducted a misguided and abusive investigation,” a company statement said.
The company also downplayed the significance of the device in Vascular Solutions’ product catalog, noting that it created revenue of $534,000 over seven years, or 0.1 percent of company sales. Executives promised to reveal what it called the motives for prosecutors’ “abusive conduct” in future court filings.

Vascular Solution’s stock price on Nasdaq dipped Thursday and then recovered, ending the day virtually unchanged near its all-time high, at $30.59.
The criminal case stems from allegations in a civil whistleblower lawsuit filed in 2010 by a former sales representative.
Hundreds of whistleblower cases are filed against health care companies each year, but the government joins only a small fraction, as it did in the civil case against Vascular Solutions.
Even after the Food and Drug Administration announced in 2010 it would bring more cases against executives, only a handful have been filed. The most prominent was in 2011, when four executives of the Johnson & Johnson spine division Synthes were sentenced to prison time for failing to stop the company from doing an unauthorized clinical trial of a new bone cement. Several patients died during the experimentation.
Vascular Solutions denies that any of its patients’ adverse events were that severe. However, one complication alleged in court files involves deep-vein thrombosis, which can lead to a potentially life-threatening pulmonary embolism.

The Justice Department alleges business pressures drove off-label promotion at Vascular Solutions.
In 2009, Vari-Lase held about 35 percent of the market for devices used to seal off varicose veins. A competing company, meanwhile, touted a device that also had approval to treat deeper veins.
Vascular Solutions sought the same FDA approval, and launched a clinical trial to bolster its claim. The government says 14 percent of the patients in that study had small clots emerge from perforator veins into deeper veins, creating a risk of deep vein thrombosis, while 25 percent had an “abnormal burning sensation” six months after the procedure.
“Internally, Vascular Solutions employees admitted that the trial was ‘lacking some key data points’ and that the data was … ‘less than optimal,’ ” the Justice Department said in its whistleblower suit. Yet “the Vice President of Marketing sent an e-mail to the entire sales force indicating that the company had “completed a successful clinical trial on using laser for perforators.”
The company disputes that the internal communications indicated wrongdoing.

Praise for Cardiac ArrestAmazon ReviewsPraise for Cardiac Arrest
The Howard Root story is a harbinger of a newly aggressive government prosecution strategy – one that is troubling. Simply an urge to have bodies swinging from lamp posts isn’t a very edifying way for the Justice Department to proceed.
Michael Mukasey, former U.S. Attorney General
A gripping case study on the perils of big government. Read it before you’re next.
Pete Hegseth, Author of In the Arena and Fox News contributor

Howard Root’s account of the government’s ruthless prosecution of him and his company reads like a nightmare tale. His is an eloquent and important voice on a subject that is of vital interest not just to the medical device industry, but to anyone – patients and physicians – who benefits from the products the industry brings forth. This book must be read by everyone in the med-tech industry as a wake-up call about one of the biggest threats to growth and innovation for one of America’s most important industries.
—David Cassak, Editor-in-Chief, The MedTech Strategist

A call to arms for business that shocks as it entertains.
—Mark DuVal, President of DuVal & Associates and former general counsel of 3M Pharmaceuticals

Frequently Asked Questions








What is the Amazon Trade-In program?
The Amazon Trade-In program allows customers to receive an Amazon Gift Card in exchange for hundreds of thousands of eligible items including video games, Kindles, books, electronics, DVDs, and more. The process is easy and convenient with an immediate offer and free shipping.
How long will it take to receive payment once I trade in my item?
Depending on your location, trade-in items may take up to 10 business days to arrive before they are processed. The packages you sent can be tracked anytime in Your Trade-In Account.
Once your item is received and appraised, you'll receive an e-mail notification within 2 business days informing you whether your items were accepted or rejected. You can find the status of your trade-in anytime in Your Trade-In Account. Once your trade-in value has been paid, you'll see the amount when viewing your gift card balance.
Qualified customers can also choose to be paid immediately when submitting a video game, console, or accessory trade-in by selecting the Instant Payment option.
What condition do my items need to be in?
In general, all items you wish to trade in must match the exact version displayed in the Trade-In search results or on the product page on Amazon.com. You can find the full condition descriptions by visiting our Product Eligibility Criteria page.
Are there any shipping or other fees?
When submitting a trade-in, customers will print a free pre-paid shipping label for sending in all items. There are no fees. If a trade-in item is not accepted and is returned, there is no cost for return shipping.
What do I do if I lost my shipping label?
You can print a shipping label at any time by going to Your Trade-In Account and clicking the Print Shipping Label button on the trade-in order.
If you have multiple packages or other shipping questions, check out our Packing and Shipping Instructions.
Can I use the Amazon App to trade in my items?
Yes, you can use the Amazon App on both Android and iOS phones to trade in. Simply open the app and scan or search for your items. Trade-In eligible items will have a Trade-In button on the product pages.
Can I trade in an item that isn't listed in the Trade-In Store?
If your item is not listed in the Trade-In Store, then we currently do not have an offer for it. However the Trade-In program is constantly updated with new items, so check back regularly.
How long do I have to ship my items?
Please make sure your trade-in is postmarked within 7 calendar days of submission and the item meets or exceeds the product eligibility criteria in order to receive the trade-in value listed on the website.
Who do I contact with questions about my trade-in?
The most recent status of your trade-in is available online anytime in Your Trade-In Account.
If you need help submitting the items you want to trade in, you can contact Amazon Customer Service via phone, chat, or e-mail by clicking the Contact Us button on any Help page.
You can find full program details by visiting our Amazon Trade-In Program Terms & Conditions page.

                     operate as a regulated power supply that will sustain accessory loads and offset parasitic drain. -Reverse connection, brown-out, over-current, and over-temperature protections. -Same platform required by Audi, Jaguar, Land-Rover, VW, and Volvo; also approved by Daimler-Chrysler, Ford, GM, and Mercedes-Benz. Midtronics PSC or Power Supply Chargers are an absolute must for “re-flashing” vehicle computers. Conventional chargers and booster packs were not designed for reflash use, and can cause problems such as program interruption (need to start over, lose time!) and, worse yet, damage to vehicle electronics (costly part replacement and even more lost time!).
