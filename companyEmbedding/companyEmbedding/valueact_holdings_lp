Our core values shape who we are.

Relationships & trust.

We place great value on our relationships with current and former portfolio companies, as well as the institutional investor community. We always consider what is in the best interest of the company and all shareholders. 










Responsibility & long-term thinking.

We believe in investing for the long term and managing companies for the long term. This requires the highest standards of integrity, a deep understanding of industry structure and business strategy, and a consideration of relevant social, ethical and environmental issues.










Transparency & respect.

Our team culture promotes openness, shared learning and shared rewards. We succeed or fail together. We apply this same approach to working with our portfolio companies.











“Since ValueAct Capital joined our Board at the end of 2012, they have developed a deep understanding of our business and we have forged an open, two-way communication with them. As our largest shareholder, they have provided valuable input and perspective to our Directors and senior management. Their well-studied insights have been particularly helpful with our strategy development and with our investor relations practices. At a time when many investors are focusing primarily on short term or cyclical issues, ValueAct Capital’s long-term strategic approach has supported sustained investment in and growth of our business.”

“I was expecting their focus to be on financial engineering and short term opportunities. Instead, throughout the engagement, I found them to be methodical and analytically oriented much like a good product manager or CEO.  Overall, I found we had much in common in terms of business perspective and the keys to driving value.”

ValueAct Capital Management L.P. Key Developments

ValueAct to Pay $11 Million to Settle DoJ Suit
Jul 12 16
The U.S. Department of Justice announced that ValueAct has agreed to pay $11 million to settle allegations that certain ValueAct entities violated the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. As part of the settlement, ValueAct has also agreed to injunctive relief designed to prevent future violations. On November 17, 2014, Baker Hughes and Halliburton announced their plan to merge in a deal valued at $35 billion. Thereafter, ValueAct, an activist investment firm, purchased over $2.5 billion of Halliburton and Baker Hughes voting shares without complying with the HSR Act's notification requirements. According to a complaint filed on April 4, 2016 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, ValueAct purchased these shares with the intent to influence the companies' business decisions - including decisions related to the merger - and therefore could not rely on the limited "investment-only" exemption to the HSR Act's notification requirements. The complaint detailed how ValueAct used its access to senior executives of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes to attempt to influence the companies' proposed merger and other aspects of their businesses. Halliburton and Baker Hughes abandoned their proposed merger on May 2, 2016 after the Antitrust Division sued to block it in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Federal courts can assess civil penalties for premerger notification violations under the HSR Act in lawsuits brought by the department. The current maximum civil penalty for an HSR violation is $16,000 per day; however, the maximum penalty will increase to $40,000 per day effective August 1, 2016. As part of the settlement, ValueAct agreed to pay a record $11 million. The highest fine previously paid for an HSR violation was $5.67 million. ValueAct is also enjoined from relying on the "investment-only" exemption when it intends to influence, or is considering influencing, certain basic business decisions, including those relating to merger and acquisition strategy, corporate restructuring, and the company's pricing, production capacity, or production output.


U.S Department of Justice Sues ValueAct Capital for Violating Premerger Notification Requirements
Apr 4 16
The U.S Department of Justice said it filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against certain ValueAct Capital entities for violating the reporting and waiting period requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 or the "HSR Act". The Antitrust Division's lawsuit seeks civil penalties and an injunction against further HSR Act violations. According to the complaint, ValueAct purchased these shares with the intent to influence the companies' business decisions as the merger unfolded and therefore could not rely on the limited "investment-only" exemption to HSR notification requirements. The complaint details how ValueAct used its access to senior executives of both Halliburton and Baker Hughes to formulate merger and other business strategies with the companies.

13F Filings



The Security, Class, and CUSIP columns in the table below are shown exactly as filed by the investor.
        We do our best to track continuity of investments through acquisitions, and this will be reflected in
        the table as changes in names and cusips.
In addition to descriptive data, performance of the investment
        is shown over time. To calculate quarterly performance, we first calculate cost basis of the shares purchased during the quarter, then use
            that to calculate gross profit. Quarterly return is Gross Profit / Starting Portfolio value.
Note that cost basis is calculated and stored in thousands, so small quarterly changes in shares frequently
            result in a cost basis of zero.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
