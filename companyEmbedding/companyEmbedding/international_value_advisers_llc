Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.

About IVA

International Value Advisers, LLC (IVA) was formed in October 2007 for the purpose of offering investment management services to institutions, qualified high net worth individuals, and financial intermediaries worldwide. The firm is a Registered Investment Adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
IVA is based in New York, NY with 43 employees as of June 30, 2016.
The operating ownership of the firm is comprised of the following four partners:

Mr. Charles de Vaulx, Chief Investment Officer and Portfolio Manager
Mr. Chuck de Lardemelle, Portfolio Manager
Mr. Michael Malafronte, Managing Partner
Mr. Thibaut Pizenberg, Securities Analyst

All four partners have worked together previously.
At IVA, our focus is to attempt to deliver absolute returns for our clients while at the same time preserving their capital. The key elements of our investment philosophy are:

A search for fundamental (as opposed to relative) value
Stock picking based upon rigorous, in-house research
Flexible, "go anywhere" approach to investing with a diverse asset class, geographic and capitalization mix

On January 21, 2011, IVA announced the close of all investment products to new investors.

An investor should read and consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing in the IVA International Fund or IVA Worldwide Fund. This and other important information are detailed in our prospectus and summary prospectus, which can be obtained by calling (866) 941-4482 or visiting www.ivafunds.com.

Until March 2007, Charles was portfolio manager of the First Eagle Global, Overseas, U.S. Value, Gold and Variable Funds, together with a number of separately managed institutional accounts. He was solely responsible for management of the Sofire Fund Ltd. when it won an Absolute Return Award* for “Fund of the Year” in the global equity category in 2005 and 2006.
In addition to sharing Morningstar’s “International Stock Manager of the Year” Award** in 2001 with his co-manager, Charles was runner-up for the same award in 2006.
From 2000 to 2004, Charles was co-portfolio manager of the First Eagle Funds. He was named associate portfolio manager in August 1996.

Charles graduated from the Ecole Superieure de Commerce de Rouen in France and holds the French equivalent of a Master’s degree in finance.
* The Absolute Return Awards identify the best performing U.S. hedge fund managers based on risk adjusted returns as tracked by Hedge Fund Intelligence. To be considered, funds first need to have at least $500 million in assets. Qualifying funds have the highest returns and Sharpe ratios, with the winner having the highest return and a Sharpe ratio within 25% of the best qualifying ratio. No fee is paid to participate in the selection and the rating is not indicative of future performance.
** The criteria used for Morningstar’s selection of Fund Manager of the Year are: superior returns in the current year, consistent outperformance over a long period of time, sound and consistent strategies, and good fund stewardship. No fee is paid to participate in the selection and the award is not indicative of future performance.
