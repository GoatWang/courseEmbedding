Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

During a gap between contracts in 2006, the two began work on a microblogging website, which was launched as Tumblr in February 2007. As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6] In August 2009, Karp was named Best Young Tech Entrepreneur 2009 by BusinessWeek[7] and in 2010, he was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[8]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained CEO of the company.

Early life[edit]
Born in New York City, Karp grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. His parents are Barbara Ackerman, a science teacher from San Anselmo, California, and Michael D. Karp, a film and television composer.[9] He has a younger brother named Kevin.[10] His parents separated when he was 17.[10] Karp attended the Calhoun School from aged three through 8th grade, where his mother teaches science.[4] At 11, he began learning HTML and was soon designing websites for businesses.[3] Karp went on to attend Bronx Science for one year before dropping out at the age of 15 and started homeschooling.[4] At the time, Karp had aspirations of getting into a college in New York or MIT and saw homeschooling and doing other projects on the side as a way to impress the colleges.[11] Karp never returned to high school or earned his high school diploma.[10] Marco Arment, the first employee of Tumblr, would later recall that Karp was keen to avoid letting his age shape people's assumptions about him: "He wanted to keep it quiet for as long as he could because he knew that as soon as it got out, every story about Tumblr would just be about David's youth."[12]
Career[edit]




Karp in 2007


Karp began interning at age 14 for animation producer Fred Seibert, founder of Frederator Studios.[4] Karp's mother had taught Seibert's children at the Calhoun School and was friends with his wife.[10][13] Karp was fascinated with the work of Frederator's computer engineers and his visits became regular. After he started homeschooling, Karp also began taking Japanese classes at the Japan Society and saw a math tutor, with whom he worked on writing software for winning at blackjack and poker.[13] When entrepreneur John Maloney sought technical help with UrbanBaby, an online parenting forum, a Frederator employee recommended Karp for the job. Karp completed the project, which had to be done in a couple of days, within four hours. Maloney made him UrbanBaby's head of product and gave him a small amount of equity.[10] At age 17, while still working for UrbanBaby, Karp moved alone to Tokyo for five months. It was a full three months after Karp had moved to Tokyo that UrbanBaby found out he wasn't in New York.[4]


I realized that I got to spend that entire day working on this product that I absolutely loved. ... And it was this incredible, liberating, unbelievably inspiring feeling.

—Karp in an interview with Fast Company about his
first day of work dedicated solely to Tumblr[14]
Karp left UrbanBaby after it was sold to CNET in 2006.[10] Using money from the sale of his shares, Karp started his own software consultancy company, Davidville, envisioning a mix of client work and his own products.[13] Marco Arment joined the company as an engineer after replying to Karp's Craigslist ad.[10] Karp had been interested in tumblelogs (short-form blogs) for some time and was waiting for one of the established blogging platforms to introduce their own tumblelogging platform. As no one had done so after a year of waiting, Karp and Arment began working on their own tumblelogging platform during a two-week gap between contracts in 2006.[2][4][15] Tumblr was launched in February 2007[14] and within two weeks, the service had gained 75,000 users.[8]
In October 2007, Karp shut down his consultancy business as his work with Tumblr was interfering with his client work.[16] Davidville was renamed Tumblr, Inc.[17] and 25 percent of the company was sold to a small group of investors.[4]
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that Yahoo! and Tumblr had reached an agreement for Yahoo! to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion. Karp remained as CEO.[18][19] As of June 1, 2017, Tumblr hosts over 349.3 million blogs.[6]
Advocacy[edit]
Karp joined the Planned Parenthood Board of Directors in 2014.[20] In March 2017, Tumblr and Planned Parenthood launched an initiative calling on the tech industry to support Planned Parenthood.[21]
Karp endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the lead-up to the 2016 United States election.[22]
Personal life[edit]
Beginning in 2011, Karp's girlfriend was Rachel Eakley, a psychology graduate and nursing student.[23][24] They lived together in Williamsburg with their pet dog, Clark.[1][25] The pair split in 2014.[26]
Karp has made personal investments into several companies including Superpedestrian, Inc. (the company behind the Copenhagen Wheel),[27] Sherpaa, Inc. (a healthcare app startup)[28] and Splash (an event marketing platform).[29]

David Karp and Tumblr Internet Biographies 
Sometimes in business, success comes not by reinventing the wheel but by simply building a better mousetrap. That's exactly what David Karp did when he founded his microblogging site, Tumblr. This book introduces readers to Karp and follows him from his humble beginnings as a shy kid to the head of one of the most successful tech companies today. He grew his business simply because he believed he could build a simpler, leaner blogging platform that was easier to use. His idea was a hit, and Tumblr's success took off. As with most companies, though, Karp's business experienced growing pains from its rapid expansion and struggled to turn a profit. However, readers learn that Karp, the once introverted kid who transformed into a confident leader, is looking toward further growing Tumblr into an even greater success. With fact sheets on the founder and the company itself, readers see that it's possible to turn a simple idea into a revolutionary business.

David Karp, the Nonconformist Who Built Tumblr


As a kid, David Karp, the founder of Tumblr, taught himself to code and dropped out of high school. Now Karp runs his company his way--and refuses to keep a schedule.

Away From the Computer Tumblr lets users share their thoughts online, but Karp prefers to jot his ideas for the company on paper.











In 2007, when others his age were studying for midterms and living on dorm food, David Karp was busy launching Tumblr, an easy-to-use blogging platform that now hosts 17.5 million blogs and receives about 1.5 billion page views per week. The company has also attracted some $40 million in venture funding.
Karp, 24, is used to doing his own thing. At 11, he taught himself how to write code. At 15, he dropped out of high school. A year later, he got a job as CTO of UrbanBaby, a New York City parenting site. At Tumblr, Karp likes to spend his time sketching ideas in notebooks, lunching as a group with his 30 employees, and of course, perusing blogs on Tumblr. One thing he doesn't like is being pinned down. That quickly becomes clear if you try to make an appointment with him. Or happen to spot him zipping around New York City on his Vespa.
I'm very antischedule. Except for board meetings, I don't really schedule things or keep a calendar. I think appointments are caustic to creativity. It's so frustrating when you're in the middle of a great conversation or work groove, and you realize, "Oh, I've got an appointment. I've got to bolt." I prefer the "let's just call each other when we need something or want to hang out" approach. That way, I never have to cancel on people, which is always a bummer. People tell me I need an assistant, but I don't want one.
I live in Manhattan, about 15 minutes from my office. In the morning, I usually walk to work or take my Vespa. I got it in October, and I love it. I've always wanted a motorcycle, and I thought a Vespa was a good first step. It's a lot cheaper than cabs for getting around the city. It costs $5 to fill it up, and a tank of gas lasts all week.
I try hard not to check e-mails until I get to the office, which is usually between 9:30 and 10 a.m. Reading e-mails at home never feels good or productive. If something urgently needs my attention, someone will call or text me.
I used to suck at e-mail. I'd let e-mails pile up, get overwhelmed, and miss important messages-;or forget to reply. So I set up filters on my e-mail, and that's been working pretty well. Now, my inbox gets e-mails only from people in my company and from my girlfriend. A folder called Robots gets anything not written by a human, like bank statements and Google Alerts. Most everything else goes into the Unsorted folder. When I get to the office, I go through my inbox first and try to respond right away. Then I go through my Unsorted folder, but I respond to very few of those. I've found that if you're not responsive to e-mail, it trains people to leave you alone.
As I go through my e-mail, I make a list of things that I need to do that day in my notebook. I have a bad memory, so I've become a thorough note taker. I use Action Method notebooks from a company called Behance. They are really beautiful. The pages have rows of dots instead of lines. I ordered a bunch for our team. I always write with a Pilot Precise V7 pen. It's inky but doesn't smudge. In addition to to-do lists, I also use the notebooks to sketch out ideas for new features on Tumblr. The notebooks are big, so it takes me four to six months to fill one up. I keep all of the old ones in a drawer.
Every Monday morning, we have an all-team meeting in our conference room, a place I designed to be quiet and cozy. There are no conference tables-;just a couch and a few comfortable chairs. Our customer support team, a group of eight people in Virginia, attends via Skype. I started holding these meetings in January as a way for everyone to get up to speed on what everyone else is doing. The first few meetings were pretty awkward. I tend to get excited and ramble on. So I've been trying to go around the room and have everyone else talk about the projects they're working on. I still probably talk too much.
Our office is a big, open loft space, and I'm right in the middle. The engineers, who run the site, are clustered on one side of me. And the community outreach team-;the company evangelists who interact with our users-;is on the other side. People are really quiet and respectful of one another. I use headphones if I listen to music. We mostly use e-mail to communicate. I love e-mail, because it doesn't interrupt anyone. The fewer distractions, the better.
I have two screens on my desk. The first is a 30-inch Mac monitor. I always have Tumblr open in the Web browser. The second is a vertical screen, which I use only for writing code. You can turn most Dell or Hewlett-Packard monitors sideways, a trick I learned from Marco Arment, who used to be Tumblr's lead developer. I like using two screens, because if you do everything on the same monitor, you end up constantly flipping back and forth between programs, which is distracting. A lot of our engineers have the same setup now.
I'm on Tumblr all day. I don't follow a ton of people, but I post and reblog stuff I really care about. I love my blog. I get most of my news from my Tumblr dashboard. I used to be a 24-hour news consumer, but so much of the reporting is bad these days. I find tech reporting incredibly tedious and dull. And I've kind of given up on reading anything that anyone writes about Tumblr. It's often inaccurate.
I used to spend all day coding, but that changed when we hired engineers who were a lot smarter than me. I still jump in to help code as needed. The engineers have scrums every day. Occasionally, I'll sit in on their meetings to get a sense of what's going on and see if I can help with anything. I'm really good at asking questions about edge cases or unusual scenarios. So when our engineers are describing a new way to build something, I'll ask, "What if it's in a different language?" or "Will it get totally messed up if that button has to be a different dimension?" Basically, what part of this aren't we thinking about?
We roll out changes to the site every day at 11 a.m. We stagger out small changes, so we can see what works and what doesn't. We chose that time because we want engineers around if there's an issue. Plus, it's early enough that there's not much traffic. Basically, everything that was finished the day before gets pushed the next morning. It could be a bug fix or a new language file-;say, a feature that was translated into French. Or it could be a new feature that's dark launched-;the public can't see it, but we have the ability to test it.
After we launch a new feature, I keep a close eye on how many people are using it. If it's unpopular, we'll discontinue it and try something else. Every feature has some maintenance cost, and having fewer features lets us focus on the ones we care about and make sure they work very well. For every new feature we add, we take an old one out. A lot of big sites don't do that, and it's a problem. Twitter started as a beautifully simple product, but it's now going the same route as Facebook. The drive to innovate can overencumber and destroy a product. My goal is to keep Tumblr very focused.
There's kind of a hive mentality at the office. We all break for lunch between 12 and 1. Usually, one person gets up, and the rest follow. We all cram into the elevator. Once we hit the street, we break off into two or three groups and go get food to bring back to the office. Then, we all eat together.
I always carry my camera with me. In January, I bought my dream camera, a Leica M9. It's the smallest digital camera they make with a full sensor. I post lots of photos on my blog, and I actually took most of the Tumblr employee photos.
I don't do much of the hiring anymore. Each department is in charge of hiring its own members. I like autonomous people. I want people who can take a project and figure out how to do it themselves. I don't really care about how things get done. Only that they get done.
Lately, I've been focused on our community outreach team-;it's responsible for figuring out how to connect with and promote the people who use Tumblr. I recently brought in my friend Richard Tong to be our fashion editor. He started Weardrobe, a fashion website that is now owned by Google. About 18 percent of our blogs are fashion related, and he focuses on reaching out to that demographic. As a result, Tumblr had a huge presence at New York's Fashion Week. I meet with the community team at least once a week to brainstorm about ways we can connect with users, like sponsoring a literary event or organizing meetups for Tumblr users around the world. I love that part of my job.
Usually around 3 p.m., I need a pick-me-up. A handful of us will pop out for tea at a place around the corner. I either order an iced tea or an Armenian mint tea. I used to drink coffee, but it messes me up-;I have a very fast metabolism, so I go from drowsy to unbearably hyper. Tea has just the right amount of caffeine.
In the afternoons, I usually want to bury my head in some project-;either screwing around with design or coding something. Recently, I took a stab at redesigning our photo sets feature, which lets users post several photos together, like a slide show. I may spend a couple of hours scraping together my thoughts before sending an idea out to the product team to get their take on it.
One or two nights a week, I usually work late-;until 8 or 9. When I do, I like to see who is still in the office and then take them out for dinner as a way to say thank you. We are surrounded by great restaurants, so we go somewhere nice.
I rarely work on weekends unless there's a serious database or infrastructure emergency. The company is growing fast, and we've had some problems scaling. Any time we add capacity, it immediately fills up. In December, the site was down for an entire day. It happened on a Sunday-;there was a whole lot of scrambling to figure out what broke. Everything about it sucked.
One of my favorite things to do on the weekend is take road trips. I just joined the Classic Car Club in Manhattan. You pay an annual fee, which gives you access to all these cool cars. My girlfriend and I took a 1996 Porsche 993 Carrera 4S up to Montreal one weekend. It was amazing. We've also taken trips to Boston and Maine. Other times, we'll jump on the Vespa and drive around the city. We might have brunch at our favorite place in the East Village, then pop over to see friends in Brooklyn before heading back up to Union Square to see a movie.
I spend a lot of time with people who work at Tumblr, but I make a very poor effort to hang out with other people in my life. I'm trying to do a better job of that. But, honestly, I love quiet nights at home. My girlfriend is a spectacular chef. She usually cooks dinner for us two or three nights out of the week. And then we wind down by watching TV. We use Apple TV to watch television shows from iTunes. We both love Futurama. I recently got her into Top Gear, a car show on the BBC.
Sleep is precious to me. I'm very disappointed if I don't go to bed before midnight. We have a rule: no laptops in the bedroom. Being on computers all the time makes me feel gross.

Tumblr Plans To Turn Into A $100 Million Business By Taking On TV And Newspapers

Tumblr's plan to reach owner company Yahoo CEO's Marissa Mayer's vision of becoming a business with $100 million in revenue by next year isn't to take on other internet giants like Facebook and Twitter for advertising money. Instead, the blogging platform wants to steal ad money from TV broadcasters and newspaper and magazine publishers, Tumblr CEO David Karp told the Financial Times.
Tumblr is on a mission to prove to advertisers that it is the best platform for "aspirational" marketing campaigns, which are typically placed on TV or in premium glossy magazines, the Financial Times report suggests. Tumblr doesn’t just want to be speaking to the digital agencies; it wants to be forming partnerships with the top creatives and marketers behind big-brand Super Bowl ads.
Karp told FT that while the rest of the industry was focused on direct response advertising — when consumers are likely to be on the lookout for one particular product and are served with a "buy me now" ad — and narrow targeting that uses data to show ads based on very strict sets of criteria, Tumblr offers advertisers a broader base of interests. That is why he thinks Tumblr is the best place for brand marketing campaigns online.
He said in the interview: "The whole industry is obsessed with harvesting intent when, if you look at the biggest brands, they want to create intent, to get people to aspire to wear the clothes, drive the car, drink the soda. Right now there aren't a lot of pleas in any of these digital networks which inspire people to become a customer … which they used to do with great TV and print campaigns.
"The general message to big brands and agencies from Silicon Valley and all the digital networks is 'leave the creative people at home, show up with the data scientists.' We want them to show up with the guys putting together the Super Bowl ads."
One of the advantages of Tumblr over Facebook or Twitter, Karp says, is that people come to Tumblr with the intent to consume content rather than to communicate with their friends. So in that way the site's sponsored posts, radar posts, and trending blogs ad formats are not a "jarring surprise" that take you away from your very "personal place," Karp added.
Yahoo acquired Tumblr for $1 billion last year. However, many observers have criticized the move, as the acquisition does not appear to be immediately paying off.
However, in Yahoo's latest earnings call, Mayer said Tumblr was likely to report its first profit (before interest, tax, depreciation, or amortization — otherwise known as EBITDA) by the end of 2015.
Mayer on Tuesday said, in announcing Yahoo’s $640 million acquisition of the video adtech platform BrightRoll, that Tumblr was on track to generate more than $100 million in revenue next year. 
Business Insider’s Nicholas Carson revealed last month that Yahoo was planning to use BrightRoll to turn Tumblr into a video site to rival the likes of YouTube. 
YouTube has also recently confirmed it is coming after TV’s money, by putting more effort into mimicking broadcasters' "upfront" events to secure long-term bulk advertising deals.
