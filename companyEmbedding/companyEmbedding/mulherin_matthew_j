Matthew J. Mulherin
Corporate Vice President and President, Newport News Shipbuilding






Matt Mulherin is corporate vice president of Huntington Ingalls Industries and president of HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding division in Newport News, Virginia. Named to this position in 2011, he is responsible for all of the division’s engineering, operations and programs, including the most complex ships in the world: nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines. Newport News has approximately $4 billion in revenues and more than 20,000 employees.
Mulherin also has responsibility for the company’s subsidiaries, which include Continental Maritime of San Diego, a shipyard that services and supports U.S. Navy ships on the West Coast; AMSEC, a full-service provider of engineering, logistics and technical support services to the U.S. Navy; Newport News Industrial, a provider of services and innovative products to the energy and petrochemical industries as well as government customers; SN3 (Stoller Newport News Nuclear), a provider of technical, ecological, waste management, remediation and consulting services within the Department of Energy arena; and Undersea Solutions Group, a developer and builder of specialized manned and unmanned undersea vehicles for military customers around the world.
Mulherin earned a bachelor’s degree in civil engineering from Virginia Tech in 1981 and began his career at Newport News the same year as a nuclear test engineer. Since then, he has held increasingly responsible positions, including nuclear project manager for Los Angeles-class submarines, director of facilities, director of nuclear engineering and refueling, and director of carrier refueling and overhaul construction. He also served as director and vice president for the next generation of aircraft carriers, the Gerald R. Ford class, and vice president of all programs, including shipbuilding and repair, Department of Energy and commercial energy. Before being named president of Newport News Shipbuilding, Mulherin served as vice president and general manager of site operations at Newport News as part of Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding.
Mulherin serves on the board of directors for the Shipbuilders Council of America and the Naval Submarine League. He also serves on the board of trustees for The Mariners’ Museum, is a vice president of Greater Peninsula NOW, a member of the Hampton Roads Business Roundtable and a member of the Peninsula TowneBank Community Board. In 2013, Mulherin was appointed by the governor to serve on the board of directors for the Virginia Nuclear Energy Consortium Authority.
Huntington Ingalls Industries is America’s largest military shipbuilding company and a provider of manufacturing, engineering and management services to the nuclear energy, oil and gas markets. For more than a century, HII’s Newport News and Ingalls shipbuilding divisions in Virginia and Mississippi have built more ships in more ship classes than any other U.S. naval shipbuilder. Headquartered in Newport News, Virginia, HII employs nearly 37,000 people operating both domestically and internationally.

The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
