Socially Aware Investing

Socially Aware Investing
Socially aware investing , also known as sustainable, socially conscious, “green” or ethical investing, is an investment discipline that considers environmental, social and corporate governance criteria to generate long-term competitive financial returns and a positive societal impact.
While its roots stretch as far back as the 1700s, the practice of socially aware investing did not become mainstream until the early 1970s when public outcry over the practice of apartheid in South Africa led to groups of investors boycotting those companies that continued to do business there.  These actions eventually helped to bring an end to apartheid.
Since then, the practice of socially aware investing has become less about simply avoiding businesses involved in things like alcohol, tobacco, firearms or gambling and more about finding corporations whose sustainable business practices promote environmental stewardship, consumer protection, human rights and diversity.
At Trust Company of Vermont, we feel that there is no “one size fits all” when it comes to socially aware investing.  We each have different concerns that we feel strongly about.  Utilizing online resources, we can screen our universe of stocks in order to incorporate our client’s priorities when selecting stocks for their portfolios.

What are analysts saying about Maxim Integrated Products stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Maxim Integrated Products stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Maxim is an OEM of analog and mixed signal ICs. The fiscal third-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. Maxim has a solid portfolio that generates steady design wins, a highly profitable and well-diversified core business, a policy of maintaining efficiency that has led to cost cutting measures and regular cash returns.  Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks. However, the diversification of the consumer revenue across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals and smartphones is adding stability to the company’s business profile." (6/28/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "MXIM delivered another round of beat/raise results with F3Q (March) sales/EPS of $581M/$0.56 besting the Street’s $576M/$0.52, and F4Q (June) guidance of $610M/ $0.62 easily ahead of consensus $598M/$0.58. Auto/industrial (~50% of sales) is driving upside. GM of 65.2% was just ahead of mgmt’s LT target and expected up another 100bps Q/Q in F4Q. Investors would typically cheer such a solid upside result/ outlook; however, mgmt commentary concerning slowing auto orders could temper enthusiasm near term. In addition to MXIM, semiconductor auto bellwethers include NXPI, ADI, and TXN." (4/21/2017)

Consensus Ratings for Maxim Integrated Products (NASDAQ:MXIM) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: $47.13 (5.85% upside)

Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection1. Trust Company of VermontBBB Rating: A+86 Linden StBrattleboro, VT 05301(802) 254-9400Product Liability Law AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection2. Trust Co Of Vermont151 Main StBrattleboro, VT 05301(802) 254-9400Trust CompaniesFinancial ServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your other collection!Error when adding to other collectionThis business was removed from the other collection3. Vermont Land Trust Inc10 Furnace Grove RdBennington, VT 05201(802) 442-4915Business & Personal CoachesWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Trust Company of Vt5245 Main StManchester Center, VT 05255(802) 367-1200Trust CompaniesFinancial ServicesWebsiteServicesBusinesses in related categories to Product Liability Law AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection5. Gentry, Sharon J51 Putney RdBrattleboro, VT 05301(802) 257-5533AttorneysCriminal Law AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Mc Hugh Thomas PBBB Rating: A+84 Spring StWilliamstown, MA 01267(413) 458-2521AttorneysWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection7. Newborn Law(1)45 Summer StKeene, NH 03431(603) 352-0600AttorneysWebsiteServicesPersonal Injury Attorney in NH, VT, & NYAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection8. Lynch, Nathan R, JD40 Main StWalpole, NH 03608(603) 756-4700AttorneysBusiness Law AttorneysWebsiteServicesAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection9. Winburn Law Offices409 Main StBennington, VT 05201(802) 447-0100Insurance AttorneysAttorneysWebsiteServicesSponsored LinksMap ViewSponsoredDidn't find what you were looking for?magnifying glass
