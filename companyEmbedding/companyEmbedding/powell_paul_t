	The 7-foot 6-inch length has been the standard size for flipping sticks throughout the years, so it’s only natural that we offer one this size too! The fast action of the 765 CF means that this rod doesn’t behave like a total broomstick, which also makes it ideal for other things like smaller swimbaits or fishing the heaviest spinnerbaits in deep water.

	This 7-foot 4-weight is a solid choice when you need just a hint more muscle out of a small-stream rod. The smooth, soft action of the 704-3 protects fine tippets but offers up a satisfying dose of power as well. From Montana spring creeks to Midwest farm ponds, this rod is a hoot!

	Topwaters, crankbaits, and rip baits are right up the alley of the 6104 CB. The moderate-fast action allows just enough “give” to fish these baits perfectly without being too soft for effective hook setting. With a length of 6’10” and rated up to 3/4 ounce lures, this 4 power stick will easily handle most common-sized hard baits at short to medium distances. If you dream about cranking riprap on the California Delta or throwing poppers on Toledo Bend, it’s time to wake up and grab yourself a 6104 CB!

	This is a phenomenal all around spinning rod for an array of finesse techniques. It works great for everything from small worms and drop shotting, to fishing little jigs, tubes, and grubs. The 7 foot length is a real asset when fishing at long distances, as it aids in improving distance and hook setting efficiency. Lake Erie Smallmouth, beware!

1415161718  >>  Sort By  Oldest First Newest First  Show  20 50  per pageA MUST for pools or cement parks!...smooooooooth— MikeHey there George,So far so good! I've really been stoked on all the re-issues that you've been putting out lately. I've already bought both the Vallely and Kevin Harris decks, but I'm dying to get ahold of a RODNEY MULLEN CHESSBOARD re-issue.I think that powell once had the strongest most recognizable image back during the the mid to late 80s. Most of this was due to the iconic graphics that only VCJ could have created. I've often wondered what he's been up to these days and if he'd ever consider creating skateboard graphics again. I think it's about time the world was re-introduced to his art again! Many thanks,— Crab ScramblyAt last, long last!  I emailed you a year ago with the thin hope of getting the Ray Bones Snub nose reissued and here it is!  This was my all-time favorite board back in the '80s but I never got one.  After waiting 20 years here it is... Thanks a bunch!— Braden SmithI think if Chin made a speech he would say ,"Any man or woman could parachute once but you would need a parachute to parachute twice." Life is animal chin K S34 yrs old and still love Bones.. thank you for keeping skateboarding fun... PP is #1...— Kelly DyerSo very awesome to be able to get my hands on all my old faves ON DVD! and the Video Tunes shoulda been here 20 years ago. I'm in my early 30's now and walking into skate shops asking for Animal Chin and PD is a frustrating experience as the guys behind the counter don't know what I'm talkin' 'bout. Cheers Boys!— Ben EvansIts great to see the reissue of boards, we have known to love. I'm a geezen @ 37. But grew up in N.VA and skated the Ditch, Chicken Ranch, Mt. Trashmore. and a slew of other little hot spots. One place that sticks out was this guy Page had a Pink half pipe in N. Little Rock Ark.That was Glassed, that thing was Sofa-King sweet. You guys Remember when Thrasher was nothing more than news print? And Chief Rasta where you could get some recipe to fill your belly? Well sorry to be geezen on ya. Peace.	Do you really have to ask?— ScottI haven't had a board that I really loved to skate since my Frankie Hill was regretfully retired from service in about 1991. But now thanks to Powell I have a Vallely and a Kevin Harris freestyle. My skating has returned to how it was before those evil popsicle decks started breeding. Thanks to everybody at Skate One. Please don't ever stop making these reissues. You are making the world a better place.— Paul SullivanThanks so much for the great re-issue decks,it is great to see them available. Please re-issue "Frankie Hill's bulldog deck" and Tony Hawk's 1983 skull deck". Keep going with your great classic powell products, they are great.— KarlHi dudes. I just got on the web page by pure hazard. well anyway, I stopped skating after some really painful experiences, but guys I wanted to thank you for what you have released over the years. Definitely and adept of PP  products, I will never forget all those years watching the bones brigade and trying to get as good as them... Well I really want to get back on a skate but now I don't have the confidence that I had when I was 10. Thanks again.— Rno TampereThe Rat-Bones are the perfect pool wheel. They grip like no other and make it a pleasure to ride.— Graham CrawleyI was 14 in 1982 when I started riding skateboards.  Down at the end of the road was a friend who had made a half pipe ramp that was perfect.  He named it rampage and he road the Ray Bones Powell Peralta.  It was the coolest board I had ever seen.  I believe the color was white with red design and white Bones wheels.  I dreamed about having this board.  I never was fortunate enough to buy one, but when I saw your re-issues page I immediately had to have one.  I have even decked it out with dbl cons and tracker trucks.  I wanted some old pizza grip, but cannot find, so had to settle for clear Madrid. It wont get ridden to much.  I believe it will be more of a showcase for the wall.  keep those re-issues coming, they might not be originals, but to me they were works of art and I don't mind owning a reproduction.— Scott DrewThank you for re-issuing this wonderful line quality vintage material and decks---there seems to be a real craving for it!  How about some womens' tees with the vintage logos?  (and hopefully a restocking of the general product line)  Thank you, thank you, thank you, from a skate-ratette with great memories of the 80s scene.  ;o)— JamieI'm 31 years old and surf the snow out here in Colorado, but I was bred in Cali and skated the Monty back in the day, even on half pipes. I used to skate the chicken ranch in Nor Cal. For my birthday I'm getting a Powell board.— Mike FitzgeraldHey! I have the Steve Steadham re-issue deck. It is sooo sick. I love it so much. You guys really did a good job on it and i love the spoon nose on it. I wish the new rasta one had that! thanks for making these decks for everyone to enjoy, including me, a 15 year old that loves old skool decks and culture! Peace,— JeffreyGuys, Long story short. I'm 31 and saw the reissues and got a Ripper just to ride and carve.  That turned into going to the skatepark and now I'm riding ramps just like 15 years ago. Skating is one of the many freedoms that got lost in all the things that I was conditioned to believe were important. Thanks for the wake-up call! Keep up the great work!— greg minorI was a member of cherry hill skateboard park in 79/80, i seen stacy skate there along with the rest of them,including jamie godfrey the park pro, i seen him skate evey friday, if i only new,i had the yellow snub with red skull,the cubes,the tracker six tracks,copers,the hole 9,please put out some with the red skull and sword,it brings back so much memories and i still skate at 40,this yellow and white one is very sweet to can't wait to get a couple,thanks so much for still being around.— Mike BuntsAwesome boards, I wasn't born when the originals were made so I'm really excited about these reissues, but there is one thing that would be better than all these boards together and that is a reissue of the Per Welinder "nordic skull" deck.. please!Best wishes,— Johannes OknerThey don't make them like they use to, but... They make them better!— TravisYou guys still make what is basically the original freestyle wheel you produced for the roller skate market so why not re-release for the freestyle market like the Rat Bones and Cubics? There are only a couple freestyle wheels on the market and none of them have that good square edge the original Powell freestyle wheel had.— Jeremy  ElderI'm another 30-something rider. I'm totally stoked to see my favorite board reissued. These new school popsicle stick boards just don't cut it for me. Thanks.— JD Mellowship Items 301-320 of 427 Page:  <<

Defective Goods & Product Injury Attorney in Las Vegas


Product Defect




                    Nobody plans to be injured by their favorite car or electronic device. Nevertheless, thousands of people are injured or killed by defective products every year. These defects often go unreported until enough serious injuries have occurred to warrant a headline. Whether it is a defect that occurs in the design of the product, during the manufacturing of the product, or as a result of poorly advertised safety guidelines, you could be eligible for compensation. 
Product injury attorneys gather information about defective products and help determine whether or not the injury was sustained as a result of defects throughout the product line. Paul Powell, your Las Vegas defective products lawyer, will identify similar cases of injury or death as well as potential class action suits that may be pending against the manufacturer. 
We’ve helped dozens of clients who have been injured due to careless manufacturing and marketing practices, and we can help you too. If you or a loved one has been injured by a defective product, contact me today to schedule a one-on-one consultation.
