Biography




Research summary
My research covers the areas of Occupational and Health Psychology with the  major emphasis being on well-being. Specifically, I have conducted extensive  research on the non-auditory effects of noise on cognition and health. In  addition, I conduct research on stress and fatigue in both the workplace and  life in general. My interests in health psychology cover two main themes:  health-related behaviours (effects of nutrition, caffeine and chewing gum on behaviour)  and minor illnesses (psychosocial risk factors for susceptibility to colds and  influenza; effects of upper respiratory tract infections on mood and  cognition). 
Teaching summary
Teach Stress and Disease and Work Psychology to Level 3 Psychology Students.
  Level 2 practical on social support and tutorials in social and abnormal  psychology.

Research topics and related papers
Non-auditory effects of noise: My research on the effects  of noise started 35 years ago with the late Donald Broadbent. The main areas  that I have been active in are: noise and cognition; noise and health; noise  and accidents; combined effects of noise and other occupational health hazards;  and noise and mental health (see publications). I have been Chair of the Noise  and performance team of the International Commission for the Biological Effects  of Noise (ICBEN) and an expert on the Department of Health/Health protection  Agency Noise Group. I am currently a member of the European Noise Network (ENNAH) and have the  remit for advising on new methods for use in noise research.
Occupational stress and fatigue: This research has been  supported by the Health & Safety Executive, IOSH, the Maritime and  Coastguard Agency and the EU. It has involved studies of the scale of  occupational stress; seafarers fatigue; effects of drugs and medication in the  workplace; stress in ethnic minorities; safety culture; and what makes a good  job. Current projects are concerned with well-being at work and health and  safety in the maritime industry. The  research involves both collaboration with other academics, with industry (e.g.  ConnectAssist) and charities (e.g. the Well-beingWalesNetwork).
The Psychology of the Common Cold and other infections: This research has examined two areas. The first has been concerned with  psychosocial risk factors (e.g. stress) for infection and illness. The second  has examined the behavioural malaise (negative mood, impaired cognition)  associated with upper respiratory tract illnesses. This research has involved  both laboratory studies and simulations of real-life activities (e.g. driving).  Surveys have also investigated occupational risk factors for minor illnesses  and the effects of such illnesses on productivity and safety. Combined effects  of minor illnesses and other stressors have been examined. Pharmacological  studies have also examined the neurotransmitter changes that underlie malaise.
Functional disorders: Initial studies of post-viral fatigue  have led to extensive research in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Again, a  major interest has been the cognitive impairments associated with CFS. The role  of psychosocial factors in the pathogenesis of the disorder has also been investigated.  Recent research has evaluated multi-convergent therapy and shown that it can  have benefits for those with CFS. We are now starting a similar programme to  investigate irritable bowel syndrome.
Nutritional Neuroscience: While conducting research on mood  and performance at different times of day I became interested in the  behavioural effects of meals. Similarly, I became interested in the beneficial  effects of caffeine in low alertness situations (e.g. working at night). The  research has been extended to examine behavioural effects of macro-nutrients,  micro-nutrients and pre-and pro-biotics. Current interests include effects of  chewing gum on stress, mood and cognitive function. We have also developed  methods of investigating effects of diet on well-being. These have been used to  examine high fibre diets and effects of fruit/vegetable consumption.
