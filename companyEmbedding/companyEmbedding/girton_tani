Desktop computers were new when Tani Girton unlocked the mystery of how to send information using the new device, sending information from Portland to the EDS’s Government Services Division in Bethesda, Maryland.“I was rewarded with a job that ignited my interest in financial analysis and set me on a path to business school and the financial services industry,” she said. “I dove into every aspect of finance, including asset/liability management, investment portfolio management and capital markets.”TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR COMPANYPROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND: In the very early days of desktop computers, I figured out how to transmit information from a PC in Portland, Ore., to EDS’ Government Services Division headquarters in Bethesda, Md. I was rewarded with a job that ignited my interest in financial analysis and set me on a path to business school and the financial services industry. I dove into every aspect of finance, including asset/liability management, investment portfolio management and capital markets.I mentored many successful professionals along the way and discovered another passion — leadership development. I taught finance at San Francisco State University, was a founding manager of Charles Schwab Bank and Treasurer of Bank of the West prior to becoming chief financial officer for Bank of Marin.EDUCATION: B.A., international affairs, Lewis and Clark College; MBA, finance, San Francisco State University.STAFF: Finance and accounting, 12; compliance, five; internal audit, two.Bank of Marin is a growing commercial and community bank known for its consistent high performance and excellent credit quality. With its unwavering emphasis on long-term relationship banking and strong core deposits, the bank plays an important role in the communities it serves. The spirit of collaboration and focus on strategy that permeates Bank of Marin has enabled me to expand my leadership capabilities and contribute my finance and systems expertise to a variety of initiatives, which is very gratifying personally.Giving back is also part of the bank’s fabric, and employees can be found volunteering every day at local events, on nonprofit boards and delivering services to those in need. I serve on the board of directors for Professional BusinessWomen of California and volunteer in classrooms with Junior Achievement to bring financial literacy to underserved K–12 school children.MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT IN THE PAST YEAR OR SOI was a keynote speaker at the 26th annual Professional BusinessWomen of California Conference. I shared with 6,000 participants the importance of honest feedback in building a professional brand and how active listening and honest speaking will forge pathways for all women to gender equity in the workplace.WHAT IS THE ACHIEVEMENT YOU ARE MOST PROUD OF?I co-founded the Women’s Connection in 2009, a grass roots organization that supports the personal and professional growth of employees through coaching, education and networking. That organization grew to encompass nine geographic councils, 30 events a year, successful partnerships with multiple non-profit organizations and the participation and membership of over 500 people.WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE TODAY?In this economic environment of prolonged low interest rates and increased regulation, growth is important to banks. However, GDP growth is moderate at best. Expected loan growth must be achieved without compromising our values, and sometimes the competition requires us to pass on deals that don’t make sense. While we would like to grow faster, we know that our discipline will pay off as the inevitable business cycles roll around.

Tani Girton Joins Bank Of Marin As Chief Financial Officer. (Photo: Business Wire)






Business Wire




Jul 25, 2013 6:30 PM EDT













 




























































  Bank of Marin Bancorp (NASDAQ: BMRC) has announced the hiring of Tani Girton as Chief Financial Officer of the company and its subsidiary bank. Girton joins Bank of Marin with more than 25 years of experience in financial services, including risk management, treasury, and investment portfolio management. Most recently, she was Executive Vice President and Treasurer at Bank of the West where she managed a team of more than 25 professionals. Prior to that, she was Vice President of Treasury Capital Markets at Charles Schwab & Company.   Tani Girton joins Bank of Marin as Chief Financial Officer. (Photo: Business Wire)   In addition to her financial experience, Girton is also known for her commitment to coaching and training employees, and giving back to the community. During her tenure at Bank of the West, she founded the Women’s Connection, a program to provide employees with relevant education, mentoring and networking support. She also serves on the Executive Committee for the Junior Achievement of Northern California Board of Directors.  “We are delighted to have Tani join us as our new Chief Financial Officer,” said Russell A. Colombo, President and Chief Executive Officer. “The CFO role is a highly strategic position and her talent and experience will be of great value, particularly as we expand into the East Bay with our recent announcement of the agreement to acquire NorCal Community Bancorp. Tani has a strong track record of success in business and driving positive change in the community, and she will be a wonderful asset to our team.”  Girton earned her MBA from San Francisco State University, and graduated from Lewis and Clark College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in international affairs. She has also completed graduate work at the Monterey Institute of International Studies.
