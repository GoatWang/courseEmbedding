Commitment to Action 



Eco Products Fund, L.P.



Commitment by


    Equator Environmental, LLC  





In 2007, Equator and New Forest committed to establish the Eco Products Fund, a $100 million fund for investment in carbon, wetlands, and biodiversity mitigation. The fund is primarily focused on opportunities within United States, but also intends to devote a portion of the capital to international endeavors. The Eco Products Fund has committed over $20 million to forest carbon and wetlands mitigation projects. The fund is aimed at realizing value from illiquid environmental assets such as carbon, water, and biodiversity, and to use innovative financial structures to represent the value of these critical services in the marketplace.

Details

I. Equator Environmental will create a $100 million private equity fund to make investments in wetlands mitigation, endangered species conservation, carbon sequestration, water quality, and other ecosystem-based projects, and to monetize the value of such projects.  All investments will be based on land, forest or vegetation-based projects in North America.
Ecosystems provide many of the services upon which the global economy depends, such as water purification, biodiversity conservation and atmospheric climate regulation.  Globally, approximately 60% of 'ecosystem services' provided by nature are being used unsustainably or are in decline. Over the past twenty years, the amount of developed land has grown by 50% in the United States through increasing population and urbanization, creating pollution, water quality and other environmental problems.  The weight of the economy on the natural infrastructure of the U.S. has led to the pricing of ecosystems services.  Equator Environmental believes that by establishing a fund to invest in projects that preserve and enhance the viability of our ecosystems, we can have a direct impact on the preservation of our ecological assets. Equator also believes that by monetizing such assets through the creation of environmental credits and other 'eco products', we will be able to enhance the market value of our ecosystems, and create further incentives for environmental conservation.
II CGI's tremendous leadership over the past two years on environmental issues has helped inspire Equator Environmental to launch this fund, which is the first of its kind.
Measures of Success: Measures of success may include the growth of nascent markets (carbon, biodiversity, endangered species and water), creation of new financial platforms and instruments for these markets, and a rise in public awareness.
TIMELINE:
Anticipated Launch: December, 2007
First Milestone(s): Invest in at least one of each: terrestrial carbon sequestration project, wetlands mitigation project, endangered species project.
06/30/08:
Participants in this Activity: Members of Equator Environmental, LLC and New Forests Inc.


    Background

Equator and New Forests bring together critical areas of expertise in underlying scientific and technical disciplines and in financial structuring, trading and commercialization of assets. In addition, the partnership creates a one stop shop with strengths in sourcing/origination, transaction management, and distribution.

                                                     Newly established Investment fund begins operations in the United States                            Audrius Ziugzda, manager of Craftstone Capital LLC
Investment fund Craftstone Fund LP established by Craftstone Capital LLC fund Management Company, owned by the Lewben Group’s companies started to operate in the United States in March 2017. The fund has attracted initial capital and will soon make its first investment, according to the fund manager Marius Vaiciulis.
 “Our operations in the US market is a logical step forward. A year ago we established Craftstone Capital Appreciation Fund designed for the Lithuanian market while continuing to manage SMAs for selected clients abroad. We believe that Craftstone investment strategy’s proprietary self-learning algorithms make it stand out among competitors and helped the strategy to generate positive returns in every calendar year since inception in 2014. This coupled with our professional team makes an attractive proposition to export our product to other markets. In particular, to the US market with deep knowledge of machine learning strategies and a large pool of investment capital”, said the fund manager Marius Vaiciulis.

 Craftstone Fund LP is for accredited investors or qualified purchasers. The fund invests in shares with long-term trends either on the up or down side. According to the fund manager, the main competitive advantage of the investment strategy is a self-learning algorithm enabling effective risk management thereby achieving results with little correlation to capital markets. The main aim of the strategy is to attain high returns by managing risks in both rising and falling markets. The strategy is fully automated.

 “We invest in highly liquid stocks with the average daily turnover of at least 10 million USD. This allows us the flexibility to cut our losses early without impacting the price too much ”, said the fund manager M. Vaiciulis.

 According to him, the fund portfolio has over 30 well-diversified stock positions on average. At the moment, 140 different stocks are on the investment horizon ranging from biotechnology, telecommunications to energy and consumer goods. The majority of these are listed on the US stock exchanges with the rest coming from Western Europe.

 “We made the next step of international development at a time when the growth of global capital markets dictates a need to try new investment methods. Craftstone is one of the most technologically advanced instruments and after receiving strong interest from foreign investors so far we expect this positive momentum to continue”, said the manager of Craftstone Capital LLC Audrius Ziugzda.
