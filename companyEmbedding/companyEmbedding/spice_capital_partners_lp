Spire III's limited partners consist of existing Spire II investors as well as new investors representing leading pension funds, endowments, fund of funds, family offices, insurance companies, financial institutions and executives from the areas of Spire's investment focus. Spire III's investment focus targets lead and control investments in the business services, information services, media, education/education technology and communications services sectors ("BIMEC" sectors).  Spire targets domestically based platform companies between $30 million and $150 million of enterprise value.

NetFortris – Provider of hosted cloud communications, managed networksolutions, IT security solutions and other managed applications to small and medium-sized business and enterprise customers - www.netfortris.com

Spire III is led by Andrew J. Armstrong, Jr., Bruce M. Hernandez, David K. Schaible and Sean C. White ("Partners"), alongside other team members and maintains offices in New York, NY and Philadelphia, PA. The Partners have worked together at Spire for nearly 15 years.
Spire partnered with Aqueduct Capital Group as its primary placement agent for Spire III.  Dentons and Ropes & Gray LLP provided legal counsel to Spire Capital during the formation of Spire III.
