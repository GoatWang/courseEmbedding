Company





Who We Are
Unified Practice is a technology company that provides a fully integrated acupuncture software for TCM practitioners, available on iPad, web and mobile (iPhone and Android).
At our core, we build technology that synchronizes and supports the complex work of Chinese Medicine practitioners from streamlining, scheduling and patient care, to unifying administrative functions and practice management.
Designed to work the way practitioners think, Unified Practice understands practitioners' unique processes to provide the support necessary to harmonize their work lives.

The Unified Practice journey
The Unified Practice journey started when one of the co-founders was in Taiwan completing a TCM internship at a leading city hospital. 
After witnessing the full-scale integration of EHR there, which has existed for many years, its value and importance were clear but there were no viable or modern options for TCM practitioners. 
It was at this moment that Unified Practice was concepted and since then, we have set out to build the first mobile, fully-integrated acupuncture EHR specifically for TCM practitioners.
Are you a TCM clinic manager, practitioner or student? We would love to hear from you. Click here to contact us.

Frequently Asked Questions






What is UnifiedPractice? see answer

Unified Practice is a cloud based acupuncture practice management and electronic health record (EHR) tool specifically created for TCM practitioners. Instead of using multiple tools to run your practice, imagine only using one that integrates in a simple, seamless and paperless way allowing you to securely access and operate your clinic from anywhere.
Our scheduling and patient onboarding tool is accessible on both desktop, via the web on any device, or on our native iPad application. Our acupuncture EHR tool is only available on the iPad and can be downloaded in the Apple App Store.







Do I need a specific device or computer to access Unified Practice? see answer


Practice management and admin tools are accessible on your laptop or desktop (PC or Mac) via the following compatible web browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple’s Safari. Please note that Unified Practice is not compatible with Internet Explorer.
iPad EHR – charting with Unified Practice is meant to be accessed on our native iPad application only. You can also chart using any computer however the interface when charting on a computer is different than using the iPad application.








How long does it take for my clinic to implement Unified Practice? see answer

Implementation time depends on you. Our most motivated clinics are typically fully setup and able to use the platform within a couple of weeks. To assist in getting you up and running as soon as possible, we offer two concierge coaching calls ($100 value) and ongoing support which is always included.







Is Unified Practice a cloud based platform? see answer

Yes, we are cloud based which means no information is going to be stored on your local device. This allows anyone in your clinic to login from anywhere, anytime. This also means you’ll seamlessly receive any platform updates and improvements.







How does Unified Practice keep my information safe? see answer

Your data security is our highest priority. All data is stored according to HIPAA guidelines. To learn more about HIPAA compliance and the steps Unified Practice takes to ensure information is secure, click here.

Yes! We are HIPAA secure no matter where you access your account.







What are the iPad specifications to use Unified Practice? see answer

We recommend using iPad Air or newer.

There are no contracts with Unified Practice. Once you sign up, you will be billed month-to-month with the option to cancel anytime. We value your business and believe in what we’re offering so every plan also has a 30-day money-back guarantee.







Are there any price incentives? see answer

Schedule a demo or speak to our team to learn if your clinic qualifies for a discounted monthly rate.







Who owns the data I put into Unified Practice? see answer

You do, always.
Unified Practice does not own any of the data you enter into the system. If you decide you would like to move on, you’re welcome to take all your data and records with you.







Does Unified Practice work if the internet is down? see answer

Unified Practice’s acupuncture practice management and EHR platform will not work if internet is down.
This is the case for all cloud based EHR services. We recommend internet redundancy, so if your internet goes down, simply switch over to your mobile telecom provider (Verizon, AT&T, etc) connection by using your phone’s “hot-spot” and make sure you have a very good data plan (more than 6 gigs). Redundant internet connection sources are important and we certainly recommend them, specifically the “Wi-Fi + 3G” version of the iPad which will give you peace of mind the day that you have an intermittent internet connection.







Can I manage my appointments on my mobile device? see answer

Yes! You can access your patient calendar securely, in a HIPAA compliant way, on your phone either using the web (your phone’s browser) or via our iPhone or Android application.







How fast does my internet need to be to use Unified Practice? see answer

We recommend 10-15 mbps or higher. To put it another way, 10-15 mbps is the equivalent of going 65 mph on the highway.







Does Unified Practice integrate/sync with GCal, iCal? see answer

Yes we have a mobile app for iPhone that syncs with your personal calendar.
