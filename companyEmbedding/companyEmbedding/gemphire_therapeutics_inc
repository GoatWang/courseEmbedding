            			About Gemphire
            		 


						Gemphire Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:GEMP) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing and commercializing therapies to help patients with cardiometabolic disorders, including dyslipidemia and NASH. We are focused on providing new treatment options for cardiometabolic diseases through our complementary, convenient, cost-effective product candidate, gemcabene (CI-1027 licensed from Pfizer in 2011), as add-on to the standard of care especially statins that will benefit patients, physicians, and payors. Gemcabene’s lack of drug-drug interactions with highest dose of statins such as Lipitor offer a first-in-class, once-daily oral drug candidate for additional LDL-C, triglycerides (fat), and inflammation lowering.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds of approximately $25.6 million (or
approximately $29.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock
offered by us in this offering, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to make significant investments in
research and development and clinical activities related to gemcabene and for
working capital and other general corporate purposes as well as to establish a
public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access to the
public equity markets.

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering, together with
our cash and cash equivalents, for the following purposes:

. approximately $20.0 million to fund development costs associated with our
  three late stage clinical trials of gemcabene for our target indications and
  for costs associated with our planned End of Phase 2 (EOP2) meetings with the
  FDA;

. approximately $4.0 million to fund manufacturing-related activities for 
  gemcabene;

. approximately $3.5 million to fund development costs associated with
  preclinical studies and related activities for gemcabene; and

. the balance for general corporate purposes, including working capital, general
  administrative costs, potential acquisition or in-licensing costs and the
  prosecution and maintenance of our intellectual property.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to advance the
development of any acquired or in-licensed product candidate. However, we have
no current commitments or obligations to acquire or in-license any product
candidate.

We expect to have our EOP2 meetings with the FDA in the first half of 2018.
Based upon our currently anticipated clinical trials, we will need to raise
additional capital to continue to fund the further development of gemcabene and
our other operations. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including our ability to gain access to additional
financing and the relative success and cost of our research, preclinical and
clinical development programs. We have based this estimate on assumptions that
may prove to be wrong, however, and we could use our cash resources sooner than
we expect. Additionally, the process of advancing early-stage product candidates
and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly and the timing of
progress in these clinical trials is uncertain.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts
and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to access additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs,
whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements and the other
factors described under "Risk Factors" in this prospectus. In addition, we might
decide to postpone or not pursue clinical trials or preclinical activities if
the net proceeds from this offering and any other sources of cash are less than
expected.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government, or hold them as cash.


Our industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant
innovation and change. The market for lipid regulating therapies is especially
large and competitive. Our potential competitors include large pharmaceutical
and biopharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug
companies, academic institutions, government agencies and research institutions.
Gemcabene, if approved, will face intense competition. Key competitive factors
affecting its commercial success will include efficacy, safety, tolerability,
reliability, convenience of dosing, price and reimbursement.

Statins are the most commonly used therapy to lower LDL-C in the dyslipidemia
market. They are used by patients with HoFH as well as HeFH and ASCVD. Branded
statins include AstraZeneca's Crestor (rosuvastatin), Merck's Zocor
(simvastatin) and Pfizer's Lipitor (atorvastatin) among others. Generic statins
are marketed by several companies including Apotex Inc., Mylan N.V. (Mylan),
Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. and Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Lupin) among
others.

Non-statin based therapies are also used to lower LDL-C in dyslipidemia
patients. Merck's Zetia (ezetimibe) is a common non-statin therapy that is often
combined with statins for HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD patients. Merck's Vytorin and
Liptruzet are fixed-dose combination therapies that combine ezetimibe with
statins. Non-statin therapies are combined with statins to improve LDL-C
lowering or to offer other efficacy benefits, including Daiichi Sankyo Inc.'s
(Daiichi Sankyo) Welchol, a bile acid sequestrant and niacin. Non-statin
therapies are also used to treat HoFH. These therapies include Aegerion's
Juxtapid, a once-daily oral microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP)
inhibitor and Ionis and Genzyme Corporation's, a Sanofi Company (Genzyme),
Kynamro, a once-weekly injectable apoB antisense therapy. These agents have
boxed warnings associated with liver toxicity and significant tolerability
issues on their labels. Amgen's Repatha, an injectable PCSK9 inhibitor, was
recently approved for HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD, and Sanofi's and Regeneron's PCSK9
inhibitor, Praluent, was recently approved for HeFH and ASCVD.

There are multiple product candidates in late stage development for HoFH, HeFH
and ASCVD. CymaBay Therapeutic's (CymaBay) MBX-8025 (Phase 2) and Regeneron's
RGEN-1500 (Phase 2) are in development for the treatment of HoFH. For
hypercholesterolemia, including HeFH and ASCVD, drugs in development include
oral CETPi, Merck's anacetrapib (Phase 3), Eli Lilly and Company's evacetrapib
(recently discontinued Phase 3), and Amgen/Dezima's TA-8995 (Phase 2), current
Esperion's oral product, ETC-1002 (completed Phase 2), The Medicines
Company/Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.'s (Alnylam) injectable PCSK9 inhibitor,
ALN-PCSsc (completed Phase 1), and Pfizer's injectable PCSK9 inhibitor,
bococizumab (Phase 3).

The market for LDL lowering therapy is both large and competitive, and the
diagram below depicts the opportunity for gemcabene in 2nd line oral therapy,
especially with discontinuation of competing oral CETPi.

Fibrates, niacin and prescription fish oil are common therapies used to lower
triglycerides in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Examples of branded
fibrates include AbbVie Inc.'s (AbbVie) Tricor and Trilipix, and an example of a
branded niacin includes AbbVie's Niaspan, an extended-release niacin. In
addition, AbbVie markets combination therapies, such as Advicor (niacin extended
release and lovastatin) and Simcor (niacin extended release and simvastatin).
Prescribed generic versions of fibrates, such as gemfibrozil, are manufactured
by many companies including Impax Laboratories, Inc. (Impax), Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva), Mylan and Lupin among others. Generic
versions of niacins are manufactured by many companies including Teva, Lupin and
Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA), Inc., among others. Commonly used prescription fish
oils include GlaxoSmithKline plc's (GlaxoSmithKline) Lovaza, AstraZeneca's
Epanova and Amarin's Vascepa. Drugs that are in late stage development for SHTG
include Ionis' volanesorsen (Phase 3).

commercializing therapies for the treatment of dyslipidemia, a serious medical
condition that increases the risk of life threatening cardiovascular disease.
Dyslipidemia is generally characterized by an elevation of


 low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or bad cholesterol, triglycerides, or fat in
the blood, or both. We are developing our product candidate gemcabene (CI-1027),
a novel, once-daily, oral therapy, for patients who are unable to achieve normal
levels of LDL-C or triglycerides with currently approved therapies, primarily
statin therapy. Gemcabene's mechanism of action is designed to enhance the
clearance of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) in the plasma and inhibit the
production of fatty acids and cholesterol in the liver. Gemcabene is
liver-directed and inhibits apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) protein in the liver
and may inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) in the liver. Gemcabene has been
tested as monotherapy and in combination with statins and other drugs in
895 subjects, which we define as healthy volunteers and patients, across 18
Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials and has demonstrated promising evidence of
efficacy, safety and tolerability.

Cardiovascular disease is a major health concern, causing more deaths globally
than any other disease. Dyslipidemia is generally viewed as an important
predictor of cardiovascular events including heart attack and stroke, and a
cause of cardiovascular disease. It comprises one of the largest therapeutic
areas with annual worldwide drug sales of approximately $22 billion in 2013. We
estimate more than 40% of Americans have LDL-C or triglycerides, or both, above
a normal range. Statins, such as Lipitor, marketed by Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), and
Crestor, marketed by AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP (AstraZeneca), among others,
are standard of care for LDL-C lowering, while fibrates, prescription fish oils
and niacin are standard of care for triglyceride lowering. Although these drugs
are highly prescribed and capable of reducing LDL-C and triglyceride levels,
many patients are unable to effectively manage their dyslipidemia with currently
approved therapies and are in need of better treatment alternatives. For
example, approximately 40% of patients on statins are unable to meet their LDL-C
lowering goal, and doubling a statin dose has shown to incrementally lower LDL-C
levels by a nominal percentage (approximately 6% based on historical evidence),
while increasing safety and tolerability concerns. An even higher percentage of
patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia do not achieve triglyceride levels low
enough to reduce the risk of developing co-morbidities such as pancreatitis.

We believe gemcabene possesses a differentiated product profile compared to
other therapies in the market and in clinical development. Key attributes of our
product candidate include the following:

. Cost-effective, once-daily, oral therapy. Gemcabene is a small molecule
  formulated as a tablet and is cost effective to manufacture. As a once-daily,
  oral therapy, gemcabene, if approved, would be more convenient than other
  non-statin therapies, many of which require frequent injections or multiple
  daily doses. We expect to take a value-based approach to pricing across the
  target indications.

. Promising safety and tolerability. Gemcabene was observed to be well tolerated
  in 895 subjects across 18 Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials both as monotherapy and
  in combination with statins. No subjects died and no subjects experienced a
  serious adverse event (SAE) that was considered to be related to gemcabene. 
  Adverse events (AEs) reported were generally mild to moderate in intensity.
  Gemcabene did not appear to increase the reporting of myalgia (muscle pain)
  when added to statin therapy and no treatment related events of myalgia were
  reported in any gemcabene monotherapy arm in the dyslipidemia trials.

. Significant lipid-lowering of LDL-C, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
  (hsCRP) and triglycerides. In Phase 2 trials, patients with
  hypercholesterolemia treated with gemcabene as monotherapy were observed to
  have significantly lowered LDL-C by approximately 30% from baseline and 
  significantly lowered hsCRP by approximately 40% from baseline. In addition,
  patients with hypertriglyceridemia (†200 mg/dL) were observed to have
  significantly lowered triglycerides by approximately 40%, and based on
  post-hoc analysis, gemcabene was observed to lower triglycerides by up to 60%
  in patients with severe triglyceride levels (†500 mg/dL). Our product 
  candidate's ability to meaningfully lower levels of multiple key lipids
  attributable to cardiovascular disease may expand its use across multiple
  indications within the dyslipidemia market.

. Additive effect in combination with statins. In a Phase 2 trial in patients
  with uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia while on stable statin therapy, 
  gemcabene was observed to significantly lower LDL-C by an additional 25% to
  31% from baseline. This data indicates that gemcabene may better treat a large
  population of patients who are unable to reach their lipid goal with statins
  and other currently prescribed therapies.

. No drug-drug interactions when combined with high-intensity statin doses. In
  two Phase 1 trials, gemcabene was tested in combination with high-intensity
  statin doses, 80 mg simvastatin and 80 mg atorvastatin. No clinically relevant
  drug-drug interactions were observed. In addition, gemcabene has been 
  formulated as a fixed-dose combination tablet with various atorvastatin doses,
  which may offer additional convenience and compliance to patients.

We are initially pursuing gemcabene in the following four indications
(representing approximately 14 million addressable patients in the United
States) as a treatment in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy (the
maximum dose tolerated by each patient) for patients who are unable to reach
their lipid-lowering goals:

. homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a rare genetic lipid disorder
  which results in elevated LDL-C usually due to mutations in both alleles, a 
  pair of genes on a chromosome responsible for a specific trait, of the
  LDL-receptor gene;

. heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), a more prevalent genetic 
  lipid condition which results in elevated LDL-C usually due to a mutation in
  one allele of the LDL-receptor gene;

. atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), patients with
  hypercholesterolemia, or patients with elevated LDL-C who have had or are at 
  risk for a cardiovascular event, such as heart attack or stroke; and

. severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG), in which patients with elevated
  triglycerides are at an increased risk of developing co-morbidities such as
  pancreatitis.

We are pursuing HoFH given that gemcabene has recently received orphan drug
designation for this indication. We believe we can design an efficient
development plan to provide a new treatment alternative for those patients.
Furthermore, we believe that gemcabene's potential ability to treat patients in
the most severe segment of the dyslipidemia market, HoFH, will enhance brand
awareness among key thought leaders and physicians. We are developing gemcabene
for HeFH, ASCVD and SHTG given gemcabene's: (1) promising clinical data in these
indications; (2) cost-effective manufacturing process; (3) convenient oral
dosing; (4) viability as adjunct combination therapy; and (5) large commercial
potential. By the end of 2016, we expect to initiate three late stage clinical
trials for gemcabene in HoFH, hypercholesterolemia, including HeFH and ASCVD
patients on maximally tolerated statins, and SHTG.

We believe it is unlikely the FDA will require us to initiate a cardiovascular
outcomes trial for our target indications. The FDA has not required the
initiation or completion of cardiovascular outcomes trials for recent approvals
of certain dyslipidemia therapies, including non-statin therapies targeting
LDL-C for the treatment of HoFH, HeFH and ASCVD and triglyceride lowering for
treatment of SHTG.
