Abstract:

            A cat litter product is provided and includes manufacture primarily from modified corn starch which is processed through mash distillation. The litter product is pelletized via an extrusion technology process so as to form particles the size of wheat grain.

[0022] Consequently, a need has been felt for a cat litter possessing anti-odor and anti-microbial agents which is biodegradable and provides easy cleanup and lessens cat tracking. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0023] Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is non-toxic and naturally safe. [0024] It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is biodegradable. [0025] It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is odor-eliminating. [0026] It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that is scented. [0027] It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter having anti-microbial agents. [0028] It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter that clumps in a convenient size for easy disposal and which has little dust and reduces tracking by cats. [0029] It is another object of the present invention to provide an improved cat litter which includes manufacture from modified corn starch. [0030] Briefly described according to one embodiment of the present invention, an improved cat litter is provided and includes manufacture from modified corn starch, Yucca Schidigera, anti-microbial agents, anti-odor agents, zeolite, distilled dried grains, and sodium bicarbonate for improving the litter density and for improving cost production. [0031] Modified corn starch is a polysaccharide, which are the most common agents used in providing the cohesiveness, or clumping, of litter when used. Among the suitable agents that may additionally be used for clumping are dextrins, maltodetrins, flours, cellulosics, hemicellulosics, and the many varieties of starches. [0032] Yucca Schidigera is a plant typically found in the desert regions of Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah and Mexico. Among its many properties, the Yucca Schidigera's ability to bind and neutralize ammonia is relevant to the cat litter formula. Natural saponins, which are emulsifying or foaming agents, are found in the leaves of the Yucca Schidigera and are the chemicals responsible for binding and neutralizing the annoying and harmful odors associated with the ammonia formed in the litter after the breakdown of urea, which is found in cat urine. The natural saponins may also act to neutralize the odors associated with cat feces, as Yucca Scutigera is also used in animal foods to help neutralize feces odor within the intestinal tract of an animal so that when the feces are passed the odor is less objectionable. In addition to the natural saponins from Yucca Scutigera, additional anti-odor agents may be added to further curb the smell generated from waste deposited in the cat litter. [0033] Anti-microbial agents are also added to help curb the initiation and development of microbes that may be harmful to cat and cat owner, such as molds. The anti-microbial agents may come from among sodium propionate, calcium propionate or other known chemicals. In addition to the agents suggested, additional anti-microbial compounds may be included with those already suggested so as to provide maximum protection against the formation of microbes, bacteria or molds. [0034] The general method of manufacture of the cat litter formula is comprised of a mash distillation process and an extrusion technology process.DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT A. Composition [0035] An improved cat litter is provided, according to the present invention, comprised of a composition which includes the following ingredients: polysaccharide (modified corn starch); zeolite; yucca schidegira; distillers dried grains; salt compound (sodium bicarbonate); and anti-microbial agents. The distillers dried grains utilized in the improved cat litter is manufactured via a mash distillation process to be described in greater detail below. [0036] Each of the aforementioned ingredients may have one or more sub-components. For example, the salt compound is preferably sodium bicarbonate, however, potassium carbonate and calcium carbonate are envisioned as being selected alone or in combination. [0037] Yucca schidegira, as a natural saponin, is an emulsifying or foaming agent which functions to inhibit urease enzyme action and to prevent the formation of NH3 (ammonia), thereby binding and neutralizing annoying and harmful odors associated therewith. Yucca schidegira further serves to help neutralize feces odor. [0038] The anti-microbial agents, preferably including sodium propionate and calcium propionate, facilitate protection against the formation of microbes, bacteria, or molds. [0039] Zeolite is a natural mineral consisting of silica and alumina. Zeolite has a unique interconnecting lattice structure arranged to form a honeycomb framework of consistent diameter interconnecting channels and pores. Negatively-charged alumina building blocks and neutrally-charged silica building blocks are stacked thereby producing an open, three dimensional honeycomb framework. Odors and gases such as ammonia are attracted to and trapped within the zeolite crystalline structure. Zeolite also adsorbs and desorbs water, thus eliminating and preventing mildew formation. [0040] Modified corn starch is a polysaccharide which serves in the production of alcohol and provides cohesiveness, or clumping of litter. While other cereal grains such as wheat, barley, and rye may be selected, modified corn starch is preferred. In addition, other suitable agents facilitating occlusivity or clumping may include a mixture of detrins, maltodetrins, flours, and arabinoxylans. B. Method Of Manufacture [0041] In practicing the present invention, the general method of manufacture is comprised of a mash distillation process which includes grinding corn into a coarse modified flour called meal. The meal is mixed with water and a malt enzyme, preferably alpha-amylase, and is passed through cookers where starch is liquefied. Heat is applied to enable liquefaction using cookers with a high temperature stage and a lower temperature holding period, wherein a mash product is produced. The high temperature stage facilitates reduced bacteria levels in the mash product. The mash product is then cooled and an additional malt enzyme is added to convert liquefied starch to fermentable sugars. The additional malt enzyme selected includes gluc amylase and beta-amylase, however, gluc amylase is preferred. Yeast, preferably saccharomyces cerevisiae, is then added in order to ferment the sugars to ethanol and carbon dioxide. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the preferred yeast species because it facilitates quick, efficient production of alcohol and possesses a high alcoholic concentration tolerance. Fermented mash results and is sent to distillation, wherein ethanol is extracted, leaving spent mash. The spent mash is centrifuged, where liquid is separated therefrom. The liquid, or stillage, is reintroduced into the cooking system and sold as livestock feed, or is partially dehydrated into a syrup. The aforementioned mash distillation process is executed under controlled pH being adjusted and readjusted in a suitable manner as is commonly practiced in such industry. [0042] The mash distillation process creates two main co-products in the production of ethanol, namely carbon dioxide and distillers grains. The distillers grains are rich in protein, fat, minerals, vitamins, and amino acids, and thus serve as a highly valued livestock feed ingredient. [0043] Next, centrifuged spent mash (distillers dried grains) is suitably dried into a powder to which the following ingredients are added to form a litter product: modified corn starch, zeolite, yucca schidegira, sodium bicarbonate, and anti-microbial agents. The litter product is suitably dried to a powder and is processed through a pelletizer via an extrusion technology process so as to form particles each having a size approximating the size of a grain of wheat. The particles are then bagged and sealed. C. Example [0044] The following example represents the general formulation for the improved cat litter of the present invention.

D. Operation of the Preferred Embodiment [0045] To use the present invention, user simply opens the improved cat litter from its sealed packaging and pours a suitable volume thereof within a container fabricated of a material specifically adapted for use as an animal litter storage receptacle. [0046] Therefore, the foregoing description is included to illustrate the operation of the preferred embodiment and is not meant to limit the scope of the invention. As one can envision, an individual skilled in the relevant art, in conjunction with the present teachings, would be capable of incorporating many minor modifications that are anticipated within this disclosure. The foregoing descriptions of specific embodiments of the present invention have been presented for purposes of illustration and description. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teaching. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the principles of the invention and its practical application, to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention and various embodiments with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated. It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the Claims appended hereto and their equivalents. Therefore, the scope of the invention is to be broadly limited only by the following Claims.
