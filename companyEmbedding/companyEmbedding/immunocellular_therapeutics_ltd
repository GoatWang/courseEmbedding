ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd., incorporated on March 20, 1987, is a clinical-stage biotechnology company. The Company is developing immune-based therapies for the treatment of cancers. The Company's cancer immunotherapies target cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are the drivers of tumor growth and disease recurrence. Its product candidate is ICT-107, which is in phase III testing. In addition, the Company also has a portfolio of other potential therapeutic immunotherapies using a range of approaches to treat cancer. Its other product candidates are ICT-140 for ovarian cancer and ICT-121 for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM).ICT-107The Company's lead product candidate, ICT-107, is a dendritic cell (DC) vaccine for the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM, a type of brain cancer. ICT-107 activates a patient's immune system to target over six different tumor-associated antigens. ICT-107 is involved in a clinical trial designed as a double-blind, placebo-controlled (2:1 randomized), multicenter evaluation of the safety and efficacy of ICT-107 in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. ICT-107 targets approximately six different tumor-associated antigens. The therapeutic vaccine is used subsequent to conventional therapy or concomitantly with chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM.ICT-140ICT-140 is a vaccine that targets approximately seven tumor-associated antigens expressed on ovarian cancer cells. ICT-140 is a DC-based vaccine targeting CSCs and cancer antigens for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer. The Company has completed the Phase II trials of ICT-140.ICT-121The Company is developing ICT-121, a dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccine targeting CD133+ CSCs for the treatment of recurrent GBM and other solid tumor cancers, including ovarian, pancreatic and breast cancers. The product candidate is in Phase I enrolling patient-stage.The Company competes with Roche Group, Amgen Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Novartis AG, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Celgene Corporation, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Oncothyreon Inc., Galena Biopharma, Inc., Bavarian Nordic A/S, Kite Pharma, Inc., Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Immunovaccine Inc., Prima Biomed Ltd, DC Prime B.V., Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., Agenus Inc., OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Verastem, Inc., Stemline Therapeutics, Inc. and Infinity Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

WHY CHOOSE RESEARCH AND MARKETS?



WORLD'S LARGEST SELECTION




TRUSTED BY THE BEST




CUSTOMER FOCUSED




SAFE & SECURE







I recently ordered a book from Research and Markets via their website. Shortly after ordering the book

                         I received a message from the Research and Markets Orders Department stating that payment had not been received for the book. My first thought was credit card fraud. I called Orders Department and was connected immediately with Maria O’Toole. Maria was extremely helpful in resolving the payment question. Maria suggested that since Research and Markets is located in Dublin, Ireland and I am located in Seattle, Washington, my credit card company might have placed a hold on the payment. I checked with my card company and this was indeed the case. I corrected the hold on the payment and informed Maria. Maria confirmed that the payment transaction had been completed and assured me that the book would be delivered in a timely manner. 

I truly appreciate the ease with which I was able to contact a live person quickly and resolve the issue easily. I highly recommend Research and Markets for their depth and breadth of research materials and their excellent customer service.

about us












ImmunoCellular Therapeutics, Ltd.  is a Los Angeles-based clinical-stage company that is developing immune-based therapies for the treatment of brain and other cancers. ImmunoCellular's pipeline includes: a Stem-to-T-cell research program, which engineers hematopoietic stem cells to generate cytotoxic T cells; ICT-121, a patient-specific, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy targeting CD133 found in recurrent glioblastoma; and ICT-140, a patient-specific, dendritic cell-based immunotherapy targeting ovarian cancer. ImmunoCellular recently suspended further patient randomization in its phase 3 trial of ICT-107 in HLA-A2 patients while it pursues a collaborative arrangement or acquisition of its ICT-107 program. 



ICT-107 is a dendritic cell-based immunotherapy targeting multiple tumor-associated antigens on glioblastoma stem cells. ImmunoCellular recently suspended further patient randomization in its phase 3 trial of ICT-107 in HLA-A2 patients while it pursues a collaborative arrangement or acquisition of its ICT-107 program. 
ICT-121 is a DC immunotherapeutic that targets CD133, an antigen commonly associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs).  We are conducting a 20-patient Phase 1 clinical trial in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. 
ICT-140 is a DC immunotherapeutic that targets seven different antigens associated with ovarian cancer, including those expressed by CSCs.  A phase 2 trial is awaiting a partnership or other financing to proceed. 
ImmunoCellular’s goal is to become an industry-leading, independent, commercial-stage cancer immunotherapy company. We have a development pipeline of therapeutically important, commercially attractive product candidates, and a highly productive, proprietary cancer immunotherapy platform. These assets have the potential to transform the treatment of cancer, benefit patients and create value for our stakeholders.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
