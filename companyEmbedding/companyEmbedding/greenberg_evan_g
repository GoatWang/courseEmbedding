 Educational Background



Attendee 


The College of Insurance






Attendee 


New York University

                  Founded in 1831, New York University is now one of the largest private universities in the United States. Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, New York University is one of only 60 member institutions of the distinguished Association of American Universities.

From a student body of 158 during NYU's very first semester, enrollment has grown to more than 40,000 students attending 18 schools and colleges at five major centers in Manhattan and in sites in Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America. Today, students come from every state in the union and from 133 foreign countries. The faculty, which initially consisted of fourteen professors and lecturers (among them artist and inventor Samuel F. B. Morse), now totals over 3,100 full-time members whose research and teaching encompasses the humanities, the sciences, and the social sciences; the law; medicine; business; education; the fine arts, studio art, and the performing and cinematic arts; music; social work; public administration; the ancient world; and continuing and professional studies. With more than 2,500 courses offered, the University awards more than 25 different degrees.  Although overall the University is large, the individuals schools and colleges are small- to moderate-sized units—each with its own traditions, programs, and faculty – and there are many communities to be found within the NYU community based on interests, activities, and shared experiences.

The center of NYU is its Washington Square campus in the heart of Greenwich Village. One of the city's most creative and energetic communities, the Village is a historic neighborhood that has attracted generations of writers, musicians, artists, and intellectuals. NYU, in keeping with its founder’s vision, is “in and of the city”: the University – which has no walls and no gates – is deeply intertwined with New York City, drawing inspiration from its vitality.

In addition to its Manhattan locations, the University is also formally affiliated the Polytechnic Institute of NYU in Brooklyn, the second oldest school of engineering and technology in the country, and has research facilities, notably the Nelson Institute of Environmental Medicine,  in Sterling Forest, near Tuxedo, New York.

And NYU has established itself as the first global network university, with a comprehensive liberal arts campus in Abu Dhabi – the first to be operated abroad by a major U.S. research university – and other sites for study and research in Accra, Ghana; Berlin, Germany; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Florence, Italy; London, England; Madrid, Spain; Paris, France; Prague, the Czech Republic; Shanghai, China; and Tel Aviv, Israel, among other locations.

The Business Council

                  The Business Council is a voluntary association of business leaders whose members meet several times a year for the free exchange of ideas both among themselves and with thought leaders from many sectors.

In its most fundamental form, the Council seeks to foster understanding through discussion.  It promotes learning, best practice sharing and networking by its members with a view to making a contribution to our society, the global economy and to business generally.

Since its founding more than 75 years ago, The Business Council membership has consisted of a group of current or former chief executive officers from a broad range of companies.  All major industries are represented among the members of The Business Council.

Because schedule demands on senior business executives are extensive, the Council provides an especially valuable opportunity to discuss major subjects in a broader ranging forum than is normally available in the course of business activities.

As part of its process, the Council invites leaders in government, politics, academia, science, medicine, technology and other sectors to address the Council and to participate in its discussions.  Council members hope that these discussions result in better understanding by their invited guests as well as by the members themselves.

Today, the Council meets three times a year in a collegial atmosphere to share and explore ideas.As a gathering of peers from many fields, the Council is entirely an educational and deliberative forum.  It never takes positions as an organization and does not advocate any policy or course of action.

Individual members sometimes do present their own views in public discussions.  But they do so as individuals, rather than as representatives of the Council.

US - China Business Council

                    The US-China Business Council, Inc. (USCBC) is a private, nonpartisan, nonprofit organization of roughly 240 American companies that do business with China. Founded in 1973, USCBC has provided unmatched information, advisory, advocacy, and program services to its membership for more than three decades. Through its offices in Washington, DC; Beijing; and Shanghai, USCBC is uniquely positioned to serve its members' interests in the United States and China.

USCBC's mission is to expand the US-China commercial relationship to the benefit of its membership and, more broadly, the US economy. It favors constructive engagement with China to eliminate trade and investment barriers and develop a rules-based commercial environment that is predictable and transparent to all parties.

Among USCBC's members are many large and well-known US corporations, but smaller companies and service firms make up a substantial portion of the overall membership. USCBC is governed by a board of directors composed of distinguished corporate leaders; the current chair is Robert McDonald, chief executive officer of the Procter & Gamble Company. John Frisbie has been USCBC's president since 2004.

USCBC has long served as a respected host of events featuring senior officials from the US and PRC governments. In recent years, USCBC has been honored to receive PRC President Hu Jintao, Premier Wen Jiabao, Vice Premier Wang Qishan, and other distinguished guests from central and provincial government entities. Recent American public figures to meet with USCBC members in the United States and China have included Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, US Trade Representative Ron Kirk, US Ambassador to China and former Commerce Secretary Gary Locke, former Secretary of State James A. Baker, III, former National Security Advisor Lt. Gen. Brent Scowcroft, key members of Congress, and numerous specialists on US-China affairs from various agencies of the executive branch of government and the think-tank community.

The Rockefeller University

                    The Rockefeller University is a world-renowned center for research and graduate education in the biomedical sciences, chemistry, bioinformatics and physics. The university’s 72 laboratories conduct both clinical and basic research and study a diverse range of biological and biomedical problems with the mission of improving the understanding of life for the benefit of humanity.

Founded in 1901 by John D. Rockefeller, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research was the country’s first institution devoted exclusively to biomedical research. The Rockefeller University Hospital was founded in 1910 as the first hospital devoted exclusively to clinical research. In the 1950s, the institute expanded its mission to include graduate education and began training new generations of scientists to become research leaders around the world. In 1965, it was renamed The Rockefeller University.

The university is supported by a combination of government and private grants and contracts, private philanthropy and income from the endowment.

Since its founding, The Rockefeller University has embraced an open structure to encourage collaboration between disciplines and empower faculty members to take on high-risk, high-reward projects. No formal departments exist, bureaucracy is kept to a minimum and scientists are given resources, support and unparalleled freedom to follow the science wherever it leads.

This unique approach to science has led to some of the world’s most revolutionary contributions to biology and medicine.

Throughout Rockefeller’s history, 24 of its scientists have won Nobel Prizes, 21 have won Lasker Awards and 20 have garnered the National Medal of Science, the highest science award given by the United States.

Evan G. Greenberg


A Company of Builders


An Interview with Evan G. Greenberg, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, ACE Limited


Editors’ NoteEvan Greenberg was elected to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer in May 2004 and to the role of Chairman of the Board of Directors in May 2007. Greenberg joined the ACE Group in November 2001 as Vice Chairman, ACE Limited, and was elected to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer, ACE Limited, in June 2003. Prior to joining ACE, Greenberg spent 25 years at American International Group, where he served as President and Chief Operating Officer from 1997 to 2000. Before that, he held a variety of senior management positions, including President and Chief Executive Officer of AIU, AIG’s Foreign General Insurance organization, and Chief Executive Officer of AIG Far East, based in Japan. Greenberg is Vice Chairman of the US-ASEAN Business Council and serves on the board of the US-China Business Council and the National Committee on United States-China Relations. He is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and is an overseer of the International Rescue Committee.
Company BriefWith operations in 53 countries, ACE Group (www.acegroup.com) is one of the world’s largest multiline property and casualty insurers, providing commercial and personal property and casualty insurance, personal accident and supplemental health insurance, reinsurance, and life insurance to a diverse group of clients. ACE Limited, the parent company of the ACE Group, is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a component of the S&P 500 index.
ACE has undergone a tremendous growth in terms of market cap, capital, and earnings. What did you see in this company that made you feel this kind of growth was possible?
When I came to ACE, I had been out of action for about 15 months after leaving AIG, where I was the President and COO. I was looking around for what I wanted to do next.
Brian Duperreault, who was the CEO of ACE and a former colleague at AIG, was consistently trying to recruit me when we would get together. And then 9/11 happened, which triggered a favorable insurance market pricing environment that presented a real opportunity for growth. I needed to get off the sidelines and become engaged.
ACE had the basis for becoming a great global company – it had a foundation of businesses around the world, largely assembled in ’99 with the acquisition of Cigna’s P&C business, which were in various states of development. The original core companies of ACE and a relatively small part of the overall company were operating well.
The combination of Brian and this company and my craft all came together at that moment.
How was the company positioned when you came onboard?
I was engaged with the fact that there was this market that was presenting tremendous opportunity for growth all over the world and we had a company that had large gaps in its capability to take advantage of that. Its product line was not broad enough; its geographic presence wasn’t deep enough; its workforce was weak in terms of skill and experience; and there was limited ability to think big and prioritize. We also had to integrate disparate cultures from our various acquisitions. But it was like walking into a banquet where, if you’re not careful, you’re going to gorge yourself and be sick. We wanted to come out much larger but well organized and well built, and with the right position.
Between 2002 and 2005, it was like we were putting the wings on the plane as we were preparing to take off.
Are you happy with how the company is positioned today in terms of the product line?
The moment a CEO is satisfied or has lost his proclivity to vision is the time he should put down his tools and step away from the workbench to make room for somebody else.
The global insurance business is roughly $3 to $4 trillion; we do $21 billion of it, so there is a lot of room for growth.
Our product line is quite broad, though within almost every product area we have the potential to go deeper. Some are far more developed than others.
Geographically, we’re well positioned in 53 countries around the world; and we’re well balanced – half of our business is outside the U.S. Though we’re well positioned in Asia and Latin America, it ought to represent a greater percentage of our business over time if we do our job because that is where the economic pie will grow in a sustained way over an extended period of time at a faster rate than the developed Western economies will – that is where the wealth creation is.


ACE is building its brand in Asia after acquiring local life
insurance companies in 2011

Our focus, distribution, and ability to reach our customers are in varying degrees of development, and that includes our penetration of various customer segments, from the large industrial commercial and multinational to middle market to individual consumer to the rising middle income to the upper middle income to the high-net-worth. All of this represents tremendous opportunity.
This is a company of builders – we thrive on building and acquisitions to complement what is already a well thought out strategic plan and blueprint for building.
How do you get the message across about what makes ACE unique?
Everyone may use the same words, but the proof is in the execution. A lot of big companies have the advantage of size and resources. But most are bureaucratic, communication is not great, and they can’t react quickly.
We don’t think of ourselves as a large company. We’re young and restless, but disciplined about what we do. We don’t care about size for size’s sake, so we don’t write revenue that won’t give us a profit in our basic business. We’re an underwriting company. We’re going to make a profit in that basic business. We truly will trade market share all day long to earn a profit in our business. I don’t find many that will do that.
As executive management, we are hands-on. This is a detail-oriented business and to do it successfully, you have to be able to stand on two feet. You have to know what is happening on the ground and we trade on that internally. This is an underwriters’ company where people trade on their pride in earning an underwriting profit – not just in how they grow.
We trade on execution because we know that strategy is 10 percent of the action and 90 percent of it is bringing it to reality, and that is really tough. It requires sacrifice when you make it to a senior position because the burden in the job has just begun; your career is not at the end – it’s at the beginning. You now have the responsibility to take these great resources and create. This makes us different. We have an owners’ mentality in the company.
One thing we pride ourselves on is that while anybody can do it with unlimited resources and money, we do the same thing at one-tenth of the cost with one-tenth of the resource allocated to it. We look to be entrepreneurial and to live by our wits. We grew quickly that way and we fight hard not to lose that in our culture today.

			    for the company’s Global Day of Service in October 2010

CEOs suggest that when you get to a certain size, it’s tougher to maintain that entrepreneurial feel and a culture of innovation. But for ACE, those areas are the differentiators.
When you’re small, it’s line-of-sight management and if someone doesn’t contribute, the hole is apparent.
But while we treat each other with decency, we expect everyone to be frank, so we identify our weaknesses and problems and we self-correct.
That is the only way not to become hidebound and bureaucratic. Large companies fall in love with process after a while. You need a certain amount of process but it doesn’t replace weakness of individuals and performance.
Is there still strong growth in the U.S. market for ACE or is there more of a shift to the international side?
I see great growth and opportunity in the United States over time. The insurance business is a long-term business so you have to be patient in strategy and impatient in execution.
ACE over time will double or triple its size in the U.S. be it on my or my successor’s watch. I believe there will be continual opportunities to innovate and grow the business.
We are now the number two crop insurer in the U.S. I see great opportunity in the agriculture industry broadly because that is a growth area for the U.S., as well as in technology and insuring other-than-physical assets because the wealth is being created other than in a physical way. While it’s a difficult area, it presents great opportunity. We’re a country of laws and the laws and regulations are constantly changing, but that is creating exposure and opportunity.
We’re just beginning to grow in the high-net-worth personal lines area. ACE is positioned uniquely among a few to do that business well in this country and overseas.
Is the U.S. losing its competitive edge as a global leader?
No. Our competitive advantage is in our ability to innovate. Unlike a country like China, the private sector is the largest part of the economy and the government is smaller.
We have wandered off the path and lost sight of what the source of our wealth creation truly is: innovation. We’re a country of laws, which should create greater stability and certainty, and we have the personal freedom and talent to create a dynamic economy. But we have lost sight of that and as a nation, we need to address it.
On the other hand, I’m encouraged by the public dialogue and recognition of it, and the restlessness among the population about it. Democracy is messy and it has its inefficiencies, and that means that unlike a command-and-control environment, it will take us time. Ultimately, I try to remain optimistic.
How critical is it to drive the value of community engagement throughout the organization?
The building of our business and philanthropy are two sides of the same coin. I believe that most people want to make a difference. I also believe a great percentage of people have a need to belong to something bigger than themselves.
We’re making a difference be it in Indonesia, Brazil, Thailand, or the U.S. – no great economy can grow without an insurance industry. We protect people’s assets, whether it’s a business or an individual or a physical asset or a cyber asset. We collect a lot of monetary assets and we invest long term in the building of nations and economies. So we serve.
At the same time, we create wealth for shareholders and we create skilled employment, be it agents in Vietnam or high-priced underwriters in Chicago.
Also, when we earn a profit, we have the pleasure of taking a small percentage of that and reinvesting it back into the communities where we live and work to help those less fortunate. We don’t do it through aid – we don’t believe in providing aid outside of a disaster. We believe in providing support to help people do for themselves. It is part of our culture to contribute not just monetarily but also our time.
People see insurance as an expense until it’s needed. Is it frustrating that the value of it is not always well understood?
Our customers see us twice – to give us money and when something unfortunate has happened to them, and neither is an uplifting moment.
Generally they feel, “I rarely get back more than I give you.” But frankly, in aggregate, we better not give back more than we collect.
Also, people think it’s a boring business but it’s one of the most complex and interesting businesses around because we buy and hold risk, and the risk of society and the world is constantly changing. So the nature of our exposure and our ability to interpret it and put it in financial terms globally are forever changing.
Is the business more complex today?
Yes and more dynamic than it has been. Part of risk management is to understand that you can’t know everything and to realize your limitations.
We have more tools to deal with the complexity, but none of these tools replace common sense and judgment. You forget that at your peril. The graveyard of financial services is littered with the bodies that have ignored that.
Ultimately, the chief executive of an insurance company is the chief risk officer. Along with my colleagues, my job is to help the organization understand as best we can, because we buy and hold risk, what our concentrations of exposure are and how those exposures correlate to each other, and how much can we take and manage, because we’re limited by the capital of our balance sheet.
Do you still enjoy this business?
I covet it and enjoy most days. No one can understand the pressures on a publicly traded company CEO and how alone you are with your thoughts and issues until you’re in that job. But you rise above it so you can have the pleasure of doing the things you love to do which,  in my case, is to lead and build.•

Evan G. Greenberg
Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, Chubb had a very good start to the year with strong results. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or $2.48 per share compared to $2.26 per share the prior year, up nearly 10%. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition on January 14 last year, so our 2016 first quarter results excluded two weeks of Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, adding those 14 days back into the last year's first quarter, operating income per share this quarter was up 8%.
When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth, I will occasionally use the term "as if" to compare our results to last year's first quarter as if we were one company for the entire quarter and excluding merger-related accounting and underwriting actions. I expect, as the year progresses, we will reduce the need to reference "as if" for quarterly year-on-year results comparisons.
Our combined ratio for the quarter was simply excellent at 87.5%. That compares to 90% last year or 88.9% as if we were one company for the full quarter. Total P&C underwriting income of $783 million was up 28% or about 9% as if. The underlying current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat losses was simply outstanding at 88% and better than last year, driven by a strong performance in our core global P&C business in particular. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $836 million, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter and up 9% over prior year or 3% if we include the investment income for the 14 day stub period.

Chubb's strong earnings produced a good operating ROE of circa [ph] 10% for the quarter, while book and tangible book value per share were up 1.7% and 3.1%, respectively. From post-merger closing to this March 31, book value per share has increased over 9.5% and tangible book has increased about 16%. Bill will have more to say about investment income, tangible book value, and cats, and prior period reserve development.
For the quarter premium revenue growth was about in line with our expectations and what we described last quarter. The same themes prevailed; strong retentions of business, growth in new business over last year's first quarter, but constrained nonetheless due to market conditions, a contribution of new business from cross-selling and the strength of the organization, and a reduction in revenue due to merger-related underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance.
As a reminder, the impact from these last items, which this quarter amount to about 3% of P&C net premium, should ameliorate as we move through the year. For the quarter, P&C net premiums were up about 13.5% in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had a 0.5 point impact. On an as-if basis, P&C net premiums were up over 2%. The commercial P&C insurance market is soft globally. And conditions vary depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. Rates are flat or declining, depending on class of business, size of customer and territory. The rate of decline is slowing, because pricing in many classes has reached or is reaching unprofitable levels. 
On the other hand, there are a few stress classes where we're able to achieve or hold rate. Market terms and conditions continued to soften in a number of classes. At the same time we are discussing rate and term movement, keep in mind, that for the industry, claim inflation is hardly nonexistent and pricing hasn't kept pace, contributing further to industry combined ratios under pressure. And as you have noticed, in fact, loss cost inflation has increased in certain classes while overall reserve adequacy is starting to come under pressure.
As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than mid-sized. But middle market is incrementally more competitive, particularly in the U.S. and Europe as companies stress about growth and reach more aggressively. Wholesale again is certainly more competitive than retail. Again, like last quarter, certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, and Brazil by example are particularly competitive. While in the U.S. and Continental Europe, competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly but soft or softening nonetheless.
Globally, new business remains harder to come by in what simply can be characterized as a hungry market. Competitive new business conditions are ameliorated for us to some degree where the power of the organization is brought to bear for a client or producer. Also, our total capabilities in terms of product, ability to serve many different types of insurance customers, our deep distribution strength, and extensive geographic reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is exceptional and, by the way, will only improve with time.
Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segment. Renewal pricing was down about a 0.5% in our U.S. middle market business, with exposure change a positive 0.5%. In our U.S. major accounts business, renewal pricing was down about 1.5%, with exposure change a positive 1.2%. In our international retail Commercial P&C business, pricing was down 2%. By major class of business, beginning with North America retail, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 1%. Financial lines pricing was down about a 0.5% and property-related pricing was down about 3.5%. Internationally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%, financial lines pricing was down 1%, and property-related pricing was down 2%.

Now with that as context, let me give you some more detail on our revenue results for the quarter. In our North America Commercial P&C business, net premiums were up over 19%. Normalizing for the 14 days in January and the impact of merger-related underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 88.5%, with middle market and small commercial at about 87% and major accounts at nearly 94%.
It is worth mentioning that while the overall market is competitive, there are a few classes, such as property and casualty coverage for real estate-related risks, where one or two companies simply for volume, defy any logic and are writing at terms that will produce very large underwriting losses in the future. In these instances, we just walk away. On the other hand, where there is a flight to quality advantage and the strength of our firm stands out, such as in our risk management business, renewal retention can be as high as 100%.
Overall, new business writings for North America commercial lines were up 16% over first quarter 2016. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up 13%. On an as-if basis, and excluding the 5 point impact of additional reinsurance, growth was about 6.5%. Rates were up over 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention remained quite strong at over 95%.
Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for international retail P&C business were up 10.5% in the quarter in constant dollars or nearly 6% as if. Growth for our global A&H business was up more than 5% in constant dollars or 1.5% as if, made up of 4.5% in North America, which includes combined insurance and our group A&H business, and about 1.5% in international. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends.
I want to say a few words about integration. Operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on track or ahead of schedule. Integration-related savings are directly contributing to our margins in the face of declining rates and continuing loss cost trends while giving us room to invest in our competitive profile, including our technology, talent, product expansion, and future operating efficiency. Total integration-related savings impacted our combined ratio by about two points.
In closing, there is a combination of strength and stability in our company that is highly attractive to our distribution partners and customers. Our people are intently focused on execution of strategies. We have a lot of energy in the organization right now and a great deal of optimism and passion. Personally, I am confident in our people and capabilities and in our prospects near and long term.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your questions.
Philip Bancroft
Thank you, Evan. Chubb's overall financial position grew stronger in the quarter as we continued to generate substantial capital and positive cash flow. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $460 million to shareholders, including $320 million in dividends and $140 million of shares repurchased. Year-to-date through yesterday, we have repurchased $200 million.
We also paid off $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter. Our $1 billion of 2007 hybrid notes converted to a floating rate earlier this month, which at current rates will reduce our 2017 interest expense by over $30 million. Investment income was $836 million and was within our expectations. While there are always a number of factors that impact the variability of investment income, we expect our quarterly run rate to remain in a range of $830 million to $840 million.

Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $360 million, primarily from our investment portfolio and principally due to decreases in interest rates. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on book value of $118 million and a small unfavorable impact on operating income of $3 million. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1 billion.
Net loss reserves decreased $191 million for the quarter on a constant dollar basis. This primarily reflects a seasonal decrease in our crop reserves, favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter, and the amortization of the fair value liability adjustment established in purchase accounting. After adjusting for these items, net loss reserves increased by $319 million. The paid to incurred ratio in the quarter was 91% after adjusting for the items noted above. We had positive prior period development of $231 million pretax or $155 million after tax. This included $41 million pretax of adverse development related to the change in the Ogden discount rate in the UK, which impacted our casualty related exposures. 
We also had favorable development of $79 million related to the 2016 crop year loss estimates. The remaining favorable development was split evenly between short-tail and long-tail lines with the long-tail coming from accident years 2013 and prior. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were $206 million or $164 million after tax compared to $258 million or $204 million after tax in the prior year. Catastrophe losses this quarter were primarily from North America weather events and Cyclone Debbie in Australia.
During the quarter, P&C premium growth was negatively impacted by incremental merger-related underwriting actions and additional reinsurance of $187 million, impacting growth by 3%. In addition, the alignment of accounting policies related to the timing of recognizing premiums in 2016 for certain of Chubb Corp's foreign subsidiaries adversely impacted the quarter by an additional $73 million or 1.1%. When considering these items, P&C premium growth was 2.2%.
As Evan mentioned, our integration efforts are either on track or ahead of schedule. Total incremental integration-related savings realized in the quarter were $124 million, leading to total cumulative realized savings of $449 million. On an annualized run rate basis, savings through March are $710 million. The operating income tax rate for the quarter is 14%, which is below our expected range of 16% to 18%, primarily due to a tax benefit related to our employee benefit programs, including the required adoption of new accounting guidance on stock compensation.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Helen.
Helen Wilson
Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. We'll have our first question from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley.
Kai Pan
Good morning and thank you. First question on the cost savings side, does it contribute two points to your P&C combined ratio, I just wondered, do you see potential upside to the $800 million target and how much of that will flow through bottom line versus reinvestment?
Evan G. Greenberg
Upside to the $800 million. We are right now ahead of schedule in our realization of the $800 million on both an annualized and realized basis. We're thoughtfully reviewing where we are. And we will update our views about expense savings we will realize, both annualized and realized, at the end of the second quarter when we do the second quarter call. At that time, I expect we will upsize the $800 million. But beyond that, I'm not going to give you any guidance.
Kai Pan
And how much would that flow through to the bottom line?
Evan G. Greenberg
We're not, you know what, Kai, we're not going there. A substantial portion will flow through the bottom line. It's offset by natural rises in our operating expenses. We're a very efficient company. As you've noticed over the years, we control expenses well, but you still have natural inflation and expense. Then we have investments we're making in the company, technology in particular, though I note that it seems that there is a misunderstanding about how that works. Those are capitalized expenses. You have a timing question. And we hardly -- like anybody, we hardly lay out a model of here's how our -- here's the detail of how our expenses look. So you'll figure that for yourself.

Kai Pan
Okay, great. My follow-up question is, if we step back, look at your earning growth potential, we see your combined ratio is very good and already very good and premium gross profit is limited given the pricing environment and buyback could help EPS a little bit, probably a couple of points. What do you see could drive the EPS higher from here? And what do you see as a sort of earnings power for this franchise?
Evan G. Greenberg
Well, I'm quite bullish about the earning power for the franchise. Margins, as you saw this quarter, are -- the loss ratios naturally rise as you're in a pricing environment that is soft and you have loss cost inflation. And that's ameliorated for us by both portfolio management, choices we can make in terms of where we grow our business, because we have far greater optionality in that regard, which helps to mix loss ratio. And then as you know, we have substantial expense improvements that help margins. 
Secondly, the organization did grow. The underlying -- when you account for the underwriting noise due to the merger and the accounting, underneath it all, we did grow. And that growth was pretty broad-based. And in spite of the world we see, I see momentum. And our -- what we can do internally, the part we control, I see that part only improving and momentum building as time goes on, particularly in that middle market and small commercial business and pockets around the world. Our A&H business and our large account business, which had frankly quite good growth. If you look at our risk management business this quarter, it stood out because of flight to quality and capability and stability that Chubb presents that frankly is a standout. And so -- and then you look at our Personal Lines business that actually showed underlying growth in the quarter. I am quite bullish overtime about our capability to produce wealth creation.
Kai Pan
Great, well thank you so much for all the answers.
Evan G. Greenberg
You are welcome. 
Operator
Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo.
Elyse Greenspan
Hi, good morning. I first had a question, the cat losses screened pretty low this quarter just given the size of the industry losses that we saw in the U.S. So I was wondering if you can comment just on your exposure and did the rate of reinsurance that you guys purchased last year, did that help to alleviate some of the cat losses in the quarter? And so when we think about Chubb, is your kind of quarterly cat loss load lower now than it would have been for each of the legacy companies?
Evan G. Greenberg
No, the additional reinsurance that we have purchased really didn't have an impact on ameliorating cat loss in the quarter. We set our appetite on cat losses as a percentage of capital in particular. And frankly, the cat losses in the quarter, it's geographic, it's where they hit. And they happened to hit where we had less concentration.
Elyse Greenspan
Okay, thanks. And then can you provide, I mean your opening commentary, you spoke about higher inflation for the industry. Can you give a little bit more color by line, where you're seeing greater inflation? And what prior periods would you potentially compare the inflationary levels we're seeing today within the property and casualty industry?
Evan G. Greenberg
Yes, I'm not going to go on that part. But look, you can see it pretty simply, you see it. Anything with wheels on it has inflation. That doesn't take a genius. And on Professional Lines, I would call out in particular, where D&O is experiencing more inflation and you're seeing it in security class action, in particular merger-related objection, in particular employment practices liability, in particular there is inflation. And you don't just see it in the United States. You see it on other geographies around the world, such as Australia, such as security class action beginning in Europe and the UK. You're seeing more of that. So those are two examples for you.

Elyse Greenspan
Okay, great. And then just, Phil, on the Ogden charge in the quarter, did that hit both overseas gen and reinsurance?
Philip Bancroft
There was about $8 million in reinsurance and the remainder was in COG.
Elyse Greenspan
Okay, great. And then do you have a share repurchase update as of quarter-to-date?
Philip Bancroft
Year-to-date, as of yesterday, was $200 million.
Elyse Greenspan
Okay, thank you very much. 
Philip Bancroft
You are welcome. 
Operator
We'll go next to Jay Gelb, Barclays.
Jay Gelb
Thanks very much. Evan, I had a couple follow-ups with regard to your annual letter. In 2017...
Evan G. Greenberg
You read it, did you?
Jay Gelb
With great interest. In 2017, I think I believe you said we should expect growth from Chubb in constant dollars, even while taking into account the soft market conditions. I know you touched on in your prepared remarks, but if there's any other insight you could add on that, that would be helpful? Thank you. 
Evan G. Greenberg
Yes. I said to you that in the last earnings call, I believe that, look, first quarter would look to a degree like fourth quarter, you'd begin to see the amelioration of some of the underwriting actions we took, etcetera. And that minus 1.9% or 2% was less than you saw in prior quarters. Secondly, the normalized for all that, and I hate as if and I hate noise, you want it just as published. And we're getting there. But the underlying of 2% growth is an improvement. And it's pretty broad-based to me. When I look at it by region, I look at the P&C business broken down between its various segments, between its various lines of business. And I see a building momentum in that regard, but offset by what you have to do in underwriting to maintain margins. 
I'm not looking for this company to be publishing mid-90s combined ratios. And that means on various portfolios, as pricing or terms reach a point, you have to be disciplined and trade growth for underwriting discipline. I think that we're showing great restraint and great discipline in that regard of underwriting and at the same time, getting more and more after the growth opportunities that you put them all together and that you can produce combined ratios like that and grow on the underlying at 2% or greater. That's a pretty good trick to me. And I expect, as I say, in certain areas where we really see opportunity for that to continue to build momentum.
Jay Gelb
That's helpful. The other area of the letter that really caught people's attention was the unfavorable comment on the insurance brokers, can you give us some insight there in terms of what issues you see as most problematic?
Evan G. Greenberg
Yes, you made me win -- I won the bet because of your question. I knew, I believed this question was going to come up. Look, I want to put a little context around this, and then I want to just expand on my comments. And this is hardly some cause celeb for me. It was one comment out of a letter that commented on many things in the industry and beyond the industry. 
Chubb is an agency and a brokerage company. We are not a direct writer. This is our chosen form of distribution. Now one of the reasons, one of the main reasons I am a firm believer that brokers and agents, intermediaries, provide a necessary role in the selection and market-making function in our business. And if they didn't, then frankly there wouldn't be a -- there wouldn't, long term be a place for them. In a market-based economy, if you don't really have a role that's necessary, you soon disappear. I believe it is a vital role in our business. And agents and brokers are our partners. 
In brokerage, it's more ambivalent. It's by the nature of brokerage. They represent a client. In agency, they truly are an extension of us, they represent us, and they are our partners. My comments came about because I've been in this industry for over 40 years. I care about this industry and I care about its long-term health. I was referring in particular to the facilitization of business that I see, predominantly that we see, predominantly but not exclusively in the wholesale markets. And I think some of that behavior has gone beyond what is reasonable. 

How does it look? The broker, particularly in the wholesale area, will box up, will collect the class of business for efficiency's sake into one portfolio. Business that was placed at one -- as one-off risks, particularly smaller and midsized risks, but not exclusively. It could be just simply a class of business. But they bring it all into one place and so there's a lot of volume. And so in the first instance, it's spoken of as efficiency. But that volume is used to attract underwriters, who no one comes with clean hands, who for the sake of volume will do things to pricing and terms and conditions that aren't that prudent, that aren't sustainable, and that they otherwise wouldn't do when its one-off risk placed. 
And then for the sake of efficiency, it is more efficient for the broker to place it this way, more efficient for the underwriter, in some cases, to receive it this way, but not in all cases. Compensation goes up. Price goes down, compensation goes up, what's the logic of that? And frankly, in this world today, a digital world where there is greater efficiency and greater transparency, what industry or business do we know about where prices are going down but intermediary percentage of the dollar of what's being placed goes up. And that's what's occurring in the facilitization of the business. I don't think it's advisable. I don't think it's in the long-term interest or even the medium-term interest of our business, of our industry. I don't think it's sustainable. And I say it because I care about the industry. And I think like every other industry, those who are knowledgeable of markets, who are knowledgeable of how to use technology in markets, they will notice this, and change will come, without a doubt in my mind.
Jay Gelb
Thank you for that and if I could just focus on one separate issue, given your position in the industry, given the media speculation on the CEO transition that looks like it's forthcoming at AIG, any perspective you'd like to provide on that?
Evan G. Greenberg
No. I wish them well. I'd like to see a healthy AIG. And I can guarantee you Chubb's ability to thrive and to execute our strategy is hardly based around a competitor stumbling or not thriving. And I'd like to see a healthy company. So I wish them well in their selection.
Operator
We'll go next to Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Jay Cohen
Yes, a couple of numbers questions. So I believe you said there was an accounting adjustment on the premiums of $73 million, I guess it was a negative, does that continue going forward or was that a one quarter issue?
Philip Bancroft
It looks like it will also recur in the fourth quarter in the neighborhood of $50 million. But then second and third quarters are immaterial impacts.
Jay Cohen
Okay. And then beyond this year, there's no impact?
Philip Bancroft
No, that's correct. It'll all be over this year.
Jay Cohen
That's helpful. And then secondly, on the administrative expenses in both U.S. personal and U.S. commercial, that number dropped quite a bit from where it had been running for the past couple of quarters. And obviously, you're recognizing some synergies, but it was a pretty notable drop off. I understand that there was a pension benefit essentially versus a year ago and I'm wondering if you could break that out, I want to see how much the number came down beyond just the pension change?
Philip Bancroft
The expense savings, the incremental expense savings over the first quarter of last year was $124 million. The pension change was not included in that number. That's an additional $28 million that's been allocated to the units.
Jay Cohen
And that's mostly in the U.S.?
Philip Bancroft
It is mostly in the U.S. but it's spread amongst the units. Actually no, the pension change was all in the U.S., sorry.

Jay Cohen
All U.S. okay, that is helpful. Thanks a lot. 
Operator
And next, Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill.
Paul Newsome
Hi, good morning, thanks for the call. We're past the -- you are past the deal with between ACE and Chubb and we have an ongoing soft market. What does that mean from a capital management perspective, would we see continued higher dividends and perhaps more stock repurchases as the benefits of the deal come through?
Philip Bancroft
We've said we have an authorization of $1 billion for this year, and we have no plans beyond that.
Evan G. Greenberg
No change to our playbook. 
Paul Newsome
Steady as she goes, okay.
Evan G. Greenberg
That is right, there is -- Paul maybe to go a step further. There was no surprise to us in the landscape you just painted. There has hasn't been a change to us. It's a year since the merger, going well. The market is soft, the market was soft, the market is soft. That's exactly within our expectation. And so actually, there is no change in what we see internally and expected of ourselves. And there is no change from what we expected to the external environment.
Paul Newsome
That's great. And what about the M&A outlook at this point? Again, through a good chunk of the merger integration, do you think -- should we expect to see you more active in the market?
Evan G. Greenberg
No, I'm not comment -- I'm not going there. I'm not commenting on -- we have plenty to do in not only completing integration, but in unlocking the power and potential we see of this organization. And if we never do another deal, the value creation potential we have in our hands is enormous, simply enormous. And from both the product, geographic, customer perspective, God, don't lose sight. This is P&C industry is, what, about $2.5 trillion a year of business. We write about 1.5% of it, almost a rounding of it. And we have, what, something like 10 countries that we do over $400 million a year in, a hardly excessive market penetration. And the opportunities, when you put together the capabilities and knowledge of both organizations is simply stunning. And the only thing that stands in the way is you got to maintain or you got to balance it with underwriting discipline when people are doing dumb stuff. So over any period of time I look at this organization, we're going to win and we're going to outperform. And there are going to be moments in every micro market and in every product area where there's, because the world doesn't move in lockstep, where we're going to be able to just zip ahead. So in that regard, forget about M&A, stay tuned.
Paul Newsome
Fantastic, I will stay tuned. 
Operator
We'll go next to Brian Meredith, UBS.
Brian Meredith
Yeah, a couple of quick questions for you. First one, I'm just curious on the homeowner's business, how much of the growth that you're seeing right now is rate versus unit volume growth? Because I know you've been taking potential price increases on the Fireman's Fund business.
Evan G. Greenberg
So we told you -- in my commentary, I told you 6.5% growth normalized and that there was three points and two points between rate and trend. So rate and trend was about 5% together, and overall, we're up 6.5%.
Brian Meredith
Okay. Just unit growth, great.
Evan G. Greenberg
Hold on, Paul Krump is going to expand on that.
Paul J. Krump
Yes, hi Brian, it's Paul. Just a couple of thoughts there. Just wanted to note that the first quarter growth was a little bit higher than the previous run rates because there were some timing issues related to the integration and some of the impacts from ending the Fireman's Fund conversion. So, I think that the run rate is really long term I think, right now, we're seeing around 3%, 4%.
Brian Meredith
Got you, great. And then, Phil, just quickly back on the administrative expenses, just to follow-up on Jay's question. So the pension's all going through the admin line right now, but still a pretty substantial decline on the year-over-year basis. Was there any shifts with respect to kind of reallocation of kind of expenses this year versus last year versus loss in administrative expenses?

Philip Bancroft
It was. There was. There's about $24 million that moved from administrative expenses to ULE of our loss costs. That was just an attempt to make the policies consistent between Chubb Corp. and Legacy ACE.
Brian Meredith
Makes sense. Thank you. 
Operator
Ian Gutterman, Balyasny.
Ian Gutterman
I guess I was hoping you guys could expand a little bit on the comments on incipient loss cost inflation and just what drivers you're seeing in the environment. And I guess if I throw out a few, maybe to prompt a response, is this the delayed impact of more liberal judges appointed, is it the populism we've seen across the country showing up in the jury box, or is it something more close to home and to the industry meaning to say, terms and conditions have deteriorated and things that wouldn't have prompted a lawsuit, now that plans bar sees a hole they can drive through and takes you to court?
Evan G. Greenberg
Yes, I'll come to that. Let me go a step further beyond Professional Lines and commercial auto. We regularly look at portfolios and it happened just last week, a group of us spent many hours doing the deep dive with our casualty folks from around the world, going through all casualty portfolios and giving updates on what we see in pricing and trend. And our updated look at trend right now, it's a -- the casualty-related trend primarily is running around 4%. And so you'll say, well, that's not 5%. And we see the same thing in comp, by the way. And so that's not 0%. And that's my point. While it's still a little tamer than what we had seen historically in the past, you take 4% that goes year-over-year-over-year-over-year and you got prices that are flat or down, well, do the math of what happens to loss ratio and what you do with risk selection, et cetera, and portfolio management or terms to alleviate, that plus expense are your anecdotes. But other than that, it does grind.
When it comes to Professional Lines in your question, it is about the external environment and I'll ask maybe John Keogh and John Lupica, who both grew up in the business, to speak, maybe give you a few comments. But I would tell you this. It's not that we're seeing populism. Remember this doesn't happen on a dime or appointments of judges recently. Appointment of judges, that has occurred for the last 8 years. You've stacked a more liberal court, on one hand. But what we're also seeing is a change in the plaintiff bar environment. There are more plaintiff bar law firms, more boutique law firms who are like ambulance chasers and out to make a buck. And it's attacks on society, by the way, it's attacks on corporations and it's a problem where anything that represents any kind of bad news, that is natural exposure to any kind of business, and by the way, this is not restricted to one industry like health care or I read some of that and that's just not right. It's very broad-based. And there's not a merger that goes down where there isn't a lawsuit filed on both sides. You paid too much, you paid too little. And do these get settled? They get settled to reduce its money, but it's still money and it increases the frequency. And then security class actions around absolutely everything. And then employment practices liability, as an example, has found its way into higher-paying jobs, when it seems as part of layoffs today that, okay, another retirement benefit you get or another benefit you get is a payment from an EPS. That's the kind -- that's just what's going on. Now I'll ask my colleagues if they want to answer that.
John Keogh
As you see, this is John Keogh. As usual, Evan, I mean, you've kind of covered all. I would, just for color, make the point that when I was deep into the D&O business 15 years ago, there were a handful...

Evan G. Greenberg
Did you say 50 years ago?
John Keogh
15, not that bad. Feels like 50 though. 15 years ago, there were a handful of plaintiff firms that drove all the litigation, at least here in North America. Today, when you look at the list of plaintiff firms, and most of them are led by people who worked at those handful of firms who've gone out on their own, there are dozens firms today, all of whom are going to work every day with the ambition to make money and find ways to create new theories of litigation, new theories of liability against corporate America. And I think that is a fundamental change in the business that they we're witnessing in terms of the frequency of claims in the D&O business that is not, in my mind, a temporary change. It's a secular change. This is going to be with us and probably there's a dozen more firms in the next 5 years, that wouldn't surprise me, that are making a living doing this. And then outside the U.S., in Australia and UK, they see what goes on here, the lawyers. They see an opportunity. And the thing I would add that Evan did not mention is litigation funding, right? Whether it's here in the U.S. or in UK or in the Australia. Right, there are funds, right, that are attracting some serious money to fund the litigation in the D&O world, which obviously creates more both frequency and severity in this business than we've seen before.
Ian Gutterman
Got it. And if I could sort of tie that in...
Evan G. Greenberg
John Lupica says we've wrung it dry.
John Lupica
I think you guys got it.
Ian Gutterman
Just to tie that in, Evan, with your comments in the press release about the softening market. And when I think about a sort of true soft market bottom, I guess, I think more than just price, I think about terms getting worse and winning business through that. I mean, we've seen, obviously, maybe one example is a program business where a lot of people are starting to get burned and I kind of wonder if that's terms and selection. And the other is reserves, right? And just when I look at reserves, you see across most liability classes and Professional Lines a lot less IBNR than you would have seen three years ago, five years ago. Do you look at those type of signs and say, boy, it's really -- maybe it's not 1999, but it's the seventh inning or the eighth inning and all the same things are repeating and it's more than just price or is it really just we're still in that pricing stage and the rest of it doesn't worry you as much yet?
Evan G. Greenberg
Ian, I have been saying for five or six quarters or more now that I've mentioned terms and conditions softening. And I have mentioned the insidious nature of that, because there's a lag before you feel the claim effect from that, that impacts both frequency and severity. We see it beginning to show up in claims around the industry. We see claims that wouldn't have been covered by wordings in the past that all of the sudden become claims now because the wordings have been broadened and we can see that in both short tail physical lines and we see it in various casualty-related classes. I think the impact of that is more in front of us, but the notion, when I say soft market, I am not simply at price, I am right on term and condition. Remember, what we do for our living is manage exposure and that's how we think about it. So wording and coverage, that's part of what drives your view of exposure. Then you're putting pricing against that.
Ian Gutterman
Very helpful, thank you, I appreciate it.
Operator
We'll go next to Larry Greenberg, Janney.
Larry Greenberg
Not much left to cover but I'm curious, Evan, with regard to corporate tax reform. If you could talk just specifically, what impact do you think that might have on the industry and, more specifically, whether or not that could really impact insurance demand?

Evan G. Greenberg
Larry, first of all, tell me what tax reform I'm commenting on, because I don't know. So I just say that so that we just keep this in perspective. I cannot...
Larry Greenberg
Yes, I would just say lower tax rates.
Evan G. Greenberg
I understand the general question. I can't respond with specificity, but I'd say this. We are -- we have needed tax reform for so many years, and American business requires tax reform. And if we do major tax reform, i.e. if we move to a territorial system and we lower the rates, even if we lower the rates to 25%, 20%, it's going to have a major stimulus -- and it's done the right way, it can have a major stimulative impact on our economy, not simply the cash that comes home, but the eagerness to invest. And growth, we insure growth and exposure. The faster the economy grows, the better it is for the insurance business, because exposure grows.
Larry Greenberg
Okay, good enough, thank you. 
Operator
Meyer Shields, KBW.
Meyer Shields
Thanks. 0Evan, I want to jump off that recent comment. Are you seeing signs yet of more new business in the U.S. from economic growth?
Evan G. Greenberg
No, not really. I don't -- I think there was a -- animal spirits were obviously awakened by the policy direction of the new administration. Policy direction that I personally endorse when it comes to deregulation of business, less regulation. God, get government out of our way. When it comes to tax reform, when it comes to infrastructure, it will simply have a multiplier impact on our ability to grow efficiently the productivity in the economy. Those are great things. I think that the reality that is setting in is that stating policy and implementing policy are two different things. And it will take time to implement policy. And at the same time, I personally, and I know many were cautious about the stance we're going to take regarding trade because that can have, depending on the stance we take and the approach we take as a country, that can have a negative impact on economic growth. And I think, right now it is always natural. The moment of euphoria is passing. And I think we're at a moment where there is a sense of realism. So therefore, I am not really seeing a pickup in economic activity that -- a trend change that is impacting our business.
Meyer Shields
Okay, thanks. And Phil, quick question, the $73 million accounting adjustment to premiums, did that have any impact on net or operating income in the quarter?
Philip Bancroft
Very little.
Meyer Shields
Thank you very much.
Operator
Ryan Tunis, Crédit Suisse.
Ryan Tunis
Hey thanks. So, I just had a follow-up, I guess, just thinking about expenses. And I guess, thematically, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Evan, but is it right to think about the integration process' job is. Year one was about making the cost base more efficient and then years two and three perhaps is investing to position the enterprise for future growth? And then I think...
Evan G. Greenberg
No.
Ryan Tunis
That's not the right assessment? Okay. So I'd be interested...
Evan G. Greenberg
No, absolutely not. The expense efficiencies that we're gaining from integration, synergies and all of that, that -- we told you how that plays out between -- we gave you a schedule and showed you how that plays out between 2016, 2017 and 2018. And that is on track or ahead of schedule. What I said to you was, on this call is, that may get -- that we're looking at that right now. We could very well upsize that and we'll talk to you about it in the second quarter. 
So no, it's not like you put it in these neat packets. The investments we're making, we began making them -- ACE was making investments all along and Chubb, in some ways, was starved for investments. And we're making in -- we began and I was very clear about it. And I was clear about it to you on calls, and I was clear about it in the shareholder letter. And that is that we have been making investments and continue to make investments in expanding product, in digitizing the company and in putting in place foundational technologies that will give us greater flexibility to move in many directions, including lower cost. So no, it all goes on at once. That's more how a corporation works.

Ryan Tunis
Okay, understood. So in the letter, the comments about the investments and digitalization was not really referencing an acceleration of investment, just an ongoing part of an investment cycle.
Evan G. Greenberg
Yes, except that, God, a much bigger company now with more opportunities to invest in and, as I said, some who were starved for investment. So we are upsizing investment, but at the same time, given all the efficiencies we gain, we have tremendous flexibility to ameliorate margin pressure, and at the same time, invest for our competitive profile and grow this company in a competitive, sustainable way for the future, which that is our job for shareholders.
Ryan Tunis
Okay, understood. And then just a quick follow-up for Phil. Could you give us an update on the revenue synergies produced as of the end of the quarter? Thanks.
Evan G. Greenberg
The revenue synergies, Phil. Is that 111 million?
Philip Bancroft
Globally.
Evan G. Greenberg
111 million globally in the quarter.
Ryan Tunis
Thank you.
Helen Wilson
Thank you. We have time for one more person to ask question. That comes from Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan.
Sarah DeWitt
Great, thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one follow-up on your comments on Professional Lines inflation. To what extent are you concerned about the potential for inflation with no pricing power? Or do you think the industry could get pricing power if higher inflation emerged?
Evan G. Greenberg
I don't really understand that question, with all due respect. The industry, it's -- we have free will. Lincoln freed us all. And so we have free will and we can react to exposure changes as we see it.
Sarah DeWitt
Okay. So you don't see excess capacity and competitive pressures as preventing pricing power to offset that inflation?
Evan G. Greenberg
Well, those are all factors that -- it's a marketplace. Each will determine for themselves. Ultimately, we all exist in the same world. We're all going to ultimately have the same experience. And some will play it in an intelligent way like a marketplace and some will be a little less intelligent. And I will say, what I am confident about is we have the capacity, we got the paper, we have the balance sheet, we have the data, we have the knowledge, we have the global reach, we have the claims capability and the insight in this business that is unrivaled. And so our ability to manage this business and to be attractive to customers that want Chubb. Well, that's an asset and we'll taken advantage and protect our asset.
Sarah DeWitt
Okay, great. Thank you. 
Helen Wilson
Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day.

Merger mania has swept across huge swaths of the corporate landscape in the last five years. Now the insurance industry, spurred by a $28.3 billion deal, could be about to join that wave.Ace Ltd.’s agreement to buy Chubb, one of the best-known names in the property insurance business, brought talk that more consolidation is in store for the sector. It is being led by Ace’s chief executive, Evan G. Greenberg, scion of a famous insurance family — one known for growing through serial deal-making.Wednesday’s transaction was one of the biggest yet announced this year, a time that has already proved to be extraordinarily fruitful for mergers in general. It will give Ace valuable operations from Chubb, perhaps best known for insurance covering expensive homes, jewelry and fine art. Together, the two will have net written premiums worth over $30 billion and more than 31,000 employees around the world.“The combination of the two will create greater growth and greater earning power,” Mr. Greenberg said in an interview. “I see greater opportunity for the two on a global basis, including in the U.S.”

Over all, analysts say, the property and casualty insurance market has been primed for consolidation for some time. Low interest rates have made it more difficult for these companies to reap satisfactory returns from their capital. Continue reading the main story

An unusually benign period for natural disasters in the last two and a half years, particularly given a lack of serious hurricanes making landfall in the United States, have swelled their coffers with money that hasn’t been paid out to fulfill claims.Already, reinsurers — which essentially buy the risks of traditional insurance firms — have been gripped in a series of mergers. Now, a catalyst like Ace buying Chubb could prove to be the spark that ignites consolidation among property and casualty insurance providers, one that would reduce costs and provide more scale to branch out into new products and markets.“A deal of this scope tells us that something big has changed, and that is the push for growth,” Todd Bault, an analyst with Citigroup, wrote in a research report. “There is now literally no deal that cannot be contemplated.”And Jay Gelb, an analyst with Barclays, added in his own note that the transaction “probably puts pressure to target deals on other insurers that have historically been focused almost entirely on organic growth.”Mr. Greenberg played down any competitive pressure to pursue such hefty acquisitions, saying in an interview that he would have done the transaction even if interest rates had been higher.“I would have done this in a hard environment,” he said. He added, “If it’s compelling, and it makes strategic sense, then it’s great in all markets.”

While Ace is paying a high price, roughly two times book value, merging with Chubb will yield an insurer with much bigger scale and with a proven history of performance, according to Mr. Gelb of Barclays.Empire-building seems to be in the blood of Mr. Greenberg, who is 60. Famously, his father, Maurice R. Greenberg, built the American International Group into a far-flung empire, only to see it nearly crater during the financial crisis.

Mr. Greenberg’s brother, Jeffrey, had previously worked at A.I.G. before striking off on his own to lead Marsh & McLennan, an insurance broker. Jeffrey Greenberg was later forced to resign after an investigation by Eliot L. Spitzer, then New York State’s attorney general.Evan Greenberg himself was once considered a favorite to succeed his father at A.I.G., spending 25 years and rising to the position of president. But in 2000, he, too, left the company. He later resurfaced at Ace, where he became chief executive in 2004 and embarked on a campaign to create a stronger rival to his family’s insurance empire.Much of that has revolved around acquisitions — 21 in the last decade, according to the data firm Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ — that transformed Ace into a property-and-casualty insurer with an international reach; its operations span from Mexico to Thailand. Its business also encompasses reinsurance and life insurance.That experience with mergers, Mr. Greenberg said, prepared Ace for its biggest acquisition to date.“We’re experienced at that and know how to integrate what we covet and what we purchase,” he said. “My organization is ready for something like this.”The deal on Wednesday came together swiftly, according to Mr. Greenberg. He reached out to John D. Finnegan, his counterpart at Chubb, only several weeks ago and rapidly hammered out details of the merger. Among the factors that may have worked in Ace’s favor: Mr. Finnegan, 66, was set to step down next year, after Chubb’s board waived a company policy that would have required him to retire at the end of last year.Under the deal’s terms, Chubb shareholders will receive cash and shares equivalent to $124.13 a share, representing a 30 percent premium to Chubb’s closing price on Tuesday. They will own roughly 30 percent of the combined company.The newly merged insurer will retain the Chubb name — “It’s a venerable name and brand on a global basis,” Mr. Greenberg said — but will be led by Mr. Greenberg as its chairman and chief executive. Mr. Finnegan will serve as executive vice chairman for external affairs for North America and will help combine the two firms.

ATLANTA, Sept. 26, 2016 – The Coca-Cola Company said today that Evan G. Greenberg, 61, has informed the Company that he will resign from the Company’s Board of Directors, effective Oct. 1, 2016.  Greenberg said his decision was based on increased demands on his time resulting from an acquisition by his company earlier this year to create Chubb Limited, of which he is now the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
Greenberg commented: “Due to increasing demands on my time following a major recent acquisition by my company, I have decided to resign from The Coca-Cola Company’s Board of Directors to devote my full attention to my expanded business commitments as Chairman and CEO of Chubb Limited.  I have enjoyed the opportunity of serving on the board over the past few years and believe the Company has strong plans in place for the future.  I have every confidence in the Company’s leadership and wish Muhtar Kent and James Quincey well as they build an exciting future for the Company and its many stakeholders.”
Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Coca-Cola Company, said: “On behalf of everyone at Coca-Cola, I want to thank Evan for his leadership and service to our board. We have benefitted greatly from Evan’s deep experience and perspective, and we wish him every success as he dedicates his time to leading Chubb’s business into the future.”

He held a number of senior management positions, including president and CEO of AIU Holdings, AIG’s foreign insurance organization, as well as CEO of AIG Far East, where he was based in Japan and Korea. Between 1997 and 2000 he served as AIG’s president and chief operating officer.[3] He was considered to be the heir apparent to take over as CEO, but left the company in 2000 and joined ACE in November 2001 as its vice chairman. He became the CEO of ACE in 2004.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
