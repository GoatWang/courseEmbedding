The transaction is expected to be accretive approximately $0.02 to fiscal year 2012 earnings per share, excluding non-recurring purchase accounting items and other acquisition and integration related costs.

	"With the addition of Aspen Surgical, Hill-Rom is well positioned for growth and geographic expansion in our surgical business, particularly in the safety product segments," said John J. Greisch, President and CEO of Hill-Rom. "This acquisition further expands our global portfolio beyond our core franchise with a business that is immediately accretive to earnings per share and adds recurring revenue to our existing surgical platform."

	Aspen Surgical has annual revenue of approximately $120 million.  The transaction was funded with a combination of cash and bank debt.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Hill-Rom Holdings Hits 52-Week High on Solid Product Line


June 02, 2017, 11:38:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 Share price of Batesville, IN-based Hill-Rom Holdings, Inc. HRC  scaled a new 52-week high of $78.51 on Jun 1. The company has gained 56.8%, much better than the S&P 500's gain of 15.9% and Zacks categorized Medical - Products  industry's gain of 10.8% over the last one year. The stock has a market cap of $5.16 billion. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 10%, higher than industry average of 3.7%    Meanwhile, Hill-Rom's current year estimate revision trend is promising. In the past 60 days, six estimates have gone up with no downward revision for the current quarter. The magnitude of the estimate has improved by 0.7% to $3.85 over the same period. The company has a discounted PEG ratio of 1.67, compared to the broader industry's 2.20. It has also recorded a Price/Sales ratio of 1.84, lower than the industry's 3.61.   Hill-Rom Holdings Inc Price and Consensus        Hill-Rom Holdings Inc Price and Consensus    |      Hill-Rom Holdings Inc Quote  Accordingly, the company holds an impressive Value Style Score of B. Our Value Style Score  highlights all the vital metrics to focus on value stocks offering high yields. Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of 'A' or 'B' when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities in the value investing space.  Growth Catalysts  Hill-Rom continues to grow strongly on its strategy of product expansion and diversification. The company recently introduced Hill-Rom Envella Air Fluidized Therapy Bed which offers the highest quality wound care. Apart from this, the company has launched Hill-Rom 900 Accella bed system for higher acuity patients in intensive and acute care settings. Prior to this, management had announced the introduction of Monarch Airway Clearance System which represents Hill-Rom's foray into mobile therapy. This is a major breakthrough for the company to gain space in the digital health front. The market is also optimistic about the company's consistent inorganic growth trajectory. The acquisition of Welch Allyn has helped the company drive innovation in the medical device space and patient care solutions. The buyout has helped Hill-Rom gain a wider global reach with operations in 30 countries. Management is currently looking to expand in international markets on successful execution of its strategy, courtesy of its efficient international team and organizational realignment.  Other Key Picks  Other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Luminex Corporation LMNX  , Inogen, Inc. INGN  and Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. AXDX  . Notably, Luminex and Inogen sport a Zacks Rank #1, while Accelerate Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.   Luminex has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 16.3%. The stock added roughly 12.4% over the last three months. Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%. The stock has a solid one-year return of roughly 82.0%. Accelerate Diagnostics has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 30.0%. The stock added roughly 10.1% over the last three months.  Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric   Cars?  Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.
