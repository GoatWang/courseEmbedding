Meet Dr. Richard R. M. Francis 

Dr. Francis has been practicing medicine for nearly two decades. Since founding Spine Associates in 2003, he has built a considerable reputation by maintaining a conservative approach to treating all spine conditions in both children and adults. He has made it his goal to stay at the forefront of technology, yet maintain a personal connection with patients and their families. Dr. Francis is one of few spine surgeons capable of performing surgeries on children as well as adults and prides himself as one of the first surgeons in the nation asked to perform the artificial disc replacement.  
At Spine Associates we treat the spine, the whole spine and only the spine. We specialize in the treatment of spine deformities such as scoliosis, degenerative conditions, tumors, infections and metabolic diseases. We care for both local and international patients, children and adults—even the most challenging conditions—and excel in treating patients who have had unsuccessful spine surgery.  Whether it’s a spine deformity, spine injury or degenerative disease, we are confident we can find a solution that will allow you to quickly return to your normal life.

Doctor Quote
We exist to provide our patients with the best spinal care available using recent medical advances and current technologies to achieve the best result.

Learn about this doctorDr. Francis' Care PhilosophyDr. Francis is engaged exclusively in the care of Adult and Pediatric Spinal Disorders. This involves deformity correction such as scoliosis and kyphosis, treatment of degenerative conditions of the cervical and lumbar spine, as well as tumors, infections and metabolic diseases of the spine. Additionally, he has a special interest in the revision, reconstruction and salvage of the previously operated spine. Dr. Francis prides himself as consistently being at the forefront of spinal surgery. Lumbar disc replacement has now been approved by the FDA. Lumbar disc replacement is now available to patients who qualify. In a nutshell, Dr. Francis provides comprehensive care of the whole spine. Dr. Francis's practice is based on the principle of conservatism. All reasonable forms of conservative care for patients will be exhausted before consideration of surgical intervention. This is only logical, as Dr. Francis recognizes that the peer- reviewed literature supports the fact that the majority of simple spinal conditions will respond positively in this way, with only a small proportion requiring surgery.Dr. Francis' Experience0ExperienceMatchExperience MatchSee how Dr. Francis' experience matches your preferences.15SpecialtiesFor the best healthcare for your needs, choose a doctor who specializes in your medical condition.112Conditions TreatedCheck to see that this provider treats your medical condition.54Procedures PerformedCheck to see that this provider performs the procedure that you need.Background CheckCheck to see if your provider has any malpractices, board actions, or sanctions.EducationLearn more about where this provider went to medical school, residency, and more.Awards & RecognitionView information about special awards and recognition for this provider.Languages SpokenCheck to see what languages this provider and/or staff speak.Memberships & Professional AffiliationsView memberships and affiliations associated with this provider.Overall Patient Satisfaction112responsesLikelihood of recommending Dr. Francis to family and friends is 3.7 out of 5Have you seen Dr. Francis?Leave a ReviewSee all 309 Orthopedic Spine Surgery Specialists in Houston, TX 77074Dr. Stanley Jones, MDOrthopedic Surgery(29)Dr. Vivek Kushwaha, MDMinimally Invasive Orthopedic Spine Surgery(38)Dr. Howard Cotler, MDOrthopedic Spine Surgery(17)Dr. Neil Badlani, MDOrthopedic Spine Surgery(25)Dr. Rex Marco, MDOrthopedic Spine Surgery(25)Dr. Mark Prasarn, MDOrthopedic Spine Surgery(20)View MoreVisiting Dr. FrancisDr. Francis accepts 36 insurance carriersView all insurance carriers Dr. Francis is now accepting new patients Spine Associates of Houston9301 Southwest Fwy Ste 600Houston, TX 77074This provider offers the following appointment availability:Same DayNext DayEveningSaturday(713) 383-7100Get DirectionsSpine Associates of Beaumont3820 Pointe PkwyBeaumont, TX 77706This provider offers the following appointment availability:Same DayNext DayEveningSaturday(409) 767-8221Get DirectionsAffiliated HospitalsHospital QualityCheck out the quality of care at the 3 hospitals where Dr. Francis has admitting privileges.Memorial Hermann - Texas Medical Center6411 Fannin StHouston, TX 77030Hospital Awards0Overall Patient ExperienceView Hospital ProfileFirst Surgical Hospital4801 Bissonnet StBellaire, TX 77401Hospital Awards0Overall Patient ExperienceView Hospital ProfileMemorial Hermann Orthopedic & Spine Hospital 5410 West Loop SBellaire, TX 77401Hospital Awards0Overall Patient ExperienceView Hospital ProfileDr. Francis' ReviewsLikelihood of recommending Dr. Francis to family and friends3.7 based on 112 total reviews (18 with comments)Leave a reviewDr. Francis' PerformanceTrustworthinessVERY GOODExplains condition(s) wellVERY GOODAnswers QuestionsVERY GOODTime well spentVERY GOODOffice & Staff PerformanceSchedulingVERY GOODOffice environmentEXCELLENTStaff friendlinessVERY GOODAverage wait time 31 to 45 minutesPatient Comments (18)15Port Arthur, TX | Jun 12, 2017Upon my first visit, I was treated with kindness, although the wait was excruciatingly long; I was referred to Dr. Francis from my GP. It was determined within my first visit that I would need a laminectomy for a pinched sciatic nerve. Dr. Francis agreed with how the nerve was pinched, that I was in much discomfort, and we moved forward with the plan for surgery. Dr. Francis promised a two week interval between surgery and returning to work. The actual recovery time for a laminectomy is a minimu55-L.T	 | May 16, 2017It was good	15-Jeremy Haferkamp in Gatesville, TX | Apr 24, 2017Horrible experience! Never saw him after surgery in the hospital. Left in worse pain than I went in. Had to go back due to a screw he put in, causing a secondary fracture in vertebrae, pushing bone splinter into nerve bundle at spine. Couldn't get the right help over the phone. Still in horrible pain. Lost my job. It has been over a year and I have permanent damage due to his 2 surgeries! I a disabled because of him. Please, do not chance using him!!!55Houston, TX | Feb 18, 2017Dr. Francis was very helpful in treating my husband after he was injured at work. I took him to his appointment and we both had a very positive experience. He was thorough and very friendly. I was expecting a long wait time after reading some of the other reviews, but that was not my experience.  He has a follow up scheduled after his first injection and we will see where we go from there!15Houston, Tx. | Feb 13, 2017This was my very first visit ever with a specialist regarding my lower back pain. I will not be going back to this doctor. I waited 4 hours to see him. That is when I got an office manager involved expressing my visit. Nurses were rude. I was forced to have xray, when all of my imaging is up to date.  He came in treated me like a number. I felt no type of concern from him. He forced expensive pt on me through his company. I will be taking my business elsewhere. Beaware wait time, rude staff
25Houston, Tx | Jan 28, 2017Ridiculous wait times (the second visit we waited 4 hours and then left without seeing the doctor). When you finally see the doctor its for 2 minutes. They make you pay a ton of money before claims are processed. Others say its worth the wait to see him but when you have a patient with unbearable back/leg pain and make them wait hours to be seen, its not worth it in my opinion. He will not see you or do surgery unless you pay upfront. 55-Bradely  in Vidor, TX | Dec 13, 2016Dr Francis did my 15 year old sons back surgery in Oct. he did a great job. He was always willing to answer any question I or my son had never rushed us with this whole thing. His after care has been just as great. We went for a check up and seen the nurse but ran into him in the hall he stopped and talked to my son about how he was doing and when they thought he could go back to normal activity. He is also doing his therapy with him and has been doing great my son is no longer in pain from this15-Joshua D in Beaumont, TX | Nov 16, 2016Two words would really sum up my review: SO UNETHICAL!

After performing the surgery he refused to see me anymore even though I was still having pain issues after surgery. He only cares about surgeries and making money off you. By not seeing me he can advertise that only 15% of his patients are recurring. 

I've seen doctors for my back issues for 16 years. Dr. Francis is a quack and a scam. He told me he was fusing one disk but the day of my surgery, after they already had me hooked up to an i.15-Jeana F in Beaumont, TX | Sep 23, 2016First,  I was treated like a drug addict....  Being told to leave my purse in the exam room, because it wasn't allowed in the restroom with me...  To finally: after waiting 3 1/2hrs finally the Dr came in... Only to be told by the Dr himself not to talk, his nurse would tell him ALL OF MY PROBLEMS...  And if the 4 back surgeries hadn't worked  a 5th sure wasn't going to help.... " YOU KNOW I WONDER IF HE REALIZED HE JUST CALLED HIMSELF A POOR SURGEON"...  HE WAS SO ARROGANT AND BEYOND RUDE...15-Imran  in Houston, TX | Sep 14, 2016I want to give ZERO star to this doctor.
He is kind of Doctor who would look at you as you're a bank check and not a patient.
Total waste of time and money.
He conducted completely irrelevant tests, from out of network lab (i am sure some way associated with him), and declared need of urgent surgery giving a completely wrong medical explanation. I told him, i would like to get another opinion, but his staff called me very next morning to schedule surgery.
Just after money. 15-Isabel Leal in Texas | Aug 21, 2016Absolutely horrible!!! No bedside manner,rude and arrogant.had a 6 pm appointment and it was 10 pm when I was seen. And he gave us 5 min of his time. Can never get the same person at his office,nobody knows what is going on,is a complete cluster mess!!!
He maybe a great surgeon but I won't find out after that first introduction .55-Brett O in Beaumont, Tx. | Aug 10, 2016I would ABSOLUTELY recommend Dr. Francis and would have the surgery done again in a heartbeat.  I went from not being able to do hardly anything for about 6 years and being terrified of the horrors of surgery to being able to do anything I wanted after surgery and about two months of physical therapy. Thank you and your Staff.  The wait time at appointments is somewhat lengthy but you have one Dr. seeing everyone from the Golden Triangle that wanted to see HIM.  Very informative on procedures. 15-Mike C. in Spring, TX | Jul 27, 2016I HIGHLY recommend that you see another doctor.  His bedside manner lacked.  He's egotistical and I did not feel comfortable around him after my surgery.  Prior to surgery the anesthesiologist as well as Dr. Francis were rushed and impersonal.  He didn't know what he prescribed me after surgery.  He didn't know if he had recommended a chiropractor or PT.  He sent in his P.A. to see me each time and there was a sense that he was disinterested.  Wait time was three hours to be seen. 15Mar 11, 2016Horrible!!! I wouldn't even give one star. 
We arrived a little before 4:00 for our 4 o'clock appointment and we left a little after 7:00 because we still had not been seen by Dr. Francis. We were told that we still had 2 patients ahead of us. Waiting over 3 hours to see a doctor is RIDICULOUS period!!!15-TK in Friendswood, TX | Feb 04, 2016Don't waste your time.  I'm almost positive MD owns part of or gets payment due to ownership of the drug testing labs.  You should see all that they billed my insurance for for 1 VISIT!!!!!!! 25 different CPT codes and now sending me a bill!!!!! I waited over 2 hours and staff says wait is usually over 4 hours. Horrible horrible bed side manner, spoke like a robot and would only talk through his NP/PA, which was so awkward I felt so sorry for her.  There are way too many Drs to waste your time55-Earlan Mccray | Jan 05, 2016I, Earlan McCray, would like to take this opportunity to say thank you. Thank you for a spine surgery well done and to you and your staff for the professional and knowledgeable people that you all are and for answering all of my questions in a way that I could relate to and making me feel very comfort at office and at the hospital. I would recommend family and friends to you and your staff. Once again thank you, thank you Dr.R. Francis and Staff.55Houston | Dec 19, 2015I was just told I was a candidate for surgery by a different doctor. I was terrified & wanted a second opinion. Dr. Francis has a wonderful bedside manner and friendly staff. My scoliosis has progressed significantly, & even though the other doctor suggested surgery, Dr. Francis assured me that we needed to take a conservative approach first. I started physical therapy & will go back in a year to remeasure. I am confident in Dr. Francis, & will be recommending anyone with back pain to see him.55-Sheryl in Orange,Tx | Dec 18, 2015He is so attentive and caring.

An accurate diagnosis can only be reached through a thorough examination by a specialist with experience and extensive training in spine and is the only one that is going to be able to sort through the "noise" and find the root cause of the patient's pain. Every patient receives a comprehensive exam which includes a review of the patient's medical history, thorough physical examination, diagnostic testing if needed to confirm diagnosis and a detailed explanation of their condition and treatment options. The most important thing in our whole approach is to obtain an accurate diagnosis.

The surgical team at Spine Associates was among a few in the United States equipped with this advanced technology.

St. Francis Hospital Appoints Richard D’Agostino, M.D., Chairman of Its New Department of Orthopedic Surgery 




ROSLYN, NY, September 27, 2016 – Dr. Richard D’Agostino, who has served as Chief of the Division of Orthopedics at St. Francis Hospital for the past 23 years, has been named Chairman of the new Department of Orthopedic Surgery at the hospital. St. Francis, which has recently added many outstanding orthopedic surgeons to the Department, now has one of the highest caseloads on Long Island. The Department has also been recognized for excellence by U.S. News & World Report and other national ratings groups. 
“It’s a great pleasure to announce that Dr. D’Agostino will be serving St. Francis in this new expanded capacity,” says Ronald J. Gulotta, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and V.P. of Medical Affairs at St. Francis. “He has been at the forefront of bringing new initiatives and technology to the Hospital- helping us to receive national recognition for this rapidly growing specialty.”
Dr. D’Agostino earned his medical degree from Mount Sinai School of Medicine in June of 1982. He completed his Orthopedic Surgery Residency at Mount Sinai Medical Center, serving as Chief Resident from 1986 to 1987. He then completed a Fellowship in Sports Medicine and Arthroscopic Surgery in 1988 at New England Baptist Hospital, an affiliate of Tufts University.
The highly regarded orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine expert has received numerous national and regional recognitions throughout his longstanding affiliation with St. Francis. He has been rated as one of Castle Connolly’s “America’s Top Doctors- Metro Area” every year since 2010, and has been ranked in New York Magazine’s “Best Doctors” list.
Dr. D’Agostino has made significant contributions to the St. Francis community over the years. He helped develop the Student Athlete Screening Program, which offers free cardiac screenings to high school students throughout Long Island and Queens. He serves on the Hospital’s Credentials, Operating Room, and Products Committees, as well as Chairman of the Medical Executive Committee.  He currently serves as President of the Medical Staff of St. Francis Hospital, and is Chief of the CHS Orthopedic Service Line for Nassau County.
