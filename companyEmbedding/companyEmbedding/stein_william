About this Textbook




The systematic study of number theory was initiated around 300B.C. when Euclid proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers. At the same time, he also cleverly deduced the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which asserts that every positive integer factors uniquely as a product of primes. Over 1000 years later (around 972A.D.) Arab mathematicians formulated the congruent number problem that asks for a way to decide whether or not a given positive integer n is the area of a right triangle, all three of whose sides are rational numbers. Then another 1000 years later (in 1976), Diffie and Hellman introduced the first ever public-key cryptosystem, which enabled two people to communicate secretly over a public communications channel with no predetermined secret; this invention and the ones that followed it revolutionized the world of digital communication. In the 1980s and 1990s, elliptic curves revolutionized number theory, providing striking new insights into the congruent number problem, primality testing, public-key cryptography, attacks on public-key systems, and playing a central role in Andrew Wiles' resolution of Fermat's Last Theorem.
 
Today, pure and applied number theory is an exciting mix of simultaneously broad and deep theory, which is constantly informed and motivated by algorithms and explicit computation. Active research is underway that promises to resolve the congruent number problem, deepen our understanding into the structure of prime numbers, and both challenge and improve our ability to communicate securely. The goal of this book is to bring the reader closer to this world. Each chapter contains exercises, and throughout the text there are examples of calculations done using the powerful free open source mathematical software system Sage. The reader should know how to read and write mathematical proofs and must know the basics of groups, rings, and fields. Thus, the prerequisites for this book are more than the prerequisites for most elementary number theory books, while still being aimed at undergraduates.
 
William Stein is an Associate Professor of Mathematics at the University of Washington. He is also the author of Modular Forms, A Computational Approach (AMS 2007), and the lead developer of the open source software, Sage.

Reviews




From the reviews:

"This one treats topics that have become standard in recent years … and it has exercises with selected solutions. … it gives the students a tool to do calculations that illustrate even the most abstract concepts, and, simultaneously, introduces them to an open source software that can later be applied profitably for studying research problems. … introducing the reader to a powerful software system." (Franz Lemmermeyer, Zentralblatt MATH, Vol. 1155, 2009)
"The cliché that number theory, ever the purest mathematics, now yields very practical applications barely tells the story. Teach undergraduate number theory today, and students demand to hear about public-key cryptography and related technologies. … Stein (Univ. of Washington) serves undergraduates well by … opening the way by intimating their power. … he frames the sophisticated Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture as the new canonical challenge for the future. Summing Up: Recommended. All undergraduates students, professionals, and general readers." (D. V. Feldman, Choice, Vol. 47 (2), October, 2009)
"This book is an introduction to elementary number theory with a computational flavor. … Many numerical examples are given throughout the book using the Sage mathematical software. The text is aimed at an undergraduate student with a basic knowledge of groups, rings and fields. Each chapter concludes with several exercises." (Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr., Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2009 i)

                           In a large factorial study replicated in six locations, responses of five Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco)
                              and two western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg.) stock types, tubed and untubed, were observed when planted after
                              each of four site preparation treatments with and without later release. In 10 years, more Douglas-fir seedlings survived
                              than did western hemlock seedlings, 69.6 vs. 57.7 percent, averaged much taller, 543.7 vs. 416.6 cm, and larger in diameter,
                              8.2 vs. 5.2 cm. Survival of tubed seedlings averaged 82.2 percent, untubed 50.5 percent. Seedling survival, height, and diameter
                              averaged highest in areas prepared by preburn spraying followed by broadcast burning and later release. Large Douglas-fir
                              stock (2+1 and large 2+0) outgrew medium or small stock. Stems clipped near ground line in the first 3 years, largely by mountain
                              beavers (Aplodontia rufa), comprised two-thirds of all mortality. In repeated examinations, vegetative cover was measured
                              along linear transects, stem density and height on milacre plots, and live biomass by destructive sampling. Live vegetative
                              cover averaged 52 percent before site preparation. Rapid establishment of pioneering herbaceous species after site preparation
                              soon erased temporary reductions in total cover. The woody shrub component of total cover was reduced from 23.7 to 9.8 percent
                              by broadcast burning and from 28.0 to 2.5 percent by preburn spraying and broadcast burning. By the third examination, woody
                              shrub cover was double as much in control areas as in the spray-and-burn treatments, 42.0 vs. 20.4 percent. Spraying herbicide
                              for release caused only a minor reduction in woody shrub cover. By the 10th year, woody shrub cover averaged 47.9 percent
                              in the control but only 32.1 percent in the spray-and-burn treatment. More tree cover after spray-and-burn than for other
                              site preparation treatments appears attributable to lower competition of woody shrubs throughout the decade. Red alder (Alnus
                              rubra Bong.) and salmonberry (Rubus spectabilis Pursh) were the most abundant competitors

Shop with complete confidence at AFA Stores. 
So, youve purchased and received your piece of furniture from AFA Stores, but you dont want to keep it. WHAT?!? Like everyone else, our customers have the rights to change their minds. We dont want you keeping something that you dont want, and have included a set of guidelines for you below to help you get started with your return.






What if I receive my shipment and I dont like it? 
What? You dont like it? Well stop our questioning and hope that you simply had a bit of buyers remorsewhich we totally understand. Just give us a call at 800-617-0106 or email us at returns@afastores.com. Once a return request is authorized by customer service, we will email you a return authorization number. Please note that returns without an authorization number will be refused. Sorry! Its just policy! You must ship your item back within 30 days to qualify for a refund. We do charge a 10% restocking fee and require that you pay your own return shipping.







What if I get my furniture and its damaged? 
We offer you a million apologies, but hey, sometimes things just happen for no good reason. Whether it was an error on our part or the consequence of your delivery mans rally car racing dreams, we do accept items that are defective or damaged. Please do one of the following:


A. Refuse the item and notate on the paperwork that your order was damaged and hand the paperwork back to the driver.

B. Accept the item, and take close-up shots of the defective furniture and email them back to us at support@afastores.com. (Just please dont confuse them with the other bedroom furniture shots you have on your computer.) Well take a look and determine if we need to send a replacement piece or issue a full refund. Please note that all shipping-related damages must be claimed within 48 hours of receiving your shipment.  In other words, dont be a couch potato (even if it is a comfy couch).







Fine print that you really shouldnt ignore
Returned products must come back in original condition and packaging. In the circumstance that we receive a return that shows obvious signs of wear and use (shame on you!), additional fees may be applied. We also cannot accept returns on modified or assembled merchandise.

The following brands are made to order and CANNOT be returned after purchase: 


Copeland Furniture
Kalon Studios
Emeco
Broyhill Custom Upholstery



Exceptions for these brands:
