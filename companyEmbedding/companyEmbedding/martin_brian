              brian w. martin, independent broker and sales agent
 i have over 25 years of experience in   the food distribution industry. i started as a sales representative for a leading distributor of bakery products in 1990. my experience in managing  multi-million dollar territories and selling thousands of line items  taught me the fundamentals of how the foodservice and baking industries work. understanding the supply chain from manufacturing to distribution, selling to the end user and having solid business relations are key to success. with the knowledge i have gained about the workings of the industry i believe the most important part of the business is building lasting relationships with clients by providing superior customer service.

                i created martin brokerage in 2009 because i saw a great  opportunity to  bring my expertise   to the industry. i  offer a very personalized service and put my customers needs first. i have built  successful relationships over the years and have earned a reputation in the industry of having honesty and integrity.

martin brokerage provides core ingredients including; flour, sugar and shortening as well as value added products including yeast, donut mix, cake mix, dough conditioner, packaging and fillings. keeping the product line focused  on these core ingredients  allows me to provide the service level my customers deserve. if there are products you are in need of that are not listed here, we have a vast array of manufacturer's  from which to source products.
    we can offer you products in truckload, pallet or per item quantities with a minimum order requirement.
      i work diligently to provide my clients with quality ingredients at competitive prices. contact martin brokerage for your foodservice and bakery needs.
