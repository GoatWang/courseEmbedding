Portrait of Jacques Sarazin by engraver Charles-Nicolas Cochin, c. 1731.


Jacques Sarazin[1] or Sarrazin (1588/90 – 3 December 1660) was a French sculptor, who is less known for his paintings.[2] His preparatory drawings in chalk have become more prominent in recent decades.[3]

Life[edit]
Sarrazin was born in Noyon, France, and went to Paris with his brother, where he trained in the atelier of Nicolas Guillain. He went to Rome in 1610 and worked there under a Frenchman named Anguille. Starting thus, Sarrazin speedily obtained employment from Cardinal Aldobrandini at the Villa Aldobrandini, Frascati, where he won the friendship of Domenichino, with whom he afterwards worked on the high altar of Sant'Andrea della Valle. Sarazin also provided stucco bas-reliefs for San Lorenzo in Miranda, Rome.
In 1628 he was called to Paris, where he married a niece of Simon Vouet, whom he had met in Rome[4] and with whom he collaborated closely in the 1630s, in hôtels particuliers and châteaux in the Ile-de-France, notably Maisons-Lafitte. Sarazin assembled a large atelier to provide interior and exterior sculptures for the Château de Maisons, for Claude de Bullion at the Château de Wideville and in other private commissions. His usual assistants were Gilles Guérin, Philippe de Buyster and Gérard van Opstal.
His success attracted the notice of Louis XIII's minister François Sublet de Noyers, a grand patron who entrusted to him his best-known work, the decoration of the great portal and the dome of the western facade of the interior court of the Louvre. Sarazin's famous Caryatides of the attic show the profound study of Michelangelo. He now executed many commissions from the Queen, and was an active promoter of the foundation of the Académie. The mausoleum for the heart of the prince de Condé in the Jesuit church of the Rue Saint Antoine was his last considerable work[5] He died on 3 December 1660 while it was in progress, and the crucifix of the altar was completed by his pupil Pierre Le Gros the Elder.

Sarrazin Pierre Jacques
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in New York:













Does Sarrazin Pierre Jacques carry a valid contracting license?



Any person or business involved in a home improvement project more than $200 must get a license from the Department of Consumer Affairs to operate legally in New York.
Sarrazin Pierre Jacques currently holds license 030890 (Architecture), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in New York?



New York City maintains high standards for licensing. To obtain a home improvement license, applicants must pass a written exam.











Your liability risk when hiring Sarrazin Pierre Jacques



Licensed contractors in NYC are required to carry workers' compensation insurance.











Financial recourse when hiring Sarrazin Pierre Jacques



Licensed contractors contribute $200 to DCA's Trust Fund at the time of application and each time they renew or post a bond. DCA's Trust Fund reimburses homeowners who hired a licensed contractor who subsequently damaged their home and went out of business or left town.











What else should I know before hiring Sarrazin Pierre Jacques



NYC home improvement contractors are required to submit a copy of their fingerprints to the DCA and pass a criminal background check.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The NYC Department of Consumer Affairs recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
