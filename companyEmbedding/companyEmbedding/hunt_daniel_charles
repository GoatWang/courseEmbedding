Overview
In many ways it was the
Hunt Line which led my mother Margaret Allen Cook, her brother
Arthur Allen jr, and me to begin the research into the family
history. She knew her Great Grandmother, Elnora Hunt Allen, and
remembered the pride taken in the Hunt Line. Searching that line
took us on an adventure to Orleans County and into the wonderful
world of genealogy. We were the first in our family's memory to
visit the Daniel's Cemetery where Daniel Fay Hunt and much of
the Hunt family now lie.
For several years our knowledge
stopped with the pioneer that brought the Hunt family to Western
New York. Then the internet brought us the work of Mitchell J.
Hunt and T.B. Wyman which we discovered through a wonderful website
The Hunt Archives.
The Line below traces our
family from Robert Hunt of England, through William (of Concord)
Hunt down to the generations which brought the Hunt and Allen
families together. For additional information on the early generations,
visit the work of Hunt and Wyman through the Hunt Archives.
New light has been shed
on the 19th century Hunt Family by a book on the Lewis Family
compiled by Mrs. Barbara Thesing. The book is based on a treasure
trove of Lewis family letters, documents, and photographs which
Barbara has organized and had added additional research and material.
There are many which relate to the Hunt Family, which Barbara
has given us permission to share on the site.
