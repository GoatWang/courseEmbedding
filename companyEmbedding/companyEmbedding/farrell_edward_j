Dr. Hards has special training in orthodontics, implantology, and advanced restorative techniques and is certified in Invisalign techniques (tooth straightening without braces).Invisalign OrthodonticsInvisalignÂ® treatment consists of a series of medical-grade polymer (plastic) aligners that are changed every few weeks. The InvisalignÂ® system isImplantsDental ImplantsContinuing his dedication for excellence in dentistry, Dr. Farrell has received an Associate Fellow from the American Academy of Implant Dentistry. Dr. Farrell founded Village Dental in 1997.RestorativeBridgesA bridge is a fixed dental restoration that serves to replace one or more missing teeth. Several different types of bridges have been used throughout the dental industry over the years, but some have remained more popular than others. The most traditional construction of a dental bridge involves a false tooth attached between the two crowns. Another type of bridge that is still in use is a resin-bonded bridge that bonds metal or porcelain wings attached to a fake tooth to existing teeth on either side of the missing teeth.Restorative DentistryRegular dental hygiene is very important, but when something more serious affects our teeth, we need a little extra help getting them in good condition again. Diseases, decay, and damage to our mouths and teeth can create complications that brushing and flossing alone cannot fix, and for those issues, restorative dentistry is the solution.Dental BondingFillingsFillings are able to conceal visual evidence of cavities. Â The introduction and improvement of bonded tooth colored resin fillings has resulted in a product strong and stylish enough for teeth in the front areas of the mouth. While people have benefited from the traditional amalgam fillings, many have always felt self-conscious about the blackish silver metal that leaves a dark featureÂ in the back of their mouths and which is often visible while talking or laughing. Therefore, tooth colored resign fillings afford a preferableÂ alternative to many individuals today, and Village Dental offers this durable and indiscernible type of tooth restoration.VeneersRestore the inherent value of smile s back to our patients. One of the ways in which we restore smiles is through the application of porcelain veneers.CrownsÂ€œI decided to give myself a new smile for my 70th birthday. I checked out 5 different places to get my whole mouth done just so I would know I was making the best decision. In the end, I decided on Village Dental. I got 16 crowns done by Dr. Farrell and was very, very happy. Everybody says I look so nice.EndodonticsRoot Canal TreatmentIn order to save the tooth and prevent further infection and pain, endodontic therapy, or root canal therapy, may be applied. Due to the amount of pain that disease or infection can cause in a tooth, patients may occasionally desire for the tooth to be removed, butProsthodonticsDenturesThe Village Dental Care approach for deliveringÂ top-quality services toÂ clients in need of new dentures or denture repairs is designed to make the client ourÂ priority. We offer dental prosthetics services that can provide functional replacements for teeth and soft tissues that are missing from dental decay, dental trauma, destruction of connective tissue or undeveloped teeth to get your smile back to the way you want it.GeneralTeeth WhiteningTeeth whitening can help patients restore their smile to the glow it used to have, or it can give you a bright smile for the first time in your life.Cosmetic DentistryCosmetic dentistry services Â to do so.
