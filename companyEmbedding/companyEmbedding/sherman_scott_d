Description by OLDIES.com:

Police Rookie (1940; 66 minutes): Racketeers have overrun the city by killing anyone who stands in their way. A veteran police inspector who threatens their domination is murdered. His son, Steve Hannigan, vows revenge and becomes a cop. As he penetrates the layers of corruption surrounding the criminal syndicate, he discovers that their organization is far more powerful than he ever imagined.The first official release from PRC, Police Rookie (aka, I Take This Oath) was directed by Sam Newfield, who would go on to direct more features for the company than anyone else. Gordon Jones, the film's muscular, driven star, is better known for his role as the Green Hornet in the Universal serial (1940) and "Mike the Cop" in "The Abbott and Costello Show" (1952).Marked Men (1940; 71 minutes): Fingered for a crime he didn't commit and facing 10 years in the state penitentiary, Bill Carver escapes imprisonment and finds shelter in a small Arizona town. When the gang that framed him shows up, he sees his chance for revenge. Offering to guide the crooks out of the desert, Carver gambles his own life in a winner-takes-all game of survival. With their water supply dwindling, Bill leads the men on a death march, hoping to draw a confession out of the criminals and clear his name.

Product Description:

When a group of racketeers terrorize a city with their murderous ways, they make a grave error by killing a veteran police inspector in the vintage cop thriller POLICE ROOKIE. The rookie of the title is the deceased inspector's son, who joins the police force so he can legally mete out his own brand of revenge. But he discovers that the racketeers have some connections in high places, making his job more difficult than he expected. Also included here, the superlative 1940s crime caper MARKED MEN is about a man on the run from the police as he tries to evade imprisonment for a crime he didn't commit. But he gets a fortuitous stab at revenge when he runs into the gang who framed him and concocts an ingenious method for luring a confession out of them.

LEGAL TERMS

(more...)A legally binding agreement involving two or more people or businesses (called parties) that sets forth what the parties will or will not do. Most contracts that can be carried out within one year can be either oral or written. Major exceptions include contracts involving the ownership of real estate and commercial contracts for goods worth $500 or more, which must be in writing to be enforceable. (See statute of frauds.) A contract is formed when competent parties -- usually adults of sound mind or business entities -- mutually agree to provide each other some benefit (called consideration), such as a promise to pay money in exchange for a promise to deliver specified goods or services or the actual delivery of those goods and services. A contract normally requires one party to make a reasonably detailed offer to do something -- including, typically, the price, time for performance and other essential terms and conditions -- and the other to accept without significant change. For example, if I offer to sell you ten roses for $5 to be delivered next Thursday and you say 'It's a deal,' we've made a valid contract. On the other hand, if one party fails to offer something of benefit to the other, there is no contract. For example, if Maria promises to fix Josh's car, there is no contract unless Josh promises something in return for Maria's services.

(more...)The taking of physical evidence or property by law enforcement officials. This runs the gamut from taking blood for a drug test to impounding a car used in a robbery. The police must generally obtain a search warrant, or court order, before they can seize personal property.

(more...)A fee charged by real estate brokers and apartment-finding services in exchange for locating a rental property. These fees are permitted by law. Some landlords, however, charge finder's fees merely for renting a place. This type of charge is not legitimate and, in some areas, is specifically declared illegal.

(more...)(1) A written agreement purchased from a bonding company that guarantees a person will properly carry out a specific act, such as managing funds, showing up in court, providing good title to a piece of real estate or completing a construction project. If the person who purchased the bond fails at his or her task, the bonding company will pay the aggrieved party an amount up to the value of the bond. (2) An interest-bearing document issued by a government or company as evidence of a debt. A bond provides pre-determined payments at a set date to the bond holder. Bonds may be 'registered' bonds, which provide payment to the bond holder whose name is recorded with the issuer and appears on the bond certificate, or 'bearer' bonds, which provide payments to whomever holds the bond in-hand.

NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENTAn agreement, generally included in an employment contract or a contract for the sale of a business, where one party agrees not to compete with the other party ... (more...)An agreement, generally included in an employment contract or a contract for the sale of a business, where one party agrees not to compete with the other party for a specific period of time and within a particular area. Salespeople, for example, often sign noncompetition agreements that prevent them from using the contacts gained by one employer to benefit another employer. Or a salesperson may sign what is known as a 'noncompete,' agreeing not to sell within a particular area, or even work in the same type of business. In some states, such as California, courts view noncompetition agreements with disfavor and will not enforce them unless the restrictions are very narrow. In other states, courts routinely uphold them.

BEQUESTThe legal term for personal property (anything but real estate) left in a will.

QUASI-COMMUNITY PROPERTYA form of property owned by a married couple. If a couple moves to a community property state from a non-community property state, property they acquired togeth... (more...)A form of property owned by a married couple. If a couple moves to a community property state from a non-community property state, property they acquired together in the non-community property state may be considered quasi-community property. Quasi-community property is treated just like community property when one spouse dies or if the couple divorces.

(more...)For income and capital gains tax purposes, the value that is used to determine profit or loss when property is sold. Often the basis is what you paid for the property, 'adjusted' to reflect improvements made or damage incurred while you own the property. See stepped-up basis, carryover basis.

APPRAISERA person who is hired to determine the current value of real estate or other property.

Find Pain Management Doctors in Florida (FL) by City

    A pain management specialist is a physician with advanced knowledge and training in diagnosing and treating pain. These doctors do not come from one particular discipline, but rather use their respective backgrounds to contribute a varied approach to the field of pain management.


    These specialists use their different skills and training in pain management to treat pain stemming from different causes - whether it's neuropathic pain or headache, or the result of injury, a surgical procedure, cancer or another illness.


    Pain management specialists are primarily trained as anesthesiologists, physiatrists, interventional radiologists, neurologists, osteopaths, or primary care physicians.

[EBOOK] If You're in a Dogfight, Become a Cat!: Strategies for Long-Term Growth (Columbia Business School Publishing) W.O.R.D
Businesses often find themselves trapped in a competitive dogfight, scratching and clawing for market share with products consumers view as largely undifferentiated. Conventional wisdom suggests that dogfights are to be expected as marketplaces mature, giving rise to the notion that there are "bad" industries where it is unlikely that any company can succeed. But there are notable exceptions in which enlightened executives have changed the rules to grasp the holy grail of business: long-term profitable growth. Rather than joining the dogfights raging within their industry, companies such as Apple, FedEx, and Starbucks have chosen to become metaphorical cats, continuously renewing their distinctive strategies to compete on their own terms.In If You're in a Dogfight, Become a Cat, Leonard Sherman draws on four decades of experience in management consulting, venture capital, and teaching business strategy at Columbia Business School to share practical advice on two of the most vexing issues facing business executives: why is it so hard to achieve long-term profitable growth, and what can companies do to break away from the pack?Sherman takes the reader on a provocative journey through the building blocks of business strategy by challenging conventional wisdom on a number of questions that will redefine management best practices:• What should be the overarching purpose of your business?• Do you really know what your strategy is?• Is there such a thing as a bad industry?• Where do great ideas come from and how do I find them?• What makes products meaningfully different?• What makes and breaks great brands?• How and when should I disrupt my own company?• What are the imperatives to achieving long-term profitable growth?Filled with dozens of illustrative examples of inspiring successes and dispiriting falls from grace, this book provides deep insights on how to become the cat in a dogfight, whether you are a CEO, mid-level manager, aspiring business school student, or curious observer interested in achieving sustained profitable growth.

Review

A wonderfully comprehensive view of competition and competitive strategy and illustrating it well with contemporary examples and citing of the scholarly literature and linking that to action oriented techniques. (John Czepiel, New York University Stern School of Business)With an incisive writing style rarely seen in studies of business strategy, Sherman neatly reevaluates some corporate reputations that have failed the test of time and elevates more lasting examples from his own research. The result is that all-too-rare combination for books on management: advice that is as valuable as it is readable. (Alex Taylor, former senior editor at large, Fortune)Sherman takes a machete to standard thinking in strategy, offering up a common sense but deeply insightfulâ€•and sometimes surprisingâ€•recipe for what it takes to win in business. (Sydney Finkelstein, professor, Dartmouth College and author, Superbosses: How Exceptional Leaders Master the Flow of Talent)In this important book, Leonard Sherman takes on dangerous shibboleths of business strategy. Foremost among them is the purported priority of maximising shareholder value. Too often, this goal has led to manipulating short-term earnings and stock prices, in the interests of maximising gains to management from stock-related pay. Maximising rewards to shareholders is the outcome of a good business strategy; it is not itself a business strategy at all. (Martin Wolf, chief economics commentator, Financial Times)A thorough study of strategy and how it needs to be done today. The author's ability to put new strategy concepts in the context of fifty plus years of management science is a real gift. Detailed, rigorous, but never boring, this book gives every executive everything they need to know to run a business in today's fast changing world. A rare book that combines the right elements of marketing strategy with business strategy to come up with real winning business solutions. (Paul F. Nunes, Global Managing Director of Thought Leadership, Accenture Research)If You're in A Dogfight, Become A Cat! not only offers a devastating critique of the biggest and worst idea in businessâ€•maximizing shareholder valueâ€•it also offers a coherent and practical guide to the strategy of innovation that should replace it. (Stephen Denning, author of The Leader's Guide to Radical Management)Insightful, thought-provoking, and practical. Len Sherman takes us on an enjoyable journey through five decades of some of the most influential written works on business management and strategy and shows how history has judged these various concepts. He translates these observations into a framework that prompts you to drive clarity in how you can fulfill your company's core mission behind the execution of three strategic imperatives, and ultimately find sustained long-term profitable growth. The book is filled with case studies that will inspire you to think critically about how these concepts apply to your own business. Sherman offers insights that would be of value to all levels of business leaders who have an interest in sharpening their strategies. (William Deutsch, founder and chairman, Deutsch Family Wines & Spirits)Leonard Sherman's book If You're in a Dogfight, Become a Cat!, based on his decades of business management experience, provides a much-needed approach to sustaining an innovative enterprise. It should be read by everyone concerned about business from MBA candidates to their professors to incumbent executives. This book makes the company rather than the industry the focus of analysis, confronts the erroneous and damaging ideology that companies should be run to 'maximize shareholder value,' and offers executives a new set of principles for strategizing about how an enterprise can be innovative. The many real-life examples that Sherman provides should stimulate plenty of informed discussion about what an innovative enterprise is really about. (William Lazonick, professor, University of Massachusetts Lowell and president, Academic-Industry Research Network)This book provides countless concrete examples of how businesses can create real value and continuously renew competitive advantage. It's a must-read, as relevant to senior executives as to MBA students aspiring to become next generation business leaders. (Marty St. George, executive vice president for Commercial and Planning, JetBlue)This book integrates key ideas from the most influential strategy thinking of the last forty years with Len Sherman's extensive practical business experience to present a convincing and practical case for the three strategic imperatives that drive sustained profitable growth. Be a cat and pounce on this book! (Niraj Dawar, Ivey Business School)

Stimulating and Refreshing

By DK
Well-written and topical, the book puts popular business theories to the test against real world examples of successes and failures in demonstrating that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to creating and growing a lasting company.  Highly recommended for young entrepreneurs and established CEOs alike.

A Book for All Consumers

By Judy Feigin
This book is not just for those who have or want an MBA. I am neither business savvy nor particularly interested in the field. And yet . . . I found this book fascinating. It explains, in language a layman can understand, why some businesses fail and others succeed. The explanations are accompanied by compelling anecdotes about companies we all know. And the graphs -- beautifully done in color -- are fully and simply explained by the author in the same easy-to-follow style as the rest of the book. I came away feeling I had learned a tremendous amount without any sense of having done "homework." That is quite a feat.  As an unexpected aside, the book is printed on quality paper. For those who love holding a hard copy, there is a noticeable difference from most books. It actually feels luxurious to read.

By Autamme_dot_com
A curious title sets off this somewhat different, informative and thought-provoking book about how to find a position for long-term company growth.This book is the distillation of the author’s experience as a business consultant and educator, made into a three-part strategy that focusses on allowing a company to survive in industries embroiled in “dogfights”—whereby there is intense competition among established companies for a small piece of the market. The solution is to be a cat and do things a bit differently and be more innovative than the group of dumb dogs who spend more time fighting each other than looking forward.It was an enjoyable read, mixing theory, opinion and practical strategies together to great effect. The author allowed his humour and character to shine through this book and it felt as if helped make a difference; an authentic, personable and informative persona set tone and authority.Punches are not pulled and criticism is freely given about “holy cows”, such as models from BCG and Porter, and how they can be blindly and inappropriately applied in many situations. It felt as if it could also be a great primer or summary for those who need a bit of a management strategy reboot and for students and newcomers to the sector it may be an invaluable, different read. Some of the case studies alone could be worth the modest price of this book!It is a hefty book, something you won’t read in one sitting; yet this is no bad thing and the book does deserve your undivided attention. Your business and your career may thank you for it too. There are extensive references for those who want to dig even deeper into source material and gain further knowledge.This is definitely something you should consider checking out in a bookstore and a purchase could be strongly recommended!
