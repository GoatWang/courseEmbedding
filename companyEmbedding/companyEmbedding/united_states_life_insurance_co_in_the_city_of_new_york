Index annuities are not a direct investment in the stock market. They are long-term insurance products with guarantees backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. They provide the potential for interest to be credited based in part on the performance of the specified index, without the risk of loss of premium due to market downturns or fluctuations. Clients cannot invest in an index directly.
Annuities are designed for long-term retirement purposes.  Early withdrawals may be subject to withdrawal charges. Partial withdrawals reduce the contract value and may also reduce certain benefits under the contract, such as the death benefit and the amount available upon full surrender. Withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax and, if taken prior to age 59½, an additional 10% federal tax may apply. An investment in a variable annuity involves investment risk, including the possible loss of principal. The contract, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the total amount invested.  
Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains the investment objectives, risks, fees, charges, expenses and other information regarding the contract and underlying funds, which should be considered carefully before investing. A prospectus may be obtained from your financial advisor or by calling 1-800-445-7862. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.












Annuities are issued by American General Life Insurance Company (AGL), or, in New York, by The United States Life Insurance Company in the City of New York (US Life), except the Polaris Platinum Elite and Polaris Choice Elite Variable Annuities and the Power Index Elite index annuity, which are issued by The Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company (VALIC) in all states. Variable annuities are distributed by AIG Capital Services, Inc. (ACS), Member FINRA, 21650 Oxnard St., Suite 750, Woodland Hills, CA 91367-4997, 1-800-445-7862.
AGL, US Life, VALIC and ACS are members of American International Group, Inc. All contract and optional benefit guarantees are backed by the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and are not the obligation or responsibility of AIG.
All products and features may not be available in all states. The purchase of an annuity is not required for, and is not a term of, the provision of any banking service or activity.

Confirmed Complaints: the number of confirmed complaints closed 
	against the company for the line of insurance and year indicated. 
	A complaint is confirmed if the department receives information indicating that a company 
  committed any violation of an applicable state insurance law or regulation, a federal requirement
  the department has authority to enforce or the term or condition of an insurance policy or
  certificate.  A complaint is also confirmed if the complaint and company's response, 
  considered together, suggest that the company was in error or that the complainant had a valid
  reason for the complaint.

Complaint Ratios: the ratio, expressed as a percentage, 
	is the number of closed confirmed complaints divided by 
	the number of policies the company had in force for 
	the line of insurance and year indicated. 

Complaint Index: indicates how a company's ratio of 
	the number of complaints to the number of policyholders 
	compares to the average for all insurers. 
	The index is calculated by dividing the company's percentage of 
	complaints for a specific line of insurance by the company's 
	percentage of the policies in force for the same line of insurance. 
	The average index is 1.00. A number less than 1 indicates 
	fewer complaints than average; a number greater than 1 indicates 
	more complaints than average. For the most recent completed year, 
	a given insurer's index may change over time, as policy count data is 
	received by TDI. This will affect each insurer's percentage of the total. 

Complaints against an insurance company are not part of 
	the complaint tally above if the insurance company served 
	only as a Third Party Administrator (TPA), a company hired 
	simply to administer the paperwork of a health plan. 
	Instead, they are included in the complaint record of the 
	insurance company or HMO that hired the TPA. 
	If a bonafide self-insured benefit plan hired the TPA, 
	no complaint numbers are recorded as a part of the company/TPA's profile. 
	Neither are profiles available for self-insured plans, 
	as such plans are regulated under federal law.
