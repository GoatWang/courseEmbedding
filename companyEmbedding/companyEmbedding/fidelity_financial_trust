			Whether selecting Fidelity Personal Trust Company, FSB, (FPTC)1 as your trustee or investment manager for assets held in a trust, you put to work a team of professionals who are committed to adding value to your trust.
		








 Help preserve wealth for future generations 
Consider using FPTC if you would like help transferring $200,000 or more to your family or other beneficiary through a trust; or, if you would like to potentially avoid probate—the legal process of distributing wealth after death—to maintain privacy and minimize estate-related costs.
If you decide to name FPTC as your trustee or co-trustee, we offer objectivity, continuity, and experience in trust administration. As part of our fiduciary services, we will:

Administer the trust according to its terms.
Communicate regularly with beneficiaries.
Prepare required records, statements, and tax returns.

Whether you name us as trustee or prefer to name another in this capacity, you’ll also receive the same tax-sensitive investment management2 as with Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios.
A dedicated trust officer will be assigned to all accounts for which FPTC serves as trustee or co-trustee. A dedicated portfolio specialist will be assigned to all other Fidelity® Personalized Portfolio accounts.










Next steps

To open an account, start by telling us your financial needs and goals. We’ll send you a complimentary investment proposal.

FAQs: Fidelity® Personalized Portfolios


How can this strategy help me meet my goals?  

This professionally managed strategy is tailored to your personal financial situation, enabling you to request exclusion of particular stocks or industries, while seeking to reduce the impact of taxes on your investment returns.



Who manages my money?  

Strategic Advisers, Inc., a Fidelity company, will actively manage your personalized portfolio using their disciplined, research-driven approach, and will apply tax-sensitive investment strategies1, where appropriate, that seek to enhance after-tax investment returns.



What kind of investments can I expect in my account?  

This strategy includes a broad range of investment options including stocks, bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs) when appropriate.



How are the investments chosen for my account?  

Because we are creating a portfolio that is personalized to your needs and specific goals, our investment team will research and select the mix of investments that is appropriate for your goals.



Can I choose my own investments?  

Our investment professionals will select your investments and build a portfolio tailored to you. We will use in-depth investment research, manage your risk through diversification, and suggest a mix of investments personalized for your goals. We do offer transparency into your holdings and the activity conducted on your behalf.



Can I change my investment strategy?  

You can contact us at any time to discuss changing your investment strategy should your financial situation or goals change. You can feel confident knowing we'll work with you to help ensure you're on track to meet your needs.



Can I add funds to my account?  

Yes, you can add funds at any time.



Can I withdraw funds from my account?  

Yes, there are several ways to access your funds, including scheduled withdrawals.



How much do I need to open an account?  

The minimum funding amount is $200,000. Accounts can be funded with a check, bank wire, an exchange purchase from an existing Fidelity account, or a transfer of eligible assets from an account at another institution.



How much does it cost?  

Gross advisory fees range from 0.55% to 1.50% based on the amount of assets you invest.3



What type of tax strategies do you use?  

While many investment management firms only offer tax-loss harvesting at year's end, Strategic Advisers uses this and a number of other strategies throughout the year designed to help reduce your tax liability and help reach your goals as quickly as possible.1



Will there be tax consequences when I open my account?  

Partnering with you to help manage your money in a tax-efficient way starts with getting your account set up with the right mix of investments. This process may require selling some investments that generate taxable gains. However, the result is an account that we believe will be better positioned to provide opportunities for growth while managing potential investment risks.



Can I choose a different strategy than what is suggested?  

You can opt to select a different strategy than what is suggested during our planning discussions. We will manage your account according to your selected investment strategy.
