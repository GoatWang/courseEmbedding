Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

PenFed Credit Union


                                            Applied for a credit card and was denied based on what they said was a loss from a personal loan in 1978. I have never had an account with PenFed, so I questioned the accuracy of this denial. Considering, as a business owner, my scores are well north of 700, I thought this...show more

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            IF I COULD GIVE IT A ZERO I WOULD! Amazon/Synchrony Bank will cut your limit out of no where, even when making monthly payments. I've spent almost a year trying to pay off a card THEY maxed out and now they have sent to collections AS IM PAYING IT! DO NOT APPLY FOR THIS CARD!

Andrew W. McWilliams
Good morning. I’m Andrew McWilliams, Chief Accounting Officer of AAC Holdings and I would like to welcome you to our Third Quarter 2016 Conference Call. To the extent any non-GAAP financial measure is discussed in today’s call, you will find a reconciliation of that measure to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to GAAP on our website by following the Investor Relations link to press releases and viewing this morning’s news release.
This conference call may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements, among others, regarding AAC’s expected quarterly and annual performance for 2016 and beyond. For this purpose, any statements made during this call that are not statements of historical facts may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes, anticipates, plans, expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
You are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors, among others set forth in AAC’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in the company’s third quarter 2016 earnings release. And consequently, actual operations and results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. The company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
At this time, I’ll now turn the conference over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Cartwright for opening remarks.
Michael T. Cartwright
Good morning. In addition to Andrew, I’m here today with our Chief Financial Officer, Kirk Manz and other members of our Executive Management team. Kirk and I each have some remarks about the third quarter. After that, we will open the line for your questions.
I’d like to begin with some comments about the California matter. On July 29, 2015 a California Corp unsealed a criminal indictment against several of our subsidiaries. This indictment was unprecedented for any healthcare company. In spite of the unfortunate and expensive distraction we managed to continually grow bed capacity and admission since the indictment. 
In this past quarter one of our former employees went to trial. That trial ended up in hung jury with 10 of the 12 juries voting to acquit. This favorable outcome helped trump productive settlement discussions with the Attorney General of the State of California. On October 21, we reached a resolution that resulted in all charges being dismissed against the corporate entities. We are pleased to put this matter behind us and to clear the AAC Holding subsidiaries. We can now fully focus our commitment and passion on serving clients and their families who are overwhelmed by addiction in California and throughout the United States. 
Moving on to our longitudinal outcome study and our commitment to client quality we are now tracking approximately 4700 clients up from 3300 clients from Q2. As previously stated we expect to begin sharing initial results for six month follow ups on our fourth quarter investor call. 
Now to Q3 performance, residential client admissions totaled 3258 in the third quarter, a 65% increase year-over-year and up 13% over the second quarter. Average daily residential census was 853 in the third quarter up 52% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Total residential bed capacity at the end of the third quarter was 1140 up 72% year-over-year and flat to second quarter. Effective bed capacity which is based upon our staffing levels was 1057 at the end of the third quarter. 

Effective bed utilization was 82% for the third quarter. Effective utilization at our legacy treatment centers which includes all facilities opened or acquired before 2016 was 84%. Keep in mind that we have expanded our effective bed capacity by 60% in just the past year and that we would expect utilization drop in the near-term. In an effort to streamline operations on the East Coast of Florida we have transferred single items operations into our recovery first operation. This consolidation converts 65 out of network beds into In-network beds. We expect this to be financially neutral event. In-network beds now represent 36% of our total residential bed capacity. 
Average daily residential revenue was 768 for the third quarter down 21% year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. In-network revenue accounted for 22% of our client related revenue during the quarter up 10% from a year ago. We had 15,299 outpatient visits for the third quarter up 253% year-over-year and up 17% sequentially. Outpatient revenue was 12% of total client related revenue up from 7% a year ago. 
We consider our M&A pipeline to be robust with the expansion of our credit facility in July and the California litigation now settled we would expect to significantly increase growth through acquisitions in 2017. In reviewing our De Novo pipeline I would like to highlight that we are ahead of schedule with our various construction projects. Our sobre living bed expansions in both Resolution Las Vegas and Resolution Arlington have progressed substantially. These renovations are occurring at a phased approach to enable us to bring on beds faster. 
We now have 86 sober beds online at Resolution Las Vegas and 30 sober living beds online at Resolutions Arlington. We currently anticipate those bed counts to expand at 100 beds at each location by the end of Q2 2017. At Oxford we are pleased to report that we have recently completed and brought online 24 residential beds. An additional 20 detox bed and 48 sober living beds should be completed by end of Q1 2017. 
Turning our attention to Ringwood, we believe that we are making great progress in the construction of 150 beds and we are moving up on anticipated completion date to the first quarter of 2018. Let me be crystal clear, the third quarter did not meet our expectations. We did not ramp our outpatient visits in Laguna as much as we had hoped. Our expenses came in higher than I would have liked and our lab revenue dropped more than expected. 
While I’ll admit the California took up a lot of management time and that was a strong factor, we put that matter behind us and we are focused on growing our business. Currently we have over 300 residential and sober living beds in the pipeline which will be funded by our credit lines. This represents approximately a 25% increase in our capacity within the next 18 months. Between our current M&A and de novo pipelines and due to the settlement of the California matter we are very excited about our growth prospects for 2017 and beyond. 
With that said let me turn the call over to Kirk Manz to talk more about our financial highlights. 
Kirk R. Manz
Thanks, Michael. Our revenue for the third quarter of 2016 was $70.5 million, compared with 57.4 million in the prior year period a 23% increase year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. While facility and outpatient revenue increased by 5.4 million in the third quarter, ancillary client related revenue which includes drug testing, lab revenue, and professional services decreased 4.8 million in the quarter to 23% of total client related revenue compared to 30% of total client related revenue for the second quarter. 
Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was 12.1 million, a 3% increase year-over-year and down 4% sequentially. Adjusted EPS was $0.19 for the third quarter compared with $0.27 a year ago and $0.18 in the second quarter. Salaries, wages, and benefits were 36.5 million which were relatively flat versus second quarter and in line with the guidance we previously provided on these expenses for the second half of 2016. Client related services in the third quarter increased sequentially by 1.5 million due to our de novo and expansion activities and a full quarter impact of client related activities associated with Solutions Treatment Centers that was acquired in May 2016. 

Net loss available to common stockholders was 2.5 million for the quarter. On a per diluted share basis net loss available to common stockholders was a negative $0.11 compared with net income available to common shareholders of $0.11 a year ago and $0.04 in the second quarter. For the third quarter litigation in California legal expenses totaled 3.8 million and had a negative impact of $0.14 on our EPS. In total we have spent 10.4 million on the California matter which had a cumulative impact of a negative $0.43 on EPS. 
AAC’s tax rate for Q3 was 15.9% compared with 27% in the prior year. We now anticipate an annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18% for the year. Cash used by operating activities was 5 million for the third quarter compared with cash used by operating activities of 800,000 a year ago and 2 million provided by operating activities in the second quarter. Cash outlays for the California matter was 3 million in the third quarter. 
Now that the California matter is settled we anticipate being able to allocate those cash flows to new growth in 2017. DSOs were a 105 days for the second quarter compared with 93 days a year ago and 95 days in the second quarter. DSOs at legacy facilities were 81 days down from 84 days in the second quarter. The increase in DSOs was related to acquired AR de novo projects and slower lab collections. Our provision for doubtful accounts was 4.8 million or 6.8% of revenue down from 5.4 million or a 9.4% from the prior year period. We had 13.3 million of cash at quarter end with outstanding debt inclusive of our senior credit facility in Deerfield convertible notes of 189.4 million.
Our total leverage ratio at quarter end was 3.9 times trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA and senior leverage was 2.5 times. Based on these results and activity we are modifying our full year guidance and assumptions for 2016. Due to lower than originally forecasted lab contribution and slower ramping of our outpatient business in Laguna, we are revising our full year 2016 revenue guidance to 275 million to 280 million, our adjusted EBITDA guidance to 47 million to 49 million, and our adjusted EPS guidance to $0.69 to $0.77. This outlook does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, transaction related costs, litigation settlement, expenses related to legal defense and De Novo startup expenses.
I will now turn the call over to the operator for questions. 
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions]. Today’s first question comes from Ryan Daniels of William Blair. Please go ahead.
Ryan Daniels
Hey, good morning thanks for taking the questions. Kirk maybe a follow up for you I want to make sure I got some of these numbers correct, but did you indicate that outpatient and other was up about 5.4 million but ancillary overall was down 4.8 million, so is that 10 million delta purely lab pricing pressure?
Kirk R. Manz
No, no, the facility revenue was up over 5 million and the lab revenue was down roughly 5 million which is why even though our admissions were up and census was up over the quarter we ended up relatively flat to slightly down to the prior quarter in terms of revenue. Those two kind of offset each other. 
Ryan Daniels
Okay and then the lab pricing I guess is probably the key focus this morning because pricing pressure has a direct impact on the bottom line although it’s not hurting your revenue guidance too much clearly your EBITDA is down quite a bit. So, can you give us a little bit more color on when you started to see that, how quickly it manifested, and then you give us comfort I guess if that’s going to stabilize or could get it worse going forward, how do you think about that. 
Kirk R. Manz
You know the first half of the year was relatively stable and then we looked at the second half we thought we would get to the low 20s by the end of the year and it got there three months earlier than we thought. We’ve yet to really kind of ramp our third party lab revenue to help offset the reimbursement declines which is kind of a major focus for us. So, we thought we get in to low 20s, it is in the low 20s now. I would anticipate that it should be fairly stabilized but we’ll see what happens in Q4. 

Ryan Daniels
That’s the question, I mean do you have visibility on how that’s trending, could it accelerate and be worst just from a peer pricing or have you seen kind of prices get cut initially and then stabilize. 
Andrew W. McWilliams
We’re not seeing that. I mean what we’ve also seen with CMS new guidelines coming out whether recommending going back up on pricing so it’s a combination of things. It’s also the insurance companies are wanting more documentation related to the actual test that’s being performed. So we feel like that we put systems in place to accommodate the proper issues that the insurance companies are looking for and we feel like that the pricing has become stable and I don’t think it’s any different than what we anticipated that would come. Kirk pointed out we thought that our third party lab would offset some of that. It hasn’t done that, we’re trying to ramp the third party lab now that’s kind of really on me and the focus of the company. We’re back focused now kind of getting California behind us. We will get the third party lab ramped up and then I think you’ll see that will offset some of our losses that we saw in the lab that we do with our own patients. 
Ryan Daniels
Okay, I know you are probably not prepared to fully give 2017 guidance but Michael you indicated you are pretty excited about growth. I think the question is Q3 was flat effectively on revenue and EBITDA Q4 is kind of guided that way and it seems like the bed growth and some of the expansion is getting eaten up by some of the pricing pressure. So how should we think about 2017 from kind of a top and EBITDA line growth outlook and what would be your expectation or what would you be disappointed and not to be able to achieve. 
Michael T. Cartwright
Right, in terms of the full guidance for next year not really go out there but what I am excited about is if you take a look at the census levels and you take a look at the new bed that we just brought online in the second half of the year and then on top of the beds that we’re adding in the first half of the year both down at Oxford and the construction projects. The new sober living bed that we got coming online in Arlington and Las Vegas we have capacity and that’s one thing that we do really well is sales and marketing. We’ve always been able to open de novo projects and fill it up. 
Laguna did not ramp as quickly as I’d hoped it would ramp in the third quarter, that’s really kind of a first for us. We’re starting to now see that go in the right direction in the fourth quarter. Again it’s just getting back focused on blocking and tackling. We have capacity and then into next year we have 300 beds that we’re showing coming along online in 2017. So I think we did 15% growth this year with really no access to capital markets and I don’t think there is any doubt that we can achieve much better than that in 2017. If we get access to equity markets I think we can do more than that. 
Ryan Daniels
Okay, maybe last one I’ll hop off, so others can ask questions. Just on Laguna obviously that’s slower ramp, can you go into detail on that why you think that ramped a little slower, did it have to do with the California legislation or is it just the novelty of more of a detox hospital versus kind of a typical residential facility. 
Andrew W. McWilliams
More associated with accreditation. Cost of accreditation normally we would get a cost for accreditation for our facilities and because we already have a relationship with them we would easily be able to add a facility under that accreditation. We needed as a hospital to get JCAHO accreditation. That process is a 120 day process, it’s a little bit longer than we had anticipated and they are backed up. They haven’t come out to do the survey yet. Many of the insurance companies won’t certify a patient to go into the hospital unless they are JCAHO accredited. We will have that resolved in the fourth quarter. We’re excited about being able to take more patients into that facility. So it’s a combination of focus and then an actual problem was getting JCAHO out there and getting our certification done. 

Ryan Daniels
Okay, that’s helpful. Thank you guys. 
Operator
And our next question today comes from Paula Torch of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.
Paula Torch
Great, thanks everybody, good morning. I guess I want to start off just asking some more questions about the average daily revenue. So excluding lab I think you mentioned that it was 4% higher sequentially which we expected it might be due to Laguna having a higher rate offset by some of the In-network acquisitions that you’ve recently taken on so, is that correct and then maybe how should we think about that growing in the fourth quarter and maybe looking out to next year and then I have a follow up on that?
Kirk R. Manz
If you strip out the lab side we have an increase of our facility ADR. If you kind of look at the different buckets we actually increased our core facility by roughly $26 on the ADR side. The lab and the point care was a decrease 57 and we had another couple of dollars from the professional groups in terms of a decrease which ended up being a net 33% decrease. So on the one hand we had lower than we originally expected lab but on the other hand we were encouraged that our facility ADR went up quarter-over-quarter.
Paula Torch
And I guess just in terms of thinking about where that should flush out longer-term excluding lab now, can you generate cash and return on capital at a rate of $600 to $620 and as the mix of a network kicks that down overtime can you still generate a return at a lower rate just thinking about the residential and excluding the lab at this point. 
Andrew W. McWilliams
Yes, absolutely Paula. I mean I think that whether doing an In-network facility or an out of network facility we have talked about this before, if we’re charging $800 a day or $400 a day you can still make margin on that business. It’s just different marketing cost and different operating cost to be able to operate that. And we’re doing exactly what we said we will do. We’re going to take some of our facilities more In-network, we’re going to get a more mix and balanced approach. I think we’ve done that and I also think that we’ve had a small miss in the third quarter after being extremely distracted for -- I spent a good portion of my third quarter in a trial adding California. A lot of our brain power was going into that. I hope that you guys are not taking this and blowing this up to more than it is. We had some census off a little bit on Laguna. We need to fill up some more sober living beds that we’re operating in both Dallas and Texas and we need to continue to execute on our third party lab strategy, right. And we feel very confident we’ll do that in the fourth quarter and all through 2017. 
Paula Torch
And just as a follow up on that my sober living beds and you know ramping those up I know you need to sell those up, is the marketing different, what is sort of going on from that standpoint in terms of what you need to do to help sell those beds?
Andrew W. McWilliams
It’s a combination of things. It's making sure that we get the places renovated and make sure the amenities are there, that the sober living program is solid for patients who want to go there versus another sober living operation. It’s a new product line for us we’ve tested some variety of different things that so liked that we got the solution to it. I think that you’ll see that in the fourth quarter and into next year. We’re excited about sober living, we’re actually expanding living in Oxford, Mississippi and looking at other markets to do sober living. It’s like outpatient we first started going into that if you remember in 2014, we were all residential. And then in 2015 we brought online some outpatient and then into 2016 more outpatient and now we have a good full handle on doing standalone outpatient. Sober living is a new product line we brought on in 2016. We’ll get some of the kinks worked out a bit and execute it and we’ll expand that across the country as well.

Paula Torch
Okay, now thank you, that’s helpful. And then if I might just put another quick one in just on margins, I know that we’ve talked about in the past a long-term margin goal of 20% to 25%, we’re going to be several 100 basis points below that this year. Is that still the right goal for margins for the company overtime especially as we continue to add on more In-network, more sober living that’s which might be at lower rates?
Andrew W. McWilliams
Absolutely, it will be. It is not just a goal, I mean that is what we will achieve and I think as you continue to see us a diversifying other lines of business and In-network facilities as well as our out of network facilities you will see that margin. Part of it is just getting the scale and size that we need and I think we’re there. We’re seeing that come into play in 2016, I think we’ll see it come into play more so in 2017 when we add 300 more beds. So I don’t think that’s going to be an issue. 
Paula Torch
Okay, so not much more investment that needs to be made to sort of get us to the low end and you think that could come fairly quickly or there is a lot more maybe -- a little bit more to be done to get to the lower end of that range?
Andrew W. McWilliams
I think a couple of quarters, I mean I think that’s what we’re looking at. 
Paula Torch
Okay, thank you, I’ll let someone ask some questions, thanks. 
Operator
And our next question today comes from Ann Hynes of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.
Ann Hynes
Hi, so when I look at your 2016 guidance, your Q4 EBITDA well the guidance implies to Q4 EBITDA kind of dropped to 4 million versus what was reported 12 million. So I guess, I mean if you look at your stock price I think what people are doing is taking out 4 million run rate time is taking by a 4 and assuming that’s new to 2017 number. So I think what would be helpful for investors is one, is lab, what causing -- can you break out what’s causing that sequential drop, is it all lab and if it’s all lab?
Andrew W. McWilliams
Well I think you are missing the math a little bit. We’re projecting more like 11 million not 4 million for fourth quarter. I am trying to understand where you are getting 4 million.
Ann Hynes
Alright, well I’ll check my math but if I can go back to the question with the lab so when you look at the lab you said, I think why does it change so rapidly because if I remember when you reported Q2 lab reimbursement you expected to decelerate but it was better than your expectations. Why did it decelerate so much in Q3, was it a specific payer, was it more than one payer?
Kirk R. Manz
You know Ann, this is a combination of things and we have said earlier the first couple of quarters we had a very stable lab piece of the business. I mean I think one of the things that we want to kind of highlight is that we delivered roughly the same EBITDA in Q3 versus Q2 and we did it with significantly less lab contribution than we had in the prior quarter. In other words we went from 30% down to 23% and yet we were able to manage to increase our facility ADR by $26 which help to offset what would have been a larger ADR decrease. And so we’ve known that we’re going to be in this kind of shifting tide in terms of lab to get to the place of ultimately stabilizing now. It’s the master rate that came out obviously, an increasing pricing for 2017 and so this isn’t so much as a surprise in the context of 23% we thought we would get there, it’s just more of a surprise in terms of the timing coming on earlier than we expected. Had that been mitigated over two quarters we would have obviously had a very different EBITDA contribution in this quarter. So that's all the information that we have right now as it relates to lab but we don’t have any indication right now indicating that we have any other for instance degradation that it is eminent with that we would be talking about on this particular call. So we’ll just wait to see how the rest of the quarter plays out. 

Andrew W. McWilliams
And I just want to clarify and what we’ve proposed is that our revenue for 2016 would be $275 million to $280 million and our adjusted EBITDA will be $47 million to $49 million. So I just want to clarify so that would put our fourth quarter guidance at around 11 million. 
Ann Hynes
Okay, that’s helpful and can you remind us the negative. I think you are seeing it from fair remarks the cash flow that you spend on the California case will be redeployed to growth next year, can you remind us of that total amount that you expect to be able to redeploy for development in acquisitions?
Michael T. Cartwright
Yes, I mean if you take out the California case we would have had close to 8 millionish free cash flow for the first three quarters. So if you run rate that out call it 12 million plus. If we just used free cash flow to reinvest in the business we’d be able to bring on new de novo project every 18 months to 24 months based on where we are today. Obviously we are optimistic that we’ll be able to continue to drive revenue and EBITDA and margins in 2017 which we would hope will give us more cash flow to reinvest in the business. 
Ann Hynes
Alright and is there anything you want to call on the cost structure. I know you had some uptick in medical cost last quarter, has that stabilized or any other cost as your client related services right on cost, is anything on the cost side do you want to call out?
Andrew W. McWilliams
This is Andrew, on the last quarter we highlighted the health insurance cost and that we did see that rise in Q2 up from Q1. That has stabilized into Q3 and we expect that to stabilize into Q4. The client related expenses did go up this quarter over previous quarter and that was really primarily related to our growth, our acquisition, de novo as the full quarter of solutions. 
Ann Hynes
Alright and then one last question, I know you have given your obviously In-network and out of network as a big topic and you provide your mix as a percentage of client related services, does that include lab or exclude lab?
Michael T. Cartwright
Well that would include lab but keep in mind on most of the In-network business and labs are typically negotiated as part of the daily rate. 
Ann Hynes
Yes, okay.
Michael T. Cartwright
So, roughly we added some more In-network beds when we did a consolidation of [indiscernible] to recovery first that gives us another 65 In-network beds. In-network revenue was right around a quarter of our revenue, the beds are now 36% of our total beds that are out there. So, obviously from the beginning we’ve stated our goal to diversify our payer mix. We made a lot of progress in just really the first couple of years of being public and we continue to look to diversify that in 2017. 
Ann Hynes
Okay, great. Thank you. 
Michael T. Cartwright
Welcome.

[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from John Ransom of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
John Ransom
Hey, good morning. Just want to go back to the census question, in our model we only assumed 2080C at -- in California. So I am still just trying to figure out where the census was light, was it what I would call legacy or was it -- is there something else that we might be missing, in other words we got the Laguna ride and yet you missed our census by 50 so again I am just trying to figure out where that might have been? 
Kirk R. Manz
I understand, we were at 82% utilization across all of the beds in terms of our -- beds. We had 84% at the legacy facilities so in terms of was there a particular facility that was lighter than the other, no there wasn’t. It was pretty much spread across the board. 
John Ransom
Okay and I guess the philosophical question is as rates are coming under pressure and as you have to fill more beds what do you think -- let’s talk about a 1080C or 1280C what do you think the equilibrium rate is where you trade your call volume for the need to fill beds at a price. So where do you think if you had to guess, where do you think we end up in terms of and let’s just forget outpatient for a minute but where do we end up in terms of rate either with or without lab however you want to characterize it?

Kirk R. Manz
When you say rate I am missing.
John Ransom
Rate per day? So the rate per day, I mean I guess my question is if you have to go to 4% for your incoming cost versus 2% does that imply a rate per day that’s $650 a day, $600 a day, is it -- once we hit equilibrium on the lab are we just going to have to trade a little bit of price for demand and rate or am I missing something?
Kirk R. Manz
I am digesting the question here so.
John Ransom
Let me just -- in other words at times here you had to fill 400 beds now you have to fill a 1000. I am assuming that means you have to take a higher percentage of your incoming call volume or and/or you do more In-network and so I think clearly rates are headed down but is it bigger than the bread box or are we over thinking this, I mean you are in a position to assess that more than we are, so I am kind of curious what your thoughts are?
Michael T. Cartwright
I am not saying where rates are heading down and some of our In-network facilities were actually getting rate increases. So rates themselves at the core facilities I think are very stable and we’re seeing that as we go In-network in some of our facilities. Obviously our ADR across the system would come down. But the pressure has been on the laboratory bringing the rate down further. We had anticipated our third party lab which showed that up a little bit. 
Again I think that as we continue to bring facilities In-network, the ADR goes down a little bit and you are right we need more patients in those in-network facilities but the cost structure for in-network versus out of network on a marketing situation is much lower. So again, I think that we’re making -- we’re extrapolating more out of this than it is. We’ve had eight quarter successfully of hitting our numbers exactly what the street wanted to see. This quarter we’re off a little bit, we’re not off by the magnitude of huge amount. I think that if you take a look at overall in 2016 for what this company is faced to be able to come back and continually grow the business without access to outside capital, we’ve done an extremely good job. I am sorry that it’s not exactly where we had hoped in terms of full year guidance. Sure, you will get it back there in fourth quarter we’ll hit our numbers, we will come back to 2017 and we’ll be fully focused. It’s not -- the lab is not deteriorating so much that it's causing major calamity in our company that’s not the case whatsoever. 
John Ransom
And just on the lab numbers, I mean if I remember it’s been 22, 27, 30, and 23 in the last four quarters so it’s been a hard thing to forecast for I think the Street. So and going from 30 to 23 sequentially is that all payers, is it a few payers, is it point of care coming down faster than you think or is it the new Medicare rates pressuring the high complexity test, how do we think about that in a little more depth? Thanks.
Andrew W. McWilliams
This is Andrew, I would that’s it’s a combination of almost all of the factors that you indicated which between the lab and the point of care certainly reimbursement pressure on the point of care as we’ve indicated in the past. And then also on the lab, the high complexity lab as well it seem reimbursement pressure there as well and unfortunately it’s not isolated to any one payer. Its different payers in different states. 
John Ransom
And if I remember last year you did 61 million in lab and maybe a third of that was point of care, what’s the ratio of point of care this year assuming we think it’s probably down 60% to 70%. So is that a useful way to think of it. If we looked at the total lab revenue this year point of care would be maybe less than 10% of total lab revenue?
Kirk R. Manz
No, it's still it’s around 20% to 25% in that range.

John Ransom
Okay, and is that where -- I mean I assume that was the highest risk piece of the business?
Kirk R. Manz
Yes, we felt obviously from the beginning that the point of care was the -- had a higher exposure than the high complexity there.
John Ransom
Okay and then my last question is just the question of bank covenants at kind of a $45 million run rate EBITDA, where you calculate you are going to be with respect to your bank credit and where do you need to be to feel comfortable that you got some cushion there?
Andrew W. McWilliams
This is Andrew again, on the -- based having or similar to the add back that we haven’t adjusted EBITDA and so that’s right around -- this puts us about it for time. 
John Ransom
And what’s the covenant, 25?
Andrew W. McWilliams
Yes you got that right. 
Michael T. Cartwright
And the senior leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.5. We have a benefit kind of rolling off of Q4 from last year so we feel we are in good shape on our covenants as it relates to the banks.
John Ransom
But I guess the issue would be you are not generating that kind of cash right now with the DSOs and you only get a quarter point of cushion. I mean is there a cost lever you think you need to look at just to give yourself some cushion?
Michael T. Cartwright
Cost lever I am not following. 
John Ransom
I mean to get to be comfortably into the bank, I mean I am just looking at a couple of quarters if DSO stay high and EBITDA stays in this 45 range you don’t have a ton of cushion, is there anything you are thinking about, do you have to look at some cost in the short term just to kind of make sure you stay under that threshold or you think you are okay?
Andrew W. McWilliams
I think we are okay. I mean I am not seeing what you’re seeing there John. I mean I feel like that we are very comfortable in line with our bank covenants. We are very in line with what we need from a cash standpoint to operate our business so...
John Ransom
I mean the only thing I am seeing is you got a quarter point of cushion which is not a ton?
Kirk R. Manz
Understand we expect -– we are growing our revenue and improving our EBITDA is what we anticipate doing over the course of the next couple of quarter so. 
Michael T. Cartwright
And then is Kirk outlined earlier, year-to-date we spend about $8 million of cash on California and then we now are just utilizing that for operating cash flows. 
John Ransom
Got you, okay, thank you. I’ll hop back up.
