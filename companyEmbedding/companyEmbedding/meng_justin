Justin Meng






I am 25 years old and have been doing CrossFit for about 3 years now. Growing up I played every sport you can imagine, but eventually put all of my focus into playing football. I played football in college for a few years and rugby for all four years.  Before graduating college I thought about going overseas to play rugby once I graduated, but after sustaining a few injuries, I thought it would be best to stop.
I continued to stay fit by running and working out at 24 hour fitness, but it was starting to get bored of it rather quickly. I needed to find something that would allow me to train toward being competitive in some sort of way. I spoke to an old friend I played rugby with and he told me that I should try CrossFit. July of 2013, I began my CrossFit journey at a local box called CrossFit pandemic. I remember before doing the WOD, which was Grace, I thought to myself, but it’s only 135lbs. Well, those 135lbs kicked my butt and that was when I knew that I wanted to compete in CrossFit.
After the 2014 CrossFit open, I was very fortunate to compete for the first time at the 2014 southern California CrossFit Regionals on a team. It was a very humbling experience and hope that I can compete as an individual at regionals and make it to the CrossFit Games.

This site contains REAL police records (court records of driving citations, speeding tickets, felonies, misdemeanors, sexual offenses, mugshots, etc.), background reports, photos, court documents, address information, phone numbers, and much more. Please BE CAREFUL when conducting a search and ensure all the information you enter is accurate.
Learning the truth about the history of your family and friends can be shocking, so please be cautious when using this tool.
TruthFinder does not provide consumer reports and is not a consumer reporting agency. We provide a lot of sensitive information that can be used to satisfy your curiosity, protect your family, and find the truth about the people in your life. You may not use our service or the information it provides to make decisions about consumer credit, employers, insurance, tenant screening, or any other purposes that would require FCRA compliance.
