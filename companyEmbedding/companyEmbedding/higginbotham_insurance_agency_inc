Personal Insurance
We have options for your home, auto and liability coverage so you're not limited to one plan that may or may not fit your lifestyle.
 



















Personal Insurance








Personal insurance should be just that—personalized. That’s the advantage of using a broker like Higginbotham over insuring directly with a carrier. We have access to multiple insurance carriers for your home, auto, liability, life and medical coverage so you’re not limited to one program that may or may not fit your lifestyle. With our guidance, you’ll be paired with the carriers that offer the best protections for your personal risk factors, tolerance and budget. And when possible, we consolidate your program with fewer carriers to eliminate extraneous costs. It’s the peace of mind that comes from knowing that you have a trusty advisor on your side.

Commercial Coverage








Commercial Auto


Covers liability for bodily injury and physical damage caused by vehicles used for business purposes. Factors such as ownership by a business, use in hauling goods for hire and gross weight determine a vehicle’s eligibility under a commercial auto policy. Except for auto-related businesses, motor carrier and trucking firms, a commercial auto policy addresses the auto insurance needs of most commercial entities. Some small vehicles used for business purposes can be insured on a personal auto policy.




Business Owners Policy (BOP)


Combines property and liability coverage in a package policy for eligible small businesses. A typical BOP covers commercial property, including buildings and contents, and liability protection for the operation of a business at its established location, its products and completed operations. Some policies include business income and extra expense coverage after an insured loss, but not workers' compensation, professional liability or commercial auto coverage.




Business Interruption


Covers the loss of income suffered by a business as a result of not being able to use property damaged by an insured loss during the time required to repair or replace the property. From the time of the loss to when operations are restored, business interruption insurance helps replace lost profits and pay continuing expenses like rent and payroll.




Commercial Umbrella (Excess Liability)


Covers losses that exceed the limits of its underlying insurance policy. Umbrella insurance provides excess limits when the limits of underlying policies are exhausted by the payment of claims, covers exclusions and gaps in underlying policies and provides protection against some claims not covered by underlying policies.




Boiler & Machinery


Covers losses caused by mechanical or electrical equipment breakdown, including damage to the equipment, damage to the business’s other property and damage to the property of others. Lost income is not typically covered under a boiler and machinery policy and must be purchased through additional coverage.




Crime (Fidelity Insurance)


Provides protection against a number of criminal acts by employees, including employee dishonesty, theft of money or securities, forgery or alteration, computer fraud and burglary or robbery.




Kidnap & Ransom (K&R)


Covers loss by the surrendering of property as a result of a threat of harm to the insured, an employee or a relative or guest of the insured or the insured’s employees. K&R policies reimburse loss, such as extortion payments, loss of ransom in transit, crisis management consultant fees, travel fees and medical costs, rather than pay ransoms on behalf of the insured.




Builders Risk


Covers property in the course of construction. It typically applies not only to property at the construction site, but also to property at off-site storage locations and in transit. Builders risk protects against building damage and damaged or lost materials, fixtures and equipment used in construction or renovation. The estimated completed value of the project is used as the limit of coverage, and protection ends when the work is completed.


 








 
General Liability
Protects against financial loss resulting from claims of bodily injury, property damage, personal injury, like libel and slander, and advertising injury to others caused by a business or its employees. Exposures come from a broad spectrum of sources, including accidents on the insured premises, employment-related lawsuits and copyright infringement. A general liability policy covers the cost to defend or settle claims even if they are fraudulent. It does not cover auto and professional liability exposures.

  

 
Marine
Inland marine is property insurance covering exposures that cannot be reasonably confined to a fixed location or insured under a standard policy. It applies to property in transit over land, certain moveable property, property under construction, instrumentalities of transportation and communication such as bridges, roads, piers or television/radio towers, legal liability coverage for bailees and computerized equipment. Many inland marine policies provide coverage without regard to the location of the property. These are sometimes called “floater” policies.
 

Ocean marine is property insurance covering the transportation of goods and/or merchandise by vessels crossing foreign and domestic waters, including any inland or aviation transit associated with the shipment. Ocean marine insurance also covers damage to vessels involved in shipments and legal liability arising in the course of shipment.

  

 
Non-Subscription
Texas employers can opt out of the workers’ compensation system; however, they can be held liable in tort if proven negligent in causing a worker’s injury since they waive the legal defenses available to employers subject to workers’ compensation laws. Nonsubscribers may not argue that the employee’s own negligence or the negligence of another worker contributed to the accident or that the employee voluntarily assumed the risk of injury. A court may order a nonsubscriber to pay for pain and suffering and punitive damages.
There are two types of non-subscriber policies: occupational accident and employers excess indemnity. Occupational accident insurance allows an employer to provide benefits similar to those afforded under workers’ compensation laws. Employers excess indemnity insurance reimburses the employer for liability settlements and judgments applying to pain and suffering, permanent disfigurement and lost future earnings.

  

 
Professional Liability
Often called “Errors and Omissions” (E&O), a professional liability policy protects business professionals and companies against liability incurred as a result of errors and omissions in performing professional services. Most E&O policies cover financial losses suffered by third parties as opposed to bodily injury and property damage, which are typically covered under commercial general liability policies.

  

 
Workers' Compensation
A statutory benefit prescribed in state law requiring most employers to compensate employees or their families for lost wages and medical care due to job-related injuries resulting from accidents or occupational disease. In exchange, employees relinquish their right to sue their employer for negligence. Workers’ compensation insurance helps cover the cost of injured employees’ medical and income benefits.

  

 
Commercial Property
Helps businesses pay to repair or replace buildings, structures and contents that are damaged or destroyed because of fire, storm and other events outlined in the policy. It also pays to replace stolen or lost property. Different policies protect against different risks. Some cover only those risks named in the policy, and others cover all risks except for those that are excluded. Additional coverage may need to be purchased to fully protect a business, depending on what it does and where it is located.

  

 
Cyber Liability
Protects companies from exposures encountered when communicating or conducting business online, like breaches of privacy, infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property, employment discrimination, violation of obscenity laws, computer viruses transmission and defamation. Any business that does Internet commerce, has a Web site or stores sensitive electronic information on a network can benefit from a cyber liability insurance policy; however, it is most applicable to technology, financial service and health care companies.

  

 
Directors & Officers (D&O) Liability
Protects corporate directors and officers against claims, often made by stockholders, customers and employees, alleging financial loss arising from mismanagement. The policy provides two protections: the first reimburses the insured organization when it is legally obligated to indemnify directors and officers for their acts; the second provides direct coverage to directors and officers when the organization is not legally obligated to indemnify them. Coverage can extend to defense costs for criminal, regulatory and civil trials. D&O policies typically exclude intentional/dishonest acts, bodily injury and property damage, but do include “wrongful acts” such as unintended omissions and misstatements. The underlying principal is that directors and officers must be allowed to take reasonable strategic risks in the course of business without the threat of personal liability.
 
Under state law, directors’ and officers’ personal assets are at risk. So, quality D&O coverage is necessary for a company to attract top directors and officers.

  

 
Employment Practices Liability
Employment Practices Liability Insurance (EPLI) covers claims made by employees of wrongful acts resulting from the employment process. The most frequent type of claim alleges wrongful termination, discrimination and sexual harassment. EPLI is available as a stand-alone coverage, but is also frequently offered as an endorsement to directors and officers liability policies.

                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/01/1990
            

                BBB has determined that Higginbotham Insurance Agency Inc meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Fort Worth
























        Who We Are      




Fort Worth is Higginbotham’s birth place and headquarters. Founded in 1948 by Paul C. Higginbotham after returning from World War II, the firm has relocated several times to accommodate its growing staff. In 2001, it moved to its current downtown building, which houses nearly 200 insurance and administrative professionals. It is the center of the firm’s accounting, HR, IT and marketing functions.
But more than our location has changed during the firm’s 60-plus years. What started as a small neighborhood home and auto insurance agency has expanded to one of the largest full-service brokerage firms in Texas and nationwide.
Through experience and growth, we have developed expertise in every area of insurance, employee benefits and risk management—a Single Source solution.
We have successfully ventured beyond Fort Worth to cities throughout Texas. But no matter where you find Higginbotham, our commitment to Single Source solutions is the same.  Paul Higginbotham would be amazed at his legacy.

Business Insurance
We develop a custom marketing and coverage plan after getting to know your business goals and exposures.
 



















Business Insurance








We don’t assume that the insurance coverage you’ve had in place meets your needs today or that it will tomorrow. Instead, we design a custom coverage plan based on our assessment of your unique exposures. Then we market those exposures to appropriately place your coverage with our highly rated insurance carriers and get the best value for the price you pay.
Lots of insurance brokers can provide coverage for your business. Higginbotham provides that and much more. We deliver a detailed market analysis with side-by-side quotes and all the data you need to make an informed carrier selection and avoid rushed decision-making. Once coverage is placed, we develop an annual service timeline to track pivotal account and risk management activities to demonstrate how we will fulfill our service commitments to you throughout the coverage term.

Employee Benefits
Our specialists become your partners in finding and administering the best mix of plans for your business and employees.
 



















Employee Benefits








Our relationships with reputable national insurance carriers enable us to achieve the best mix of plans for your unique employee demographics, and our benchmark reports show how your benefit package compares to those offered by your industry peers. Using these resources, we design an attractive benefits package that will help you recruit, retain and reward professional talent while keeping an eye on your bottom line.
But before we can develop cost control remedies, we get to know your long-term goals through strategic planning meetings and historical data analysis.  This due diligence helps ensure that we design the best plan for you and your employees and that plan documents deliver on your goals.
Then we maximize the efficiency of your benefits package with year-round support in every aspect of plan administration. Whether it’s answering your employees’ enrollment questions or alerting you of regulatory changes, we’re your human resource partners.

Business Insurance
We develop a custom marketing and coverage plan after getting to know your business goals and exposures.
 



















Business Insurance








We don’t assume that the insurance coverage you’ve had in place meets your needs today or that it will tomorrow. Instead, we design a custom coverage plan based on our assessment of your unique exposures. Then we market those exposures to appropriately place your coverage with our highly rated insurance carriers and get the best value for the price you pay.
Lots of insurance brokers can provide coverage for your business. Higginbotham provides that and much more. We deliver a detailed market analysis with side-by-side quotes and all the data you need to make an informed carrier selection and avoid rushed decision-making. Once coverage is placed, we develop an annual service timeline to track pivotal account and risk management activities to demonstrate how we will fulfill our service commitments to you throughout the coverage term.

Health Care Reform








In 2010, former President Obama signed into law the health care reform bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. This legislation, along with the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, made sweeping changes to the U.S. health care system. The current administration has taken steps to repeal and replace parts of the ACA, leaving employers in limbo between current law and pending new regulations.
Higginbotham is committed to providing frequent updates on health care reform activity so you can plan accordingly and remain in compliance. Check back here often for the most recent legislative changes.
 
Leading News
On May 4, 2017, members of the House took first steps toward repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by passing the American Health Care Act (AHCA). While the majority of the AHCA deals with individual markets and Medicare, there are provisions that will affect employers if the bill becomes law. In particular, the AHCA would reduce the penalties imposed under the Individual and Employer Mandates to zero beginning in 2016, effectively repealing both (although they would technically still exist). Click the link below to learn more.
