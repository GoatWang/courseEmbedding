Product Description:

LUNA LLENA: In a small provincial city, a young girl is found brutally murdered. As a detective searches for any sort of clue that would lead him to the perpetrator, the girl's death triggers a series of events affecting a wide net of people who are in some way related to either her or the murderer. This dark drama received five Goya Awards in 2001.NO TE FALLARE: A feature-length follow-up to the popular Spanish high school-themed television series "Companeros" (or "Schoolmates" in English), NO TE FALLARE examines a group of former high-school students three years after graduation. The death of one of their group while celebrating graduation still haunts them, and they are finding life in the adult work harder than they expected. Valle, now a dancer at a nightclub, finds herself in a relationship with Ray, the club owner who is under pressure to use his establishment to sell drugs.
