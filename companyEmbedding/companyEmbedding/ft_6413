Customer Questions & Answers








            What are the inside dimensions?
        

            I want to use this shed to store my lawnmower which is 22 inch wide.
        
Asked by: Anonymous

            Inside dimension in mine is 23&quot; My lawn mower is exactly 23&quot;... it just fits.

            What is the inside height dimensions?
        

            At level not where it starts to peak.

Thanks.
        
Asked by: Mary

            The measurement from the floor to the trusses is 80&quot;. The minimum height on the interior measures at 70&quot; and goes up to 94&quot; as the maximum height.

            Can this product be painted to match our home?
        
Asked by: Purz

            We do not recommend painting our sheds. The plastic material our sheds are made from is designed to expand and contract with the heat and cold so any paint that is applied will likely peel or chip off.

The shed was not as hard to put together as some of the reviews state. Locking the walls into the floor was the hardest part, if you use the wood block as suggested in the instructions the walls will snap in easier. All in all a great shed, it provided the correct storage space for our needs. Also, it appears to be built to last, time will tell.

Extremely difficult to assemble--took 3 people (two experienced carpenters) most of 2 days to put it together . . . the doors still won't close properly and one part of the wall just wouldn't snap into the base.

        Best Boat Locker Ever!
We've had this Lifetime 8' x 2.5" shed installed for over a year. We are located in Southwest Florida and are using the shed as a boating locker for storage of all things boating and fishing. The narrow width results in more of a closet feel than a shed and has the benefit of being able to reach everything quite easily without having to step in.
This shed has great UV resistance as there has been no fading, the shed is also water tight and has a solid feeling. It was very easy to install, even with a special pedestal to keep it off the ground and adding electrical wiring for an outlet and a light inside. The horizontal shelves and corner shelves have performed well.

        Great Features but needed replacement parts
I waited a long time to buy this Lifetime 6413 shed but I was disappointed with the quality control or packaging when I received it. All four roof panels were warped which they replaced at no charge. The back panels were warped but I put 2 of the shelf braces horizontal accross them to straighten the panel out. One of the front doors was not molded properly which they replaced but the color was different so they sent a second one and it was also different. So I injected the original door with silicone to expand it to look like it was suppose to. It was a 3 step process. Other than that it looks great now. Overall it is a nice shed and they were great about sending the replaceing parts. Hopefully this was a one in a million problems.

        Excellent Shed for townhouse or narrow yard
I bought 2 of these for a townhome I own near the beach. These are excellent sheds and perfect for the space I have. Make sure to follow all of the instructions and watch the videos for some tips on getting the sides into the base. These are the best value for the price. The other brands out there don't come close to this quality.

            Memories of You is a unique store where they help you keep memories alive through their amazing selection of memorial products – even for pets.  There’s jewelry, frames, keepsakes, garden stones, urns, sympathy gifts, and they can customize just about anything you can imagine.  You probably have no idea how many options you have in keeping memories until you meet the staff at Memories of You.  They talk to you about the passions of your loved one, what they stood for, how they lived and then help you create the perfect memorial.  Other products and services offered are personalized caskets (may people are uncomfortable looking at caskets so we have them in a separate viewing room at the store so you don't have to see them if you don't want to), funeral pre-planning, delivery to funeral homes of sympathy gifts, and cemetery markers.  Visit us on Lima Road in front of Meijer next to Starbucks!

Excellent place to park your mower
Pros:Durable,"Innovative" Cons:Expensive Best Uses:"Yard Tool Storage","Lawn Mower Storage" Bottom Line:Yes, I would recommend this to a friend. When I first read about this shed I was amazed -- and not in a good way. I mean, come on, who would want a shed that's less than 4-feet deep? That sounds pretty silly. Then I got to thinking, my mower is less than 4-feet wide. My snow blower is less than 4-feet wide. My tiller is less than 4-feet wide... maybe it's not such a silly idea after all! This little shed nestles right up next to your house and is the perfect size for yard equipment and power tools -- all without taking up too much room in your yard! It's definitely worth a second look!

Too Good To Be True  ...  Not!
So many times we hear,  ... "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is ... "So is it?Product - Nope!  Very Impressive ProductPrice - Nope!  I Feel Like I Stole ItService - Nope!  I Ordered On Sunday, Delivered Friday!I must honestly say that I had never heard of Lifetime, until I found them through a search for a Deck Box, which blew me away when I received it.  I started to research other products by Lifetime.Lifetime may be an obscure company at the moment, but will soon become THE PARADIGM in the industry.One satisfied customer!

Shipping: Orders for the 6413 Lifetime Storage Shed generally leave the warehouse the next business day. Accurate Tracking: Tracking information is automatically emailed to you just as soon as the order ships out.  Delivery Details: This product ships directly from Lifetime Products in Clearfield, UT. Delivery of this product is via a curbside delivery through an LTL carrier (too big for UPS and FedEx). The customer must be present to sign for the order. The freight carrier is instructed to contact you prior to delivery to set up a delivery appointment. The carrier will unload the product by means of a lift gate. In some cases items may be too large to fit on the lift gate and may require assistance from the customer helping unload box-by-box (takes only a few minutes). Signing for the Package: When signing for the delivery it is important to note any damage.  Damage is extremely rare.  We package these to travel both domestically and internationally.  However, sometimes the packaging may be slightly damaged, but you may not be sure whether something inside is damaged.   In such a case it is a good idea to sign for it and have the driver note it as such. You can still accept delivery.  Call or email us with any questions. Local Pickup Option: This item is available for local pickup in Clearfield, Utah. If you are interested in picking it up locally contact our customer service for a special pickup quote at 866-308-5484. 


This product has a 30-day money back guarantee: Simply hang on to the original packaging and contact us within 30 days of receipt if you are not satisfied with this product. We will have the item picked up at our cost and refund you in full. We are that confident you will love this product!  Please contact us before purchasing if you are unsure whether this product is right for you by calling us toll free at 866-308-5484 or via email at websales@competitiveedgeproducts.com
