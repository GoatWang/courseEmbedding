(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  Some of the statements under "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Business" and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q may include forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. These statements include forward-looking statements both with respect to us specifically and to the insurance sector in general. Statements that include the words "expect," "intend," "plan," "believe," "project," "estimate," "may," "should," "anticipate," "will" and similar statements of a future or forward-looking nature identify forward-looking statements for purposes of the Federal securities laws or otherwise.  All forward-looking statements address matters that involve risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in these statements. We believe that these factors include, but are not limited to, those described under "Risk Factors" and the following:  �  ineffectiveness or obsolescence of our business strategy due to changes in current or future market conditions;  �  developments that may delay or limit our ability to enter new markets as quickly as we anticipate;  �  changes in technology that causes our product to be obsolete;  �  acceptance by our targeted customer of a competing product;  �  changes in regulations or laws applicable to us, our subsidiaries, brokers or customers;  �  loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key personnel;  �  insufficient revenue to support further development or operation of the Company;  �  changes in accounting policies or practices;  �  changes in general economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates and other factors;  �  future litigation or governmental proceedings.  The foregoing review of important factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.  If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, actual results may vary materially from what we project. Any forward-looking statements you read in this Form 10-Q reflect our views as of the date of this Form 10-Q with respect to future events and are subject to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or individuals acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. Before making an investment decision, you should specifically consider all of the factors identified in this Form 10-Q that could cause actual results to differ.  Overview  Company Overview  eBizware Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, was formed on December 31, 2013. The Company is headquartered at 5251 West 116th Place, Suite 200, Overland Park Kansas 66211. The Company was formed to continue the development and distribution of a software solution that provides visual online data resource for our customers to integrate with third party implementations.  The exchange of data is a constant problem for most organizations no matter what their size. eBizware began operations with the intent of providing customers with middle-ware applications. Our tools allow for the customer to attach our software to their resident database, no matter the manufacturer, via an online connection string builder. Once the customer's database is attached to the eBizware tool, you have the ability, through our online resource, resident or on one of our servers, to choose the data you would like to distribute and how you would like to distribute it. eBizware offers several standard delivery options, the system can deliver a .csv file (comma separated value file), a txt file, web service or API (application programming interface), all without any additional programming or resources.  The system is currently operational and in production for one customer who is a related party. We are working towards the next release, which will include a complete Email Notification Factory. The email factory will allow current customers the ability to map the data from our production system and create bulk email notifications from those results. The factory is in beta testing now and should be able to be in production within the next 60 days.  The Company began generating revenue in September 2014 with a related party, and has several options to increase the revenue. Our revenue model is a subscription service, paid monthly prior to the beginning of that month.  Organizational Structure  Our Officer, Mark W. DeFoor, handle the operational business functions, including corporate administration and development responsibility. We have no employees. Our officers receive no salaries.  Products and Services  The Company provides customers with middle-ware applications. Our tools allow for the customer to attach our software to their resident database, no matter the manufacturer, via an online connection string builder. Once the customer's database is attached to the eBizware tool, you have the ability, through our online resource, resident or on one of our servers, to choose the data you would like to distribute and how you would like to distribute it. eBizware offers several standard delivery options, the system can deliver a .csv file (comma separated value file), a txt file, web service or API (application programming interface), all without any additional programming or resources.  Risks, Uncertainties and Trends Relating to the Company and Industry  Web-based technology solutions are intensely competitive in the United States as many software development companies are focused on medical and healthcare applications. We have numerous competitors in the United States and elsewhere. Several of these competitors have already successfully marketed and commercialized products that compete with our products. Our success is dependent upon our ability to effectively and profitably produce, market, and sell our products. Our business strategy and success is dependent on the skills and knowledge of our management team. The marketability and profitability of our products is subject to unknown economic conditions, which could significantly impact our business, financial condition, the marketability of our products and our profitability. We are vulnerable to the current economic crisis which may negatively affect our profitability. Our success depends, in part, on the quality and operability of our products. Furthermore, the Company has no active sales staff so generating new clients may be difficult.  Results of Operations for the nine and three months ended May 31, 2016 compared to May 31, 2015.  We generated related party revenue of $11,250 for the three months ended May 31, 2016. We incurred expenses of $5,478 and a net income in the amount of $5,772 for the three months ended May 31, 2016. Our expenses during the quarter consisted of advertising and promotion of $2,593, professional fees of $185, auditing and accounting fees and NAIC appointment fees of $2,700. By comparison, we generated related party revenue of $11,250. We incurred expenses of $2,163 and net income in the amount of $9,087 for the three months ended May 31, 2015. Our expenses consisted of audit and accounting fees of $1,250, professional fees of $913.  We generated related party revenue of $33,750 for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. We incurred expenses of $37,899 and a net loss in the amount of $4,149 for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. Our expenses during period consisted of legal and accounting fees of $6,800, professional fees of $15,350, bank service charges of $25, and fees to the State of Delaware of $169, Computer and Internet expenses of $4,095, leads expense of $3,392, NAIC appointment fees of $5,348, office supplies of $68, advertising and promotion expense of $2,593, and rent expense of $59. By comparison, we generated related party revenue of $33,750. We incurred expenses of $18,773 and net income in the amount of $14,977 for the nine months ended May 31, 2015. Our expenses consisted of audit and accounting fees of $13,750, and professional fees of $4,149, miscellaneous fees of $792, office supplies expense of $23, and rent expense of $59.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of May 31, 2016, we had total current assets of $26,479, consisting of cash of $229 and accounts receivable from related party of $26,250. We had current liabilities of $21,468. Accordingly, we had a working capital of $5,011 as of May 31, 2016.  On December 23, 2014, the Company commenced registration of its common stock by filing a Form S-1 registration statement (the "Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") which was effective on August 24, 2015. Thereafter, during its offering, the Company sold 280,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, at a fixed price of $.05 per share in exchange for $14,000.  Based on our anticipated level of revenues, we believe that funds generated from operations, together with existing cash and cash available from financing activities in 2016, will be sufficient to finance our operations and planned capital expenditures through 2017.  We will continue to pursue traffic to our web site and actively seek new customers. We believe these actions will position us to capitalize on opportunities as they arise in the industry. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful. Should volumes and revenues decline to a level significantly below our current expectations, we would reduce capital expenditures and implement cost-reduction initiatives which we believe would be sufficient to ensure that funds generated from operations, together with existing cash, would be sufficient to finance our current operations through 2017.  We may also seek to raise additional cash to fund future investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue. To the extent it becomes necessary to raise additional cash in the future, we may seek to raise it through the sale of debt or equity securities, funding from joint-venture or strategic partners, debt financing or loans, issuance of common stock, or a combination of the foregoing. We currently do not have any binding commitments for, or readily available sources of, additional financing. Nor do we have any current plans to raise additional capital. However, we reserve the right to raise additional capital in the future in which case the percentage ownership of our shareholders would be diluted. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to secure the additional cash or working capital we may require to continue our operations.  Going Concern  As discussed in the notes to our financial statements, we have no established sufficient sources of revenue. This has raised substantial doubt for our auditors about our ability to continue as a going concern. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for us to continue as a going concern.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most "critical accounting polices" in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Currently, we do not believe that any accounting policies fit this definition.  Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Contractual Arrangements.  The Company did not have any contractual arrangements as of May 31, 2016.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements.  As of May 31, 2016, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results based on management's plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "will" and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Factors that could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially are set forth in the "Risk Factors" section of our annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on December 15, 2016, as the same may be updated from time to time in documents that we file with the SEC.  We caution that these factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  Company Overview  eBizware.com, Inc. (the "Company"), a Delaware corporation, was formed on December 31, 2013. The Company is headquartered at Unit B19, 9/F, Efficiency House, 35 Tai Yau Street, San Po Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Company was formed to continue the development and distribution of a software solution that provides visual online data resource for our customers to integrate with third party implementations.  On August 12, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in our company, Mark W. DeFoor the Company's former Chief Executive Officer and Director entered into and closed on that certain Share Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with 57 Society, whereby 57 Society purchased from Mr. DeFoor a total of 5,000,000 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Shares") for an aggregate price of $321,000. The Shares acquired represented approximately 94.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.  On August 12, 2016, the Company discontinued its activities related to the electronic management and appointment of licensed producers in the insurance industry and commenced exploration of its new business by way of developing and launching a mobile device application (APP) that encourages community building centered around the use of a cloud-based APP. The concept for development of this APP surrounds the use of "Numbers 1-9" where products are expected to be customizable according to individual color preferences and suitable number combinations.  Concurrently with the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Choong Jeng Hew was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and sole Director and Chip Jin Eng was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer, treasurer and secretary. At this time, we do not have any written employment agreement or other formal compensation agreements with our new officers and director. Compensation arrangements are the subject of ongoing development and we will make appropriate additional disclosures as they are further developed and formalized.  Results of Operations  The following comparative analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative unaudited financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this report.  - 8 -  Revenue. The Company did not generate revenues during the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015.  Total Operating Expenses. For the three months ended November 30, 2016, the Company incurred operating expenses, in the amount of $17,611 compared to $20,750 for the three months ended November 30, 2015, a decrease of $3,139 or 15.1%. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in professional fees of $2,095 and a decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1,044.  Income from Discontinued Operations. On August 12, 2016, the Company discontinued activities related to the electronic management and appointment of licensed producers in the insurance industry. Accordingly, the operating results of this business been classified as discontinued operations in our statements of operations for all periods presented. During the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company generated $0 and $11,250 in revenues from a related party and incurred operating expenses of $0 and $5,812, and reflected income from discontinued operation of $0 and $5,438, respectively.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  Liquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of November 30, 2016, working capital deficit amounted to $16,319, an increase of $17,611 as compared to working capital of $1,292 as of August 31, 2016.

During the three months ended November 30, 2016, 57 Society, a company under the common control of Choong Jeng Hew, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, paid $14,925 of operating expenses on behalf of the Company. As of November 30. 2016 and August 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding payable to 57 Society in the amount of $18,906 and $3,981, respectively. The payable is unsecured, does not bear interest and is due on demand.  For the three months ended November 30, 2016, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $0 as compared to net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended November 30, 2015 of $13,682.  For the three months ended November 30, 2016, net cash flow provided by financing activities amounted to $0 as compared to net cash flow from financing activities for the three months ended November 30, 2015 of $9,331. During the three months ended November 30, 2015, we received proceeds from the sale of common stock of $10,750 and we repaid net related party advances of $1,419.  We do not have sufficient resources to effectuate all aspects of our business plan. We will have to raise additional funds to pay for all of our planned expenses. We potentially will have to issue additional debt or equity, or enter into a strategic arrangement with a third party to carry out some aspects of our business plan. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us. We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. Since we have no other such arrangements or plans currently in effect, our inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on our ability to remain a viable company. We are dependent upon our controlling shareholders to provide or loan us funds to meet our working capital needs.  Going Concern  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we had a net loss from continuing operations of $17,611 and $20,750 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The net cash used in operations was $0 for the three months ended November 30, 2016 and 57 Society, a company under the common control of Choong Jeng Hew, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, paid $9,930 of operating expenses and made $4,995 prepayment on behalf of the Company. Additionally, the Company discontinued its operating business and is seeking new business opportunities and acquisitions. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management cannot provide assurance that the Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. The Company is seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future. Although the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity, from related party working capital advances, and from the issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  - 9 -  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  Under SEC regulations, we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. As of November 30, 2016, we have no off-balance sheet arrangements.  Critical Accounting Estimates  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  Jan 12, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

integration solutions for third party resouces











Need to map data from your database to a third party?
We have an online solution


Data integration is one of the most costly and unproductive tasks we ask our IT departments to undertake.
Countless emails and phone calls from you to your vendor for a one-off data import or export leaves both sides frustrated because we all know that IT doesn't have any interest in actually talking with someone.
Imagine allowing a vendor to log onto your white labeled website, allowing them to pick the fields they require for the download, selecting the method in which they would like to receive that download, and then scheduling it.  Seem impossible?


It Isn't - Our web-based system allows all of this and more.

Data mapping tool - visually representation of your data online.
Foreign key relationship manager - allows you to get to the sub tables meta data.
Data table results - eliminated the call to IT for a listing based on critiera, define it yourself and go.



If you and your company would like to jump into the 22nd century and actually utilize one of your greatest assets, give us a call at 913.826.6888.

the Maximum Offering proceeds raised ($37,500), and the Maximum Offering 
proceeds raised of $75,000 through the offering. The costs associated with
operating as a public company are included in all our budgeted scenarios and
management is responsible for the preparation of the required documents to keep
the costs to a minimum.

Minimum Offering proceeds raised of $10,000 is budgeted to sustain operations
for a twelve-month period. The minimum amount is sufficient to keep the Company
current with its public listing status costs with prudently budgeted funds
remaining which will be sufficient to complete the development of our marketing
package. If the Company were to raise 50% of the Maximum Offering which is
$37,500 then we would be able to expand our marketing and sales package. Raising
the Maximum Offering of $75,000 will enable the Company to implement our full
business. If we begin to generate profits, we plan to increase our marketing and
sales activity accordingly. We anticipate starting generating profits
approximately nine months following closing of the offering.

eBizware intends to use the proceeds from this offering as follows:

Notes:

The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the proceeds of
this offering based on planned use of funds for the our operations and current
objectives.

The minimum amount of potential offering proceeds will be sufficient to continue
for 12 months given the projects in place and the expected revenues therefrom.

We currently consider the foregoing project our priority and intend to use the
proceeds from this offering for such projects.


eBizware has many potential competitors marketing to the Company’s industry. We
consider the competition is competent, experienced, and they have greater 
financial and marketing resources than we do at the present. Our ability to
compete effectively may be adversely affected by the ability of these
competitors to devote greater resources to the marketing of their products than
are available to us.

Some of our competitors in the industry also offer a wider range of products;
have greater name recognition and more extensive customer bases than our 
Company. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or 
changing opportunities and technology, undertake more extensive marketing
activities, and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than our Company. 
Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish
cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance
their visibility. The Company expects that new competitors or alliances among
competitors have the potential to emerge and may acquire significant market
share. Competition existing, and future competitors could result in an inability
to secure adequate customers and pay-per-employee numbers sufficient to support
eBizware’s endeavors. eBizware cannot be assured that it will be able to compete
successfully against present or future competitors or that the competitive
pressure it may face will not force it to cease operations. As a result, you may
never be able to liquidate or sell any shares you purchase in this offering.


Company Description
eBizware.com, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed on December 31, 2013. The
Company was formed to continue the development and distribution of a software
solution that provides visual online data resource for our customers to
integrate with third party implementations.

The exchange of data is


 a constant problem for most organizations no matter what
their size. eBizware began operations with the intent of providing customers
with middle-ware applications. Our tools allow for the customer to attach our
software to their resident database, no matter the manufacturer, via an online
connection string builder. Once the customer’s database is attached to the
eBizware tool, you have the ability, through our online resource, resident or on
one of our servers, to choose the data you would like to distribute and how you 
would like to distribute it. eBizware offers several standard delivery options,
the system can deliver a .csv file (comma separated value file), a txt file, web
service or API (application programming interface), all without any additional
programming or resources.

The system is currently operational and in production for two customers. We are
working towards the next release, which will include a complete Email
Notification Factory. The email factory will allow current customers the ability
to map the data from our production system and create bulk email notifications
from those results. The factory is in beta testing now and should be able to be
in production within the next 60 days.

The Company began generating revenue in September 2014 and has several options
to increase the revenue. Our revenue model is a subscription service, paid
monthly prior to the beginning of that month. Installation has occurred for the
customer Yoga Patch LLC at www.yogapatch.com as of January 1, 2015. First
quarter of 2015 will be used as a timeframe for data integration and testing.
Revenue will commence on April 1, 2015. Final terms have need been settled.
Currently, Yoga has moved all 3,080 customer files into production and has been
operating successfully since the January 1st date.

NOTE

–



ORGANIZATION
AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS




 

eBizware,
Inc. (the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of
Delaware on December 31, 2013 and established a fiscal year end of
August 31. The Company was engaged in the electronic management and
appointment of licensed producers in the insurance industry of the
United States.

 

On August
12, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in
the Company, Mark W. DeFoor (the “Seller”), the
Company’s former Chief Executive Officer and Director entered
into and closed on a Share Purchase Agreement (the
“Agreement”) with 57 Society International Limited,
(“57 Society”), a Hong Kong company, whereby 57 Society
purchased from the Seller a total of 5,000,000 shares of the
Company’s common stock. The Shares acquired represent
approximately 94.7% of the issued and outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company. Following the closing of the agreement, Mark
W. DeFoor resigned from all positions held of the Company and
Choong Jeng Hew was appointed as the Chief Executive Officer and
President of the Company.

 

On August
12, 2016, the Company discontinued its activities related to its
electronic management and appointment of licensed producers in the
insurance industry and commenced exploration of its new business
opportunities by way of developing and launching a mobile device
application (APP) that encourages community building centered
around the use of a cloud-based APP. The concept for development of
this APP surrounds the use of “Numbers 1-9” where
products are expected to be customizable according to individual
color preferences and suitable number combinations.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION, GOING CONCERN AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES




 

Basis of
Presentation and Discontinued Operations

 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and the rules and regulations
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

On August
12, 2016, in connection with the Agreement discussed in Note 1, the
Company discontinued activities related to the electronic
management and appointment of licensed producers in the insurance
industry. Accordingly, the operating results of this business been
classified as discontinued operations in our statements of
operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise indicated,
all disclosures and amounts in the notes to the financial
statements relate to the Company’s continuing
operations.

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations
of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information required to
be included in a complete set of financial statements in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. The results for the
three months period ended November 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending
August 31, 2017. The accompanying unaudited interim financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes included in the Company's 2016 Annual
Report filed with the SEC on December 15, 2016.

 

Going
concern

 

These
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other
things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of
liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the
accompanying financial statements, the Company had a net loss from
continuing operations of $17,611 during the three months ended
November 30, 2016. The Company had a working capital deficit in the
amount of $16,319 as of November 30, 2016. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as
a going concern. Management cannot provide assurance that the
Company will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become
cash flow positive, or raise additional debt and/or equity capital.
The Company is seeking to raise capital through additional debt
and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future.
Although the Company has historically raised capital from sales of
equity, from related party working capital advances, and from the
issuance of promissory notes, there is no assurance that it will be
able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise
additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future,
management expects that the Company will need to curtail its
operations. These financial statements do not include any
adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going
concern.

MANAGEMENT’S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS




 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May
Affect Future Results

 

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“SEC”) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking
information so that investors can better understand a
company’s future prospects and make informed investment
decisions. This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other written and
oral statements that we make from time to time contain such
forward-looking statements that set out anticipated results based
on management’s plans and assumptions regarding future events
or performance. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such
statements by using words such as “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “expect,”
“project,” “intend,” “plan,”
“believe,” “will” and similar expressions
in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial
performance. In particular, these include statements relating to
future actions, future performance or results of current and
anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies,
such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Factors that
could cause our actual results of operations and financial
condition to differ materially are set forth in the “Risk
Factors” section of our annual report on Form 10-K as filed
with the SEC on December 15, 2016, as the same may be updated from
time to time in documents that we file with the SEC.

 

We
caution that these factors could cause our actual results of
operations and financial condition to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that
investors should not place undue reliance on any such
forward-looking statements. Further, any forward-looking statement
speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we
undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to
reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such
statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or
unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time
to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such
factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor
on our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or
combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in any forward-looking
statements.

 

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our
unaudited financial statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.

 

Company
Overview

 

eBizware.com,
Inc. (the “Company”), a Delaware corporation, was
formed on December 31, 2013. The Company is headquartered at Unit
B19, 9/F, Efficiency House, 35 Tai Yau Street, San Po Kong,
Kowloon, Hong Kong. The Company was formed to continue the
development and distribution of a software solution that provides
visual online data resource for our customers to integrate with
third party implementations.

 

On August
12, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest in
our company, Mark W. DeFoor the Company’s former Chief
Executive Officer and Director entered into and closed on that
certain Share Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) with
57 Society, whereby 57 Society purchased from Mr. DeFoor a total of
5,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock (the
“Shares”) for an aggregate price of $321,000. The
Shares acquired represented approximately 94.7% of the issued and
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company.

 

On August
12, 2016, the Company discontinued its activities related to the
electronic management and appointment of licensed producers in the
insurance industry and commenced exploration of its new business by
way of developing and launching a mobile device application (APP)
that encourages community building centered around the use of a
cloud-based APP. The concept for development of this APP surrounds
the use of “Numbers 1-9” where products are expected to
be customizable according to individual color preferences and
suitable number combinations.

 

Concurrently
with the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Choong Jeng Hew
was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and sole Director and
Chip Jin Eng was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer,
treasurer and secretary. At this time, we do not have any written
employment agreement or other formal compensation agreements with
our new officers and director. Compensation arrangements are the
subject of ongoing development and we will make appropriate
additional disclosures as they are further developed and
formalized.
