About Timothy

Tim Clackson is President of Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer at ARIAD Pharmaceuticals Inc., an integrated oncology company headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Lausanne, Switzerland. During his 20 year career at ARIAD, Dr. Clackson has held a series of increasingly senior positions, including CSO since 2003 and President of R&D since 2010. Dr. Clackson has overall operational and strategic responsibility for R&D at ARIAD, including drug discovery, preclinical and translational research, clinical development, and manufacturing and technical operations. He led the multi-disciplinary R&D team that discovered and developed Iclusig (ponatinib), a pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of resistant CML and Ph+ALL; and investigational agents brigatinib, an ALK inhibitor; ridaforolimus, an mTOR inhibitor licensed to Medinol Ltd.; and AP1903, a small molecule regulator for cancer cell therapy licensed to Bellicum Pharmaceuticals. From 1991 to 1994, Dr. Clackson was a postdoctoral fellow at Genentech Inc., where his studies on growth hormone receptor defined the now-established “hot spot” paradigm for how proteins interact.  Dr. Clackson received his Ph.D. in Biology from Cambridge University in 1991, for research conducted under Dr Greg Winter, FRS at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology into antibody engineering and the development of antibody phage display technology, subsequently commercialized by Cambridge Antibody Technology. He received his B.A. degree in Biochemistry from Oxford University in 1987.

ARIAD Names Timothy P. Clackson To New Position Of President Of Research And Development






Business Wire




Jun 23, 2010 7:35 AM EDT













 


















































  ARIAD also announced three important additional promotions and new positions today:   Frank G. Haluska, M.D., Ph.D. has been named Vice President, Clinical Research and Development and Chief Medical Officer, reporting to Dr. Clackson. Dr. Haluska has been with ARIAD for nearly three years and has led ARIAD’s clinical affairs group. He has contributed to all of the company’s medical programs, including leadership of the ongoing clinical trial of ARIAD’s investigational pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor, AP24534. Prior to joining ARIAD, Dr. Haluska held senior academic positions at Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He will oversee the pivotal trial of AP24534 in patients with resistant and refractory chronic myeloid leukemia, which is scheduled to begin patient enrollment in the second half of this year.  Edward M. Fitzgerald has been promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reporting to Dr. Berger. Mr. Fitzgerald has been with ARIAD for more than eight years and has led the business and finance functions of the Company. His new role will include oversight of ARIAD’s commercial operations.  Pierre F. Dodion, M.D., M.B.A. will move into the newly created position of Senior Vice President, Corporate Development, reporting to Dr. Berger. Dr. Dodion has been with ARIAD for more than three years, most recently heading clinical development and medical affairs, and he will now be responsible for leading business development and corporate strategy for ARIAD. His initial focus will be on partnering AP24534 consistent with ARIAD’s strategy of becoming a fully integrated oncology company.  About ARIAD  ARIAD’s vision is to transform the lives of cancer patients with breakthrough medicines. The Company’s mission is to discover, develop and commercialize small-molecule drugs to treat cancer in patients with the greatest and most urgent unmet medical need – aggressive cancers where current therapies are inadequate. ARIAD’s lead product candidate, ridaforolimus, is an investigational mTOR inhibitor being developed by Merck Sharpe & Dohme Corp. and is in Phase 3 clinical development in patients with advanced sarcomas. ARIAD’s second internally discovered product candidate, AP24534, is an investigational pan-BCR-ABL inhibitor completing Phase 1 clinical development in patients with hematological cancers, notably chronic myeloid leukemia.
