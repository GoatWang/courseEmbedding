Eric L. Mattson and James W. Harris: Lit. Rel. No. 17126 / September 12, 2001















Home | Previous Page





























SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
Washington, D.C.
Litigation Release No.  17126 \ September 12, 2001

Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1445 / September 12, 2001

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. ERIC L. MATTSON AND JAMES W. HARRIS, Civil Action No. H-01-3106 (S.D. Tex.)(filed September 11, 2001)

SEC SUES BAKER HUGHES INCORPORATED'S FORMER 
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AND CONTROLLER FOR 
AUTHORIZING THE PAYMENT OF A BRIBE
On September 11, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, against Eric L. Mattson ("Mattson"), the former Chief Financial Officer of Baker Hughes Incorporated ("Baker Hughes"), and James W. Harris ("Harris"), Baker Hughes' former Controller.  The Commission's complaint alleges that Mattson and Harris authorized the payment of a bribe of $75,000, through KPMG-Siddharta Siddharta & Harsono ("KPMG-SSH"), Baker Hughes' agent and accountant in Indonesia, to a local government official in Indonesia.  Mattson and Harris directed that this payment be made while knowing that KPMG-SSH would pass all or part of the payment along to an Indonesian tax official for the purpose of influencing him to reduce a tax assessment from $3.2 million to $270,000 for PT Eastman Christensen ("PTEC"), an Indonesian company beneficially owned by Baker Hughes.  This improper payment was authorized in violation of the antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA")  

The complaint alleges that on March 9, 1999, Harris was told that an Indonesian tax official was demanding a $75,000 payment, in exchange for which he would reduce PTEC's tax assessment.  Harris learned that KPMG-SSH had offered to make the improper payment on PTEC's behalf using PTEC's funds, and then issue an inflated invoice that would conceal the payment.  The complaint further alleges that Baker Hughes' FCPA advisor advised Harris that any such payment to an Indonesian tax official would violate the FCPA.  On March 10, 1999, Harris told Baker Hughes' General Counsel and Mattson of the Indonesian tax official's demand for an improper payment.  During this meeting, the General Counsel stated that the Indonesian tax official's demands raised FCPA concerns and under no circumstances should Harris or Mattson enter into any transaction that could potentially violate the FCPA.  On the evening of March 10, 1999, disregarding the FCPA advisor's instructions, and acting contrary to the advice of the General Counsel, defendants Mattson and Harris authorized the payment of the bribe to the Indonesian tax official.  The complaint alleges that Mattson and Harris violated Sections 30A(a) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Exchange Act Rule 13b2-1 promulgated thereunder and aided and abetted Baker Hughes' violations of the books and records and internal controls provisions of the Exchange Act, Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B).  

    Also on September 11, 2001, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice filed a joint civil injunctive action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, against KPMG-SSH and Sonny Harsono, a partner of KPMG-SSH, for their part in the payment of the bribe to the Indonesian tax official.  This is the first time that the Commission and the Department of Justice, both of which have jurisdiction over the antibribery provisions of the FCPA, have combined to file a joint civil action.  Without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint, the defendants have consented to the entry of a Final Judgment that permanently enjoins both defendants from violating and aiding and abetting the violation of the antibribery provisions of the FCPA and the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") (Sections 104A(a)(1), (2) and (3) of the FCPA and Sections 30A(a)(1), (2) and (3), 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).  See Litigation Release No. 17127 (September 12, 2001).  

  Finally, in a related action, the Commission also instituted, on September 12, 2001, a settled administrative proceeding against Baker Hughes.  The Commission's Order finds that, in March 1999, Baker Hughes' CFO and its Controller authorized the above-described illegal payment, through KPMG-SSH, its agent in Indonesia, to a local government official in Indonesia.  The Order also finds that in 1998 and 1995, senior managers at Baker Hughes authorized payments to Baker Hughes' agents in India and Brazil, respectively, without making an adequate inquiry as to whether the agents might give all or part of the payments to foreign government officials in violation of the FCPA.  Without admitting or denying the Commission's findings, Baker Hughes consented to the entry of the Commission's Order.  The Order directs that Baker Hughes cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of the internal controls and books and records provisions of the Exchange Act (Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and Section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act).  See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 44784 (September 12, 2001); Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release No. 1447.

  The Commission wishes to thank the United States Department of Justice for its assistance in this matter.

	Indonesian tax official representing the Directorate General
	








Facts:
      


	On March 9, 1999, James W. Harris, a former Controller of Baker Hughes Incorporated ("Baker Hughes"), allegedly learned that an Indonesian tax official would reduce a tax assessment for PT Eastman Christensen ("PTEC"), an Indonesian company beneficially owned by Baker Hughes, from $3.2 million to $270,000 in exchange for payment of $75,000.  KPMG Siddharta Siddharta & Harsono ("KPMG-SSH"), Baker Hughes's accountant in Indonesia, offered to make the payment using PTEC's funds and then issue an inflated invoice that would conceal the payment.  On March 10, 1999, Harris allegedly told Baker Hughes's General Counsel and Eric L. Mattson, former CFO of Baker Hughes, of the Indonesian tax official's demand.  On March 10, 1999, Harris and Mattson allegedly authorized payment of the bribe despite the General Counsel's warning that such conduct would violate the FCPA.  After receiving the invoice, PTEC allegedly paid KPMG-SSH $143,000 and improperly recorded the transaction as payment for professional services rendered.  On March 23, 1999, PTEC received a tax assessment of approximately $270,000 from the Indonesian government, almost $3 million lower than the original assessment.  After Baker Hughes's General Counsel and FCPA Advisor discovered the subject payment, Baker Hughes: (a) attempted to stop the payment to KPMG-SSH; (b) voluntarily and promptly disclosed the alleged misconduct to the S.E.C. and D.O.J.; and (c) instructed KPMG-SSH not to make the payment to the Indonesian tax official and to return the entire amount paid to KPMG-SSH.  On September 9, 2002, the district court dismissed the Commission's antibribery claim.  On January 28, 2003, the court dismissed the remaining books and records and internal controls claims with prejudice and rendered its "final judgment."  The Commission appealed dismissal of the antibribery claim.  On July 14, 2008, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the Commission's appeal and litigation in this matter concluded.
