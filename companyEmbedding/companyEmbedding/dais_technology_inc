The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

Dais Signs Agreement with Leading Provider of Advanced Solutions for Contaminated Water Treatment in China

ODESSA, FL--(Marketwired - Apr 25, 2017) -  Dais Analytic Corporation (OTCQB: DLYT), a commercial nanotechnology materials business selling its industry-changing nanomaterial technology into the worldwide water, air and energy markets, announced today that it has entered into a three-year Cooperation Agreement with Beijing Geoenviron Engineering and Technology, Inc. (XSHG: 603588), a leader in providing advanced pollution prevention and treatment solutions in Mainland China, to distribute Dais' NanoClear™ products for the treatment of aggressively contaminated industrial wastewater. 
Under the Agreement, BGE will use its well-established sales organization and distribution channels to actively promote and sell NanoClear™ membrane evaporators to treat wastewater in the petrochemical and electric power industries in Mainland China. BGE will establish a pilot project that will serve as an integral part of BGE's marketing strategy for NanoClear and then purchase a minimum of sixteen systems during the three-year term of the Agreement. BGE will purchase membrane evaporators from Dais and design, procure and buildout the balance of the water pollution treatment systems with Dais providing guidance and support for NanoClear portion of the system.
"The water resources of China are affected by water shortages and water pollution," commented Tim Tangredi, Dais's CEO. "China has 20% of the world's population but only 7% of the world's water supply with a large portion of the available drinking water showing signs of contamination. A growing population, and continued economic development coupled with newer regulatory environmental requirements create a steep demand for products offering solutions to improve water quality and supplies." 
Mr. Tangredi went on to say, "Entering into this Cooperation Agreement with BGE is a significant milestone for our Company. Their vision led them to Dais and Dais's innovative NanoClear™ product powered by our proprietary Aqualyte™ nanomaterial." 
"Advanced industrial wastewater technologies are in great demand in China as the country takes on the challenge of addressing its water crisis," said Mr. Miller Ma, BGE's General Manager and Chief Engineer. "Dais's cutting-edge Aqualyte™ nanomaterial technology lets sophisticated science do the work of cleaning aggressively contaminated industrial waste water rather than traditional contaminated water cleaning products. We are excited to be launching a cooperation with Dais in China this year."
About Dais Analytic Corporation
Dais Analytic Corporation (OTCQB: DLYT) is a nanotechnology business producing a versatile family of membrane materials -- called Aqualyte -- focusing on evolutionary or disruptive air, energy and water applications. The uses include:

NanoClear™, a commercialized system treating contaminated water (notably most all forms of industrial waste), to provide pure potable water;
            
ConsERV™, a commercially available engineered energy recovery ventilator (an HVAC product) useful for efficient management of ventilation air's temperature and moisture content using the energy found in the outgoing 'stale' air stream to pre-condition the incoming fresh air often saving energy, CO2, and allowing for equipment downsizing;
            
NanoAir™, an early beta-stage water-based, no fluorocarbon producing refrigerant cooling cycle which can replace the existing gas based compression cooling cycle in most all forms of air-conditioning and refrigeration saving a projected 50% in energy and CO2.

Each use demonstrates the diversity of Dais' core product -- Aqualyte™ -- the family of nano-structured polymers and engineered processes having a focus on minimizing consumption of irreplaceable natural resources, and ending the degradation of our environment.

Dais to provide industrial wastewater treatment in China








































ODESSA, FL, APRIL 25, 2017 -- Dais Analytic Corporation (OTCQB: DLYT), a commercial nanotechnology materials business selling its industry-changing nanomaterial technology into the worldwide water, air and energy markets, announced today that it has entered into a three-year Cooperation Agreement with Beijing Geoenviron Engineering and Technology, Inc. (XSHG: 603588), a leader in providing advanced pollution prevention and treatment solutions in Mainland China, to distribute Dais' NanoClear™ products for the treatment of aggressively contaminated industrial wastewater.
 
 
Under the Agreement, BGE will use its well-established sales organization and distribution channels to actively promote and sell NanoClear™ membrane evaporators to treat wastewater in the petrochemical and electric power industries in Mainland China. BGE will establish a pilot project that will serve as an integral part of BGE's marketing strategy for NanoClear and then purchase a minimum of sixteen systems during the three-year term of the Agreement. BGE will purchase membrane evaporators from Dais and design, procure and buildout the balance of the water pollution treatment systems with Dais providing guidance and support for NanoClear portion of the system.[Native Advertisement]
 
"The water resources of China are affected by water shortages and water pollution," commented Tim Tangredi, Dais's CEO. "China has 20% of the world's population but only 7% of the world's water supply with a large portion of the available drinking water showing signs of contamination. A growing population, and continued economic development coupled with newer regulatory environmental requirements create a steep demand for products offering solutions to improve water quality and supplies."
 
Mr. Tangredi went on to say, "Entering into this Cooperation Agreement with BGE is a significant milestone for our Company. Their vision led them to Dais and Dais's innovative NanoClear™ product powered by our proprietary Aqualyte™ nanomaterial." 
 
"Advanced industrial wastewater technologies are in great demand in China as the country takes on the challenge of addressing its water crisis," said Mr. Miller Ma, BGE's General Manager and Chief Engineer. "Dais's cutting-edge Aqualyte™ nanomaterial technology lets sophisticated science do the work of cleaning aggressively contaminated industrial waste water rather than traditional contaminated water cleaning products. We are excited to be launching a cooperation with Dais in China this year."
 
About Dais Analytic Corporation Dais Analytic Corporation (OTCQB: DLYT) is a nanotechnology business producing a versatile family of membrane materials -- called Aqualyte -- focusing on evolutionary or disruptive air, energy and water applications. The uses in clude:NanoClear™, a commercialized system treating contaminated water (notably most all forms of industrial waste), to provide pure potable water; ConsERV™, a commercially available engineered energy recovery ventilator (an HVAC product) useful for efficient management of ventilation air's temperature and moisture content using the energy found in the outgoing 'stale' air stream to pre-condition the incoming fresh air often saving energy, CO2, and allowing for equipment downsizing; NanoAir™, an early beta-stage water-based, no fluorocarbon producing refrigerant cooling cycle which can replace the existing gas based compression cooling cycle in most all forms of air-conditioning and refrigeration saving a projected 50% in energy and CO2. Each use demonstrates the diversity of Dais' core product -- Aqualyte™ -- the family of nano-structured polymers and engineered processes having a focus on minimizing consumption of irreplaceable natural resources, and ending the degradation of our environment.
