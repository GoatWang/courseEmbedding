SAMPLE LEGAL CASES

Bard v. Lord... Lord contends that the court erred in using Department of Labor statistics in imputing income
 to him for the purpose of determining his child support obligation. ... [¶ 7] Lord contends only that
 the court erred in relying on Department of Labor statistics in imputing income to him. ...

 claim, can a plaintiff suing for negligence recover damages under Maine law for purely economic
 harm absent personal injury, physical harm to property, or misrepresentation?". ...
