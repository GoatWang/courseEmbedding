Phone Number: (800) 784-1009 | Email Address: support@lizbramletconsulting.com
 




























Understanding the Implications of Using LIHTC in a PBRA RAD Conversion
$229.00





Tuesday, May 16, 2017 
 
1:00 – 4:00 PM Eastern Time, including a 15-Minute Break
 
$229.00; $200 per person when you register at least 2 people at the same time
 
There is much to understand whenever a developer utilizes multiple programs to create affordable housing. It is especially so when an owner converts public housing units to project-based Section 8 rental assistance through the RAD program. In addition to comprehending HUD’s requirements for converting a project through RAD, an owner must understand the complications involved when converting a project while meeting the requirements of Section 8, the compliance regulations for the IRS, plus meeting the credit delivery schedule for the LIHTC invvestors.  Both the developer and property manager need to be able to meet their LIHTC requirements if the conversion is to be a success.
 
Understanding the Implications of Using LIHTC in a RAD PBRA Conversion is an advanced level class. It is assumed a participant has a strong understanding of the workings of the LIHTC program.
 
Note: This class does not address a PHA converting public housing to a project-based voucher (PBV).
 
Each paid registrant will receive the information they need to access the training the day before the webinar. They also receive a PDF of the slide show that guides the presentation. Many people elect to print the copy of the presentation to use for note taking during the class.
 
Each paid registrant will receive a link by email allowing them access to the recorded version of this webinar through the end of calendar year 2017.
 
Each paid registrant who attends and participates in the webinar will receive a certificate of participation.
 
Questions are encouraged throughout the class.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
