From the cinema to your living room, Dolby has transformed the entertainment experience. Today, Dolby technologies can be found in cinemas, professional recording studios, video games, laser discs, DVDs, mobile media, digital broadcast TV, digital cable, and satellite systems

FOUNDERRay Dolby: Inventing the
Future of Entertainment










It's the rare person who can travel between the artistic and scientific worlds with ease. Ray Dolby connected the two with inventions that expanded the creative possibilities for musicians, filmmakers, and other artists. 












Ray Dolby: The Artist’s Inventor



























The Power of Sound
When Ray Dolby founded Dolby Laboratories in 1965, movies and television featured only one channel of sound, and record producers were limited to a handful of audio tracks. Much of what happened since then to improve the sound of entertainment can be traced to the efforts of Ray Dolby—not just his technical innovations but the impact they had on artists.
"Dolby's work changed the way movies were made," said director Philip Kaufman, "because sound became a powerful artistic element, and you could do things with sound that had never been done before."
A Sense of Uncertainty
Ray Dolby was born in Portland, Oregon, in 1933 and later moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. From 1949 to 1957, he worked on various audio and instrumentation projects at Ampex Corporation, where he led the development of the electronic aspects of the Ampex® videotape recording system. In 1957, he graduated from Stanford University and left for England on a Marshall Scholarship to continue his studies at Cambridge University. He received a PhD in physics from Cambridge in 1961.
Dolby had a desire to explore the unknown, a quality he shared with the artists who would later embrace his technologies.
