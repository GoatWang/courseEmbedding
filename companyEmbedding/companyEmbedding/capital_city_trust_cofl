Individual/Family Services




Capital City Trust Company focuses on several key areas:






            Trusts, guardianships and estates
            



            Wealth management, including Investment Management Accounts
            



            Real Estate management
            



            Personal administrative services
            



            Private banking
            



            Insurance reviews



        Our clients trust us to handle the details so they’re free to enjoy life. Here’s what stands out when they talk about us:
        

Forms, forms and more forms. When you are making a transaction, sometimes details can fall through the cracks, which  can mean the difference between an asset transferring seamlessly or triggering probate, paperwork, legal fees and tax consequences. Not to mention anguish for the family. You may not understand what each document does, but we do. And we know every slip of paper needed for effective estate planning.
        

Corporate Trustee: Your plans carried out. Many of our clients ask, “Why should I name a corporate trustee instead of a family member or friend?” We’ve all heard the stories: name a child as a trustee and there are going to be hard feelings. No matter what – someone is going to be accused of favoritism.
        

        As your corporate trustee, we act as a referee – an extension of the family who can respond objectively, keeping other relationships intact. When there is a question that is not answered easily by the administrative documents, we have a committee of professionals who can review the language and determine the best course of action.
        

Personalized Money Management. If you don’t want to manage your investments, we can do that for you, even without a trust. We’ll help you figure out your risk tolerance, build a plan and create an investment policy statement. You will still have discretionary control and be reassured knowing everything is managed in-house.
        

        You can be confident our team of professionals offer proven, effective solutions for your trust and money management needs. We are here to help when you need us.

FAQ

       Superior investment strategies, asset protection and estate planning are just a few ways we make it easier for you to enjoy life. We’ve answered a few of the more common questions here. If something isn’t covered, please contact us and we’ll get it answered.
    




        
    


Do I need a trust to use your investment services?


        No. Many of our clients choose trust arrangements because of the unique advantages they offer, but you are not required to create a trust. If you prefer, we can work together on an investment management basis only. We’ll create a simple letter of instructions stating that you are designating Capital City Trust Company to act as your investment agent.
        



What are the advantages of a trust?


        With a trust you can not only draw on our broad investment capabilities but also arrange to have us perform any number of other personalized services. These services could range from making payments of estimated taxes while you're traveling abroad to providing full personal financial management if you are unable to do it yourself due to serious illness or other life event. Also, you can name one or more beneficiaries to receive the assets of your trust at your death, which provides tremendous advantages, including avoiding probate. Or, you can have your trust continue beyond your lifetime, serving as a source of continuing income and support for your spouse, a child or others you designate.
    



Is it difficult to set up a trust?


       Not at all – it can be done in just two steps. First, you transfer the securities and/or deposits to Capital City Trust Company for management and oversight. Then you give us your written instructions in the form of a trust agreement. The agreement – drawn up by an attorney – is signed by you (as creator of the trust) and by Capital City Trust Company (as trustee). These are often called “living trusts” to distinguish them from testamentary trusts (those established under the terms of a will). Living trusts created for the purpose of personal asset management are also known as “revocable trusts,” because the person who creates the trust reserves the right to cancel or revoke it.
    



If I create a trust, can I keep control?


       Yes. You are assured of this in three ways according to what the trust agreement specifies:
    


        That you can make withdrawals (or additions) at any time.
      

        That you reserve the right to cancel the trust.
      

        That you reserve the right to give us new or different instructions by amending the trust agreement.
      




 Can I make the investment decisions?


       Some of our clients like to take active participation, such as selecting particular stocks or bonds. However, most of our clients value our unbiased approach to portfolio management because they lack the time or specialized knowledge that it requires. Still, you can delegate as much or as little investment responsibility as you want. It’s your trust.
    

       There are also hybrid approaches:
    


        You might spell out your goals and requirements in some detail, then leave the selection of specific investments to us as trustee.
      

        You could ask us to submit each proposed investment change for your approval until you're satisfied that we're interpreting your wishes accurately.
      

        You might ask us to submit recommendations while also researching some opportunities on your own.
      


       With a trust, you make the rules.
    



Are trusts expensive?


       No. Our fees are competitive with those charged by investment advisory firms (although theirs may not include custodianship of securities, recordkeeping and other conveniences that we offer) or mutual funds.  
    



How big must a trust fund be?


       If you think “millions of dollars” when you hear the word “trust,” you're the victim of a common misconception. Today's trust institutions have developed ways to handle even relatively small trusts efficiently. In any case, we don't think in terms of fixed minimums. Instead we ask ourselves, "Is a trust the best way to meet this client's financial management needs?"
    

       To find out whether a trust would be right for you, please contact us and we’ll explore your options.
    



How much of a return will I get on my money?


       That depends on your goals—current income, long-term growth to offset inflation or some balance of the two—and on ever-changing investment conditions.
    

       Over roughly the past 85 years, diversified portfolios of good-quality stocks have produced an average total annual return (dividends plus growth in principal value) around 9.8%. Bonds have produced somewhat lower returns overall, but they sometimes offer a higher level of current income than stocks.
    

       Although past performance is no guarantee of future results, our goal as trustee is to provide reasonably consistent returns over the years. We emphasize careful asset allocation, the selection of quality investments and constant vigilance.
    



Who should be the trustee of my trust?


       Experience is the most important criteria. You should look for a person or financial organization, such as Capital City Trust Company, with experience in a variety of market changes and handling diverse family needs. You want the type of experience that will provide the greatest financial security for you and your family. Your trustee should have financial strength as well as professional investment capabilities. The trustee should participate in the financial markets every day, ideally with trusteeship being considered a full-time job.
    



How can I find out more about trusts?


       That's easy. Our trust and investment professionals can provide a more personal introduction to trusts after hearing more about your individual circumstances. Please contact us and we’ll be happy to arrange a phone call or in-person consultation.

Our Legacy

        Capital City Trust Company has served as a “fiduciary” for more than 50 years, which simply means our number one responsibility is representing your best interests.
        





Trust companies were created because people needed someone they could trust to act on their behalf – if and when they needed it. That’s our lineage, our roots. A wholly-owned subsidiary of Capital City Bank Group, we have stayed true to our community banking roots and pride ourselves on our client-centric approach.


        Our business model has always been to put you first. That means there’s no conflict of interest on the buying and selling of your investments. We’re on your side of the table.
        

        What sets us apart from other trust companies?
        

Name recognition – yours. We have a toll-free number, but don’t expect call center treatment. Our clients know us and we know them. We take your money matters personally.
        

Stability. Something about the financial services business causes high turnover. Not at Capital City Trust Company. We have unusually low turnover and the greatest stability where it counts.
        

Team. Choosing Capital City Trust Company means you have a team of experts working together to meet your goals. This structure ensures there is always someone who knows you by name and can access your files in the event your personal account administrator is unavailable. Your team also includes a hands-on money manager so less is lost in translation.
        

Performance. Ask us about our track record. We practice prudence in decision-making, so even in the toughest economic times, we successfully limit our clients’ exposure.
        

Community Commitment. Our commitment to community service is as essential to us as our client relationships. We believe in building strong foundations for the future of our communities, and associate volunteerism is a hallmark of our corporate culture. In addition to support offered through the Capital City Bank Group Foundation, every associate volunteers a minimum of 10 hours annually. That’s a lot of giving back, and we consider it our best investment ever.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards.

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

Inheritance and estate planning is a very complicated legal procedure. Laws vary from state to state, notwithstanding any specific federal tax implications. Having a valid will in place helps to avoid problems typically associated with probate. There are a number of other methods available to minimize the financial obligations you might incur through an inheritance.
If you are seeking legal help regarding financial planning for the future, contact an estate planning lawyer in your area today. An estate is the entirety of a property, real and personal, owned by an individual prior to distribution through a trust or will.
Estate planning is the process by which an individual, or nuclear family with the person's consent and approval, arranges the transfer of assets to heirs or other beneficiaries. The reason for this is to provide the family, or anonymous miscellaneous beneficiaries, with legal rights to the property after the individual has passed away.
Aspects of estate planning include: Trusts, Wills, Uniform Probate Code, Gift Tax, Dynasty Trust and Joint Tenancy
A good estate planning lawyer can do more than just manufacture a simple will. Estate planning also typically minimizes potential taxes and fees, and sets up contingency planning to make sure that your wishes regarding which items are allocated and who the main beneficiaries are.
Many trusts are created as an alternative to or in conjunction with a will and other elements of estate planning. State law establishes the framework for determining the validity and limits for both.
An estate planning lawyer can assist you with organizing your personal and business records such as: Brokerage Accounts, Retirement Plans, Savings and Checking Accounts, Insurance Policies, Business and Partnership Interests and Debt Personal Property. An Estate Planner can also assist all other possible estate planning law concerns.
