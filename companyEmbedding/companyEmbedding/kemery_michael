Utilization of interactive device-adjacent ambiently displayed images



Patent number:  8451192
                                            

Abstract:  A telecommunication device configured to project an ambiently displayed image at a location proximate to the telecommunication device on a surface that is substantially parallel to a plane formed by a body of the telecommunication device is described herein. The telecommunication device is further configured to detect an interaction with the ambiently displayed image and perform an action based on the detected interaction.

Shareable Applications On Telecommunications Devices



Publication number:  20110044438
                                            

Abstract:  During voice communication between multiple telecommunications devices, a shareable application facilitates concurrent sharing of data and processes between the devices. The application may be configured to monitor the voice communication and execute a predetermined function upon detecting a predetermined condition in the voice communication. The application may further facilitate sharing of functionality and user interface displays during the voice communication. In some implementations, a server computing device on a communications network may facilitate functions of shareable applications on one or more telecommunications devices.

Hand weight with contoured opposing weight protrusions



Patent number:  7494452
                                            

Abstract:  A hand weight with a central grip area and contoured opposing weight portions at the ends so as to convey a “Z”-shaped profile. The asymmetry of the hand weight results in a shape that is more open to accommodate a larger range of hand sizes and to more comfortably fit into the hand for a variety of holds. The shape of the end portions also results in an overall shape that is less obstructive of movements since it has a narrower profile when rotated appropriately. One of the ends is configured with a flat section to enable the weight to be positively and stably set on a flat surface and prevent rolling.

Inflatable Structure and Method of Manufacture



Publication number:  20070069419
                                            

Abstract:  A method of thermoforming an inflatable structure of dissimilar materials includes the steps of providing a first sheet formed of a first material and a second sheet formed of a second material different than the first material, the second sheet being spaced from the first sheet, and a valve being positioned between the first and second sheets; heating the first and second sheets to a temperature above their glass transition temperature and below their melting point; bonding the first and second sheets together in a mold having an opposed pair of cavities to form an inflatable structure having a seal around a periphery thereof, the valve extending through the seal and being in fluid communication with an interior and exterior of the inflatable structure; and trimming excess material from the periphery of the inflatable structure.

Glove with multi-element dorsal stiffeners



Publication number:  20070022512
                                            

Abstract:  A glove includes two “H” shaped stiffening battens on a dorsal side. The battens terminate on a proximal side of the second through fifth fingers, and are formed from a non-rigid material. A one-piece protective panel is attached to the palmar side of the glove. The protective panel covers portions of the wearing hand palm corresponding to the distal ends of the second through fifth metacarpal bones, as well as palmar side portions of the second through fifth digits corresponding to the second through fifth proximal phalanx bones. Flex notch cut-outs in the protective panel correspond to portions of the palmar region which tend to bunch during gripping of a bar or other object and help prevent discomfort during such gripping.
