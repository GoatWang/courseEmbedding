Possibilities. Turning seawater into drinking water. Reinforcing genetic analysis for medical breakthroughs.
    Furthering the evolution of next-generation eco-cars. Producing functional wear that is plant-based and environmentally friendly.
Extending the shelf life of food for reduced waste in the world. Creating a world where everyone can achieve their personal best.
Materials have the power to do all of this and more. Because materials make our modern world.
The world is full of possibilities. And we will never stop believing.

Business Characteristics We Favor


 


Free cash flow generation


 


Sustainable competitive advantage


 


High returns on capital


 


Capital allocation discipline


Our Portfolios
Our portfolios are prudently diversified, usually holding  25-40 stocks. Limits on the weight of individual investment positions and  economic sector exposure are used to avoid excessive concentration.


Sell Discipline
Positions are reduced or sold if:


 


A superior investment opportunity is identified


 


The original investment thesis changes


 


The investment has become significantly overvalued

Performance data is based upon past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Please call 800.626.9769 to obtain performance data as of the most recent month-end.

2The S&P 500 Index is a widely recognized unmanaged index of equity prices and is representative of a broader market and range of securities than is found in the Fund's portfolio.

30-DAY SEC YIELD

The 30-Day SEC Yield is computed in accordance with a standardized method prescribed by rules of the SEC. The 30-day SEC Yield is computed by dividing the fund's investment income per share earned during a particular 30-day base period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the base period, and then annualizing the result. The 30-day SEC Yield is calculated at each month end and updated within the first ten business days of the following month. These yields reflect the reimbursements or waivers of certain expense. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed, the yields would have been lower.            

12-MONTH DISTRIBUTION YIELD

The 12-Month distribution yield is calculated by taking the sum of all distributions occurring over the previous twelve calendar months and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The distribution yield represents a 12-month historical distribution and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. For Funds that have been in operation for less than one year, an annualized distribution yield is calculated by annualizing the Fund's historical distributions to date and dividing the result by the Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) as of the date of the previous month-end. The annualized distribution yield represents an estimated 12-month distribution from the Fund based on the limited distribution history of the Fund to date and does not represent the total return of the Fund and is not necessarily an indication of future distributions or yield. Past performance does not guarantee future results.            

FUND PERFORMANCE

*Expense ratios are as-of the most recent prospectus. Contractual arrangements have been made with the fund’s investment manager, Transamerica Asset Management, Inc. (“TAM”), through March 1, 2017.  **Reflects average annual returns.

The Class I shares are using performance history from The Torray Resolute Fund which commenced operations December 31, 2010.

Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Net Asset Value (NAV) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. If a sales charge had been deducted, the results would have been lower. Public Offering Price (POP) returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, and reflect the maximum sales charge. Maximum sales charge for Class A shares is 5.50%. Purchases of Class C Shares are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge if redeemed during the first 12 months of purchase. There are no sales charges on Class I shares.

RISK MEASURES

Standard Deviation is a statistical measurement that helps to gauge the fund's historical volatility.

The Russell 1000® Growth Index is an unmanaged index used as a general measure of market performance. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. Calculations assume dividends and capital gains are reinvested and do not include any managerial expenses.

Growth stocks may be particularly susceptible to larger price swings or to adverse developments. Growth stocks as a group may be out of favor and underperform the overall equity market for a long period of time, for example, while the market favors “value” stocks. The fund may be more concentrated than that of a more diversified fund, subjecting it to greater fluctuation and risk.Shares may be sold (or “redeemed”) on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Proceeds from the redemption of shares will usually be sent to the redeeming shareholder within three business days after receipt in good order of a request for redemption. However, Transamerica Funds has the right to take up to seven days to pay redemption proceeds, and may postpone payment under certain circumstances, as authorized by law.Due to rounding, not all of the percentages will equal 100%.Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal.
