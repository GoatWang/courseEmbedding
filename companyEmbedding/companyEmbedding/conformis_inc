One Patient. One Implant.
ConforMIS does something that we believe no other knee replacement company does – we design and manufacture customized knee implants, both the femur and tibia, for each patient. No two are alike. Our femoral and tibial implants are individually sized and shaped to fit to each patient’s unique anatomy, offering advantages we believe are not achievable with “off-the-shelf” knee implants.

Customized Knee Replacement Implants
There’s a reason 1 in 5 patients are not satisfied with their traditional total knee replacement.i
In traditional knee replacement surgery, the surgeon selects an “off-the-shelf” implant from a range of standard fixed sizes, and then has to make the necessary adjustments to fit the implant to the patient during the procedure.
Because off-the-shelf knee replacements aren’t designed to your specific anatomy, surgeons have to compromise on implant fit. This compromise may result in having implant overhang (implant hangs over the bone) or underhang (the implant is too small, leaving the bone exposed and uncovered). It could also result in an implant that isn’t aligned properly.

Not all patient-specific systems are created equal
Learn More »





Clinical studies have demonstrated that these compromises on fit can cause residual pain after surgery. At ConforMIS we design partial and total knee implants to fit the patient, not the other way around. We combine proven elements of standard knee replacement with our iFit Image-to-Implant® technology to create customized knee implants and surgical instrumentation that are designed to fit your knee’s natural shape and curves.
 
With this patient-specific approach the ConforMIS knee replacement systems offer unique advantages we believe are not possible with traditional, off-the-shelf implants, including:

Individualized fit that reduces sizing compromises common with off-the-shelf implants and associated with residual pain after surgeryii
Designed to follow the shape and contour of each patient’s knee, which provides an increased potential for a more natural feeling knee
Designed for optimal bone preservationiii
Reproducible surgical technique using disposable pre-navigated iJig® instrumentation and iView surgical planning images with detailed resection values that can be used to verify accuracy throughout the surgery

The iTotal CR Knee Replacement System is intended for use as a total knee replacement in patients with knee joint pain and disability whose conditions cannot be solely addressed by the use of a prosthetic device that treats only one or two of the three knee compartments, such as a unicondylar, patellofemoral or bicompartmental prosthesis. Only a licensed physician can help you determine the appropriate medical treatment. There are potential risks to knee replacement surgery, and individual results may vary. Before making any decisions concerning medical treatment, consult your physician regarding your options and the risks of those options. The longevity, performance and feel of any knee implant will depend on various factors, including your physical condition, your activity level, adherence to your physician's instructions, and other factors.
The Indications for Use include:

Painful joint disease due to osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or osteonecrosis of the knee.
Post traumatic loss of joint function.
Moderate varus, valgus or flexion deformity in which the ligamentous structures can be returned to adequate function and stability.
Failed osteotomies, hemiarthroplasties, and unicondylar, patellofemoral or bicompartmental implants.
Revision procedures provided that anatomic landmarks necessary for alignment and positioning of the implant are identifiable on patient imaging scans.

The implant is intended for cemented use only.
Caution: Federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician.

i: According to a study of 1,703 patients published by Bourne in 2009 in the peer-reviewed journal Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (In this study entitled Patient Satisfaction after Total Knee Arthroplasty: Who is Satisfied and Who is Not?, “the overall satisfaction question was used to determine a two category satisfaction outcome by combining patients who answered very dissatisfied, dissatisfied, or neutral into one group, and patients who answered satisfied or very satisfied into the second group.”)   
ii: Mahoney, et al; Overhang of the Femoral Component in Total Knee Arthroplasty: Risk Factors and Clinical Consequences. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery; 2010, 92: 1115-1121
iii: In a study by W. Kurtz titled “Patient-Specific Knee Replacement Implants Preserve Bone and Decrease Blood Loss & Swelling” presented at the 2013 BASK Annual Meeting, comparing 66 iTotal patients with 66 patients receiving one off-the-shelf implant brand (Zimmer NexGen), thickness of the femoral (distal and posterior medial/lateral), and tibial (medial/lateral) resections were measured intra-operatively. The average total of all bone resection measurements for iTotal was 27% (14mm) less than for the off-the-shelf total knee. Additionally, the total thickness of the iTotal implants was 25% (15.7mm) thinner on average than the off-the-shelf implants.

						About ConforMIS									


“ We believe that optimizing implant fit and performance requires a patient-specific approach. ”

No two knees are the same. No two ConforMIS knee implants are either.

 
Orthopedics has historically been a game of averages. Average sizes. Average shapes. Average results. No more.

We start with a simple idea: make the implant fit the patient rather than force the patient fit the implant
ConforMIS does something that we believe no other knee implant manufacturer has done. We put the patient at the center of implant design. By combining advanced 3D imaging technology with the latest manufacturing capabilities, we customize each and every implant to the patient’s unique size and shape.


We are a medical technology company that uses our proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell joint replacement implants that are individually sized and shaped, which we refer to as customized, to fit each patient’s unique anatomy. We believe we are the only company offering a broad line of customized knee implants designed to restore the natural shape of a patient’s knee. In recent clinical studies, iTotal CR, our cruciate-retaining total knee replacement implant, demonstrated superior clinical outcomes, including better function and greater patient satisfaction compared to traditional, off-the-shelf implants.

(NASDAQ:CFMS), a medical technology company that uses its proprietary iFit Image-to-Implant technology platform to develop, manufacture and sell joint replacement implants that are customized to fit each patient's unique anatomy, announced today financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Q1 Summary:  Total revenue of $20.5 million, up 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 2% on a constant currency basisProduct revenue of $20.4 million, up 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and up 3% on a constant currency basis  -  U.S. product revenue increased 9% year-over-year  -  Rest of World product revenue decreased 16% year-over-year on a reported basis and decreased 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis "We reported better than expected revenue results in the first quarter of 2017,” said Mark Augusti, President and Chief Executive Officer of ConforMIS, Inc. “Revenue exceeded the mid-point of the first quarter 2017 guidance range in excess of $2 million. Our full year guidance remains unchanged as we work through this year of transition.” First Quarter 2017 Financial Results       Three months ended March 31,Increase/decrease($, in thousands)  2017 2016$Change %Change%Change     (as reported)(constantcurrency)United States $  15,964$  14,708$  1,256 9%9%Rest of world    4,415   5,274   (859)-16%-12%Product revenue    20,379   19,982   397 2%3%Royalty revenue    76   268   (192)-72%-72%Total revenue $  20,455$  20,250$  205 1%2%              Total revenue increased $0.2 million to $20.5 million, or 1% year-over-year on a reported basis and increased 2% on a constant currency basis. Total revenue in the first quarter of 2017 included royalty revenue related to patent license agreements of $0.1 million as compared to $0.3 million in the first quarter of 2016. Product revenue increased $0.4 million to $20.4 million, or 2% year-over-year on a reported basis and increased 3% on a constant currency basis. U.S. product revenue increased $1.3 million to $16.0 million, or 9% year-over-year, and Rest of World product revenue decreased $0.9 million to $4.4 million, or 16% year-over-year on a reported basis and decreased 12% on a constant currency basis. Product revenue from sales of iTotal CR, iDuo and iUni was $15.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $17.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.3 million, or 13% year-over-year, on a reported basis and 12% on a constant currency basis.  Product revenue from sales of iTotal PS was $5.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016, an increase of $2.7 million, or 113% year-over-year, on a reported and constant currency basis. Total gross profit decreased $0.2 million to $6.5 million, or 32% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $6.7 million, or 33% of revenue, in the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in gross margin year-over-year was driven primarily by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and the timing of royalty payments received. Total operating expenses increased $2.0 million to $23.8 million, or 9% year-over-year. The increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by higher general and administrative expense, including a $1.4 million increase in patent litigation expense and a $0.7 million increase in personnel costs compared to last year. Net loss was $17.2 million, or $0.40 per basic share, in the first quarter of 2017, compared to a net loss of $15.0 million, or $0.37 per basic share, for the same period last year. The change in first quarter net loss was driven primarily by higher general and administrative expense year-over-year. As of March 31, 2017, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled $68.5 million, compared to $65.5 million as of December 31, 2016.  As previously announced, in January 2017 the Company secured up to $50 million in term debt financing from Oxford Finance, of which $15 million was borrowed in January. 2017 Financial Guidance ConforMIS reaffirms the financial guidance provided on February 15, 2017. For the full year 2017, the Company continues to expect total revenue in a range of $80 to $84 million and total gross margin in a range of 36% to 38%. Note on Non-GAAP Financial Measures In addition to disclosing financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company provides certain information regarding the Company's financial results or projected financial results on a non-GAAP "constant currency basis." This information estimates the impact of changes in foreign currency rates on the translation of the Company's current or projected future period financial results as compared to the applicable comparable period. This impact is derived by taking the adjusted current or projected local currency results and translating them into U.S. Dollars based upon the foreign currency exchange rates for the applicable comparable period. It does not include any other effect of changes in foreign currency rates on the Company's results or business. Non-GAAP information is not a substitute for, and is not superior to, information presented on a GAAP basis. Conference Call As previously announced, ConforMIS will conduct a conference call and webcast today at 4:30 PM Eastern Time. Management will discuss financial results and strategic matters. To participate in the conference call, please call 877-809-6331 (or 615-247-0224 for international) and use conference ID number 5263799 or listen to the webcast in the investor relations section of the company's website at ir.conformis.com.
