Kelvin H. Taketa is chief executive officer of the Hawai’i Community Foundation—the largest foundation in the state that works with individuals, families, foundations, government agencies and organizations to transform lives and improve our communities.
Since his appointment in 1998, the Foundation has become the leader in facilitating charitable investments in Hawai’i and has earned distinction as a trusted community resource on charitable trends and best practices in Hawai’i.  In addition, the Foundation has launched several major initiatives with a coalition of local and national funders and government agencies to address critical issues and developed grant programs that have proven results and led to national recognition for the Foundation.  In 2015, the Foundation administered more than $50 million for programs and initiatives in Hawai’i.  A national leader and commentator about philanthropy and non-profit organizations, Kelvin has been recognized by The Non-Profit Times as one of the “50 most powerful and influential people” in the sector.
Born and raised in Hawai’i, Kelvin graduated from Colorado College and received his Juris Doctor degree from the University of California’s Hastings College of Law.  Since graduating from law school, he has spent his entire career as a non-profit executive while also working in the private sector.
He helped found The Nature Conservancy of Hawaii as its Executive Director and then managed the fundraising, government relations and communications functions for The Nature Conservancy (TNC), the largest conservation organization in the world, out of its headquarters in Washington, DC.  He then led the creation of TNC’s programs in the Asia/Pacific Region which helped build the leadership capacity of non-profit organizations and government agencies, launched compatible economic enterprises and worked on the reform of multinational and bilateral economic aid and policy throughout the region.  Over his 18 year career at TNC, Kelvin received several national awards for his conservation leadership.
Kelvin also founded and managed Sunrise Capital, LLC, a private equity company focused on aquaculture ventures in Hawaii.  He has served on numerous corporate and nonprofit boards including his current service on Hawaiian Electric Industries and as its Chair of the Nominating and Governance Committee, Hawaiian Electric Company, the Hawaii Leadership Forum and the Stupski Foundation in San Francisco.  He previously served on the Board of the Independent Sector in Washington, D.C., Grove Farm (Kauai) and the founding boards of two other national organizations, Sustainable Conservation and Civic Ventures, now Encore.org.
