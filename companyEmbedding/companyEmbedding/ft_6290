Are you considering purchasing a new home? Are you thinking about selling your current home? Or, maybe you're just eager to refinance while interest rates are low?
Whatever the case may be, you'll need to know the value of the property in question. Our home value search can provide you with a wealth of information, and unlike a costly appraisal, it's completely free.
Our home prices are calculated using a proprietary algorithm that takes recent comparable sales, neighborhood data, and specific property information into account when creating a broad property value estimate.
We're not suggesting that you use our home value estimate in lieu of an appraisal from a trained professional when selling, purchasing, or refinancing, but it's the perfect source when you just need a reasonable estimate and you don't want to wait.
In addition to a ballpark value figure, you'll have access to valuable data, incuding transaction histories, home features, mortgage insurance and property tax estimates, and recent local sales.
And if you're looking for mortgage or refinance rates, you'll find them right there, right where you need them: on our price estimate page.
Whether you're just daydreaming or you've started hunting for a home in earnest, we hope you'll find our free home pricing page to be a valuable research tool.

The rug  we received looked nothing like this.  It was totally red. I took it to Home Depot to return and they talked with the HD warehouse and it was reported that this rug is no longer being manufactured.  Yet the rug we received is not on the website.   Therefore we returned the rug.  Why would HD have a rug like the one above of their website and discontinue it.  This makes for poor merchandising and customer service.
