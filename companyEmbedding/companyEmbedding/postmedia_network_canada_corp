      agreement to sell its media monitoring division Infomart to Meltwater 
      News Canada Inc., a global leader in media intelligence, for gross 
      proceeds of $38.25 million, subject to adjustments. An amount equal to 
      15% of the purchase price will be paid into escrow to satisfy claims 
      arising under the purchase agreement. The net proceeds from the sale 
      will be used for debt repayment.
    


      “We are pleased to announce a transaction that both supports Postmedia’s 
      business strategy and provides an exceptional offering for Infomart 
      clients,” said Andrew MacLeod, Executive Vice President and COO,

      areas of the business.”
    

      Included in the transaction are Infomart’s media monitoring business, 
      direct feed business and professional services operations, including 
      clients of such services.
    

      “We look forward to welcoming Infomart employees and clients into the 
      Meltwater family,” said Kaveh Rostampor, Executive Director, Americas, 
      Meltwater. “Infomart’s existing client base will have the opportunity to 
      enjoy the Meltwater product offering while continuing with the services 
      they are used to”.
    

      The deal is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, 
      including the entering into of certain ancillary agreements, the 
      entering into of certain licenses, the receipt of certain consents, and, 
      if applicable, the receipt of regulatory clearance. The purchase price 
      is subject to adjustments, including adjustments relating to certain 
      consents.

Postmedia Network Canada Corporation (also known as Postmedia Network or Postmedia) is a Canadian media company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of the publishing properties of the former Canwest, with primary operations in newspaper publishing, news gathering and Internet operations.
The ownership group was assembled by National Post CEO Paul Godfrey[3] in 2010 to bid for the chain of newspapers being sold by the financially troubled Canwest (the company's broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications). Godfrey secured financial backing from a U.S. private-equity firm, the Manhattan-based hedge fund GoldenTree Asset Management—which owns 35 per cent—as well as other investors.[3] The group completed a $1.1 billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July 13, 2010. The company has over 4,700 employees.[4] The company's shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2011.[5]
The company's strategy has seen its publications invest greater resources in digital news gathering and distribution, including expanded websites and digital news apps for smartphones and tablets.[6] This began with a revamp and redesign of the Ottawa Citizen, which debuted in 2014.[6]

History[edit]
On July 13, 2010 the Manhattan-based hedge fund, Golden Tree Asset Management acquired the Asper family’s bankrupt CanWest media empire for $1.1 billion.[3]
Acquisitions and mergers[edit]
On October 6, 2014, Postmedia's CEO Godfrey announced a deal to acquire the English-language operations of Sun Media.[3][7] The purchase received regulatory approval from the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015,[8] even though the company manages competitive papers in several Canadian cities; while the Sun Media chain owns numerous other papers, four of its five Sun-branded tabloids operate in markets where Postmedia already publishes a broadsheet competitor.[7] Board chair Rod Phillips has cited the Vancouver market, in which the two main daily newspapers, the Vancouver Sun and The Province, have had common ownership for over 30 years, as evidence that the deal would not be anticompetitive.[7] The purchase did not include Sun Media's now-defunct Sun News Network.[7] The acquisition was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015.,[9] and closed on April 13.[10]

A decades-long heated rivalry and circulation war began 1950s and 1960s between the Liberal/left/socialist Toronto Star and the "steadfastly Conservative, Royalist and right-wing" Toronto Telegram, located on Bay and Melinda St. and owned in the early 1950s by a "wealthy deal-maker named George McCullagh."[11][clarification needed]

The problem with Postmedia: Olive | Toronto Star

Search the print archivesThis copy is for your personal non-commercial use only. To order presentation-ready copies of Toronto Star content for distribution to colleagues, clients or customers, or inquire about permissions/licensing, please go to: www.TorontoStarReprints.comThe problem with Postmedia: OlivePostmedia newspapers, including the National Post, Ottawa Citizen and the Ottawa Sun.  (Justin Tang / THE CANADIAN PRESS)  By David OliveBusinessBusiness ColumnistSat., Jan. 30, 2016There is a cancer on Canadian journalism.The malignancy is Postmedia Network Canada Corp., a foreign-controlled, debt-burdened contrivance flirting with insolvency that nonetheless is relied upon by about 21 million Canadian readers. Postmedia’s 200-plus media outlets, mostly newspapers, including some of the biggest dailies in the country, represent a far greater concentration of news media ownership than exists in any other major economy. And a degree of foreign ownership of the free press that would not be tolerated in the U.S., France, Japan or Germany.The good news is that the Postmedia abomination, which has never turned a profit, is in such wretched condition that it’s not long for this world. The bad news is that as long as the biggest newspaper publisher in the country clings to life, it is a blight on all the communities it underserves.Postmedia is controlled by quick-buck hedge funds in the U.S. Leading this group is New York-based GoldenTree Asset Management, which alone controls 35 per cent of Postmedia. Indeed, it was GoldenTree that created Postmedia, just five years ago, by salvaging proud, venerable newspapers like the Vancouver Sun, The Calgary Herald, the Ottawa Citizen and the Montreal Gazette from the ruins of the Asper family’s bankrupt Canwest empire.For generations, Canadian law has forbidden foreign ownership or control of Canadian cultural assets. But after permitting the sale to non-Canadians of practically the entire Canadian-owned steel and mining industries, then PM Stephen Harper’s government signed off on Postmedia’s creation as well. The Americans put a Canadian face on the deal by selecting Paul Godfrey, 77, as Postmedia’s CEO. Not by coincidence, Harper and Godfrey, a diehard Tory, are kindred spirits.Article Continued BelowThough it was a thinly disguised foreign takeover, Ottawa didn’t object that Postmedia’s advent showed no sign of complying with Investment Canada’s one basic demand of foreign takeovers — that they be of “net benefit” to Canada.Five years later, no one can credibly argue that Postmedia has been of net benefit to Canada. The most Godfrey can do, as he did recently, is insist that Canada is lucky that someone plucked the National Post, the Edmonton Journal and the Regina Leader-Post from the Canwest ruins, since no Canadian bidders stepped forward to do so.That is a lie. There were at least two credible bids by Canadian interests, as Godfrey well knows. And the Canwest papers would not have perished in any case. They would have been auctioned, individually and as regional groups. That would have served readers better than the monstrosity of Postmedia. It’s Postmedia that is in financial extremis, not Postmedia’s papers.Postmedia has laid off more than half of its employees. And the staff reduction continues, as recently as another round of layoffs this month. Which means that countless news stories are no longer reported, and costly investigative and “enterprise” journalism is now an unaffordable luxury.Rather than invest to improve this country’s journalism, Godfrey has been channelling William Randolph Hearst, ordering all Postmedia publications to endorse the Harper government’s bid for re-election in October. So much for the local editorial autonomy long enjoyed by certain of the larger Postmedia papers when they were owned by the Southam family, which prided itself on their papers’ independence. Then again, when you’re publishing local papers, it’s only common (and commercial) sense that your papers reflect the views of the community and not Toronto head office.In the same election, Godfrey also sold the front pages of some major Postmedia papers to the Tories for full-page ads. Which rendered the paper’s entire contents suspect.This month, Godfrey announced that newsrooms will be merged in cities where Postmedia publishes a broadsheet paper and a tabloid. In doing so, Godfrey is crossing a bright red line, since editorial is what gives a media operation the unique voice with which it attracts readers, and thus advertisers.The savage non-stop cost-cutting at Postmedia has turned out to be a fool’s errand. Postmedia’s circulation and print and online ad revenues continue to fall — as confirmed in the company’s latest quarterly results released Jan. 13 — in part because the cutbacks have so degraded the product. Despite the cost-cutting, Postmedia has managed to lose more than half a billion dollars since 2012. (Just over $554 million, to be precise.)Unable to arrest the decline in its revenues, Postmedia took the drastic step last year of buying someone else’s revenues with its debt-financed acquisition of the Sun Media tabloid chain. With that 2015 deal, Postmedia doubled down on the dubious bet it made with its similarly high-risk purchase of the Canwest papers.With these roll-all-the-dice gambits, Postmedia has installed a time bomb on its balance sheet of $672 million in debt owed to the U.S. hedge funds, which financed Postmedia’s creation and its ill-considered Sun Media expansion. All that debt must be paid or refinanced by July 2018. Roughly half of it comes due in August 2017, just 19 months from now.It’s very difficult to see where Postmedia will get the money to do this. Postmedia is worth more dead than alive, with its current negative net equity of $89.3 million.Moody’s Investor Services this month warned it is poised to further downgrade the rating on Postmedia’s debt if “it is highly likely the company will default on its debt obligations.” And RBC Dominion Securities took the unusual step of cutting its price target on Postmedia’s stock to zero, for which the rare precedents include the now defunct RadioShack.com LLC and General Motors Corp. just before its 2009 bankruptcy filing.That Postmedia debt, by the way, carries a lofty 8 per cent interest rate. Which means the U.S. hedge funds are doing just fine as long as Godfrey can make those payments from an eroding revenue base. The interest payments have become downright asphyxiating — “a noose around your neck,” Godfrey said this month — with the collapse of the loonie, given that every dime of the debt is U.S.-dominated.Bottom line: Postmedia has erased about $503 million dollars in shareholder value, a record in the 264-year history of Canadian newspapers. The company’s shares have lost more than 98 per cent of their value from their 2011 peak, and currently trade at 23 cents.Godfrey’s stated business plan included an ambitious sale of assets. But Godfrey has sold just one significant asset, the Victoria Times Colonist. Net proceeds from Postmedia asset sales over the past four years amount to a piddling $2.2 million of the firm’s stated assets of $874.1 million. (That last figure is mostly matched by debt; the rest is largely “goodwill,” an ephemeral accounting term.)Godfrey said recently that most of Postmedia’s papers are making money. That’s almost certainly true. It’s North America’s largest metropolitan dailies that are taking the biggest hit from the transformation to the Information Age. Postmedia’s many small, mid-size and community papers continue to profit from their monopoly status.The paucity of Postmedia asset sales, combined with the continued profitability of most of Postmedia’s papers, lends credibility to the current rumours that Postmedia is on a deliberate path to self-destruction.That way, the U.S. hedge funds that have already reaped tens of millions of dollars from Postmedia in interest payments can get their hands on a bankrupt Postmedia’s real estate and other assets at fire-sale prices. As debt-holders, the hedgies will be at or near the front of the line of creditors in a bankruptcy proceeding.To assist the asset-flipping Yanks, Postmedia is said to be lobbying Ottawa for a relaxation of Canadian ownership rules on cultural assets, since some of the deepest-pocketed bidders on a bankrupt Postmedia’s assets are likely to be foreigners.There are alternatives more honourable than that outcome, by which genuine Canadian ownership is restored to newspapers that no longer have money sucked out of them but are reinvesting for a promising digital future.Charitable or non-profit trust. Two of the world’s most-respected newspapers, the London-based sister national papers The Guardian and the Observer, are owned by a non-profit trust. This is also the model for the Tampa Bay Times, owned by the Poynter Institute for Media Studies, a non-profit journalism school. The Times tops its rival, The Tampa Tribune, in readership. And it has won 10 Pulitzer Prizes since 1964.Government backstop. Ottawa (CBC), Ontario (TVO) and British Columbia (Knowledge Network) have each launched public broadcasters, all of them in the front rank of journalistic quality. The federal and subnational governments have a role to play in funding non-profit trusts like those described above should any of the country’s 100-plus daily newspapers hit the wall.Community ownership: As noted, many if not most small and mid-sized papers in Canada continue to be profitable. With the backing of Canada’s enormous pension funds, they could be acquired by local interests. Or perhaps by the entire community. The Super Bowl-winning Green Bay Packers (three championships) are owned by thousands of investor residents in Wisconsin, each permitted to hold just one share so that the team is assuredly community owned and can’t be sold to become a tycoon’s plaything.Postmedia is giving private ownership of an essential public service a bad name. Its charade of pretending to operate its papers in the public interest cannot end soon enough.Correction - February 1, 2016: This article was edited from a previous version that mistakenly referred to Knowledge Network as Alberta's public broadcaster.

Postmedia Network Canada Corporation (also known as Postmedia Network or Postmedia) is a Canadian media company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of the publishing properties of the former Canwest, with primary operations in newspaper publishing, news gathering and Internet operations.
The ownership group was assembled by National Post CEO Paul Godfrey[3] in 2010 to bid for the chain of newspapers being sold by the financially troubled Canwest (the company's broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications). Godfrey secured financial backing from a U.S. private-equity firm, the Manhattan-based hedge fund GoldenTree Asset Management—which owns 35 per cent—as well as other investors.[3] The group completed a $1.1 billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July 13, 2010. The company has over 4,700 employees.[4] The company's shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2011.[5]
The company's strategy has seen its publications invest greater resources in digital news gathering and distribution, including expanded websites and digital news apps for smartphones and tablets.[6] This began with a revamp and redesign of the Ottawa Citizen, which debuted in 2014.[6]

History[edit]
On July 13, 2010 the Manhattan-based hedge fund, Golden Tree Asset Management acquired the Asper family’s bankrupt CanWest media empire for $1.1 billion.[3]
Acquisitions and mergers[edit]
On October 6, 2014, Postmedia's CEO Godfrey announced a deal to acquire the English-language operations of Sun Media.[3][7] The purchase received regulatory approval from the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015,[8] even though the company manages competitive papers in several Canadian cities; while the Sun Media chain owns numerous other papers, four of its five Sun-branded tabloids operate in markets where Postmedia already publishes a broadsheet competitor.[7] Board chair Rod Phillips has cited the Vancouver market, in which the two main daily newspapers, the Vancouver Sun and The Province, have had common ownership for over 30 years, as evidence that the deal would not be anticompetitive.[7] The purchase did not include Sun Media's now-defunct Sun News Network.[7] The acquisition was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015.,[9] and closed on April 13.[10]

Postmedia Network Canada Corporation (also known as Postmedia Network or Postmedia) is a Canadian media company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of the publishing properties of the former Canwest, with primary operations in newspaper publishing, news gathering and Internet operations.
The ownership group was assembled by National Post CEO Paul Godfrey[3] in 2010 to bid for the chain of newspapers being sold by the financially troubled Canwest (the company's broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications). Godfrey secured financial backing from a U.S. private-equity firm, the Manhattan-based hedge fund GoldenTree Asset Management—which owns 35 per cent—as well as other investors.[3] The group completed a $1.1 billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July 13, 2010. The company has over 4,700 employees.[4] The company's shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2011.[5]
The company's strategy has seen its publications invest greater resources in digital news gathering and distribution, including expanded websites and digital news apps for smartphones and tablets.[6] This began with a revamp and redesign of the Ottawa Citizen, which debuted in 2014.[6]

History[edit]
On July 13, 2010 the Manhattan-based hedge fund, Golden Tree Asset Management acquired the Asper family’s bankrupt CanWest media empire for $1.1 billion.[3]
Acquisitions and mergers[edit]
On October 6, 2014, Postmedia's CEO Godfrey announced a deal to acquire the English-language operations of Sun Media.[3][7] The purchase received regulatory approval from the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015,[8] even though the company manages competitive papers in several Canadian cities; while the Sun Media chain owns numerous other papers, four of its five Sun-branded tabloids operate in markets where Postmedia already publishes a broadsheet competitor.[7] Board chair Rod Phillips has cited the Vancouver market, in which the two main daily newspapers, the Vancouver Sun and The Province, have had common ownership for over 30 years, as evidence that the deal would not be anticompetitive.[7] The purchase did not include Sun Media's now-defunct Sun News Network.[7] The acquisition was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015.,[9] and closed on April 13.[10]

Postmedia Network Canada Corporation (also known as Postmedia Network or Postmedia) is a Canadian media company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of the publishing properties of the former Canwest, with primary operations in newspaper publishing, news gathering and Internet operations.
The ownership group was assembled by National Post CEO Paul Godfrey[3] in 2010 to bid for the chain of newspapers being sold by the financially troubled Canwest (the company's broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications). Godfrey secured financial backing from a U.S. private-equity firm, the Manhattan-based hedge fund GoldenTree Asset Management—which owns 35 per cent—as well as other investors.[3] The group completed a $1.1 billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July 13, 2010. The company has over 4,700 employees.[4] The company's shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2011.[5]
The company's strategy has seen its publications invest greater resources in digital news gathering and distribution, including expanded websites and digital news apps for smartphones and tablets.[6] This began with a revamp and redesign of the Ottawa Citizen, which debuted in 2014.[6]

History[edit]
On July 13, 2010 the Manhattan-based hedge fund, Golden Tree Asset Management acquired the Asper family’s bankrupt CanWest media empire for $1.1 billion.[3]
Acquisitions and mergers[edit]
On October 6, 2014, Postmedia's CEO Godfrey announced a deal to acquire the English-language operations of Sun Media.[3][7] The purchase received regulatory approval from the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015,[8] even though the company manages competitive papers in several Canadian cities; while the Sun Media chain owns numerous other papers, four of its five Sun-branded tabloids operate in markets where Postmedia already publishes a broadsheet competitor.[7] Board chair Rod Phillips has cited the Vancouver market, in which the two main daily newspapers, the Vancouver Sun and The Province, have had common ownership for over 30 years, as evidence that the deal would not be anticompetitive.[7] The purchase did not include Sun Media's now-defunct Sun News Network.[7] The acquisition was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015.,[9] and closed on April 13.[10]

A decades-long heated rivalry and circulation war began 1950s and 1960s between the Liberal/left/socialist Toronto Star and the "steadfastly Conservative, Royalist and right-wing" Toronto Telegram, located on Bay and Melinda St. and owned in the early 1950s by a "wealthy deal-maker named George McCullagh."[11][clarification needed]

Postmedia Network Canada Corporation (also known as Postmedia Network or Postmedia) is a Canadian media company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, consisting of the publishing properties of the former Canwest, with primary operations in newspaper publishing, news gathering and Internet operations.
The ownership group was assembled by National Post CEO Paul Godfrey[3] in 2010 to bid for the chain of newspapers being sold by the financially troubled Canwest (the company's broadcasting assets were sold separately to Shaw Communications). Godfrey secured financial backing from a U.S. private-equity firm, the Manhattan-based hedge fund GoldenTree Asset Management—which owns 35 per cent—as well as other investors.[3] The group completed a $1.1 billion transaction to acquire the chain from Canwest on July 13, 2010. The company has over 4,700 employees.[4] The company's shares were listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2011.[5]
The company's strategy has seen its publications invest greater resources in digital news gathering and distribution, including expanded websites and digital news apps for smartphones and tablets.[6] This began with a revamp and redesign of the Ottawa Citizen, which debuted in 2014.[6]

History[edit]
On July 13, 2010 the Manhattan-based hedge fund, Golden Tree Asset Management acquired the Asper family’s bankrupt CanWest media empire for $1.1 billion.[3]
Acquisitions and mergers[edit]
On October 6, 2014, Postmedia's CEO Godfrey announced a deal to acquire the English-language operations of Sun Media.[3][7] The purchase received regulatory approval from the federal Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015,[8] even though the company manages competitive papers in several Canadian cities; while the Sun Media chain owns numerous other papers, four of its five Sun-branded tabloids operate in markets where Postmedia already publishes a broadsheet competitor.[7] Board chair Rod Phillips has cited the Vancouver market, in which the two main daily newspapers, the Vancouver Sun and The Province, have had common ownership for over 30 years, as evidence that the deal would not be anticompetitive.[7] The purchase did not include Sun Media's now-defunct Sun News Network.[7] The acquisition was approved by the Competition Bureau on March 25, 2015.,[9] and closed on April 13.[10]

A decades-long heated rivalry and circulation war began 1950s and 1960s between the Liberal/left/socialist Toronto Star and the "steadfastly Conservative, Royalist and right-wing" Toronto Telegram, located on Bay and Melinda St. and owned in the early 1950s by a "wealthy deal-maker named George McCullagh."[11][clarification needed]

OverviewTorontoCalgaryEdmontonOttawaWinnipeg


The first Sun newspaper was the Toronto Sun – published in 1971, immediately after the demise of the Toronto Telegram, a conservative broadsheet.
The next Sun newspaper to begin publication was the Edmonton Sun in 1978, followed by the Calgary Sun and Winnipeg Sun in 1980, and the Ottawa Sun in 1988.




The Toronto Sun was first published on November 1, 1971, immediately after the demise of the Toronto Telegram, a conservative broadsheet. As there was no publishing gap between the two papers and many writers and employees moved to the new paper, it is today generally considered as a direct continuation of the Telegram, and the Sun is the holder of the Telegram archives.




The Calgary Sun is tabloid-format daily that was first published in 1980. It replaced the long-running tabloid-size newspaper, The Albertan soon after it was acquired by the publishers of the Toronto Sun.  The newspaper, like most of those in the Canadian Sun chain, is known for short, snappy news stories aimed primarily at working class readers.




The Edmonton Sun is a daily newspaper that began publishing in 1978 and shares many characteristics with Sun Media’s other tabloids, including an emphasis on local news stories, its conservative editorial stance and , extensive sports coverage.



The Ottawa Sun is a daily tabloid newspaper that was first published in the early 1980s as the Ottawa Sunday Herald,. The first Sunday edition of the newly named Ottawa Sun was published on September 4, 1988 and the first daily edition appeared on November 7, 1988.



The Winnipeg Sun was first published on November 5, 1980. On May 10, 1999, the newspaper was relaunched, taking on an appearance consistent with the Toronto Sun, the Edmonton Sun, the Calgary Sun and the Ottawa Sun.



 
24 Hours Toronto is a free daily commuter newspaper. It was first launched in 2003. It is published five days a week – because its target readers are commuters heading to work, it is not published on weekends or statutory holidays. It is printed in a compact format that is smaller than a tabloid.
24 Hrs Vancouver is a free daily commuter newspaper. It is published five days a week – because its target readers are commuters heading to work, it is not published on weekends or statutory holidays. It is printed in a compact format that is smaller than a tabloid.
The London Free Press is a daily newspaper with the largest circulation of any newspaper in Southwestern Ontario. It was founded in 1849 as a weekly newspaper, the Canadian Free Press.
In 1855 the renamed London Free Press and Daily Western Advertiser became a daily.  London-born publisher John Paton introduced a Sunday edition in 1997.

OverviewTorontoCalgaryEdmontonOttawaWinnipeg


The first Sun newspaper was the Toronto Sun – published in 1971, immediately after the demise of the Toronto Telegram, a conservative broadsheet.
The next Sun newspaper to begin publication was the Edmonton Sun in 1978, followed by the Calgary Sun and Winnipeg Sun in 1980, and the Ottawa Sun in 1988.




The Toronto Sun was first published on November 1, 1971, immediately after the demise of the Toronto Telegram, a conservative broadsheet. As there was no publishing gap between the two papers and many writers and employees moved to the new paper, it is today generally considered as a direct continuation of the Telegram, and the Sun is the holder of the Telegram archives.




The Calgary Sun is tabloid-format daily that was first published in 1980. It replaced the long-running tabloid-size newspaper, The Albertan soon after it was acquired by the publishers of the Toronto Sun.  The newspaper, like most of those in the Canadian Sun chain, is known for short, snappy news stories aimed primarily at working class readers.




The Edmonton Sun is a daily newspaper that began publishing in 1978 and shares many characteristics with Sun Media’s other tabloids, including an emphasis on local news stories, its conservative editorial stance and , extensive sports coverage.



The Ottawa Sun is a daily tabloid newspaper that was first published in the early 1980s as the Ottawa Sunday Herald,. The first Sunday edition of the newly named Ottawa Sun was published on September 4, 1988 and the first daily edition appeared on November 7, 1988.



The Winnipeg Sun was first published on November 5, 1980. On May 10, 1999, the newspaper was relaunched, taking on an appearance consistent with the Toronto Sun, the Edmonton Sun, the Calgary Sun and the Ottawa Sun.



 
24 Hours Toronto is a free daily commuter newspaper. It was first launched in 2003. It is published five days a week – because its target readers are commuters heading to work, it is not published on weekends or statutory holidays. It is printed in a compact format that is smaller than a tabloid.
24 Hrs Vancouver is a free daily commuter newspaper. It is published five days a week – because its target readers are commuters heading to work, it is not published on weekends or statutory holidays. It is printed in a compact format that is smaller than a tabloid.
The London Free Press is a daily newspaper with the largest circulation of any newspaper in Southwestern Ontario. It was founded in 1849 as a weekly newspaper, the Canadian Free Press.
In 1855 the renamed London Free Press and Daily Western Advertiser became a daily.  London-born publisher John Paton introduced a Sunday edition in 1997.
