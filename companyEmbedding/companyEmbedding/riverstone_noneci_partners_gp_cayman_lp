Item 4.                                                         Purpose of Transaction
 
Item 4 of the Statement is amended and supplemented as follows:
 
Silverback Subscription Agreement
 
On November 27, 2016, Riverstone Silverback Holdings, L.P. (the Riverstone Subscriber) entered into a subscription agreement (the SB Subscription Agreement) with the Issuer, pursuant to which the Riverstone Subscriber, a subsidiary of  Riverstone REL, agreed to purchase up to approximately $400 million in shares of (i) Class A Common Stock, at a purchase price of $14.54 per share, subject to adjustment as described below (the Class A Shares), and (ii) the Issuers convertible Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Series B Preferred Stock), at a purchase price of $3,635 per share (or $14.54 per share on an as-converted basis), subject to adjustment as described below (the Series B Shares and, together with the Class A Shares, the SB Subscription Shares), plus up to an additional approximately $100 million in shares of Class A Common Stock and/or Series B Preferred Stock at the same respective purchase prices set forth above.
 
If the number of Class A Shares to be issued to the Riverstone Subscriber, together with any additional shares of Class A Common Stock that may be issued to finance the acquisition of Silverback Exploration, LLC and Silverback Operating, LLC by Centennial Resource Production, LLC (the Acquisition), would exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding Class A Common Stock, then the Riverstone Subscriber will purchase a number of Class A Shares such that the 19.9% limitation will not be exceeded and will purchase its remaining commitment in Series B Shares.  In the event Centennial determines to finance any portion of the Acquisition by issuing additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to one or more additional purchasers at a per share price less than the price payable by the Riverstone Subscriber, then the Riverstone Subscribers purchase price will be correspondingly reduced to the lowest per share price to be paid by any such additional purchaser.
 
Riverstone Subscriber has assigned its rights under the SB Subscription Agreement to Riverstone QB Holdings, Riverstone Non-ECI and REL US, pursuant to which the SB Subscription Shares will be purchased by Riverstone QB Holdings, Riverstone Non-ECI and REL US pro rata in proportion to their limited partnership interests in Riverstone Centennial.
 
The foregoing description of the SB Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of such agreement, which is attached as an exhibit to this Schedule 13D, and is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Riverstone Centennial Distribution
 
On December 15, 2016, Riverstone Centennial disposed of all of its shares of Class A Common Stock in a pro rata distribution to all of its limited partners. As a result, REL US, Riverstone Non-ECI and Riverstone QB Holdings, as the limited partners of Riverstone Centennial, each became the record holder of the number of shares of Class A Common Stock as set forth herein.
