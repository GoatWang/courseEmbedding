Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Nordson Corporation Webcast for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Senior Director, Jim Jaye. You may begin.
James R. Jaye - Nordson Corp.
Thank you, Leanne. This is Jim Jaye, Senior Director of Investor Relations and Communications for Nordson. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and CEO; Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and CFO; and Jeff Pembroke, Corporate Vice President within our Advanced Technology segment .
We welcome you to our conference call today, Tuesday, February 21, 2017, to report Nordson's FY 2017 first quarter results and our FY 2017 second quarter outlook. Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at Nordson.com /investors and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until February 28, 2017, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 64914948.
During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance based on Nordson's current expectation. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks on the quarter, we'll provide some comments on our most recent acquisition, as well as on yesterday's announcement on our agreement to acquire Vention Medical's Advanced Technologies business. We'll then be happy to take your questions.
So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Mike.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Thank you, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Our global team delivered very solid performance this quarter. We generated organic growth of 10% compared to the prior year, with all three segments contributing to the growth. This marks the 11th time in the last 12 quarters that Nordson has delivered organic growth compared to the prior year. Diverse end markets, innovative products, new applications, and the best customer experience are continuing to drive our success.
We leveraged the increased volume to drive significant improvement in operating margin and earnings per share compared to the first quarter a year ago. Our ongoing continuous improvement efforts are aiding our results as well. We also continue to generate strong levels of free cash, and we executed on our capital deployment strategy, where we distributed approximately $15 million in dividends and completed one acquisition during the first quarter. Two other acquisitions closed during the first few weeks of this quarter.
And, as Jim noted, we are very happy to announce an agreement to acquire Vention Medical's Advanced Technology (sic) [Technologies] business. This transaction gives us real scale among many other benefits in one of their fastest growing and highest performing product line. We'll provide some additional detail on Vention and the other recent transactions later in the call. All four of these deals are aligned with our strategy and should provide excellent opportunities for profitable growth.

Looking ahead to our second quarter, we're forecasting solid organic growth at the midpoint of our outlook. This outlook is based on current backlog, order rates, project activity, and in comparison to a very robust quarter of organic growth a year ago. I'll speak more about our outlook, current business trends and our recent acquisitions in a few moments.
But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg to provide more detailed commentary on our current results, and our second quarter guidance.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. Regarding first quarter results, sales were $407 million, an increase of 10% over the prior year's first quarter. This change in sales included a 10% increase in organic volume, a 1% increase related to the first year effect of acquisitions, and a 1% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation compared to the prior year's first quarter.
Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, organic sales volume increased 3% as compared to the prior year first quarter, offset by 1% negative impact related to currency translation. This is solid growth against a challenging comparison of the prior year first quarter, where organic growth was 11% in this segment. Our product assembly and rigid packaging product lines drove the growth in the current quarter. On a geographic basis, Asia Pacific, the Americas and Japan were strongest.
Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 25% over the prior year first quarter, inclusive of a 23% increase in organic volume, and a 2% increase related to the first year effect of the LinkTech and ACE acquisitions. The growth was offset by 2% negative impact related to currency translation. All product lines and geographies in the segment delivered excellent organic growth, most by double digits, with performance aided in part by comparison to a softer first quarter in some end markets a year-ago.
Organic sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 8%, compared to the first quarter year-ago, offset by a 2% negative impact related to currency translation. Growth was strong in nearly all regions and was led by demand for our cold material dispensing, powder coating and UV curing product lines.
Gross margin for the total company in the first quarter was 55%, a 2 percentage point improvement compared to the prior year first quarter, driven by volume leverage and favorable mix. Operating profit in the quarter was $76 million and operating margin was 19%, a 5 percentage point improvement over the first quarter a year ago. Incremental operating margin on the increased volume was 68%.
Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, reported operating margin was 26% in the first quarter, an improvement of 1 percentage point compared to the same period a year ago. Within the Advanced Technology segment, reported operating margin was 18% in the first quarter, an increase of 11 percentage points over the same period a year ago, and within the Industrial Coating segment, reported operating margin was 13% in the first quarter, an improvement of 5 percentage points over the same period a year ago. This strong performance overall given the seasonally lower first quarter volume that is typical for all three of our segments, volume leverage, favorable mix and continuous improvement initiatives enabled all three segments to deliver operating margin improvement.
For the company, net income for the quarter was $50 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.86, 19% higher than last year's first quarter. We've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share. On a normalized basis, EPS in the current quarter represents a 41% increase over the prior year normalized EPS.

First quarter's EBITDA was $94 million and cash flow from operations was $78 million. Free cash flow before dividends was $71 million, reflecting cash conversion of 143% of net income. We've included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends.
In terms of capital allocation priorities, as Mike mentioned, we continued our balanced approach, distributing approximately $15 million in dividends to shareholders during the quarter, and we've been active on the acquisition front. At the end of the first quarter, our net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.8 times trailing 12-month EBITDA, down from 2 times at the end of fiscal 2016, and 2.8 times at the end of fiscal 2015.
I'll now move onto comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of FY 2017. As we typically do, we provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks as compared to the 12 weeks of the prior-year on a currency-neutral basis and with acquisitions that closed prior to the end of the first quarter of 2017, included in both years.
For the 12 weeks ending February 12, 2017, order rates are up 7% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year. Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, the latest 12-week orders are down 1% as compared to the same period in the prior year. Positive order rates in packaging and product assembly were offset by softness in other product lines. Geographically, positive orders in the Americas were offset by flat to slightly down rates in other regions. Timing of larger dollar system orders can have an effect on order rates, and for most of this latest 12-week period, order rates in the Adhesive segment have been up mid-to-high single-digits over the same period a year ago.
In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates for the latest 12 weeks are up 15% as compared to the prior year. These order rates reflect strong demand for automated and semi-automated dispensing systems, test and inspection systems and surface treatment systems for electronics end markets. Order rates were up in all geographies.
Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 14%, nearly all product lines and geographies were positive. Backlog at January 31, 2017 was approximately $308 million, an increase of 24% compared to the prior year and inclusive of 23% organic growth and 1% growth due to acquisitions.
Backlog amounts are calculated at January 31, 2017 exchange rates, and include acquisitions that closed prior to the end of the first quarter of 2017. With this backdrop, we're forecasting sales to increase in the range of 3% to 7% as compared to the second quarter a year ago. The sales forecast does include acquisitions that have closed, but does not include the Vention AT acquisition which is not yet closed.
This range is inclusive of an increase in organic volume growth of 3% to 7%, 2% growth from the first-year effective acquisitions and a negative currency impact of 2% based on current exchange rates. At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect second quarter gross margin to be approximately 56% and operating margin to be approximately 24%. We're estimating second quarter interest expense of about $6 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 29%, resulting in second quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings per share in the range of $1.21 to $1.33 per share.
In addition to the second quarter outlook, the following full-year updates may be helpful for modeling purposes. For our effective tax rate, we're forecasting the full-year rate to be about 29% based on current tax law and excluding discrete items. For capital spending in 2017, we're forecasting normal maintenance capital spending to be approximately $50 million.

Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Thank you, Greg. Again, I want to thank our team for delivering another strong quarter, where sales and EPS were first quarter records for Nordson. Our second quarter outlook is also very positive and we're forecasting good organic growth, against a very strong period a year ago.
We'd now like to spend some time highlighting the three recent acquisitions we have closed since the first of the year, and the agreement we have entered into, to purchase the Advanced Technology business of Vention Medical. A slide deck providing additional detail on these transactions is available on our investor website at nordson.com.
We're excited about all of these additions to the portfolio and the profitable growth opportunities we believe they bring. All four will become part of our Advanced Technology segment, further balancing the business around less cyclical end markets.
On January 3, we closed on the purchase of the ACE Production Technology (sic) [Technologies. ACE is the U.S.-based manufacturer of selective soldering systems, used in a variety of automotive and industrial electronics assembly applications. ACE technology is highly complementary to Nordson's existing conformal coating and optical inspection solution, and their products are often sold to the same set of customers. On February 16, we announced the purchase of Interselect, a European-based provider of the same-type of technology as ACE. Together these two properties will give us a new platform for growth within the electronics manufacturing space and further diversify our product offering. Combined annual revenue of the two businesses is approximately $12 million, with EBITDA margins in the mid-teen. We expect future performance of these businesses will benefit from volume leverage and operational improvements from the Nordson Business System.
Regarding our other recent transaction announcements on Plas-Pak and the Advanced Technology business of Vention Medical, let me turn the call over to Jeff Pembroke, Corporate Vice President within Nordson's Advanced Technology segment.
Jeffrey Alan Pembroke - Nordson Corp.
Thank you, Mike. We're very pleased with the acquisition of Plas-Pak Industries, which we announced on February 1. Plas-Pak expands and diversifies Nordson's offering of single-use dispensing syringes, cartridges and related components. Plas-Pak's recurring revenue model, proprietary technology and low-dollar cost, high value-add selling proposition are complementary and consistent with our existing Nordson EFD product line.
Plas-Pak strengthens Nordson EFD's position in select industrial end markets, while providing access to a rapidly growing animal health market and broader exposure to the DIY, pesticide and dental markets. The company has averaged high single-digit annual revenue growth over the last five years and had 2016 revenues of approximately $28 million and EBITDA margins slightly higher than Nordson's 2016 margin.
We expect to leverage Nordson's global footprint to accelerate Plas-Pak's growth beyond its current strong presence in North America. And as announced in a press release yesterday, we've entered an agreement to acquire the Advanced Technologies business of Vention Medical, also known as Vention AT. This is a great acquisition for our customers, shareholders and employees. Vention AT is a premium quality highly complementary business that immediately adds significant scale and differentiation to our existing Nordson MEDICAL platform. It also establishes Nordson as a leading designer, developer and manufacturer of minimally invasive interventional delivery devices, balloons, catheters and advanced components for the global medical technology market.
This transaction marks a major step forward in realizing our vision to become the premier solution provider of highly engineered, single-use components and delivery devices to leading medical device OEMs and emerging innovators around the world. Vention AT brings many complementary capabilities to our existing Nordson MEDICAL offering, such as complex extrusion, balloon and catheter manufacturing, nitinol forming and other specialty material expertise.

They have one of the largest design and development teams in the industry, which provide full service solutions to customers from concept design and prototyping, quality and regulatory support to finish device assembly, supporting some of the most complex and innovative interventional and advanced surgical procedures performed in healthcare today.
Vention AT also strengthens and expands our relationships with medical device OEM customers, where we will now be able to provide a broader array of solutions across a wider range of high-growth therapeutic areas, such as cardiovascular, electrophysiology, peripheral vascular, urology and neurovascular among others.
Finally, the acquisition clearly aligns with the medical growth strategy we have previously articulated and follows the other successful acquisitions we have made since 2010 to build our current Nordson MEDICAL platform, including Value Plastics, Micromedics, LinkTech Quick Couplings and Avalon Catheters.
We see Vention AT as an ideal complement to our current offering, which includes single-use fluid management components, biomaterial delivery devices and high-end cannula and tubing. We estimate the total addressable market for the combination of Nordson MEDICAL and Vention AT to be in excess of $4 billion and growing at a high single-digit low double-digit rate. We expect the Vention AT transaction to close by the end of our second quarter. We look forward to bringing our combined capabilities to the many leading medical device OEM customers we currently share and expanding our reach to new customers.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Greg to address additional financial aspects of these acquisitions.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Thank you, Jeff. As with the Plas-Pak acquisition, we expect Vention AT to enhance Nordson's top and bottom-line growth and be accretive to total company EBITDA margins. Vention AT sales for the 12 months ended January 31, 2017 were approximately $150 million with EBITDA of $48 million. $705 million purchase price represents an EBITDA multiple of 14.7 times, in line with similar multiples paid for other high quality properties in the medical space.
Initial identified cost synergies are modest and in the range of approximately $5 million. Including these benefits, the purchase price represents a synergized EBITDA multiple of 13.3 times. Assuming a close on Vention AT during our second fiscal quarter, we expect $0.05 to $0.10 accretion to EPS in fiscal year 2017 from all four acquisitions, including estimated purchase accounting charges.
Once we close and get further into our valuation work on purchase price allocation, we'll provide further updates on expected EPS accretion. The Vention AT deal will be funded with cash and debt. Our net debt to EBITDA is approximately 1.8 times at the end of the first quarter. Based on our guidance for the second quarter and including trailing 12 month EBITDA for these four acquisitions, our net debt to EBITDA is forecasted at approximately 3 times after close. As we have demonstrated historically, our consistent levels of cash flow allow us to delever quickly.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Thank you, Jeff and Greg. I want to welcome all the employees of ACE, Interselect and Plas-Pak and upon close Vention Medical AT to Nordson. We look forward to growing these great businesses in the months and years ahead. From an overall perspective, Nordson is firing on all cylinders right now. Thanks to the hard work of our team and the value we bring to our customers. We are executing on our growth strategy and the various initiatives we have to drive continuous improvement across the company.
With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator

And our first question comes from Jeff Hammond with KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey, good morning, guys.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning, Jeff.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Hey, congratulation on this deal. Just can you walk through where you see the synergies, the $5 million and then just talk about where there is kind of the greatest customer overlap? And I think you mentioned kind of international opportunities. Just kind of touch on all those synergies. Thanks.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. I'll just make a couple of comments. The synergy level is relatively modest as this is sort of a fourth pillar to our platform from a medical device standpoint. Obviously there will be some we'd see from the leverage of our procurement capability and then maybe some other cost improvement opportunities. We haven't included any revenue synergies here, although we do think and we have shown in the past that we've been able to demonstrate incremental top-line revenue by cross-selling across our product lines with the relationships that we have with key OEMs.
As far as the specifics on the customer side, this is a relatively concentrated group of OEM customers, and what this does for us is give us access to essentially all of the large OEM customers. But at the same time, this business has done a nice job with – through the emerging innovators and it gives us access to the broader part of our product line to some of these emerging innovators. So, that's an interesting opportunity. And then as you said, a lot of the big customers are global and can help translate this business more globally, so we feel pretty good about the position of the business.
Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then just a quick follow-up here on Advanced Tech, can you just give us an update on what you're seeing from a quoting activity, customer tone standpoint as you kind of enter this more seasonally strong, maybe just comment on what you're seeing from the Chinese OEMs automation wise, anything around major smartphone upgrades, that'd be helpful. Thanks.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. I would say, let's sort of split this up into a couple of buckets.
On the electronics side of the business, we're clearly seeing our approach to diversification playing out here. So, yeah, we're seeing good interest from the local mobile guys in China, but we also have more applications that go to in the automobile, electronics space and some of these new additions that we've added give us an even bigger footprint there on that automotive electronics space. But we're also seeing good penetration because of our new products into that wafer related processing, both the deposition through ASYMTEK and the inspection part of the business as well. So kind of what the story we've seen over the last few quarters is continuing there. We do see a lot of interest at least in terms of project activity on the mobile side. Again, at this point in time, you never know which ones of those are really going to come forward.
And then if you look at the other part of the business, in our fluid management business, we're seeing solid business in a lot of general industry applications, fluid formulators, as well as activity in the electronics-related space. And then on medical, we're seeing strong opportunities in our medical business, related to our new products and our broadening product line there. So pretty solid activity across the board. Now also, we're up against that point of time where we start to see the business pickup, orders pickup, so we do have as the year goes on, for comps in the business as well.

Jeffrey Hammond - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Thanks, Mike.
Operator
And our next question comes from Liam Burke with Wunderlich. Your line is open.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Greg.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning, Liam.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning, Liam.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Mike, could we go over to the adhesives and could you give us some color on how the polymer business has been doing?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. So on the adhesives side of the business, the parts of the business that supports sort of consumer-related products, food and beverage other consumer related products, like packaging are doing well, our product assembly business is strong. Nonwoven business is a little soft, but that's against a really strong comparison last year. As you look at our polymer area, our dies business has picked up as the extrusion business has started to improve. We are seeing a little softness in the injection molding area, as we see some of the things like the auto business maybe start to slow down from a growth perspective a little bit. But in our melt delivery and our pelletizing business we expect to see this be a solid year, although, maybe a little lumpy, because particularly the pelletizing piece tends to be very project-specific. So, I'd say the business is improving, not quite as robust as we'd like to see, but improving.
Liam D. Burke - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Okay. Thank you. And on the Vention acquisition, you mentioned there was discussion of the customer overlap or non-overlap. Is there any leveragability on the R&D front or on the production front?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
I'd say on the production front, down the road there could be. On the R&D side, I think it's complementary capability, but at this point we haven't factor that in. Jeff, I don't know if you want to comment anymore on that.
Jeffrey Alan Pembroke - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. I would just say on the manufacturing front, one of the things that this acquisition brings us is a new position into complex extrusion, balloon blowing and manufacturing and nitinol forming some other things. So, it's really complementary to what we do today, with some very specialized facilities that they have. So, probably not so much on the manufacturing side. On the design and front end, there are certain aspects of how we design products across the different medical product platforms that we can take advantage of envelope technology from one area and use it in other, so we do think there's some opportunity there.

And our next question comes from Charley Brady with SunTrust. Your line is open.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning, Charley.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
On this acquisition of Vention, you guys have talked about getting life sciences platform to $300 million, $400 million size, this certainly jumps at really closely to the bottom-end of that market. I'm just wondering it is guys obviously another piece of the business you really weren't into minimally invasive technologies. As you add this pieces of business, are there additional tack-on pieces to the one you just did that further broadens up the capabilities or as we look to life science M&A, this kind of it for a while you're going to focus on other areas in terms of M&A?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. So let me make a couple of comments, Charley. So, first of all, we feel like we're getting a lot of capability with this particular acquisition and particularly, as you mentioned in the minimally invasive space, which is probably the highest growth space within the medical device marketplace ,so we like that.

That said, across all of our businesses in the medical space, there's still a degree of fragmentation there, there's still a fair bit of work that's done in-house from the OEMs, that trend continues to outsource that. So, we see good organic growth opportunities and we do see opportunities to add additional capability down the road. But obviously, this is a sizable scale play for us and puts us well on the way to getting this business to something that down the road could be a $0.5 billion business for us.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Right. But I just want to go back, in your prepared remarks, on the orders for Adhesive Dispensing, I wasn't sure if I heard correctly. You talked about I think the tenure of orders through the quarter or through the 12 weeks, they had obviously ended up at 12 weeks down 1%, but I thought I heard you say that for the majority of the time they were actually up. Could you just clarify that?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. When you do the sort of point-to-point analysis, you can have a real strong week drop-off, and that's basically what we're seeing. And we think there's some timing around the year-on-year comparisons well, so we had solid orders and sort of in the last week, we had a period of time, where we had some very large orders last year that dropped out of that comparison. So, we feel pretty good about what we see, as I said across the businesses in terms of interest, particularly in the consumer non-durable related space, it was our packaging. As I said, this year the nonwovens area is going to be a little bit of a challenge, because we have such a strong year, last year with a lot of recapitalization, but we feel pretty good about the opportunities and prospects.
That said, it's still an uncertain global kind of environment here. And so we feel pretty good about the opportunities that we see.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
And, Charley, just to put a little more color on that, it also highlights, in that segment, we've got some larger dollar product lines, so as those orders come in in one given week, if that happens to be a week that drops-off for an incoming week, it could impact that total 12-week view. But again, the comment was to suggest, if you look on a week-by-week basis within that 12 weeks, order rates were pretty robust.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.
Yeah. Okay. That's the point I was actually trying to just clarify. So, that is very helpful. And just one more for me, did you guys give a gross margin forecast for the second quarter?
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. We did. An operating margin?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Gross margin.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Gross margin, we suggest it would be 56% in the quarter.
Charles Brady - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.

And our next question comes from Matt Summerville of Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is open.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
Thanks. Good morning. I want to talk about...
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Hi, Matt.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
...Vention again for a moment. Can you talk about, you mentioned the $4 billion sort of TAM for your core Nordson MEDICAL, if you will, and then the recent acquisitions sort of combined, including Vention, how big is Vention's addressable market as a subset of that? And can you speak directly to the competitive environment, who the players are, what the relative market share position looks like?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. So, I'll let Jeff probably add some color to that. But getting into the minimally invasive space dramatically increases the available market to us. So, probably two-thirds of that $4 billion really falls into that minimally invasive space. At a high level, there are a couple of key competitors. There is a company called Integer that's a competitor in this space. And then TE's Creganna business is a competitor in this space. We feel good about our full capability from a solutions provider standpoint. There is a bunch of smaller folks out there, so opportunities for the future. And then, there's a still a fair bit of work that's done in-house by large OEMs, but the trend continues to be to outsource that and focus more on the end device. Jeff, I don't know whether you want to add any additional color there?

Jeffrey Alan Pembroke - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. So, Mike, I think you had it right from that addressable market that we quantified about two-thirds of that would be in the Vention area, really related to minimally invasive interventional delivery devices and those sorts of things. The total outsource market for medical device OEMs is in excess of $40 billion. So, we're only talking about a portion of that, which is really the highly engineered differentiated piece. And, as Mike mentioned earlier in the call, there is additional opportunity that the OEMs continue to do in-house that more and more increasingly is being outsourced. And from a competitor standpoint, Mike mentioned, a couple, that we would see a directly against Vention AT. The market remains fairly fragmented as well with several other competitors out there as well.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
And then just a couple of follow-ups on just sticking with Vention. It looks like about a month ago, Vention completed an acquisition of a nitinol wire manufacturer. Can you speak to the significance of that acquisition, what that technology adds to Vention? And, then, whether these products or even, Mike, maybe in core Nordson MEDICAL to the extent anything that's being done here falls under some sort of Federal regulatory umbrella? Thank you.
Jeffrey Alan Pembroke - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. Mike, you want me to take that?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. Go ahead.
Jeffrey Alan Pembroke - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. So, what you'll find in these types of businesses that are technology based, a lot of the differentiation comes from your ability to manufacture, convert, and design around very specialty materials. And so, the addition of nitinol to Vention's capabilities, nickel, titanium, which is basically a very biocompatible material with shape memory, so it can be used transcatheter. You can shape it, get it through a catheter, arrive at a point and it goes back to its original shape to perform the function that it was meant to perform. So it's a material that is becoming more widely used in medical devices. And so the acquisition that Vention made was a company that has unique ability in forming nitinol into very complex shapes. So we do see that as a significant capability that we could take and expand to other applications and other customers.
As it relates to the regulatory and FDA, so Vention would be subject to similar levels of regulatory risk and FDA burden that we experience in some of our current Nordson MEDICAL business today. Vention's liability is limited to the extent, they do not own 510(k) or device registrations. But they're subject to standard medical device quality standards and manufacturing practices, which are audited from time to time by the FDA. However this is common, and something that again we experience today within parts of our Nordson MEDICAL business.
Matt J. Summerville - Alembic Global Advisors LLC
Appreciate the color. Thank you.

And our next question comes from Chris Dankert with Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Josh L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
Hi guys, this is actually Josh, in for Chris. Thanks for taking my call and congrats on the quarter and the recent flurry of M&A. I guess the first one we have is – so Vention looks like a huge win at a really accretive price. So I guess are there any other medical deals out there that have a similar scale to Vention and such accretive margins or is this sort of a unicorn?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Well, I would say, in terms of the margin side, our focus is really on differentiated capability and so everything that we're looking to acquire in this space, whether it's the minimally invasive space that we're talking about here or the other products that we've already acquired, it's around being able to differentiate capabilities, so that you can provide the right solution for customers, create value and get paid for it. So there are other opportunities out there that we continue to look at across all of the product lines within our medical business.

I think this is a nice move from a scale perspective. There may be some others out there – there's certainly things that we're interested in, but really not in a point to talk about anything right now. So I'd say there's more opportunity, this is a good move from us from a scale point, but more importantly from the capability that it gives us the market segment that it opens up to us in a big way and the ability to kind of reinforce the broader capability we have with a consistent group of customers.
Josh L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
Okay, perfect. And I guess the follow up over into ADS, it seems like things has slowed a bit in EMEA. Any color you could provide there or is this just a one-off or you've seen anything slowing ex-packaging there?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
As I said, I think, in this particular quarter as you look at the order rates, it's more probably larger project related kind of thing than anything else. What I would say is across the board, the sort of consumer non-durable space looks solid right now and that's why packaging looks solid. There's some good opportunities in the product assembly area that looks solid. Nonwovens is operating at a high level, but it's got a really tough comp last year, we did get a number of significant recapitalization. So, it's got a tough comp there. I'd say our dies businesses are improving. We're starting to see our core components pick up as well as the melt delivery in terms of opportunities out there, palletizing is lumpy, but we think it will be a good year but it's going to lumpy.
So I'd say the big project mix is the one thing that's hard to predict and that's the one area that can move things around, that's both in say product assembly and some of the lesser extent nonwovens I mean and some things like palletizing. So, we think the opportunities are good, we've got tough comparables in that business.
Josh L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC
All right. Perfect. Thanks.

And our next question comes from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Yeah, Hi guys. Good morning.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning, Allison.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
With the incremental additions including Vention, how should we think about the seasonality with that ATS business, I imagine it's a bit more smooth than it's been historically going forward?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
I'd say on the seasonality, yeah, probably a little bit. But if you think about it, we're still going to see the kind of holiday effects that we see in most of our businesses in the first quarter. So, I'd say seasonality wise, there's probably a little improvement. Obviously from a cyclicality standpoint it's part of a specific strategy that we have to try and balance out that segment where we have more cyclicality in the electronics related parts of the business.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. And then on ETFs, I guess just in this optimism of the Trump administration right now, I know you've talked about backlog and orders, but in terms of inquiries have you seen sort of a mix towards these larger projects starting to come through, particularly if you look to the U.S. there are no change there yet. Just any thoughts on that?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. I would say we've not seen any dramatic change associated with the proposed policies that the President has talked about, but for some bigger projects it would take a little longer for those to materialize anyway. I mean, I think when you look at something for example like the auto industry we kind of supported wherever it is. So, they move from place to place, but we generally view that as an opportunity and one of the stronger sort of end markets. But we haven't really seen anything that we could identify as an uptick associated with the proposed policies.

Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC

And our next question comes from Walter Liptak with Seaport Global. Your line is open.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning, Walt.
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Good morning.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC
I want to ask you about the Vention Medical acquisition, and I wonder if you can help us understand a little bit more about how the business was organized and the part of the business that you didn't acquire, and I guess it was for sale, so why didn't you acquire? Are there any relationships that are going to be continuing from that either way as a supply relationship et cetera?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. So, I'll just make a couple of high level comments. I mean the overall Vention business was put together through a series of acquisitions, some more focused on, I'd say the service side of the business and some more focused on through the technology side of the business. And the owners in the process decided to split this up into sort of two pieces and as we said, before, we like the position, where you have the opportunity to be a solutions provider to the customer, where you've got differentiated capability and we certainly saw that in the Vention AT business, and that's why we were most interested in that particular business. There will be modest ongoing relationship between the two businesses and contracts to cover that, but it's not significant in terms of the total. So, they operated as fairly independent businesses.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And, so the manufacturing locate, they're not going to be contract manufacturing for Vention AT?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
No, there's some products that go back and forth, it's a very de minimis amount and we'll have agreements in place to address those, but it's not significant. There are – as Jeff had mentioned, there's certain capabilities with each of these sites that are important, and quite frankly the locations are important from medical device, particularly front-end design standpoint. So, we really like the locations that we have and the presence we have in sort of the hot bed (44:55) markets of the medical design space.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Great. And then switching gears back to adhesives. I wonder if you can talk a little bit more about the polymers business, you mentioned that it was little bit soft for injection molding, were those comments specifically to automotive or is it, because that's kind of across the board, sort of a product or what are you thinking about for the full year in capital spending in that plastics area?
Michael F. Hilton - Nordson Corp.
Yeah. So I would say, we're encouraged by the activity that we see in terms of the opportunities. I'd say, we're finally starting to see some of the extrusion in the film part of the business pickup and that shows up most in our dies business, which is looking better. I'd say the injection molding part of the business has been on a strong run, up to about six months to nine months ago, where it's slowed down a little bit and I'd say that part is continuing.
So I'd say we expect to see it to be a positive year from a growth perspective, but a lot of these are bigger projects, we're working on them now, they need to come through to have an impact in the year. But I'd say we're encouraged by what we're seeing from an opportunity standpoint, but it's not everything working in concert much like the core Adhesives business, where we've got a couple parts of the business looking pretty attractive and other parts up against tougher comps, and not quite as attractive right now.

But again, anything that's really more consumer nondurable related is looking pretty strong and the durable piece is I'd say at a good level, but not strong as we might have seen in parts of last year.
Walter Scott Liptak - Seaport Global Securities LLC
Okay. Great. All right. Thank you.

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Nordson Corporation Webcast for First Quarter Fiscal Year 2015. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Jaye, Director of Investor Relations. Please begin.
James R. Jaye - Director-Investor Relations & Communications
Thank you, Latoya, and good morning. This is Jim Jaye, Nordson's Director of Investor Relations. I'm here with Mike Hilton, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Greg Thaxton, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'd like to welcome you to our conference call today, Wednesday, February 25, 2015, on Nordson's FY 2015 first quarter results and second quarter outlook.
Our conference call is being broadcast live on our webpage at nordson.com/investors, and will be available there for 14 days. There will be a telephone replay of our conference call available until March 4, 2015, which can be accessed by calling 404-537-3406. You will need to reference ID number 797703908.
During this conference call, forward-looking statements may be made regarding our future performance, based on Nordson's current expectations. These statements may involve a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors as discussed in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that could cause actual results to differ. After our remarks, we'll have a question-and-answer session.
I'll now turn the call over to Mike Hilton for an overview of our fiscal year 2015 first quarter results, and a bit about our second quarter outlook. Mike, please go ahead?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for attending Nordson's 2015 first quarter conference call. Nordson's team continue to perform at a high level and delivered record first quarter sales and earnings per share.
I'm particularly pleased with the 8% organic sales volume growth we delivered in the quarter compared to the same period a year ago. This growth was broad-based across the majority of our product lines and geographies, and quite impressive given the challenges presented by a weak macroeconomic environment.
Operating margin in the quarter improved 2 percentage points compared to the prior year, and diluted earnings per share grew 28% compared to the first quarter a year ago, the rate significantly outpacing the strong top line growth. While these results were strong, they were also impacted by the effect of negative currency translation compared to the first quarter a year ago.
Looking ahead, our current backlog and order rates are very strong, up 14% for the latest 12 weeks as compared to prior year.
We expect to see solid sequential revenue improvement in the second quarter, though year-over-year results will be impacted by currency headwinds, given the current exchange rates. I'll speak more about our outlook and current business trends in a few moments.

But first, I'll turn the call over to Greg Thaxton, our Chief Financial Officer, who'll provide more detailed commentary on our current results and our second quarter guidance. Greg?
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Thank you, and good morning to everyone. Sales in the quarter were $379 million, an increase of 5.4% over the prior year's first quarter. This sales improvement included, and I'm rounding here, an 8% increase in organic volume, a 3% increase related to the first year effective acquisitions, and a 5% decrease related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation. This strength of the organic growth in the quarter highlights the benefits of our business model, and the value that we bring to our customers.
Looking at sales performance for the quarter by segment, Adhesive Dispensing segment sales volume decreased less than 1% as compared to the prior-year first quarter. Organic growth was solid in product lines serving disposable hygiene, general product assembly, rigid packaging, and plastic injection, end markets. We continue to see softness in plastic extrusion, and polymer compounding and palletizing end markets.
Sales volume in the Advanced Technology segment increased 38% over the prior year first quarter. Organic volume growth was very strong at 29%, and the first year effect of the Avalon and Dima acquisitions added 10% growth. Organic growth was robust in automated dispensing product lines, serving mobile device end markets, and advanced semiconductor packaging applications, as well as our fluid management product lines serving electronics, general industrial assembly, and medical end markets.
Sales volume in the Industrial Coating segment increased 4% compared to the first quarter a year ago. The growth was driven by demand for our cold materials and powder coating product lines. Gross margin for the total company in the first quarter was 55%, one percentage point higher than the level delivered in the prior year, primarily due to segment and product mix.
Operating profit in the quarter was $63 million, an increase of 17% over the prior year, and operating margin was 17%, an improvement of 2 percentage points over the prior year's first quarter. Currency negatively impacted gross margin and operating margin in the quarter by approximately 1%.
Looking at operating performance on a segment basis, Adhesive Dispensing delivered operating margin of 22% in the current quarter. Excluding the effects of currency, operating margin would have been equal to the prior year's performance on slightly lower sales volume.
Within the Advanced Technology segment, operating margin was 20% in the first quarter or 21% excluding short-term purchase accounting charges related to the step-up in value of acquired inventory. This is an improvement of 10 percentage points as compared to the same period a year ago – excuse me, and reflects strong operating leverage on the increased volume. Operating margin performance for the segment was also negatively impacted by about 1% due to currency.
In the Industrial Coating segment, operating margin was 7% in the first quarter or 8% excluding the negative impact of currency. This performance reflects the seasonally lower first quarter sales volume, typical of this segment and a greater mix of engineered systems revenue compared to the same period a year ago. Given the typical seasonality pattern of this segment, we would expect to generate significant operating leverage on higher volume as the year progresses.
Corporate expense in the quarter was up $1.7 million compared to the prior year. This increase is related to one-time settlement cost of a pension obligation for a business we sold in 2010. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%, reflecting the retroactive benefit of the 2014 R&D tax credit.

Continuing down the income statement, net income for the quarter was $43 million. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.69, an increase of 28% over the last year's first quarter. As in previous quarters, we've included an earnings per share reconciliation schedule in our press release to reconcile between GAAP earnings and normalized earnings per share to exclude certain one-time items.
The current quarter's EBITDA was $79 million, up 16% as compared to the same period a year ago. Cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $26 million, and free cash flow before dividends was $9 million. Free cash flow compared to the prior year was impacted by an increase in working capital mostly related to the timing of receivable collections, and construction costs for our previously announced fluid management facility in Colorado. We expect free cash flow in the second quarter to benefit from the collection of these receivables as we trend back towards typical days sales outstanding. We have included a table with our press release reconciling net income to free cash flow before dividends.
We continued our balanced approach to capital deployment during the quarter, distributing approximately $14 million in dividends and investing $71 million for the repurchase of shares. Shares repurchased in the quarter more than offset the estimated dilutive effect of shares to be distributed for employee benefit programs during the year.
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain very liquid, with net debt to EBITDA at 1.9 times trailing 12-month EBITDA as of the end of the first quarter.
I'll now move on to comments regarding our outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. As we typically do, we've provided our most recent order data, both on a segment and geographic basis with our press release. These orders are for the latest 12 weeks, as compared to the same 12 weeks of the prior year on a currency neutral basis, and with the Avalon and Dima acquisitions, included in both years. For the 12 weeks ending February 15, 2015, order rates are up 14% as compared to the same 12 weeks in the prior year.
Within the Adhesive Dispensing segment, order rates were up 6% over the last 12 weeks as compared to the same period in the prior year, where we generated order growth in all four Adhesive product lines.
In the Advanced Technology segment, order rates over the latest 12 weeks are up 18%, compared to the same period in the prior year, where we generated very strong growth rates in both our electronics system product lines, and fluid management product lines. Mobile device, advanced packaging, general industrial, and medical end markets are the primary drivers of growth for this segment.
Within the Industrial Coating segment, the latest 12-week order rates are up 39%, as compared to the prior year. Order rates were strong across nearly all product lines. On a total company basis, orders were strong in all regions except Europe, which was down slightly from the prior year, due to the timing of larger nonwoven system orders and softness in certain end markets served by our polymer product lines.
Backlog at January 31, 2015, was approximately $230 million, an increase of 8% compared to January 31 of 2014, and inclusive of 6% organic growth, and 2% growth due to the Avalon and Dima acquisitions. Current backlog increased 8% compared to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. These backlog amounts are calculated at January 31, 2015 exchange rates.
Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2015. We're forecasting sales to be in the range of down 5% to down 1% as compared to the second quarter a year ago. This range is inclusive of organic growth of down 1% to up 3%; 3% growth from the first year effective acquisitions and a negative 7% impact related to the unfavorable effects of currency translation based on current exchange rates.

At the midpoint of our sales forecast, we expect second quarter gross margin to be 55%, and operating margin is forecasted to be 20%. We're estimating second quarter interest expense of about $4 million, and an effective tax rate of approximately 30%, resulting in second quarter forecasted GAAP diluted earnings in the range of $0.80 per share to $0.90 per share.
We're forecasting the full-year effective tax rate, excluding discrete items to be about 30% based on current tax law. We also expect normal maintenance capital spending for the full-year to be between $45 million to $50 million.
In addition, we estimate approximately $13 million remaining in capital expenditures associated with the our previously announced investment for a new facility in Colorado, supporting our fluid management product lines, the bulk of which will be spent in the second quarter.
To add a few additional comments related to currency, assuming exchange rates for the rest of fiscal 2015 remain where they are today, we expect currency translation to negatively impact full-year sales by about 5%.
We also estimate currency will negatively impact full-year gross margin and operating margin by approximately 1%.
In terms of the currency impact on earnings per share, our historical results have shown that, for every 1% change to sales related to currency translation, EPS is impacted approximately 2.5 times that amount in the same direction. This currency impact is due to the translation effect of converting foreign currency sales and costs back to U.S. dollars, which is not hedged. We have for a long-time hedged our cash exposure by using forward contracts.
Getting back to first quarter results in summary, our global team delivered a very strong first quarter. We have strong order momentum leading into our second quarter, although the impact of negative currency translation, and the expected timing of shipments for this strong order activity will impact sales in the second quarter. Mike will share more comments relative to the current pace of the business, and our view of sales for fiscal 2015.
With that, I'll turn the call over back to you, Mike.
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Thank you, Greg. Before taking your questions, as Greg noted, I'd like to provide some additional comments on our recent performance and outlook. First, I want to thank our global team again for their hard work, their commitment to our customers propel Nordson to a very solid start to our year.
At the midpoint of our second quarter guidance, we're expecting sequential sales growth of about 7%, which we should leverage to delivering operating margin approximately 3 percentage points higher than the first quarter, and earnings per share that are 23% higher than the first quarter.
As Greg mentioned, on a year-over-year basis, we do expect currency translation to remain a significant headwind to revenue and earnings growth in the second quarter and full-year, given current exchange rates. Excluding this currency translation effect, our underlying business remains sound. Our backlog is solid and 12-week order rates are up a strong 14% compared to the same period a year ago.
This growth in organic orders are impressive, given the challenging macroeconomic environment. Given the strength, you might expect our organic growth in the second quarter to exceed the 1% level we are forecasting at the midpoint of our guidance, as we typically have a strong correlation between order growth rates and the outlook for the next quarter.
To help reconcile this, let me provide some additional color. First, timing does play a role here as the current backlog does include some longer lead time items that are expected to benefit the third quarter. This is particularly true within Advanced Technology and Industrial Coatings segments.

In addition, we're optimistic as to our likely success on various projects that are not yet in our backlog, that should generate revenue beyond the second quarter. Our participation in these large dollar projects reflects the consultative approach in applications expertise we bring to our customers, and in several cases is being driven by innovative Nordson technology; due to the competitive reasons and customer confidentiality agreements regarded with the details we can share at this time. Directionally however, we can provide some general commentary.
While we're not providing a specific forecast beyond our second quarter, we are optimistic that the current backlog, current order growth rates and project momentum will drive double-digit organic growth in the second half of our year, as compared to the prior year, resulting in high single-digit organic growth for the full-year.
From a broader perspective, there are many reasons we continue to feel good about our longer-term prospects. While we can't control currency or other aspects of the macroeconomic environment, there are many things we can control, and that is where we were focused. The worst of these is innovative technology. Nordson earned 211 patents in 2014, driven by our envision process, we continue to introduce products that provide tangible benefits to our customers and are helping to drive organic growth.
Second is continuous improvement. The Nordson Business System is our set of tools and best practices for driving improvement in all value streams across the company. We continue to ingrain the Business System in all we do.
Third is, adding to the portfolio through targeted and strategic acquisitions. We continue to evaluate opportunities in the spaces we've talked about previously, and are working to optimize our integration processes deliver value faster.
Finally, we're focused on making a strong team even better. Our talent management and development initiatives continue to gain momentum, ensuing we're equipped to capture the growth opportunities that we see.
Overall, we're focused on providing our customers with the best experience in the industries we serve, and delivering excellent shareholder returns over the long-term. And we will continue our balanced approach for capital allocation, including returning value directly to shareholders with dividends and remaining prudent with regards to our share repurchase activity, and executing on appropriate acquisition opportunities.
At this time, let me turn to your questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. And the first question is from Joe Radigan of KeyBanc. Your line is now open.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Good morning, guys.
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Joe.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Mike, maybe we can start with your comments around the timing in the second quarter. Can you provide any more granularity in terms of growth by segment? I mean, obviously you've got some longer lead time stuffs in ICS, but orders are fairly good in Adhesives and that tends to be to be relatively short cycle, it sounds like there's some longer lead time stuff in Advanced Tech, but there's a – you have a relatively easy comp on a year-over-year basis, and orders were up almost 20% there, and that business has been growing at a double-digit clip here for, I think three consecutive quarters. So can you maybe reconcile the growth by what you're expecting by segment?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Joe, you did hit the – sort of the key areas that tend to have bigger projects, and bigger projects tend to be a little bit longer lead item. We also have projects in here where our customers have asked for sort of phased deliveries, so that's also a part of what we're seeing, and that falls into the two areas, in particular that you mentioned the Industrial Coatings and the Advanced Technology area.

There are elements of our plastics business that have some longer lead time orders like our pelletizing business that also impact that. So from our perspective, what we've seen is more of systems orders, which is encouraging, and some of those are phased from a delivery standpoint, and that's really the main fact – chalk it up essentially timing.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then, in terms of the cadence of orders that you saw through the 12-week period, first quarter is typically a soft spot in the customer capital cycle, did you see orders – order rate strengthen in recent weeks, can you kind of talk about how that develop?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Yeah, Joe, as you know it's soft because of the holiday period, and it tends to – as we talked about in the past, orders tend to get to a low-point, sort of over the holidays, right after the New Year, and then start to pickup, and we absolutely did see that trend where each of the last few weeks has gotten stronger, generally across most businesses.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. And then, maybe lastly, in terms of the operating margin, at the midpoint of your guidance, I think you said, that's expected to be about 20%, that's almost a 250 basis point or about a 250 basis point decline year-over-year, some of that, probably 100 basis points of that I think is the FX, but is there a mix factor as well in the second quarter, in terms of the timing of engineered versus standard stuff?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So you've – currently have the currency is a significant impact. And then when you look at things, volume is relatively soft and actually down a little bit, so we get a little bit of a negative leverage there, relative to our spend base. So it's not anything that we're alarmed about, again, I think it's largely the timing issue on the organic piece, and we're really pretty encouraged by the prospects that we see in addition to orders already in hand.
The currency piece, as Greg said, we're going to deal with over the next couple of quarters, and it is a strong headwind and it does impact margin to the tune of about 100 basis points, maybe a little more in the second quarter, and a little less as we go throughout the year.
Joe K. Radigan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.
Okay. Thanks, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Charlie Brady of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.
Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, Charlie.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Hi, Charlie.
Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Hey, could you give us a sense of what the parts business look like in the quarter, was there any – I guess, I'm trying to parse out if that had any meaningful impact on the margins, particularly at Adhesive Dispensing?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Year-over-year, it was pretty much the same as last year, around I think, 43% or 44%, Charlie, so no significant impact. Adhesives is one of the areas where we feel the biggest impact from a currency perspective.
Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Right, Right. I just want to go back to Jeff's question on the segment organic growth, particularly on Adhesive Dispensing, because if I'm hearing you correctly, that one – and I guess, some in the plastics, but the majority of this long lead time or phase-in of orders is happening in ICS and Advanced Tech not so much in Adhesive Dispensing. So can you give us a sense of what you're looking for kind of on organic growth, just on the Adhesive Dispensing in Q2?

Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Well, I think overall for the year we're thinking – the things will be consistent with our long-term kind of growth rates. I think in the second quarter, we're looking for things to be a little bit less, and then – and pick up based on some of the orders, trends coming in.
So not too atypical when you look at sort of the more traditional Adhesives. The one area that is strong right now, but can be lumpy is the product assembly piece, because those tend to be bigger systems orders as well. But nothing atypical that we see here in terms of progress on that part of the business. We're engaged by what we see across most of the product lines.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
And Charlie, it's Greg. I'd just add, quarter-to-quarter we might see some trends – softening trend in one quarter versus the next. But as Mike mentioned, if we look at that business on a longer-term basis, kind of across the year, we'd expect to see kind of that – that typical mid single-digit kind of growth rate in Adhesives.
Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Yeah. I guess, I'm just trying to square it up, because you had 6% order growth in the quarter, which was – that's a good solid order number for Adhesives. And I'm not hearing that you have a lot of longer lead time phase-in on the Adhesive side. So I'm – unless I'm hearing it incorrectly, so I guess, I'm just trying to square up 6% really good order growth, but maybe not translating into the same kind of growth organically in Q2, am I correct, or I mean, is there stuff that is being phased in like the other two segments, or am I missing a piece here?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
It's mainly on the plastic side, that the – particularly the pelletizer business, that tends to be a little bit longer lead times. So you're seeing that sort of impacted in the near-term. There is nothing unusual in the Adhesive side. As Greg said, you can have some one quarter and other movement based on some orders, and typically those orders will be in the product assembly area that's been pretty strong for us here of late. So nothing unusual there, but we do have our orders in the plastic side, that are little bit longer lead time and that's pulling that number down in the short-term.
Charles D. Brady - BMO Capital Markets (United States)
Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Allison Poliniak of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Hi, guys. Good morning.
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey, good morning.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Hi, Allison.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Just want to go back to operating margins, particularly as we look to the back half, you talked about currency headwinds, and it sounds like there's some system headwind there. I'm just trying to marry that with the expected volume improvement. I mean, is it going to be, I mean, should we sort of expect that acceleration on the EBIT side as well?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Absolutely. I mean, I think you know that we've got tremendous incremental margin leverage on volume. So in a typical year, we'll see margin improve from the first quarter throughout the year as volumes improve just on a seasonal basis, and this year based on some of these orders stretching into the third quarter, and what we see from a project list and some new technology introductions, we expect to see that volume lift later in the year, and with that you'll see the margin lift that we typically see across the quarters with volume.

Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Okay. And then just, even on the second half, you noted some confidence in the second half acceleration in top line growth, is there any segment or end market specifically that you're probably a little bit more concerned about as we look to the back half of the year?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
I'd say the growth across most of our segments looks solid. There could be certain end markets that are a little soft here, but we're making them up in others. I'd say, more concern would be around geography, and just because some of the geographies are struggling from a economic perspective.
So when you think about the Americas, particularly Latin America, Europe is not as robust and Japan is more of a mixed bag. That said, some of the other geographies have been considerably stronger. So I'd say, it's more of a mixed bag on geography than end market applications.
There are obviously some that are pretty strong, and things like auto, medical, electronics, applications including wireless, those kind of things are generally pretty strong. We've got new areas where we're interested in, that are picking up, but for us also, we're introducing a lot of new products this year, I would categorize in the singles category, a nice new incremental growth opportunities or recapitalization opportunities, that I think will also help in our – getting some traction.
Allison A. Poliniak-Cusic - Wells Fargo Securities LLC
Great. Thank you so much.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from the Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks. Good morning.
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning, Chris.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
I was – wanted to go into the second half margin outlook a little bit more, I think in the past, maybe you've offered directional guidance on quantifying a range or expectation for sequential incremental margins. So given the volume outlook, it's a little different modeling this year, given the FX dynamics. So wondering if you could kind of offer some kind of vague or specific rule of thumb?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. I mean the incremental margins are significant as the volume grows throughout the year. It does depend a little bit on mix. So for example, the Industrial Coatings, given the nature of scope what we provide there, while they have very good incremental margins that are probably in the 30% kind of range, are different than what we might see in technology, which would be higher and traditional adhesives would be higher yet.
So it does depend a little bit on the mix. But we would expect to see strong incremental margins across each of the businesses as it grows throughout the year. You can see from the order rates that we're providing, Industrial Coatings is stepping up nicely and the Advanced Technology is stepping up nicely, so those mix effects will be a little bit lower than, say if all the Adhesives business was stepping up. But we would expect a pretty typical pattern as the volume grows up – grows for the rest of the year, only to be moderated a little bit by mix.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)
Thanks, that's helpful. And then at ADS, just wondering how you'd score the investments in the plastics processing at this point, I think EDI and Xaloy are coming up under – on about three years with Nordson. And just wondering, if there is any change to your view of the long-term returns and update on how you get there, the integrations et cetera?

Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. Maybe I'll just start with a comment on the – for the two major end markets that support all that business. As Greg mentioned in his comments, the plastic injection part of the end markets are doing well, and when you think about the products that are being made there, it goes into auto, it goes into electronics, it goes into medical, those areas are all doing pretty well.
When you look at the film side of the business, the film side of the business, particularly the high-end film side of the business is really struggling, while there's some increase in demand. Europe slowing, China slowing, Latin America slowing really hurt the sort of supply/demand situation on the film business.
So I'd say, we're still struggling pretty significantly on the film business that affects the dyes business the most. A different application like fluid coatings in the dyes business is doing really well, but the bigger application is struggling. So we're obviously – we're behind where we had hoped to be. And the supply/demand imbalance has not resolved itself yet. And we could be looking at another year or two before that's completely resolved, and that's a function really of the soft growth primarily outside the U.S. on the demand side at this point.
Now, as far as integration goes, we made, I think great progress on the integration of those businesses. We're focused on new products in sort of other markets that we haven't played in as much, particularly on the film side, and we're getting some traction there, and we've built up our international capability, it's allowing us to do well, particularly in Asia. So we're encouraged by that. But in the short-term, we're obviously behind where we thought we would be.
Christopher D. Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)

Thank you. And the next question is from Jason Ursaner of CJS Securities. Your line is open.
Jason M. Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.
Good morning.
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Hey Jason.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Jason M. Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.
I had a little trouble connecting and missed some of the notes around each segment. Organic growth and the order rates, obviously extremely strong, just wondering maybe if you could walk through which divisions in the Tech segment were driving that in the 12-week orders?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. It's pretty much across the – across the board. So if you look at – and the electronics part of the business is doing well in wireless, but also in more traditional advanced packaging applications have started to pick up. And if you look at some of the Gartner data, it's encouraging in that area. But also auto electronics has been strong.
And then, outside of the electronics space, a lot of general industry applications that would affect our EFD business are strong. We have a bunch of new products coming into play across our EFD business as well as our systems business. And then the medical businesses aren't really well – really driven by the broadening of our product line, and some international growth now as well. So really across the board, that looks very encouraging at the moment.
Jason M. Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And the traditional PC market, I know that, yeah, it's been a struggle, but came back to growth – at least in global numbers, and especially in the domestic market. Have you seen any of that translate in some of the more, I guess legacy applications in PC and server?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yes. We are seeing that, my comment on advanced packaging is directly related to PC, desktop, server kind of applications, both with end users and then sort of the outsourced manufacturers, we saw some encouraging orders coming through. So we're certainly starting to see that.

Jason M. Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay. And the investments you've been making in Tech, just any update on kind of where those stand, and any success on the curing side issue (35:15)?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah. So we have, on the wafer project we launched, we picked up our second big order in that business, and we have probably more than 10 significant prospects that we expect to see signed this year. So we're getting good – I think good traction on that. We're also taking advantage of expanding our local China manufacturing applications, and we have a number of new products across the – that particular systems base that we're introducing this year that we are seeing some good traction, and so it's encouraging at this point.
Jason M. Ursaner - CJS Securities, Inc.
Okay, I appreciate the commentary, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question is from Jason Rodgers of Great Lakes Review. Your line is open.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
Yes, I was wondering if you can give an update on the Freedom and Liberty systems and how that – how they play into your forecast for strong second half of the year?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, we've had an uptick on both of those products in the last couple of quarters. I think what we used to characterize last year is probably revenue exceeded expectations, volume didn't quite exceed expectations. I think that is continuing, but we have seen an uptick. The one we issue we mentioned was the availability of new adhesives that would further enhance the benefit of those particular new products has really not come to market yet.
And some of the things going on in the oil industry right now, and the supply chain probably delayed that a little bit further, but they're clearly, Freedom is top of the line, Liberty is sort of our next tiered position and we have a number of other tiered positions. So we feel pretty good about what we have to offer broadly, and then we've only recently started to offer those products in Asia. So I'd say, we're at expectations on those products, not accelerating the way we might have hoped, based on the availability of the adhesives.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review
And Greg, the pension settlement expense that you have in your press release, is that included in the selling and admin line of the income statement?
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Yeah, that is – in the segment detail, that's in corporate spending.
Jason A. Rodgers - Great Lakes Review

Thank you. The next question is from Walter Liptak of Global Hunter. Your line is open.
Walter Scott Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC
Hi, thanks. Good morning.
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Good morning, Walt.
Gregory A. Thaxton - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President
Good morning.
Walter Scott Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC
I wanted to ask about the coatings business, very strong orders there and this is the third quarter that we've seen of the strong order trend, and as I think back, through the past we've seen periods like this before, where you kind of take on a couple of quarters of increasing orders, and then my recollection is that, then it starts to slow down again. So I guess, I'd like to get some color on what's driving it, what the visibility looks like as we go further into 2015?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
Yeah, so of course, Walt. Yeah. So I would say, obviously the business itself is linked to the business cycle, and that's, I think, what you're referring to in your comments. That said, there are a number of markets that have been strong, so auto for example is one that's been strong for us. With some of our, cold materials acquisition in the Sealant Equipment business, we've been able to take that – now starting to take that internationally, we're seeing some uptick there.

And we've talked about in the past – oil and gas exploration, and what that's doing from pipe coating application, pipe coating. So I would say solid, but even in businesses that are more traditional like our container business, we're seeing good order growth, some of that is upgrades and recapitalization, which new technology helps.
So I'd say, generally it's fairly broad-based, I'd say the areas that are still a little bit – a little bit slow would be the things like coatings for recreational products, for some office furniture, things like appliances kind of go up and down a little bit, but they're generally solid.
So, I'd say the key drivers are the ones, that I've talked about here, and we've got as you look at the orders, some pretty good visibility, and – at least in the near-term. And when we look at our projects list, really across the globe, we see some pretty good activity.
Walter Scott Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC
Okay, great. It sounds good. And then just a general one on currency. Is there any fundamental impact on currency like, are you any less competitive in any markets because of the stronger dollar?
Michael F. Hilton - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director
No. If you look at – we're pretty well distributed from a supply chain standpoint, so it's really the translation impacts that you're looking at there. So no, we're not seeing any significant competitive threats there. But the degree of change particularly in Europe in the end, and to a lesser extent, the pound has impacted the translation effect, but we're not seeing a competitive dynamic given the balance in our supply chain.
Walter Scott Liptak - Global Hunter Securities, LLC

Nordson Corporation Names Michael F. Hilton as New President and Chief Executive Officer, Effective January 16, 2010
21 Dec 2009

Westlake, Ohio, USA – December 21, 2009 -  Nordson Corporation (Nasdaq: NDSN) today announced that its board of directors has named Michael F. Hilton as the company’s new president and chief executive officer, effective January 16, 2010.   Hilton, who will also join the Nordson board of directors, will succeed retiring President and Chief Executive Officer Edward P. Campbell.  Campbell will continue to serve as Nordson’s chairman of the board until the company’s February 16, 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, at which time he will be succeeded by current Nordson director Joseph P. Keithley. 
Hilton, 55, has served since September 2007 as senior vice president and general manager for Air Products and Chemicals Inc. (NYSE: APD) with specific responsibility for leading the company’s $2 billion global Electronics and Performance Materials segment.  He joins Nordson after a 33 year career at Air Products driving growth and 
performance in a number of global businesses in a series of increasingly senior leadership roles.  
“The Nordson board was enthusiastically unanimous in its selection of Hilton,” said Stephen R. Hardis, Nordson’s lead director.  “The board’s process for selecting Nordson’s next leader was a deliberate and thorough one and included the careful consideration of several worthy external and internal candidates.  Mike best fit our criteria of a diversely experienced leader who has consistently delivered shareholder value by driving strong results in sophisticated global businesses with multiple markets, customers, products, and units.  He combines his ability to execute with the highest level of personal integrity and a keen understanding of the importance of organizational culture.  We believe Mike is the ideal individual to drive Nordson’s continuing success for years to come.”   
“I am very pleased by the opportunity to build on Nordson’s outstanding record of success,” said Hilton.  “I look forward to working with the company’s deep and experienced management team to deliver the performance and global growth that customers, employees and shareholders expect.” 
Hardis also offered his congratulations to outgoing President and Chief Executive Officer Ed Campbell, who will step down from his current responsibilities upon Hilton’s arrival, and retire after a short period of transition.  “During his 21 year career at Nordson, the last 12 as chief executive officer, Ed guided the company through a period of sustained excellence.  During his tenure, he expanded the international portion of Nordson’s sales to 72 percent, led the move of Nordson into many new technology and high growth markets, and significantly improved the company’s operating results.  Total return to shareholders during Ed’s leadership as CEO averaged 9 percent per year, significantly outpacing major market indices.  He retires from Nordson having developed and mentored a strong senior leadership team, leaving the company solidly positioned for future success.”  
Current Nordson director Joseph P. Keithley, 60, will succeed Campbell as chairman of the board at the company’s annual meeting of shareholders on February 16, 2010.  Keithley is chairman, president and chief executive officer of Keithley Instruments, Inc. (NYSE: KEI), and has been a Nordson director since July 2001.
