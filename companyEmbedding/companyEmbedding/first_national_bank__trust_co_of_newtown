The management team is extremely approachable and truly make time and listen to what the employees have to say. The benefits are the best around (401k match, pension plan, 100% paid health care, paid vacation time, paid holidays, college tuition reimbursement, etc.). On most occasions, FNB hires from within, so there is plenty of room for advancement and employees are encouraged to apply for new positions. If you're a honest and trustworthy person, you will have the opportunity for a lengthy career for a well respected employer. These are just a few reasons why I'm proud to say that I work at First National Bank.ConsOff the top of my head, I can not come up with a single negative remark to say about the bank.Advice to ManagementKeep doing what you're doing! You can't please all of the people all of the time, but you sure are trying!! Keep up the good work. I've been offered "better jobs" for "more money", but I can't imagine working for any other bank.
