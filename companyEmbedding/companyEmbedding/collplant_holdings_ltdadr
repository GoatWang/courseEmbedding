What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

The patent application is a part of the company's strategy to establish its position as a leader in 3D bio-printing, and as a basis for collaborations with leading companies in the field of organ printing, in which CollPlant will constitute the biological ink supplier, in various formulations.  The patent application refers to formulations of biological ink based on recombinant human collagen, which is an ideal building block for bio-ink.SponsoredBanyan HillIt's Easily the No. 1 Stock to OwnPaul reveals his No. 1 investment for 2017 ... an investment that he says will "hand you a rare once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become ...PR Newswire•2 months agoCollPlant Provides Operational Update for Q1 2017CollPlant (CLPT.TA), a regenerative medicine company utilizing its proprietary plant-based rhCollagen (recombinant human "rhCollagen") technology for tissue repair products, provided an operational update for the first quarter ended March 31 2017.  During the period, the company continued to focus on product commercialization while pursuing its activities, including potential joint ventures with international companies, to develop biological ink (bioInk) for 3D printing of organs and tissues.  Additionally, CollPlant has substantially reduced its operating costs, chiefly as a result of last year's successful completion of clinical trials, and the transition to commercialization of its first products.Yahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)

Wound Care




    The global market for wound care encompasses traditional dressings and bandages, as well as advanced wound care products such as bioengineered skin and skin substitutes and wound care growth factors. Over the past 30 years, there has been a shift from traditional wound dressings towards advanced therapies that aim to optimize the wound healing environment. Advanced wound care is composed of biocompatible products that are intended to actively promote wound healing by interacting either directly or indirectly with wound tissues. Attempts to reduce the duration of hospital stays in order to limit healthcare costs and the goal of enhancing therapeutic outcomes are driving the demand for advanced wound care and closure products. One of the primary market drivers for advanced wound care products is the increasing incidence of chronic wounds, which are on the rise due to an aging population and a sharp rise in the incidence of diabetes and obesity worldwide. Both advanced age and chronic medical conditions are associated with a slower healing process, and all phases of wound healing are affected. The inflammatory response is decreased or delayed, as is the proliferative response. Espicom estimates that the global market for advanced wound care in 2013 had reached $6.2 billion, representing a growth rate of approximately 5% since 2012. 
With a wide range of dressings to choose from, dressing selection is a significant challenge for wound care clinicians. The ideal dressing should induce rapid healing at reasonable cost with minimal inconvenience to the patient. In a healing wound, a cascade of events occurs that includes platelet accumulation, inflammation, fibroblast proliferation, cell contraction, angiogenesis, and re epithelization, ultimately leading to scar formation and wound remodeling. Collagen plays an important role in each of these phases of wound healing. Native intact collagen provides a natural scaffold or substrate for new tissue growth. Dressings containing collagen are thought to provide the wound with an alternative collagen source that is degraded over time, leaving the endogenous native collagen to continue normal wound healing.
Advanced wound dressings have the benefit of forming part of the natural tissue matrix and some of them play an important role in natural wound healing and new tissue formation. These characteristics make them the most attractive and fastest growing segment of the overall advanced wound care market, experiencing double digit growth in 2013. In certain instances, these matrices are incorporated with compounds such as growth factors and antimicrobials for delivery to the wound site. There are a number of advanced wound care dressings available that incorporate tissue derived collagen to enhance wound bed preparation.

Orthobiologics
Wound Healing
Pipeline




 We are initially focused on the orthobiologics and advanced wound care markets. GlobalData recently estimated that the major segments of the orthobiologics market, including bone allograft, bone graft substitutes, and viscosupplementation, currently comprise an annual $6.7 billion worldwide market. The overall increase in prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders combined with technological advancements in the orthobiologics field are fueling the growth of this market, resulting in a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 7.7% in the North American market from 2014 to 2019, as predicted by MicroMarket Monitor. The advanced wound care market, which includes device based wound care, moist wound care products, and biologics, was estimated by Espicom to be $6.2 billion in 2013, representing a growth rate of approximately 5% since 2012.
We believe the market opportunity for our current product candidates utilizing our rhCollagen platform technology exceeds $5 billion.
