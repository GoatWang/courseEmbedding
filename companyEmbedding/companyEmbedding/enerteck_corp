There have been many positive developments at EnerTeck Chemical this past year. We
have completed several evaluations which have led to customer contracts, brought on three distributors who have
brought to fruition some of these customer additions and have nearly completed development of our newest emission 
reduction technology, PEx, which stands for Particulate Extraction. We are confident that upon approval PEx will 
become a significant part of our business in the years ahead and will complement our current diesel catalyst business.



About EnerTeck Chemical Corporation

 EnerTeck Corporation develops, acquires and manufactures combustion enhancement,
 emission reduction and other performance improvement technologies for the heavy duty transportation industry.
  EnerTeck's flagship product, EnerBurn®, is a diesel fuel specific combustion catalyst, delivered to the engine
   via the diesel fuel, to improve the combustion rate of the fuel.
   Our two primary products are;
EnerBurn® Diesel Fuel Combustion Catalyst
The primary benefit that EnerBurn® offers is an improvement in fuel efficiency (7-10%). Its ancillary benefits include but are not limited to:


Reduction of NOx emissions, 10-12% on average 
Reduction of exhaust smoke, 50-75%, and in some applications a total reduction of exhaust smoke, to the point where only the heat signature is visible. 
Prolonged oil life, increasing oil change intervals by approximately 75-100%, thereby reducing annual oil consumption by 40-50% 
Increased brake horsepower by 4-5%
Reduction in engine wear, which will prolong engine life and increase the time between scheduled maintenance keeping your equipment in service and earning money more days per year.

Prohibit Active DPF Regeneration Preventer
The Prohibit Active DPF Regen prohibitor technology was developed to enable heavy duty diesel engines diesel particulate filters (DPF's) to eliminate the active regen process which causes downtime to your equipment. 
 Prohibit promotes a more complete burn of the fuel and enables the engine to operate at much lower temperatures thereby substantially reducing the amount of material that makes its way to the DPF. 
 This allows the engine to function normally through its passive regen process where engine shutdowns are not necessary.
Important facts about Prohibit

Active Regen prohibitor for heavy duty diesel engine applications with DPF technology
Increases equipment uptime, saving your company valuable time and money
Enables more efficient engine operation thereby increasing engine life and a longer revenue stream for your equipment.
