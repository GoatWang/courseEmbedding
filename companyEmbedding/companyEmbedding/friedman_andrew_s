			Andrew S. Friedman		
Founding Member at Bonnett, Fairbourn, Friedman & Balint
ANDREW FRIEDMAN is Founding Member of Bonnett Fairbourn Friedman & Balint, P.C. Mr. Friedman heads the firm's class action, securities fraud, and consumer fraud practice groups. Mr. Friedman is admitted to the State Bar of Arizona and is admitted to practice before the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Friedman's practice is devoted primarily to litigation of major class action cases in federal and state courts in Arizona and throughout the United States. He has represented plaintiff classes in major consumer, securities fraud, antitrust, civil rights and insurance sales practices cases and other complex commercial litigation. Mr. Friedman and other members of the firm served as Arizona counsel for the plaintiff class of investors in In re American Continental Corp./Lincoln Savings and Loan Sec. Litig., MDL 834 (D. Ariz.). Mr. Friedman was one of the team of lawyers who represented the class of investors who purchased debentures and/or stock in American Continental Corp., the parent company of the now-infamous Lincoln Savings & Loan. The suit charged Charles Keating, Jr., other corporate insiders, three major accounting firms, law firms and others with racketeering and violations of the securities laws. Plaintiffs' counsel actively participated in bankruptcy proceedings, multi-district litigation and, ultimately, a jury trial in Tucson, Arizona. Plaintiffs successfully recovered $240 million of the $288 million in losses sustained by the investors. After trial, the jury rendered verdicts exceeding $1 billion against Keating and other defendants. Mr. Friedman also served, along with other members of the firm, on the court-appointed Executive Committee in the Prudential Limited Partnerships Multi-District Litigation, representing investors in limited partnerships sponsored by Prudential Securities. This action, which alleged racketeering and securities fraud claims on behalf of a nationwide class, resulted in a settlement providing more than $125 million in benefits to defrauded investors. Mr. Friedman and the firm were key members of a team of lawyers which brought landmark cases against major life insurance companies challenging the deceptive manner in which life insurance products were marketed to consumers during the 1980's. The first of these cases, against New York Life Insurance Co., arose from events uncovered in Arizona and resulted in a ground-breaking settlement providing benefits to class members exceeding $250 million. This settlement has been praised by regulators and commentators as an innovative solution to sales practice abuses. Subsequently, Mr. Friedman and co-counsel for plaintiffs prosecuted class actions and secured settlements against a host of other major insurance companies, including settlements with Prudential Life Insurance Company (exceeding $2 billion), Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (exceeding $1 billion), Manulife (exceeding $500 million) and more than 20 other companies. Mr. Friedman was instrumental in the prosecution of these actions, was a member of the settlement negotiating team and briefed and argued class certification issues at the trial level and in the appellate courts. Mr. Friedman and the firm, along with several other law firms, have represented African-American policy holders in class action proceedings against life insurance companies seeking relief under the Federal Civil Rights Act for racial discrimination in the sale and administration of life insurance policies. For many decades, life insurance companies routinely charged higher premiums to non-Caucasians for inferior life insurance policies. The first such action, against American General Life & Accident Company, resulted in a $250 million settlement providing benefits that included cash refunds, increased death benefits and reduced future premiums. Mr. Friedman and the firm also represent plaintiffs in similar race discrimination class actions against other life insurance companies, including Metropolitan Life, Liberty National, American National, Monumental Life, Western & Southern Life and Jefferson-Pilot Life Insurance Company. Mr. Friedman also has served as lead, co-lead or liaison counsel in many major securities fraud class actions in Arizona and elsewhere, including Persky v. Pinnacle West Corp., et al. (securities fraud class action -- $35 million settlement); Culligan International Company v. United Catalysts, Inc. (Antitrust Action); Sitgraves, et al. v. Allied Signal, Inc.; Stein v. Residential Resources, et al. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Gould v. Pinnacle West Corp., et al.; Shields v. Del Webb Corp., et al. (Securities Fraud Class and Derivative Suit); Hoexter v. Valley National Bank, et al. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Friedman, et al. v. Emerald Mortgage Investment Corporation, et al. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Marks, et al. v. Circle K (Securities Fraud Class Action); Krause v. Sierra Tucson, et al. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Braunstein, et al. v. Tucson Electric, et al. (Derivative Suit); Krause v. Sierra Pacific, et al. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Blinn v. Bech, et al. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Voss v. Cobra Industries, et al. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Hollywood Park Securities Litigation (Securities Fraud Class Action); In re America West Sec. Fraud Litig. (Securities Fraud Class Action); Orthologic Securities Fraud Litig. (Securities Fraud Litigation); and In re Vitamins Antitrust Litigation (Antitrust Class Action). Mr. Friedman has lectured at numerous continuing legal education programs, including panel discussions and presentations on the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (1996 Federal Bar Convention), prosecution of nationwide class actions in state courts (1996 ABA Annual Convention), litigation of life insurance market conduct cases (1997, 1999 and 2000 PLI conferences) and other litigation programs sponsored by the Practicing Law Institute and ALI-ABA. Mr. Friedman also has testified before the Arizona Legislature in connection with legislation on the Arizona Anti-Racketeering Act and the Arizona Securities Fraud Act. Mr. Friedman received his Bachelor of Arts Degree from the University of Rochester in 1975 (high distinction) and his Law Degree from Duke University School of Law in 1978 (Order of the Coif, high distinction). He is a member of the trial sections of the American Bar Association and the Arizona State Bar Association.

†Offer Details: Offer expires December 31, 2017.  Valid only for new Bing Ads customers who are first party recipients of the offer email. A new Bing Ads customer is one that has not advertised on Bing Ads before. Enter promotional coupon code and spend $25 (applies to threshold and prepaid accounts) to receive $100 in Bing Ads credits. Limit one promotion code per new Bing Ads customer. Promotional code must be redeemed within thirty (30) days of Bing Ads new customer account creation. Ad campaign costs accrued before receiving a credit, as well as costs accrued after all credits are used, will be charged to the payment method associated with the Bing Ads account. If customer payment fails, the coupon amount will not be applied.  Ads will continue to run and accrue costs after any promotional credit has been used up. Any portion of the credit not used within ninety (90) days of credit redemption will expire and can't be carried over even if the Bing Ads Customer switches their payment method. Offer valid only to residents of the United States. In order for the offer to be valid, a form of payment must be entered into your account prior to redemption of the promotional code and prior to your account going live to take advantage of the credit. This offer may not be combined with any other offer, promotional code coupon or discount, separated, redeemed for cash, transferred, sold, or bartered. Microsoft, in its sole discretion, can close your account for any suspected coupon abuse. Refund of the $25 is not permitted.  See Bing Ads Terms and Conditions for more details at sign-up. Other terms and conditions may apply.  Microsoft reserves the right to cancel, change, or suspend this offer at any time without notice.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
