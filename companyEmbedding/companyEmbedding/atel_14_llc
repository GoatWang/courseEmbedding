pursuant to such Rule 424 are hereinafter collectively called the
“Prospectus”).

Upon request of ATEL Associates 14
LLC (the “Manager”) or the Dealer Manager, you shall
provide reports to the Fund and the Dealer Manager as to the number
and amount of subscriptions received by you.

The terms and conditions of your
engagement as Depository shall be as follows:

1. On or before the date of
commencement of the offering you shall establish an
interest-bearing escrow account which shall be entitled “ATEL
14 Escrow Account” (the “Escrow Account”). The
Dealer Manager and Selected Dealers shall instruct subscribers to
make checks payable to the order of the Depository. You shall
return any checks received that are made payable to a party other
than the Depository to the Dealer Manager or Selected Dealer who
submitted the check.

2. The Dealer Manager and the
Selected Dealers shall promptly deliver all monies received for the
payment of Units to the Depository for deposit in the Escrow
Account. You shall receive and hold deposits of subscription funds
in the amount of $10 per Unit. The minimum subscription shall be
500 Units ($5,000), subject, however, to such higher minimum
subscriptions as are described in the Prospectus as being
applicable in certain circumstances. Each deposit shall be
accompanied by a Subscription Agreement in the form of that
attached as Exhibit C to the Prospectus identifying by name and
address the subscriber whose funds are deposited and the amount of
the funds deposited by such subscriber.

3. Deposits in the form of checks
which fail to clear the bank upon which they are drawn shall be
returned by the Depository to the subscriber, together with the
copy of the Subscription Agreement. You shall concurrently furnish
to the Manager and the Dealer Manager a copy of any such
Subscription Agreement and check so returned. The Depository shall
have no further liability therefor.

If the Fund rejects any subscription
for which the Depository has already collected funds, the
Depository shall promptly issue a refund check to the rejected
subscriber. If the Fund rejects any subscription for which the
Depository has not yet collected funds but has submitted the
subscriber’s check for collection, the Depository shall
promptly issue a check in the amount of the subscriber’s
check to the rejected subscriber after the Depository has cleared
such funds. If the Depository has not yet submitted a rejected
subscriber’s check for collection, the Depository shall
promptly remit the subscriber’s check directly to the
subscriber.

4. You shall place funds from the
Escrow Account only in the following interest-bearing accounts and
short-term obligations as the Fund shall direct: short-term United
States government securities, including Treasury bills, securities
issued or guaranteed by United States government agencies,
certificates of deposit and time or demand deposits in banks and
savings and loan associations which are insured by United States
government agencies or deposits in members of the Federal Home Loan
Bank System; provided, however, that you shall not be required to
place any such funds in a manner which is inconsistent with the
Prospectus. In the absence of express instructions, you will invest
such funds, to the extent reasonably practicable, in a U. S. Bank
Money Market Account


insured by the FDIC. As Depository you shall not
be liable for any loss of interest in the event funds are withdrawn
prior to maturity. Interest accrued on subscription funds held in
the Escrow Account shall not be an asset of the Fund, but shall
either (i) be paid to the respective subscribers upon return
of subscription proceeds to subscribers pursuant to paragraph 5 of
this Agreement in the event the Minimum Subscriptions (as defined
in paragraph 5) are not received prior to termination of the
offering); or (ii) be paid to the Fund upon release of
subscription proceeds to the Fund for disbursement by the Fund to
subscribers, in either case to be divided among the subscribers on
a pro rata basis according to the respective numbers of days
between the time of deposit of their payments into the Escrow
Account and the release of such payments to the Fund or the return
thereof to the subscribers, and in either case with the amounts of
interest allocated among subscribers to be calculated by the
Manager.

During the escrow period, the
proceeds from the Fund’s offering are not subject to claims
by creditors, the Fund, the Fund’s affiliates, you as the
escrow agent, or Selected Dealers unless and until the proceeds
have been released to the Fund pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement.

5. If and at such time as amounts in
collected funds representing subscriptions for not less than
120,000 Units shall have been deposited with you under this
Agreement (the “Minimum Subscriptions”), you shall so
notify the Manager and the Dealer Manager and upon receipt of
written instructions from each of the Fund and the Dealer Manager,
you shall disburse to the Fund all subscription funds held by you.
If the offering is terminated prior to receipt of collected funds
representing the Minimum Subscriptions, or if collected funds
representing the Minimum Subscriptions have not been received on or
before the date which is one year from the date that the
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, you shall
promptly disburse all subscription funds to the subscribers who
transmitted them without deduction, penalty or expense to the
subscriber, and you shall advise the Fund and the Dealer Manager
that you have done so. The subscription funds returned to each
subscriber shall be free and clear of any and all claims of the
Fund or any of its creditors. In any case, all interest earned on
subscription proceeds held by you shall be disbursed to subscribers
as provided in paragraph 4, with the Manager providing the
Depository with the calculation of interest payable to each
subscriber. After all disbursements under this Agreement have been
completed, the escrow shall be terminated; provided, however, that
an agreement with a branch of Depository will be effective upon
escrow holder notifying the branch that the Minimum Subscriptions
have been reached and escrow is closed. The branch will agree to
facilitate transfers of subscription funds to the Fund in the event
subscribers make checks payable to the Depository after the date
Minimum Subscriptions have been received. The branch’s sole
function in such event shall be to endorse any such subscription
checks to the account of the Fund.

For purposes of the foregoing, the
term “collected funds” shall mean all funds received by
the Depository which have cleared normal banking channels and are
in the form of cash.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
and all subscription proceeds from Pennsylvania investors deposited
with the Depositary will be maintained in a separate escrow account
entitled “ATEL 14 Pennsylvania Escrow Account.” The
terms of the escrow for Pennsylvania subscriptions will be the same
as provided for all subscription proceeds under this Agreement,
except as expressly stated in the following paragraphs.

The amount of subscription proceeds
held in the Pennsylvania Escrow Account will not be counted
in determining the Minimum Subscriptions defined above in this
Section 5, unless the Pennsylvania Minimum (as defined below)
is reached prior to the date that the amount of the Minimum
Subscriptions is received from non-Pennsylvania subscribers. The
funds in the Pennsylvania Escrow Account will be retained in such
account, and will not be released to the Fund upon the release of
other escrowed funds at the time the Minimum Subscriptions are
reached under the Agreement unless the conditions for release of
Pennsylvania subscriptions set forth in this paragraph are

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
