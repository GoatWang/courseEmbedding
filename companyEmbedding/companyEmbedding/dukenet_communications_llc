DukeNet Communications lays the groundwork for a telecom rope-a-dope around the Southeast. The company develops and manages fiber-optic communications network systems for wireless and wireline telecommunications companies and ISPs. It also provides private networks for large-volume business customers. Other services include network colocation as well as wireless data transmission services for rural areas with limited wireline resources. The company operates about 3,000 route-miles of network which spans North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Founded in 1994, DukeNet is owned by North Carolina-based energy provider Duke Energy and an investment fund managed by Alinda Capital; each own 50% of the company.

DukeNet Communications is a telecom and internet infrastructure company that serves the southeastern United States. Products include a metro and long haul fiber-optic network capable of 100 Gbit/s bandwidth.[1]
Formed in 1994 as the telecommunications arm of Duke Energy, DukeNet primarily offered wholesale fiber transport services until moving into the newly developing Fiber to the Tower (FTTT) space in 2006. As of 2012[update], DukeNet is among the top 10 FTTT providers in the United States.[2] In December 2010, Duke Energy and Alinda Capital Partners LLC formed a joint venture to grow DukeNet Communications in the enterprise and data center space.[3][4] On October 7, 2013, Time Warner Cable (which later bought by Charter Communications in 2016) announced that it had agreed to acquire DukeNet Communications LLC for $600 million, and on January 6, 2014, the deal officially closed.[5][6][7]

Time Warner Cable Completes Acquisition of DukeNet Communications

Release Date: 01/06/2014



  Time Warner Cable Inc. (NYSE:TWC) today announced that it has completed its previously announced acquisition of DukeNet Communications, LLC. As a result of the $600 million transaction, Time Warner Cable adds more than 8,700 route miles to its fiber optic network that serve business customers in the Southeast, including key markets in North Carolina and South Carolina.
“DukeNet and Time Warner Cable are perfect complements to each other and the customers we serve,” said Phil Meeks, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer for Business Services at Time Warner Cable. “We welcome our new customers and look forward to serving their communications needs with our network’s expanded reach, additional product offerings and enhanced level of customer service. We’re also very excited for our existing customers, as this additional fiber capacity will enable us to extend our fiber reach and help them connect to our network from more business locations.”
Time Warner Cable Business Class (TWCBC) anticipates utilizing the additional fiber to connect and serve business customers who need services such as voice, high-speed Internet and cloud-enabled hosting. In addition, TWCBC anticipates utilizing the additional fiber capacity to further grow its carrier business, which provides network access to wireless providers. TWCBC is a leader in this industry and last summer passed the milestone of providing services for more than 10,000 cell towers around the country.
Prior to the transaction, DukeNet was jointly owned by Duke Energy Corporation and investment funds managed by Alinda Capital Partners.
