            Property Description
    


Popular Cambridge Village is a best- kept secret in Manatee County.  This 55+ maintenance free community offers activities for everyone whether you enjoy get-togethers, playing cards, shuffleboard or just relaxing by the pool. You'll enjoy the great view of the lake with the birds singing and ducks entertaining from the enclosed porch or the patio.  While the association handles maintenance to the exterior, repairs are needed to the interior. This is a fixer-upper and the listing price reflects current condition and improvements that are needed for occupancy. Quotes are available for mold remediation and restoration of the villa to give the new owner the opportunity to design with their own personal taste in mind.

Popular Cambridge Village is a best- kept secret in Manatee County. This 55+ maintenance free community offers activities for everyone whether you enjoy get-togethers, playing cards, shuffleboard or just relaxing by the pool. Youll enjoy the great view of the lake with the birds singing and ducks entertaining from the enclosed porch or the patio. While the association handles maintenance to the exterior, repairs are needed to the interior. This is a fixer-upper and the listing price reflects current condition and improvements that are needed for occupancy. Quotes are available for mold remediation and restoration of the villa to give the new owner the opportunity to design with their own personal taste in mind.
