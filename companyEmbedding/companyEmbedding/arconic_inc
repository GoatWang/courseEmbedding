Arconic Issues Statement on Reynobond PE
June 26, 2017




















 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arconic Inc. (NYSE: ARNC) today issued the following statement:The loss of lives, injuries and destruction following the Grenfell Tower 
      fire are devastating, and our deepest condolences are with everyone 
      affected by this tragedy. We have offered our full support to the 
      authorities as they conduct their investigations.While the official inquiry is continuing and all the facts concerning 
      the causes of the fire are not yet known, we want to make sure that 
      certain information is clear:

        Arconic supplied one of our products, Reynobond PE, to our customer, a 
        fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall 
        cladding system on Grenfell Tower. The fabricator supplied its portion 
        of the cladding system to the façade installer, who delivered it to 
        the general contractor. The other parts of the cladding system, 
        including the insulation, were supplied by other parties. We were not 
        involved in the installation of the system, nor did we have a role in 
        any other aspect of the building’s refurbishment or original design.
      

        While we provided general parameters for potential usage universally, 
        we sold our products with the expectation that they would be used in 
        compliance with the various and different local building codes and 
        regulations. Current regulations within the United States, Europe and 
        the U.K. permit the use of aluminum composite material in various 
        architectural applications, including in high-rise buildings depending 
        on the cladding system and overall building design. Our product is one 
        component in the overall cladding system; we don’t control the overall 
        system or its compliance.
      
Nevertheless, in light of this tragedy, we have taken the decision to no 
      longer provide this product in any high-rise applications, regardless of 
      local codes and regulations.About ArconicArconic (NYSE: ARNC) creates breakthrough products that shape 
      industries. Working in close partnership with our customers, we solve

Arconic pushes the boundaries of 3D printing with parts for space exploration


     











Four small vents—each the size of a one-liter water bottle—represent one giant leap for deep space exploration, and aerospace manufacturing too. The vents are Arconic’s first additively-manufactured flying space products. We 3D printed the vents for Lockheed Martin for service on NASA’s Orion spacecraft, which will one day carry humans to Mars.

The components are designed to equilibrate the pressure between the inner and outer hull of the spacecraft. The original components were fabricated from several individual components and welded together. Our 3D printed, nickel superalloy versions take about 40 hours to produce versus weeks for the traditional manufacturing method.
“By partnering with Lockheed Martin on design, we optimized both process and performance,” said Don Larsen, Vice President and General Manager, R&D and Advanced Manufacturing at Arconic.
The vents made their inaugural space flight on Orion’s two-orbit, four-hour test flight in 2014, which evaluated many of the spacecraft’s most critical systems.  Orion reached a max altitude of 3,600 miles and re-entered the atmosphere at 20,000 mph with heat shield temperatures reaching 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit before splashing down in the Pacific Ocean. The Arconic vents took the heat, showing no signs of damage on post-flight inspection.

Arconic Brings Advanced Stretcher Online
April 11, 2017




















 Customer-backed investment enables aerospace industry’s largest        high-strength monolithic wing ribs, design freedom for OEMsNEW YORK & DAVENPORT, Iowa--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Arconic (NYSE: ARNC) announced today that the installation of its new 
      manufacturing technology – the Very Thick Plate Stretcher (Stretcher) – 
      is complete. The Stretcher produces highly-differentiated aerospace and 
      industrial plate. The investment in the Stretcher is backed by customer 
      contracts, including one with Airbus, 
      valued at approximately $1 billion. The project was completed on time 
      with an investment of approximately $150 million, approximately $40 
      million under budget.Located at the company’s facility in Davenport, Iowa, the Stretcher 
      improves the performance of thick aluminum and aluminum-lithium plate in 
      aerospace and industrial applications. The stretching process reduces 
      stress introduced into the plate as part of the manufacturing process, 
      resulting in a part that is more easily machined and processed by 
      customers.In aerospace, the Stretcher will not only enable Arconic to service the 
      existing plate market, but also allow airframe builders to make large 
      wing ribs, fuselage frames and bulkheads in new sizes and thickness. For 
      example, one of the challenges composite wings face as they get larger 
      is strength and stiffness, and the aluminum plate from this Stretcher 
      will allow aircraft manufacturers to make aluminum wing ribs to address 
      that issue. In the industrial market, plate from the Stretcher can be 
      used in manufacturing molds and chambers for applications such as 
      semiconductors.“This investment was made to expand Arconic’s leadership in the 
      aerospace market and create profitable growth in attractive industrial 
      markets,” said Arconic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Klaus 
      Kleinfeld. “The Stretcher allows Arconic to offer a variety of new 
      products: in aerospace, we can now help aircraft engineers push the 
      boundaries of design and performance. In other industrial applications, 
      such as semiconductors and consumer electronics, Stretcher material 
      helps increase productivity and reduce cost. In both cases, Arconic will 
      help create demand that we are uniquely positioned to meet. And making 
      all of this possible is our team in Davenport, who delivered this 
      massive project on time and $40 million under budget.”Arconic’s Davenport facility is currently commissioning the Stretcher, 
      and has begun qualifying material for its customers.Aerospace ApplicationsIn aerospace, the Stretcher material offers Arconic customers more 
      design freedom and increased productivity. In addition to enabling the 
      production of the largest high-strength monolithic wing ribs in the 
      industry, the material from the Stretcher will also allow aerospace 
      engineers to design aircraft in new ways, because plate of this size and 
      scale is currently not available on the market. For example, Arconic’s 
      Stretcher material allows airframers to create single-piece parts, which 
      eliminates the need to join multiple pieces together, resulting in 
      better production efficiency and lower weight.Product shipments to aerospace customers are expected to begin in the 
      fourth quarter of 2017.Airbus was the first aerospace customer to include material from the new 
      Stretcher in the $1 billion contract announced 
      last year. Stretcher material is also a part of an agreement Arconic has 
      with AMI Metals to support their contract with Lockheed Martin for 
      production of the Joint Strike Fighter.Industrial ApplicationsThe Stretcher can be used to make some of the thickest, longest and 
      widest plate for plastics manufacturing molds and on manufacturing 
      chambers for the consumer electronics and semiconductor industries. For 
      example, semiconductor manufacturers can use the thicker plate to 
      increase the size of their manufacturing chambers, allowing them to make 
      larger and/or more chips in the same amount of time, increasing 
      productivity and saving cost.Product shipments to industrial customers are expected to begin in the 
      second quarter of 2017.About ArconicArconic (NYSE: ARNC) creates breakthrough products that shape

What We Do
Aerospace







Arconic’s largest and fastest growing market is aerospace, where we have had a major presence since the Wright brothers’ first flight. Fueled by an expanding middle class and increasing air travel, global aircraft demand has led to the largest order book in aviation history, with a nine-year backlog for both commercial aircraft and aero engines. 
Arconic is well-positioned to benefit from that growth with a range of high performance multi-materials and highly engineered products and solutions for aero engines and airframe structures on virtually every aircraft platform. Our solutions range from the world’s largest fuselage panels and wing skins, to 1/16-inch-diameter fasteners that hold an aircraft together.

CFRA sticks with hold rating on Arconic, citing uncertainty about CEO search, Grenfell Tower liability
CFRA said Monday it is sticking with a hold recommendation on shares of Arconic Inc. , after the spinoff from Alcoa Inc. reported second-quarter earnings. Analyst Matthew Miller said his 12-month price target of $27 implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 9.0 times his 2017 EBITDA view, a discount to peers that trade at an average forward EV/EBITDA of 9.3 times. The target "is justified by uncertainty regarding the ongoing CEO search and the potential liability from the cladding used on the Grenfell Tower," Miller wrote in a note. Arconic said earlier it had no control over the aluminum panels used in the exterior of the London tower, that are believed to have ignited during a fire in June that killed at least 80 people. The company had already said it will stop selling the panels for use in high-rise buildings. Miller said he is trimming his 2017 EPS estimate by 3 cents and his 2018 EPS estimate by 5 cents. Shares were down 0.7% in late trade, while the S&P 500  was down 0.1%.

Arconic raises sales outlook as cost cuts lift EPS
Arconic Inc. said Monday its second-quarter earnings rose as the aerospace- and automotive-parts maker worked to cut costs.

Arconic shares surge 6% premarket after company beats on profit, raises outlook
Shares of Arconic Inc. , the former aluminum operations of Alcoa before that company split in two, jumped 6% in premarket trade Monday, after the company beat second-quarter profit and sales estimates and raised its guidance. Arconic said it had net income of $212 million, or 43 cents a share, in the second quarter, up from $135 million, or 27 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding special items, EPS came to 32 cents, ahead of the FactSet consensus of 26 cents a share. Revenue rose 1% to $3.3 billion, also ahead of the FactSet consensus of $3.2 billion. The company said it is raising its full-year guidance after a "solid" first half, and now expects revenue of $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion, up from prior guidance of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion. Adjusted EPS is expected to range from $1.15 to $1.20, up from a prior $1.10 to $1.20. The FactSet consensus is for full-year EPS of $1.16 and revenue of $12.5 billion.

Arconic stock surges after J.P. Morgan turns bullish
Shares of Arconic Inc.  surged 2.6% in premarket trade Monday, after the maker of aluminum products was upgraded at J.P. Morgan, citing improved valuation after the selloff in the wake of the Grenfell Tower fire. Analyst Seth Seifman raised his rating to outperform from neutral, but trimmed his stock price target to $28, which is 21% above Friday's closing price of $23.13, from $30. The stock had tumbled as much as 21% before bouncing slightly after the Grenfell Tower tragedy, amid reports the company produced the aluminum sheets and polyethylene which burned in the fire. "Grenfell Tower risk hard to assess, but probably manageable and perhaps ultimately zero," Seifman wrote in a note to clients. Despite the stock's recent selloff, it has soared 25% year to date, while the SPDR Materials Select Sector ETF  has climbed 8.9% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.3%.

Breaking            
Arconic tries to distance itself from Grenfell Tower fire 
Arconic Inc.  late Monday tried to distance itself from the devasting Grenfell Tower fire that killed at least 79 people by stressing that it supplies cladding panels to clients with the assumption that its products are used in compliance with various building codes. "Arconic supplied one of our products, Reynobond PE, to our customer, a fabricator, which used the product as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower," said the company in a statement. However, it said it did not participate in refurbishing the building or in the original design. " Our product is one component in the overall cladding system; we don't control the overall system or its compliance," said the company. It also expressed its condolences and reiterated its decision that it will no longer supply cladding panel in other high-rise buildng projects, regardless of codes and regulations.

What We Do
Commercial Transportation







We develop and manufacture solutions that make trucks, buses, and railcars stronger, lighter and better looking—leading the way to a greener, more efficient future for the commercial transportation industry. 
Our forged aluminum wheels are a leading choice for commercial vehicles because they can reduce weight and save fuel. Truck cabs and chassis components built using our aluminum sheet and plate are all over the world’s roads. And mass transportation vehicles benefit from our lightweighting solutions. What holds it all together? The strength of our rivets, bolts and fasteners.

















Unmatched strength
Our proprietary Magnaforce™ alloy offers a 17 percent increase in strength over existing alloys for unmatched strength delivering unprecedented weight savings.

Shedding the pounds

Why Arconic Inc. Stock Plunged Another 9% on Tuesday
Bad PR from a London fire could be the least of Arconic's problems.











                Rich Smith
            

                (TMFDitty)



            
            Jun 27, 2017 at 6:54PM
            
            





What happened
For the second day running, Arconic (NYSE:ARNC) stock declined Tuesday, closing the day down 9% after suffering a 6% decline Monday.
So what
The reason Arconic fell today seems to be the same reason it fell yesterday: Arconic has been implicated as potentially responsible for the deaths of 79 people killed in the Grenfell Tower fire in London last week. That said, new facts entered the picture today, after Arconic released a statement after the close of trading Monday.  
Lamenting "the loss of lives, injuries, and destruction following the Grenfell Tower fire" and offering its "deepest condolences" to those affected, Arconic quickly shifted into damage-control mode. The company admitted that it sold its Reynobond PE product "as one component of the overall cladding system on Grenfell Tower," but it hastened to point out that several other parties were involved in the construction subsequently, including a "fabricator," a "facade installer," and a "general contractor." In the end, Arconic said, it was "not involved in the installation of the system, nor did we have a role in any other aspect of the building's refurbishment or original design."
Nevertheless, Arconic says it will "no longer provide this product in any high-rise applications, regardless of local codes and regulations."

Why is this stock still going down? Image source: Getty Images.






Now what
On one hand, that sounds like a prudent decision to make for safety reasons. On the other hand, it also looks more than a bit like an admission that Arconic may bear some responsibility for the disaster, which increases the chances that the company will incur financial penalties somewhere down the road.
At the very least, by limiting the future use of this product, Arconic is also limiting the size of its addressable market. For a company that was operating at a net loss even before this PR nightmare, that's not good news.
