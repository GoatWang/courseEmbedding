                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Delaware corporation, and SLM Funding LLC (the
“Company”), a Delaware limited liability company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of SLM ECFC, will cause SLM Investment
Corporation (“SLMIC”), a Delaware corporation and
affiliate of the Company, to sell pursuant to the terms and
conditions stated in this underwriting agreement (this
“Agreement”) to the firm or firms named in Schedule
I to this Agreement (each firm constituting the
“Underwriter” with respect to the Notes (as defined
below)) $22,379,000 aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate
Class B Student Loan-Backed Notes due December 28, 2043 (the
“Notes”) issued by SLM Student Loan Trust 2010-2 (the
“Trust”) on August 26, 2010 and retained by the Company
and transferred to SLMIC on such date.  The Notes are
being offered pursuant to and are described more fully in the
Supplement, dated March 17, 2011, to the Prospectus Supplement,
dated August 18, 2010, and the Base Prospectus, dated March 17,
2011.  All capitalized terms used in this Agreement which
are not separately defined herein shall have the respective
meanings set forth in the Indenture for the Notes, dated as of
August 26, 2010, among Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as
Indenture Trustee, the Trust and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, National Association, as Eligible Lender Trustee (the
“Indenture”).

 

1.            SLMIC
agrees to sell to the Underwriter or Underwriters, as applicable,
and the Underwriter or Underwriters, as applicable, agree to
purchase from SLMIC, the Notes subject to the terms and conditions
set forth herein and in Schedule I hereto.  The
firms designated in Schedule I hereto as
“Representatives” shall act as representatives of the
applicable Underwriter or Underwriters.

 

2.         The
Company   and SLM ECFC represent and warrant to, and
agree with, each of the Underwriters as follows (it being agreed
and understood that the statements set forth in clauses (d), (e),
(g), (h), (j), (k) and (m) of this Section 2 with respect to SLM
ECFC, the Servicer or the Administrator constitute representations,
warranties and agreements of SLM ECFC only and not of the
Company):

 

 

 

  

 

(a)         A
registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-166301), including
a form of prospectus, in respect of the Notes has been filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“Commission”); such registration statement and any
post-effective amendment thereto, each in the form heretofore
delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives and, excluding
exhibits to such registration statement, but including all
documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained
therein, to the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters,
have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; no
other document with respect to such registration statement or
document incorporated by reference therein has heretofore been
filed or transmitted for filing with the Commission (other than
prospectuses filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) of the rules and
regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the “Act”), each in the form heretofore
delivered to the Representatives; and no stop order suspending the
effectiveness of such registration statement has been issued and no
proceeding for that purpose has been initiated or, to the best of
SLM ECFC’s or the Company’s knowledge, threatened by
the Commission; the various parts of such registration statement,
including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by
reference in the prospectus contained in the registration statement
at the time such part of the registration statement  
became effective but excluding Form T-1, each as amended at the
time such part of the registration statement became effective, are
hereinafter collectively called the “Registration
Statement”; the prospectus relating to the Notes, in the form
in which it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for
filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this
Agreement, being hereinafter called the “Prospectus”;
any reference herein to the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to
and include the documents incorporated by reference therein
pursuant to the applicable form under the Act, as of the date of
the Prospectus; any reference to any amendment or supplement to the
Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents
filed after the date of the Prospectus under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”),
and incorporated by reference in the Prospectus; any reference to
any amendment to the Registration Statement shall be deemed to
refer to and include any annual report of the Company filed
pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after the
effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated
by reference in the Registration Statement; and any reference to
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed to refer
to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the
Notes in the form in which it is filed with the Commission pursuant
to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a)
hereof, including any documents incorporated by reference therein
as of the date of such filing);

 

(b)         The
documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when they
became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the
Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended (the “Trust Indenture Act”), as applicable, and
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, and none of
such documents contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and any
further documents so filed and incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement thereto, when
such documents become effective or are filed with the Commission,
as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to the
requirements of the Act, the Exchange Act and the Trust Indenture

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page.

How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
