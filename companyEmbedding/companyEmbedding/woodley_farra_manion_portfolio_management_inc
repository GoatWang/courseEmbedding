1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

We’re proud to be a part of the fastest-growing segment of the financial services industry.

Thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry with a fundamental belief: Independence is a better way. Today, our entire business is built to fuel the independent spirit of advisors., from your first steps toward establishing an independent firm through your tireless efforts to put clients first. We’re always looking out for what’s next and innovating on advisors’ behalf.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) is an advisory firm that offers independent professional financial advice to clients with a range of investing goals and needs.
                  

                    Many RIAs are owned by the advisors who run them. They are not tied to specific funds or products and typically provide their services for a fee based on a percentage of client assets.

            “Is the RIA model the right fit for me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Not necessarily. Some advisors are comfortable where they are. Others aren’t ready to make the move.
                  

                    But if you have a vision for how you want to do business—and you like the idea of having more control over your future and more choices for how you serve your clients—then the RIA model could be ideally suited for you.

            “What's the long-term viability of the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    While other channels (such as wirehouses and independent broker-dealers) shrink, the RIA model continues to grow year-over-year, a trend that shows no signs of slowing. 1, 2

            “Who regulates the RIA industry?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    RIAs are registered with either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators. RIAs have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients as regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                  

                    For additional information on regulation and registering as an RIA, read At a Glance: Legal and Regulatory Considerations for Becoming an RIA.

            “What if I want the benefits of the RIA model, but I don’t want to own a firm?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You have more options to grow as an independent advisor than ever before. You may prefer the freedom to focus on your clients without dealing with the day-to-day operations. Solutions range from enlisting platform-provider support to joining an existing firm.
                  

                    Decide the best fit for you by reviewing the spectrum of independence.
                  

Read the Info Sheet >

















            “Why would I expect to earn more as an independent RIA?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Advisors who own their business have the potential to net more than those in an employee model do—even when taking bonus payouts and other employee incentives into account.
                  

                    Starting and running a business is an investment, and there are certainly startup and ongoing expenses involved. However, as an owner, you have 100% control over how revenue is distributed—including how you reinvest in the firm.
                  

                    As an independent owner, you are also in the best position to maximize your income while laying the foundation for a potentially lucrative exit strategy.

            “How will the RIA model affect my access to products and services?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Many advisors explore the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) model because their current firm may limit the products and services they can offer their clients. With the RIA model, you get to choose the custodian that provides access to some of the best products and services to help suit the needs of your clients.
                  

                    “I wake up every day thinking about how [we] can be bigger and better.”—Neal Simon







                      Watch advisor Neal Simon discuss the freedom that choosing the RIA model gave him.
                    








            “Will my clients come with me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer
When clients think of your current firm, they think of you.

                    Industry research reports show that clients are loyal to their advisors, and nearly 80% of clients were immediately on board with the move.1


                    “It was seamless, and we had no complaints at all from any clients in this transition.”—Chris Baker

1Schwab Advisor Services, Advisors Turning Independent, interviews with “Sophomore Year Advisors,” 2013.
                  






                      Discover how advisor Chris Baker worked with Schwab to move 95% of her clients over.
                    








            “Can I keep my commission-based business?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    If commission-based business is part of your offer, you don’t need to give it up. The hybrid model lets you maintain both advisory and brokerage business. It also can enable you to offer clients a range of services and product solutions that complement their advisory philosophy.

            “Will I be able to choose my own technology?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Instead of working within the constraints of technology mandated by larger firms, you have the freedom to choose the solutions that are the right fit for your business and your clients.
                  

                    “One of the great things about the RIA model is you get to pick and choose the different technology packages that best fit your clients’ needs.”—Fran Hoey






                      Learn more about the benefits that advisor Fran Hoey experienced in choosing his firm’s technology.
                    















            “What kind of startup costs are involved?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Starting your own business is an investment—one that can involve everything from real estate and office setup to technology and marketing.
                  

                    The RIA Economic Discovery Tool can help you identify and track the capital needed to make your move. And financing options—like small-business loans—help make the initial costs more manageable.

            “What's involved in the transition, and how long does it take?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    No two transitions are exactly alike. For example, if you choose to join an existing firm rather than start your own, the process can be expedited.
                  

                    Whether you join or start your firm, the timing will depend on how quickly you want to make the move.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You built your client relationships on excellent service. As an independent advisor at an RIA firm, you should expect the same high level of support from your custodian.
                  

                    With Schwab, you’ll have dedicated service and support teams to help you with firm operations and business growth, plus access to best practices, industry events, and many other resources.

            “What are the legal and regulatory considerations of transitioning to the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    From assessing your current situation to formalizing partner agreements, you’ll want to dedicate sufficient time and thought into building a plan that helps establish—and safeguard—your firm.
                  

                    A Schwab Advisor Services™ Business Development Officer can introduce you to legal and compliance experts to help you build that plan for long-term success.

Woodley Farra Manion Portfolio Management













































  
Skip to content


























						Close Menu
					










We're in for the long run.

When it comes to investing and safeguarding your future, Woodley Farra Manion Portfolio Management embraces the “it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon” philosophy. Rather than focusing on short, flashy bursts and a quick finish, we patiently plot your course, prepare for the long run and help you cross a finish line that, in essence, you’ve trained for your entire life.
Watch our video to see how our approach really is different »
 












Research


A marathon runner would never invest in a pair of shoes that wasn’t right for their needs. They’d research them, ask experts for advice, try them on and assess the fit. We are constantly researching and analyzing thousands of stocks, narrowing down the best choices at the right time. When you come in to talk with us, we’ll be ready to find the best fit for you.







Coaching


We believe in the power of good coaching. So much so that we don’t provide you with just one coach — your investments are reviewed by our entire team. That’s years upon years of experience, expertise and sound thinking working on your behalf. And while we don’t typically engage in motivational speeches, if that’s something you’d like, we can certainly oblige.







Endurance


There’s another marathon scenario that bears comparison: going out too fast. Many a runner has suffered later in the race because they were so excited at the beginning, they didn’t stick to their training pace, started too fast and paid the price later. We are firm believers in keeping an eye on the finish line, sticking with our strategy and not getting caught up in the excitement of the latest buy/sell craze. This strategy has worked well, time and again, for those clients who are committed to maintaining a winning pace.







Goals


The reason most people run a marathon is because it’s a goal they wish to achieve. But the only way to cross the finish line is to marry that goal with a sound strategy. When you come in to Woodley Farra, the first thing we do is get to know you and your goals. Then, utilizing one of our portfolios, we put together a strategy to help you achieve them. And when the market puts up roadblocks from time to time, we’re there monitoring and adjusting, communicating and coaching. We’re not just cheering you from the sidelines — we’re running the course right beside you.










Our Unique Approach:

Here for You

	"For better or for worse."


	"Through thick and thin."


	"Neither rain nor sleet nor gloom of night..."
 









We think you're starting to get the idea







The safekeeping and betterment of our clients assets is more important to us than our own return on investment. We can’t say it enough: we’re in this for the long run. We’ve weathered many market ups and downs over the years and coached our clients through them. It’s about trust and faith in our expertise, about patience and perseverance, and settling in for the journey.
Along the way, we want your questions, your concerns, to know your hopes and dreams and needs. Investors who are comfortable with their assets being engaged for the entire investment cycle will feel very comfortable with our methods. If you’re looking for quick fixes and investing in what’s “hot,” chasing down the latest stock craze, well, we’re probably not for you.




Our advisors are always available to talk to you, either via phone, email or in person. You have direct access to us, when you need it. And so that we don’t bother you too much, we’ll reach out and contact you every quarter with a personalized investment report. For more about how we work, see our Process Page.
Your portfolio assets will be held by third-party custodians — we are not a broker-dealer, and you will never write a check to Woodley Farra except for fees. Our revenue is fee-based, not commission-based. Also, because we are accountable to our clients and to ourselves, all our performance results and calculations are verified by an independent third party to maintain accuracy and transparency.

Portfolio Management Process - Woodley Farra Manion











































  
Skip to content


























						Close Menu
					









Streamlined Approach.Team-Minded Process.
When you choose to work with Woodley Farra, you’ll have your own primary advisor — who will be working with other Woodley Farra advisors on your behalf. Decisions regarding adding or removing holdings from your portfolio are made as a team.
Every quarter, we’ll send you an investment report, and follow up with you via email, phone or in person to see if you have any questions. We take great pride in making our quarterly reports clear and easy to understand. You’ll readily see what you own and how it performs.










Portfolio Characteristics










Individual Securities

Client portfolios are invested exclusively in 25 – 30 individual securities held with a third-party custodian.








Large Capitalization

Portfolios contain large, well established companies.
The firm only invests in stocks with a market value of $1 billion or greater and does not invest in futures, options, or other derivatives.








Value Oriented

The goal of our screening process is to find undervalued companies. It begins with over 14,000 companies that we run through specific, proprietary filters to determine whether a stock is statistically inexpensive. The result narrows the choices to a list of 300 – 700 securities.








Strong Dividend Policy

Dividend yields are an objective characteristic of undervalued companies.
Significant contributor to the total return of a portfolio and can provide stability in declining markets.
Provide a good inflation hedge.









Stock Selection Process










Database Screening

Client portfolios are invested exclusively in 25 – 30 individual securities held with a third-party custodian.








Multi-Discipline Stock Research Process
After initial screening, we apply a proprietary process to reduce the list of potential holdings to the final 25 – 30 that are included in a client portfolio:

Fundamental: Complete analysis of a company’s financial and competitive health.
Quantitative: Analyze a company’s stock valuation utilizing several proprietary formulas.
Technical: Identify trends in supply and demand for the stock under review.
Economic: Analyze economic trends and the potential effect on a company’s valuation.

Your Financial Coaches
Located on the north side of Indianapolis and founded in 1995, Woodley Farra has more than 100 years of combined investment management experience. We are a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) with the SEC. We conduct all our own research in-house, focusing on individual securities. In addition, several members of our team have earned the title Chartered Financial Analyst* (“CFA”), providing our clients with an extra measure of confidence.
When visitors walk into our offices, they are often surprised at the open structure. Financial advisors sit at their desks in a common area along with the rest of the staff. As we’ve grown, we’ve taken our style from our roots: Don and George sharing one office, working side by side. We find we do better work for our clients when we aren’t sequestered in offices but rather functioning together as a team.
And while we embrace transparency and a collegial, team approach, we value our clients’ personal information and treat it with the utmost confidentiality.
Get to know us, and then give us a call. We’d love to get to know you.

1Forbes rankings are the opinion of SHOOK Research and are based on advisor interviews, client retention, industry experience, compliance record, assets under management and revenue generated for the firm. Investment performance is not considered. Advisors do not pay to be in the ranking.
2According to Barron's, "The formula [used] to rank advisors has three major components: assets managed, revenue produced and quality of the advisor's practice. Investment returns are not a component of the rankings because an advisor's returns are dictated largely by each client's risk tolerance. The quality-of-practice component includes an evaluation of each advisor's regulatory record." The rankings are based on the universe of applications submitted to Barron's. The selection process begins with a nomination and application provided to Barron's. Principals of Edelman Financial Services, LLC self-nominated the firm and submitted quantitative and qualitative information to Barron's as requested. Barron's reviewed and considered this information, which resulted in the rankings on Aug. 27, 2012/Aug. 28, 2010/Aug. 31, 2009.

We’re proud to be a part of the fastest-growing segment of the financial services industry.

Thirty years ago, Schwab supported a small group of entrepreneurial advisors who challenged the industry with a fundamental belief: Independence is a better way. Today, our entire business is built to fuel the independent spirit of advisors., from your first steps toward establishing an independent firm through your tireless efforts to put clients first. We’re always looking out for what’s next and innovating on advisors’ behalf.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    A Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) is an advisory firm that offers independent professional financial advice to clients with a range of investing goals and needs.
                  

                    Many RIAs are owned by the advisors who run them. They are not tied to specific funds or products and typically provide their services for a fee based on a percentage of client assets.

            “Is the RIA model the right fit for me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Not necessarily. Some advisors are comfortable where they are. Others aren’t ready to make the move.
                  

                    But if you have a vision for how you want to do business—and you like the idea of having more control over your future and more choices for how you serve your clients—then the RIA model could be ideally suited for you.

            “What's the long-term viability of the RIA model?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    While other channels (such as wirehouses and independent broker-dealers) shrink, the RIA model continues to grow year-over-year, a trend that shows no signs of slowing. 1, 2

            “Who regulates the RIA industry?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    RIAs are registered with either the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or state securities regulators. RIAs have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of their clients as regulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.

            “What if I want the benefits of the RIA model, but I don’t want to own a firm?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You have more options to grow as an independent advisor than ever before. You may prefer the freedom to focus on your clients without dealing with the day-to-day operations. Solutions range from enlisting platform-provider support to joining an existing firm.
                  

                    Decide the best fit for you by reviewing the spectrum of independence.
                  

Read the Info Sheet >

















            “Why would I expect to earn more as an independent RIA?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Advisors who own their business have the potential to net more than those in an employee model do—even when taking bonus payouts and other employee incentives into account.
                  

                    Starting and running a business is an investment, and there are certainly startup and ongoing expenses involved. However, as an owner, you have 100% control over how revenue is distributed—including how you reinvest in the firm.
                  

                    As an independent owner, you are also in the best position to maximize your income while laying the foundation for a potentially lucrative exit strategy.

            “How will the RIA model affect my access to products and services?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Many advisors explore the Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) model because their current firm may limit the products and services they can offer their clients. With the RIA model, you get to choose the custodian that provides access to some of the best products and services to help suit the needs of your clients.
                  

                    “I wake up every day thinking about how [we] can be bigger and better.”—Neal Simon







                      Watch advisor Neal Simon discuss the freedom that choosing the RIA model gave him.
                    








            “Will my clients come with me?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer
When clients think of your current firm, they think of you.

                    Industry research reports show that clients are loyal to their advisors, and nearly 80% of clients were immediately on board with the move.1


                    “It was seamless, and we had no complaints at all from any clients in this transition.”—Chris Baker

            “Can I keep my commission-based business?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    If commission-based business is part of your offer, you don’t need to give it up. The hybrid model lets you maintain both advisory and brokerage business. It also can enable you to offer clients a range of services and product solutions that complement their advisory philosophy.

            “Will I be able to choose my own technology?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Instead of working within the constraints of technology mandated by larger firms, you have the freedom to choose the solutions that are the right fit for your business and your clients.
                  

                    “One of the great things about the RIA model is you get to pick and choose the different technology packages that best fit your clients’ needs.”—Fran Hoey






                      Learn more about the benefits that advisor Fran Hoey experienced in choosing his firm’s technology.
                    















            “What kind of startup costs are involved?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    Starting your own business is an investment—one that can involve everything from real estate and office setup to technology and marketing.
                  

                    The RIA Economic Discovery Tool can help you identify and track the capital needed to make your move. And financing options—like small-business loans—help make the initial costs more manageable.

            “What's involved in the transition, and how long does it take?”
            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    No two transitions are exactly alike. For example, if you choose to join an existing firm rather than start your own, the process can be expedited.
                  

                    Whether you join or start your firm, the timing will depend on how quickly you want to make the move.

            See the answer





Close


Answer

                    You built your client relationships on excellent service. As an independent advisor at an RIA firm, you should expect the same high level of support from your custodian.
                  

                    With Schwab, you’ll have dedicated service and support teams to help you with firm operations and business growth, plus access to best practices, industry events, and many other resources.

Answer

                    From assessing your current situation to formalizing partner agreements, you’ll want to dedicate sufficient time and thought into building a plan that helps establish—and safeguard—your firm.

Woodley Farra Manion Portfolio Management













































  
Skip to content


























						Close Menu
					










We're in for the long run.

When it comes to investing and safeguarding your future, Woodley Farra Manion Portfolio Management embraces the “it’s not a sprint, it’s a marathon” philosophy. Rather than focusing on short, flashy bursts and a quick finish, we patiently plot your course, prepare for the long run and help you cross a finish line that, in essence, you’ve trained for your entire life.
Watch our video to see how our approach really is different »
 












Research


A marathon runner would never invest in a pair of shoes that wasn’t right for their needs. They’d research them, ask experts for advice, try them on and assess the fit. We are constantly researching and analyzing thousands of stocks, narrowing down the best choices at the right time. When you come in to talk with us, we’ll be ready to find the best fit for you.







Coaching


We believe in the power of good coaching. So much so that we don’t provide you with just one coach — your investments are reviewed by our entire team. That’s years upon years of experience, expertise and sound thinking working on your behalf. And while we don’t typically engage in motivational speeches, if that’s something you’d like, we can certainly oblige.







Endurance


There’s another marathon scenario that bears comparison: going out too fast. Many a runner has suffered later in the race because they were so excited at the beginning, they didn’t stick to their training pace, started too fast and paid the price later. We are firm believers in keeping an eye on the finish line, sticking with our strategy and not getting caught up in the excitement of the latest buy/sell craze. This strategy has worked well, time and again, for those clients who are committed to maintaining a winning pace.







Goals


The reason most people run a marathon is because it’s a goal they wish to achieve. But the only way to cross the finish line is to marry that goal with a sound strategy. When you come in to Woodley Farra, the first thing we do is get to know you and your goals. Then, utilizing one of our portfolios, we put together a strategy to help you achieve them. And when the market puts up roadblocks from time to time, we’re there monitoring and adjusting, communicating and coaching. We’re not just cheering you from the sidelines — we’re running the course right beside you.










Our Unique Approach:

Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.

Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
