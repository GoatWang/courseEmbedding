Data Technical News #2017 - 1

                Nasdaq Announces New Multicast IP Addresses for ISE Gemini Proprietary Data Feeds
        







Markets Impacted:

ISE Gemini

Products Impacted:

Nasdaq ISE Gemini Depth of Market Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Order Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Top Quote Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Trade Feed

Contact Information:

Nasdaq Global Information Services at + 1 301 978 5307

Resources:

Nasdaq ISE Integration FAQs
Nasdaq ISE Migration Contact List
Nasdaq Global Data Products Administration page



What you need to know:
In support of the ISE Nasdaq Technology Migration, ISE Gemini will introduce new IP addresses for the New York metro area data center for the following data feeds:

Nasdaq ISE Gemini Depth of Market Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Order Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Top Quote Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Trade Feed

Effective immediately, clients may connect to the new IP addresses.
Nasdaq requests that direct data feed clients make the necessary network changes in order to prevent loss of data by Monday, February 27, 2017.







What is changing?
As announced in Options Trader Alert #2016 - 20, Nasdaq is undergoing a technology migration on the ISE Markets. The ISE trading systems will be migrated to Nasdaq’s INET technology starting with ISE Gemini as the first exchange to make the transition.
We firmly believe that once the ISE trading platforms have migrated to the Nasdaq INET technology, customers will:

Receive competitive advantages, by having the ability to trade options on six distinct trading platforms with the same best-in-class technology.
Leverage Nasdaq's superior technology while taking advantage of the unique order types and risk management features for which ISE is known.

As part of the transition, Nasdaq will introduce new IP addresses for the New York metro area data center immediately for the following data feeds:

Nasdaq ISE Gemini Depth of Market Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Order Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Top Quote Feed
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Trade Feed

To ensure a smooth transition, Nasdaq will support a parallel period for clients to upgrade their network configurations. Firms will be required to receive data via the new IP addresses as symbols migrate to the new system. Firms will continue to receive data via the current IP addresses for symbols that have not yet migrated. Connections to legacy feeds will be retired when the symbol migration is complete. Symbol migration will begin on Monday, February 27, 2017, and firms must make the transition prior to that date to prevent loss of data.
Will firms need to request connectivity access to the new IP Address information?
Yes, in order to access the new IP addresses, existing firms will need to complete the Data Feed Request Form to receive the data.
New firms need to complete the following agreements to receive the data:

Data Feed Request Form - Required for all firms.
Nasdaq Global Data Agreement - Required for all firms prior to initiation of the first Nasdaq data service only.
System Application - Required for firms only if the data will be displayed or used in a system that is not yet approved by Nasdaq.

For the complete list of Nasdaq agreements and forms, please refer to the Nasdaq Global Data Products Administration page on the Nasdaq Trader website.
If you need assistance with the application process, please contact your Nasdaq Sales Representative.
What are the new IP addresses?
For the new IP information, please refer to the UDP/IP Addresses - U.S. Derivatives Data Feeds page on Nasdaq Trader. Please note, the Source IP Addresses are ranges, not specific IP Addresses.
In order to obtain a re-request login, please send an email to DL-GeminiISE@nasdaq.com.
Nasdaq suggests that market data vendors aim to make the necessary network changes by Saturday, January 28, 2017 to allow time to test during the UAT dates and to avoid loss of data when the symbol migration begins on Monday, February 27, 2017.
How can firms verify connectivity to the new IP Addresses?
Effective immediately, Nasdaq will publish heartbeats over all new broadcast channels for firms to verify connectivity.
Will Nasdaq provide User Acceptance Testing?
Yes, Nasdaq will hold three Saturday UAT sessions that will take place between 9:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. ET on:

Saturday, January 28, 2017
Saturday, February 4, 2017
Saturday, February 11, 2017

What are the affected data feeds?
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Depth of Market Feed - bids and offers at the top five price levels of the order book.
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Order Feed - provides a snapshot of every order that rests on the book for simple (single legged) instruments
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Top Quote Feed - Best Bid and Offer (IBBO) at the top price level of the order book, as well as trades and trading status information.
Nasdaq ISE Gemini Trade Feed - provides last trade (price and quantity) along with other trade statistics.
What are the bandwidth recommendations?
For your convenience, the recommendations are provided below:

Current Bandwidth Recommendation


Nasdaq ISE Gemini Depth of Market Feed

ISE Gemini
Effective Monday, February 27, 2017, pending filing with the SEC, the following changes will apply to the ISE Gemini Fee Schedule:

In connection with the migration of ISE Gemini to the Nasdaq INET technology (see OTA 2017-13) there will be no fees or rebates for trades in options overlying Calpine Corporation (“CPN”) executed on February 27 and 28, 2017, nor will volume executed in options overlying CPN on February 27 and 28, 2017 be counted towards a member’s Qualifying Tier Threshold.  Beginning March 1, 2017, options overlying CPN will be fee liable and rebate eligible per the ISE Gemini Fee Schedule.

For the entire month of March 2017 only, all Qualifying Tier Threshold ADV calculations will be based on the better of:
The member’s full month ADV for the period of March 1, 2017 through March 31, 2017 or
The member’s ADV for the period of March 1, 2017 through March 24, 2017.

For example: if a member’s monthly Total Affiliated Member ADV as of March 24th was 300,000 contracts, the member would qualify for Qualifying Tier Threshold Tier 3 for their full month of activity on ISE Gemini.  
If the member’s Total Affiliated Member ADV were to increase to more than 350,000 contracts for the full month of March, the member would qualify for Tier 4.  This member would not fall under Tier 3 for the month of March based on their March 1 – March 24 activity on ISE Gemini. 

All ports used to connect to the INET platform on ISE Gemini will be free during the migration period, starting on February 27, 2017 and concluding on March 31, 2017.  These include:
SQF Port Fee
SQF Purge Port Fee
OTTO Port Fee
CTI Port Fee
FIX Port Fee
FIX Drop Port Fee
Disaster Recovery Port Fee
ITTO Port Fee

ISE Gemini and Fragmentation in the Options Market






















Bloomberg Tradebook

                            

                    
                        August 2, 2013                    



The International Securities Exchange (ISE) won approval and will launch the 12th U.S. options exchange, ISE Gemini, on August 5th.
In our post SPY Options: Customized vs. Fragmented Liquidity, we discussed the trend of increased liquidity fragmentation due to the introduction of new expirations (weeklys and quarterlys) and different contract specifications (minis and jumbos). If we assume that the amount of liquidity supplied by market makers is constant and limited, then spreading it across different products only increases fragmentation. Adding another exchange will also increase fragmentation. In other words, it might become harder to determine market liquidity and harder to execute a big trade.




Photographer: Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg




If you are trading options electronically, given the increased liquidity fragmentation, there are ‘must have’ tools to intelligently route and post orders. First, you need access to fast and accurate composite quotes and bid/ask quantities. Second, you need to be able to ‘sweep’ liquidity at a given price level using a Smart Order Router (SOR). Third, the SOR needs to be able to use historical volume patterns as an input to determine where to post bids and offers across multiple venues. This is even more important for less liquid names. In a recent July 2013 TABB report titled U.S. Options Trading: Looking for the Edge, Andy Nybo states that 72% of all U.S. listed options volume comes from the top 100 names. This statistic is noteworthy considering there are approximately 3500 listed options.
The list of ‘must haves’ also applies to the electronic trading of spreads (or strategies with more than one leg). There are currently seven exchange-supported complex order books; we expect this number to grow. Plus there is liquidity spread across the individual natural legs of the spread (including an equity or futures leg). The ability to sweep and post across multiple spread books in addition to accessing the liquidity in the natural legs has quickly become a ‘must have’ for the serious options trader.
Algorithms and advanced order types are important in options just like in other asset classes, but the foundation of a reliable electronic trading solution remains fast and intelligent posting and routing.

ISE Gemini Is The Fastest New Exchange To  Surpass Two Percent Market Share In Equity Options - Successful Product Rollout Completed On An Accelerated Basis

				Date 27/08/2013
The International Securities Exchange (ISE) announced that ISE GeminiTM surpassed two percent market share yesterday in equity options, the fastest exchange to reach that milestone since ISE introduced electronic trading to the options market in 2000. ISE Gemini also successfully concluded its product listing plan on an accelerated basis, less than a month after launching on August 5.
“Since ISE’s inception, one of our core values has been a dedication to growth through innovation and the record market share milestone is a testament to that,” said Boris Ilyevsky, Managing Director of ISE. “The pricing structure, market model and listings plan we developed were meant to ensure a methodical introduction to ISE Gemini, and the extremely smooth rollout has surpassed our expectations. We are gratified that ISE Gemini continues to be well received and look forward to continued growth of our new exchange.”
ISE Gemini completed an accelerated rollout of the product listing plan in five phases, well-ahead of the original mid-September target. The full list of products trading on ISE Gemini can be viewed here.
ISE Gemini is the only options exchange that offers maker-taker pricing combined with ISE’s patented pro-rata and customer priority market structure. ISE Gemini also plans to significantly expand the roll-out to more product listings and anticipates additional market makers to start quoting in the coming weeks.
