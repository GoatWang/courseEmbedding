 I like monitoring dividend increases for stocks on my watch list of dividend growth stocks because I consider such stocks to be candidates for further analysis. Companies that regularly increase dividends show confidence in the potential growth of future earnings. Recently, 10 companies on my watch list announced dividend increases, including 3 of the stocks I hold in my portfolio. The table below presents a summary of these increases.

Please note that I'm not recommending any of these stocks. Readers should do their own research on these companies before buying shares. As a bonus, I'm including charts from F.A.S.T. Graphs for three of this week's dividend raisers, WBA, NNN, and HCSG. In these charts, the black line represents the share price and the blue line represents the calculated P/E multiple at which the market has tended to value the stock over time. The orange line is the primary valuation reference line. It is based on one of three valuation formulas depending on the earnings growth rate achieved over the time frame in question. (The Adjusted Earnings Growth Rate represents the slope of the orange line in the chart). 

 WBA's price line (black) is above the primary valuation line (orange) but below the stock's normal P/E ratio (blue). The stock is trading at about fair value. An investment in WBA in January 2007 would have returned 6.4% on an annualized basis (with dividends included). 

 NNN is a REIT (real estate investment trust), so I use adjusted funds from operations rather than earnings. NNN's price line is below its normal P/AFFO ratio but above the primary valuation line, so NNN is trading at about fair value. An investment in NNN in January 2011 would have returned 10.1% on an annualized basis (with dividends included).
 

 HCSG's price line is well above the primary valuation line and above the stock's normal P/E ratio. The stock is trading at a premium to fair value. An investment in HCSG in January 2007 would have returned 18.2% on an annualized basis (with dividends included). Thanks for reading!

EDR Trading Below Director's Recent Buy Price

There's an old saying on Wall Street about insider buying: there are many possible reasons to sell a stock, but only one reason to buy. Back on May 17, Education Realty Trust Inc's Director, Kimberly Schaefer, invested $37,630.00 into 1,000 shares of EDR, for a cost per share of $37.63. Bargain hunters tend to pay particular attention to insider buys like this one, because presumably the only reason an insider would take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock of their company in the open market, is that they expect to make money. In trading on Monday, bargain hunters could buy shares of Education Realty Trust Inc (Symbol: EDR) and achieve a cost basis even cheaper than Schaefer, with shares changing hands as low as $37.62 per share. Education Realty Trust Inc shares are currently trading down about 0.8% on the day. The chart below shows the one year performance of EDR shares, versus its 200 day moving average:       Looking at the chart above, EDR's low point in its 52 week range is $36.98 per share, with $48.87 as the 52 week high point - that compares with a last trade of $37.72. By comparison, below is a table showing the prices at which EDR insider buying  was recorded over the last six months:     Purchased Insider Title Shares Price/Share Value   05/17/2017 Kimberly Schaefer Director 1,000 $37.63 $37,630.00      The current annualized dividend paid by Education Realty Trust Inc is $1.52/share, currently paid in quarterly installments, and its most recent dividend ex-date was on 04/26/2017. Below is a long-term dividend history chart for EDR, which can be of good help in judging whether the most recent dividend with approx. 4.0% annualized yield is likely to continue.       According to the ETF Finder at ETF Channel, EDR makes up 1.20% of the PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility Portfolio ETF (Symbol: XMLV) which is trading lower by about 0.3% on the day Monday.

Yes, Airlines Do Have the Right to Change Your Seat Without Warning


July 20, 2017 20:30·





Delta hits back after Ann Coulter tweetstorm
Delta responded by calling Coulter's comments "unacceptable and unnecessary". Almost every time, the flight attendant has thanked my willingness to be flexible with free bottles of wine or a snack.
Coulter had booked an aisle seat, but got a window seat.Oh, and Delta refunded the right-wing columnist the $30 she paid for the seat with extra room.Delta's contract of carriage states: "Delta may substitute alternate carriers or aircraft, delay or cancel flights, change seat assignments, and alter or omit stopping places shown on the ticket at any time".

Archie's Sonic The Hedgehog Comic Is Officially Cancelled
					In the end, there were roughly 500 Sonic-related comic issues released until the sudden end and that's nothing to laugh at. Not just fans, but current and former staff of the series were stunned by the news.
				"Someone at the desk saw Ann's name and picked it on goal?"The six-foot-tall Coulter had booked an aisle seat for the extra legroom during the flight from NY to Palm Beach, Florida. Delta also wrote that it was "disappointed that the customer has chosen to publicly attack our employees and other customers by posting derogatory and slanderous comments and photos in social media". "Additionally, your insults about our other customers and employees are unacceptable and unnecessary".She then managed to lose a good deal of sympathy people had for her and her situation when she chose to take a photo of the young woman in her seat and send it out to her 1.6 million Twitter followers while referring to the her as 'dachshund-legged'. "And we hold each other accountable when that does not happen". But the airline's dismissive, scolding Twitter response to Coulter when she lodged her complaint lends some credence to her allegation.Delta eventually responded to Coulter a little over 24 hours into her after she first tweeted and said that it would refund her the extra $30 she paid for her preferred seat.

NBC2 Investigators: OJ Simpson could soon call SWFL home
					Four commissioners will deliberate in Carson City; if they are unanimous, that will become the final decision. Added Kim Goldman, "He committed a awful heinous crime , and I have no feeling except rot in hell".
				She joked that Delta hires people who seek to be prison guards, animal handlers or East German police."The worst airline in America" she said in a tweet to her 1.6 million followers on Saturday night."I totally get it", tweeted actor Chris Evans.Over the course of the next few days, Coulter has posted dozens of tweets attacking the airline. "I must pre-select a brush, investigate types of paste, and periodically spit bulls-t".

The BidaskClub Downgrades First Potomac Realty Trust (NYSE:FPO) to Hold
					Finally, Chartwell Investment Partners LLC increased its stake in shares of Education Realty Trust by 1.4% in the first quarter. The real estate investment trust reported $1.50 EPS for the quarter, beating analysts' consensus estimates of $1.47 by $0.03.
				Coulter's frustration is understandable, but the Delta Air Lines website reiterates that there are circumstances where there's an "occasional need to change another individual's pre-assigned seat, with bulkhead seats being particularly subject to reassignment".

United Kingdom teens say Instagram is the worst app for cyberbullying
20 Июля 2017


At one point, you'd probably say Twitter, but according to a new study done by Ditch the Label, a British anti-bullying non profit group, it's Instagram.Whereas Instagram seems to harbor cyber bullying for teens in Britain, in an older report done by US based Cox Communications in 2014,  Facebook was labeled the worst place for cyberbullying in their study of 1,301 teens from 13-17 years old - said 39% of teens witnessed bullying on Facebook. Where anonymity on social networks become a platform for free speech, it also turns into a platform for irrational behaviour and comments.In the study, 10,000 British teens were studied, and 42% said they were bullied on Instagram."We need to better understand the ways in which online and offline lives co-exist today and encourage young people to manage their online interactions safely", Professor Ian Rivers told Ditch the Label.

According to the report, the most common forms of cyberbullying included having nasty comments posted on profiles and photos, receiving unwelcome private messages, and having profiles wrongfully reported. Interestingly, from the total, 92 percent of the people said that they were using YouTube, making it the most popular platform in the survey, only about 10 percent experienced bullying on the platform. "And to this day I don't know if that person has put it online", she continued. The report also found that more than half of all young people in the United Kingdom have been bullied at some point."Using machine learning technology, offensive comments on Instagram are now automatically blocked from appearing on people's accounts".Perhaps the most interesting finding, however, is the 71 per cent of respondents that feel social networks don't do enough to prevent cyberbullying - though this is something many of them have been working on. And of those who recognised they have bullied somebody, 11 percent said that they bullied someone daily, and 7 percent said they did several times a week. You can text the Crisis Text Line at 741-741 or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 if you require support in dealing with what you're going through or if you're having suicidal thoughts.

				ABOUT EdR
			
 
 




A leader in the collegiate housing industry since 1964, EdR is one of the largest developers, owners and managers of high-quality collegiate housing communities. 
EdR is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: EDR). As a REIT, we create and own properties that will bring value to our portfolio and stockholders for a long time. Our projects are built to last and to be profitable for many years to come. 
Formerly known as Education Realty Trust and, before that Allen & O’Hara, EdR set every standard for the collegiate housing industry for almost a half-century. Our deep understanding of our ever-evolving customer stimulates a constant stream of innovations and improvements, along with a portfolio of impressive developments across the United States. 
Fast forward to today: EdR is again setting the pace with the nation’s largest on-campus housing revitalization program at the University of Kentucky. Innovations continue in other areas including financing to make on-campus developments more viable for universities and construction to make our buildings more sustainable, energy-saving and maintainable. 
EdR’s experienced and respected teams provide impressive facilities and valuable services to our customers — universities, residents (students, faculty and staff families) and owners. EdR is known for innovative solutions, financing and design as well as quality, long-lasting construction, sustainable buildings and successful management programs for our communities. With the experience of our rich history along with our creative, innovative team members and our deep financial capacity, EdR really is the very best in collegiate housing.
 HISTORY The predecessor of EdR was founded in 1952. A simple construction company, Allen & O’Hara soon became one of the nation’s most successful developers when they began working with another company founded in Memphis that same year, Holiday Inn. 
The company soon expanded and, in 1964, introduced the “student hotel concept” to the market and, thus, created the student housing industry. 
That first “privatized” student housing development was Granville Towers — a 1,300 bed high-rise on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. EdR still manages it today for the UNC Foundation. In 2014, we will celebrate our 50th Anniversary there. Not many companies can keep a satisfied client for 50 years! Read more about our award-winning multi-million dollar renovation at Granville Towers.
 MILE MARKERS
EdR began as Allen Bros. Construction Co. in 1952. We soon became Allen & O’Hara and built Holiday Inns and other hotels and office buildings across America. 
In 1964, Allen & O’Hara introduced the “student hotel” concept and the four-person suite with the historic Granville Towers at the University of North Carolina. It was the first privatized housing facility at a public university. 
One year later, we introduced individual leasing — a cornerstone of our industry. 
In 1970 we took student housing co-ed. 
We assumed the management of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. portfolio of 16,000 student housing beds in 1971 and retained that client until they sold their portfolio 27 years later in 1998. 
In 2012, after operating for years with the dual identities of Education Realty Trust and Allen & O’Hara, we adopted one name, EdR. 

 INNOVATIONS EdR has led the student housing industry through the years with many “firsts” and industry-leading innovations:
First food-service contract for collegiate housing 
First to accept credit cards for rent payment Introduced the “dine anytime” concept so students could eat whenever convenient 
First to co-market off-campus facilities with university residence halls 
First proprietary, computerized accounts receivable and revenue management system< 
In 2000, the first bond-financed property and signed contracts for the first public-private partnership development in the California State University system and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. 
In 2009, EdR created both The ONE PlanSM and The ONE Plan PLUSSM – two new on-campus equity plans that allow colleges and universities to use EdR’s equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their funds and debt capacity for other projects. 
In 2011, EdR was selected by the University of Kentucky to design, construct, finance and manage the largest on-campus revitalization development to-date. The $500 million, multi-phase project will systematically build and demolish 6,000 on-campus beds and increase UK’s on-campus beds to approximately 9,000 creating a state-of-the-art living-learning environment for this progressive campus. Each phase of the multi-year development has been delivered on time and future phases are on schedule.

Student Housing Business Magazine Awards - 2012



Most Creative Public-Private Financing — Colorado State University-Pueblo
					    EdR nimbly responded to the acute market downturn that occurred in the midst of launching a second phase of upgraded collegiate housing as the first phase was commencing construction. While tax-exempt bonds had been the preferred option at the outset, the market downturn and concomitant rising costs of bond financing would have rendered the rents unaffordable for the university's working- and lower middle-class students. EdR first secured a long-term construction loan that would have to be replaced later by permanent financing. EdR began Phase 2's site testing and design on the heels of Phase 1's construction. As system financing became the obvious option for proceeding with Phase 2, EdR worked with the Colorado State University System to obtain system financing. The Phase 2 permanent financing through CSUS also took Phase 1 out of its construction loan. During Phase 2, and as a result of state procurement rules, EdR worked under a consulting agreement during the development process and as an agent for CSU-Pueblo, providing construction oversight. Prior to breaking ground, however, we had to put Phase 2's construction out to bid. On our compressed schedule, this was no small feat but it was accomplished successfully. Though unusual, we had two contractors working on separate phases of the project. Phase 1, Crestone Hall, was completed in fall 2009 for $15.6 million. Phase 2's Culebra and Greenhorn Halls were delivered in 2010 for $27 million. Both phases were completed early and under budget ($49.6 million total development cost). These collegiate housing communities have earned architectural awards as well as Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold status.

Best Vendor University Solution, On Campus — University of Louisville
					    The University of Louisville (UL) needed data similar to those EdR collected for on-campus collegiate housing it developed and managed for the university. In summer 2011, EdR and UL's Department of Housing and Residence Life began discussing how to integrate assessing both UL and EdR student satisfaction. UL and EdR already had successfully integrated marketing, joint license, transfers, assignment database, delinquent account process, resident assistant training and rent payments (including agreements with financial aid). To complete this seamless relationship, it made sense to combine assessment efforts. By doing so, EdR helped UL get the information it needed quickly and inexpensively. Offering the same survey tools to students and parents, UL and EdR gained the ability to compare outcomes across campus consistently, enhancing the data's usefulness. By joining forces, UL eliminated a duplication of effort, thus saving money. This solution also saved a significant amount of UL's time, precluding the need for a request for proposal process that would have been labor-intensive and taken months to complete. UL also did not have to spend the staff hours developing its own tool and running its own analyses.

Best Renovation of Existing Product, Off Campus — Granville Towers at the UNC Chapel Hill
					    Working together, Chapel Hill Foundation Real Estate Holdings, Inc., and EdR, as manager, began a renovation that revitalized the community and maximized occupancy. The $900,000 revitalization program covered the spectrum, from interior renovations to information technology (IT) upgrades, to a new brand and logo campaign. Through these coordinated efforts, in 2011 Granville Towers reached 100% occupancy for the first time in the past five years. With other upgrades to the property's food service and exterior stairwells, overall renovation costs totaled $1.5 million.

Best Vendor Operator Solution, Off Campus — GrandMarc at The Corner, UVa, Mobile Upgrade
					    EdR overcame an issue with Charlottesville's lack of cell coverage and service providers' delays in addressing the issue by being proactive and installing its own Distributive Antenna System. EdR's off-campus community has transformed from a dead zone to one with "five bars" for the major carriers in the market. Thus the safety and social concerns of our residents were addressed and "negative buzz" has been eliminated. Providing a long-term solution to the cell service issues helped to maintain customer satisfaction and created a positive buzz for the community in the market.

Student Housing Business Magazine Awards - 2011



Best Public/Private Partnership Development — “Residential Revival at IUP”
					    EdR systematically created 3,516 beds — the single largest privatized collegiate housing replacement program in the nation — while ensuring no loss of bed count as 11 older dorms were demolished. Through this successful public/private partnership 1.15 million square feet of suite-style accommodations in eight new living-learning and mixed-use buildings replaced obsolete and outmoded dormitories during the four-phase project. EdR oversaw the entire process through design, tax-exempt bond financing and construction (providing oversight as the owner's representative). The new residences are credited with greatly increasing applications, which had been declining at this flagship university of the Pennsylvania state system, and admissions. Enrollment at Indiana University of Pennsylvania is at an all-time high with an increase of more than 1,000 students.
					    					   

Most Creative On-Campus Public/Private Financing — Syracuse University
					    EdR created a new financing approach, since imitated by others, to fulfill Syracuse's need for cutting-edge, on-campus upper-class housing to replace a 40-year-old, outmoded facility. The project became the foundation for EdR's innovative On-Campus Equity Plan — The ONE Plan℠ — and allowed Syracuse to use our equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize its on-campus housing. Using EdR's private equity allowed Syracuse to retain its borrowing capacity for academic buildings and a library. EdR's 50% equity allowed financing to be consummated despite a deteriorating national economy and financing market at the time. Based on this program's success, Syracuse has engaged EdR to develop graduate student housing, again leveraging the ONE Plan℠ for financing it.
					    					   

Best On-Campus Bandwidth/Connectivity Solution — Syracuse University
					    EdR and its internet partner and contractor, Pavlov Media, earned this award for work the two companies completed to solve a bandwidth issue at University Village Apartments at Syracuse University.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

About Price
The company's Stock price change every day as a result of market forces. The share prices change because of supply and demand. If more people want to buy a stock (demand) than sell it (supply), then the price moves up. Conversely, if more people wanted to sell a stock than buy it, there would be greater supply than demand, and the price would fall.

				ABOUT EdR
			
 
 




A leader in the collegiate housing industry since 1964, EdR is one of the largest developers, owners and managers of high-quality collegiate housing communities. 
EdR is a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT) publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: EDR). As a REIT, we create and own properties that will bring value to our portfolio and stockholders for a long time. Our projects are built to last and to be profitable for many years to come. 
Formerly known as Education Realty Trust and, before that Allen & O’Hara, EdR set every standard for the collegiate housing industry for almost a half-century. Our deep understanding of our ever-evolving customer stimulates a constant stream of innovations and improvements, along with a portfolio of impressive developments across the United States. 
Fast forward to today: EdR is again setting the pace with the nation’s largest on-campus housing revitalization program at the University of Kentucky. Innovations continue in other areas including financing to make on-campus developments more viable for universities and construction to make our buildings more sustainable, energy-saving and maintainable. 
EdR’s experienced and respected teams provide impressive facilities and valuable services to our customers — universities, residents (students, faculty and staff families) and owners. EdR is known for innovative solutions, financing and design as well as quality, long-lasting construction, sustainable buildings and successful management programs for our communities. With the experience of our rich history along with our creative, innovative team members and our deep financial capacity, EdR really is the very best in collegiate housing.
 HISTORY The predecessor of EdR was founded in 1952. A simple construction company, Allen & O’Hara soon became one of the nation’s most successful developers when they began working with another company founded in Memphis that same year, Holiday Inn. 
The company soon expanded and, in 1964, introduced the “student hotel concept” to the market and, thus, created the student housing industry. 
That first “privatized” student housing development was Granville Towers — a 1,300 bed high-rise on the campus of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. EdR still manages it today for the UNC Foundation. In 2014, we will celebrate our 50th Anniversary there. Not many companies can keep a satisfied client for 50 years! Read more about our award-winning multi-million dollar renovation at Granville Towers.
 MILE MARKERS
EdR began as Allen Bros. Construction Co. in 1952. We soon became Allen & O’Hara and built Holiday Inns and other hotels and office buildings across America. 
In 1964, Allen & O’Hara introduced the “student hotel” concept and the four-person suite with the historic Granville Towers at the University of North Carolina. It was the first privatized housing facility at a public university. 
One year later, we introduced individual leasing — a cornerstone of our industry. 
In 1970 we took student housing co-ed. 
We assumed the management of the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. portfolio of 16,000 student housing beds in 1971 and retained that client until they sold their portfolio 27 years later in 1998. 
In 2012, after operating for years with the dual identities of Education Realty Trust and Allen & O’Hara, we adopted one name, EdR. 

 INNOVATIONS EdR has led the student housing industry through the years with many “firsts” and industry-leading innovations:
First food-service contract for collegiate housing 
First to accept credit cards for rent payment Introduced the “dine anytime” concept so students could eat whenever convenient 
First to co-market off-campus facilities with university residence halls 
First proprietary, computerized accounts receivable and revenue management system< 
In 2000, the first bond-financed property and signed contracts for the first public-private partnership development in the California State University system and the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education. 
In 2009, EdR created both The ONE PlanSM and The ONE Plan PLUSSM – two new on-campus equity plans that allow colleges and universities to use EdR’s equity and financial stability to develop and revitalize campus housing while preserving their funds and debt capacity for other projects. 
In 2011, EdR was selected by the University of Kentucky to design, construct, finance and manage the largest on-campus revitalization development to-date. The $500 million, multi-phase project will systematically build and demolish 6,000 on-campus beds and increase UK’s on-campus beds to approximately 9,000 creating a state-of-the-art living-learning environment for this progressive campus. Each phase of the multi-year development has been delivered on time and future phases are on schedule.
