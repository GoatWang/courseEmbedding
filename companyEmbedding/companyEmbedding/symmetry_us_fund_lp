Symmetry Investment Advisors, inc.



































































































Symmetry Investment Advisors. Inc.
                is a private equity fund of funds manager focused on the secondary
                market.  Formed in 2003 by two veteran private equity partnership
                investors, the firm concentrates on purchasing and managing small
                portfolios and small individual interests of pre-established
                private equity partnerships.  This team has over 50 years
                of collective private equity investment experience covering a
                variety of private equity activities.  Together they have
                managed discretionary and non-discretionary separate accounts,
                a venture capital fund of funds and a dedicated secondary purchase
                fund. Their prior activities cover the private equity spectrum,
                from primary and secondary partnership investments (including
                venture capital and buyout) to seed and very late stage direct
                investments. 
Symmetry's mission is to provide differentiated
            products and services to institutional and individual investors to
            enable them to more effectively and profitably participate in private
            equity.
