Test Marketing








Read


Feedback

Version History

Usage















Test marketing is the final stage before commercialization, and is where all the elements of the marketing plan are tested.



Learning Objective


Discuss the requirements that must be satisfied to conduct successful test marketing of new products and distinguish test marketing from initial product testing





Key Points

Initial product testing and test marketing are very different. The former involves providing consumers with the test product, and giving them an incentive to participate. The latter involves all the elements of the marketing plan, in a real-world setting meant to simulate the broader market.
There are risks in test marketing, such as high initial marketing costs, the potential to lose customer goodwill before the official launch, and giving competitors the opportunity to quickly copy the product.
Variables in the test marketing process include the selection and number of test cities, as well as the ideal sample size to use.



Term


test marketing
The stage where all the variables in the marketing plan, as well as the product characteristics, are tested in a real-world setting.












Full Text
Test MarketingThis is the final step before commercialization. The objective of the this marketing phase is to test all the variables in the marketing plan, including different elements and characteristics of the product. This stage represents the launching of the total marketing program, albeit on a limited basis.Three questions can be answered through test marketing:
Is the overall workability of the marketing plan realized as planned?
Do alternative allocations of the budget need to be evaluated?
Can we determine whether users are being inspired to switch from their previous brands to the new one, and whether repeat purchases are taking place?
In the end, the test market should include an estimate of sales, market share, and financial performance over the life of the product.Initial product testing versus test marketingInitial product testing and test marketing are not the same. Product testing is totally initiated by the producer: he or she selects the sample of people, provides the consumer with the test product, and offers the consumer some sort of incentive to participate.Test marketing, on the other hand, is distinguished by the fact that the test cities represent the national market. The consumer must make the decision herself, must pay his or her own money, and the test product must compete with the existing products in the actual marketing environment. For these and other reasons, a market test is meant to serve as an accurate simulation of the national market and serves as a method for reducing risk. It should enhance the new product's probability of success and allow for final adjustment in the marketing mix before the product is introduced on a large scale.RisksTest marketing is not without inherent risks. First, there are substantial costs in buying the necessary productive capacity needed to manufacture the product or locating manufacturers willing to make limited runs. There are also promotional costs, particularly advertising and personal selling . Although not always easy to identify, there are indirect costs as well. For example, the money used to test market could be used for other activities. The risk of losing consumer goodwill through the testing of an inferior product is also very real. Finally, engaging in a test-market might allow competitors to become aware of the new product and quickly copy it.



Test Marketing
Aggressive promotion in a limited geographical area is often a key element of the test marketing phase.

Because of the special expertise needed to conduct test markets and the associated expenses, most manufacturers employ independent marketing research agencies with highly-trained project directors, statisticians, psychologists, and field supervisors. Such a firm would assist the product manager in making the remaining test market decisions.Variables
Selection of test market cities: these cities should reflect the norms for the new product in such areas as advertising, competition, distribution system, and product usage.
Number of test cities: should be based on the number of variations considered (i.e. vary price, package, or promotion), representativeness, and cost.
Sample size determination: the number of stores used should be adequate to represent the total market.
Even after all the test results are in, adjustments in the product are still made. Additional testing may be required, or the product may be deleted if it does not perform well during this stage, or if it becomes apparent that the product is not likely to become a commercial success.

Benefits and Solutions
The core benefit is what consumers feel they are getting when they purchase a product.









Features and Attributes of a Product
The features and attributes of a product are integral to the product design process, which in turn assists in the creation of new products.








Section 2
Types of Products








Consumer Products
A consumer product is any tangible product for sale that is used by a person or household for non-business purposes.









Shopping Products
Convenience goods are those that require little effort on the part of the buyer, while shopping goods require research and comparison.

Product Line Breadth
The breadth of the product mix consists of all the product lines that the company has to offer to its customers.









Product Line Depth
Companies employ different strategies to expand their product line depth, which refers to the number of products in a specific product line.









Product Lines in Services
By productizing a service it can be managed more like a product and various product lines can be created.








Section 4
Product Life Cycles








The Product Life Cycle
Every product goes through the various life cycle phases of introduction, growth, maturity and decline.









Growth
During the growth stage, the public becomes more aware of the product; as sales and revenues start to increase, profits begin to accrue.









Maturity
During the maturity stage, sales will peak as the product reaches market saturation, and competition will grow increasingly fierce.









Decline
During decline, sales growth becomes negative, profits decline, competition remains high, and the product ultimately reaches its 'death'.









Product Life-Cycle Curve
Product life cycles are a useful guide to lifetime sales and profits, and can help marketers understand what strategies to deploy & when.









Impact of the Product Life Cycle on Marketing Strategy
The stage of the life cycle of the product affects how it is marketed.








Section 5
Managing Existing Products








When to Extend Product Lines
A company can extend its product line using a down-market stretch, an up-market stretch, or a move both ways.









When to Modify Products
While the decision to modify products happens ideally at the design stage, products can be changed during any phase of the life cycle.








Section 6
New Product Development








The Need for New Products
In dynamic markets companies must constantly introduce new products and services to keep up with changing consumer wants and needs.









Strategy
A good NPDS can help organize research, prioritize customer needs, and reduce cost overruns, to ensure a smooth development process.









Idea Generation
The success of product-driven companies is directly tied to new product development, which is generated through innovative ideas.









Screening
During screening, the company evaluates whether to devote further resources to the development of a product at various stage gates.









Concept Testing
Concept testing is important for evaluating consumer responses to a product before market introduction.









Business Analysis
The output of the business analysis stage is a prediction about whether the product is likely to be profitable or not if ultimately produced.









Development
Development involves setting product specifications as well as testing the product with intended customer groups to gauge their reaction.









Test Marketing
Test marketing is the final stage before commercialization, and is where all the elements of the marketing plan are tested.









Commercialization
Commercialization the process of launching a new product; it may involve heavy promotion and filling the distribution networks with the product.









Success and Failure: Strategies to Improve Success
Marketers must learn from their own previous failures, and others' failures, to ensure that they are successful for the next product launch.








Section 7
Differentiating Factors in Product Design








Quality
Consumers place a value on quality; therefore high quality products may be able to win share and/or command a price premium.









Design and Feature Set
Premium features and design may help differentiate a product to earn it share or a price premium in the marketplace.









Support and Help
Excellent customer service can help differentiate a product or brand and may lead to increased brand loyalty over time.









Deletion
Product deletion, either through product replacement or product elimination, results when products fail to meet company expectations.









Organizational Requirements for Product Development and Management
Product development combined with product marketing make up the product management function within an organization.








Section 8

  New Standard for Upholstered Furniture Flammability California Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, Home Furnishings and Thermal Insulation (BEARHFTI) approved a new standard (Technical Bulletin (TB) 117 – 2013) for up-holstered furniture flammability. Effective January 1, 2015, upholstered furniture manufactured on and after that date must meet the requirements of the new TB 117-2013 standard.For years, upholstered furniture had to meet the California flammability requirements of standard TB 117-2000. This standard required filling materials such as foam to pass an open flame test. The updated method will change from the open flame method of testing to a smouldering test.CTL can test your product to ensure compliance to this regulation.   Canadian Provincial Regulation Update CTL wants to raise awareness of the Upholstered and Stuffed Article Regulations.

Terms and Conditions of Testing

Terms and conditions of testing by consumer testing laboratories, inc. and its affiliated
                                companies (hereinafter collectively referred to as "CTL")

By applying for or authorizing testing by ctl or submitting a sample for testing to ctl, you
                            (hereinafter referred to as "client" and/or "supplier") are agreeing to be bound by the
                            following terms and conditions:


                                Laboratory Reports are issued solely by CTL and are intended for the exclusive use of
                                Client and Supplier and shall not be used for advertising or promotion, copied or
                                replicated for distribution, or otherwise disclosed in whole or in part to any person or
                                entity without the prior written permission of CTL. 


                                Any use of CTL's name and/or seal is strictly prohibited without the prior written
                                permission of CTL.
                            

                                Laboratory Reports set forth the findings of CTL solely with respect to the sample(s)
                                identified therein and the results of testing are not indicative or representative of
                                the quality or characteristics of the lot from which the sample(s) has been taken. A
                                Laboratory Report reflects the findings of CTL at the time of testing based on the
                                written information provided to CTL as set forth in, or attached to, the Application for
                                Testing. The Laboratory Report represents the entire understanding of the parties with
                                respect to the subject matter of such Report and no modification, variance,
                                extrapolation or conclusion with respect thereto shall be permitted without the prior
                                written consent of CTL.


                                CTL may, in its sole discretion, destroy samples which have been submitted to CTL for
                                testing and which have not been destroyed in the course of testing. CTL may delegate the
                                performance of all or a portion of the testing services to an affiliate, agent or
                                subcontractor of CTL, and Client and Supplier consents to such delegation.


                                Foreign Clients or Suppliers shipping samples containing wildlife, including fish and
                                shellfish, to CTL in the United States must comply with laws governing the exportation
                                and importation of wildlife into the United States. Please consult the U. S. Fish &
                                Wildlife Service's website at http://www.fws.gov/le/index.html
                                for details. Failure to comply with these laws will result in shipments being delayed,
                                returned or confiscated.


                                Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by CTL, payment in full for the Laboratory Report
                                shall be due 30 days after the date of invoice. Client (or Supplier, if responsible for
                                testing fees) shall pay interest on any overdue amount from the due date until paid at
                                an interest rate of 1.5% per month. Client (or Supplier, if responsible for testing
                                fees) shall reimburse CTL for any costs it incurs in collecting past due amounts,
                                including attorneys' fees and court costs.


                                CTL represents and warrants solely to Client and Supplier that the Laboratory Report is
                                free of any material error or omission caused by the negligence of CTL. If Client or
                                Supplier desires to assert a claim for breach of the foregoing warranty, it must submit
                                a claim to CTL within 60 days after the date of issuance of the Laboratory Report to
                                Client in a writing that sets forth with particularity the basis for such claim. If CTL
                                determines that the claim is timely and that a breach of the foregoing warranty has
                                occurred, then CTL, at its option, may either (a) re-perform the deficient test, without
                                charge to Client or Supplier, or (b) refund to Client or Supplier, without interest, the
                                fee paid to CTL for such Laboratory Report. Client and Supplier waive any and all claims
                                for breach of the foregoing warranty, including, without limitation, claims that the
                                Laboratory Report is inaccurate, incomplete or misleading or that additional or
                                different testing is required, unless and then only to the extent that Client or
                                Supplier submits a written claim to CTL within such 60-day period.


                                Except for the limited warranty in paragraph 7, ctl makes no representation or warranty,
                                express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation, implied
                                warranties of accuracy, completeness, currentness, merchantability, fitness for a
                                particular purpose, or arising from a course of dealing or usage of trade. Regardless of
                                the form of action, whether based on statute or arising in contract, indemnity,
                                warranty, strict liability or tort (including negligence) and regardless of whether ctl
                                has reason to know or in fact knows of the possibility of damage or loss, ctl shall not
                                be liable to client, supplier or anyone else for any indirect, incidental, special,
                                consequential, reliance, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind (including, but not
                                limited to, loss of profit, loss of use of profit, loss of revenue, loss of production,
                                cost of capital, property damage, loss of use of property, or loss of reputation)
                                arising out of or in connection with any services performed by ctl, notwithstanding any
                                provision to the contrary contained herein. The maximum liability of ctl in respect of
                                any claim for loss, damage or expense of whatever kind or nature shall not exceed the
                                fees paid to ctl for the specific testing that gave rise to the claim.


                                These Terms and Conditions of Testing shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
                                with, the local laws of the country where CTL performs the tests or, in the case of
                                tests performed in the United States of America, the laws of the State of Arkansas. Any
                                proceeding related to the subject matter of testing shall be brought, if at all, in the
                                courts of the country where CTL performs the tests or, in the case of tests performed in
                                the United States of America, in the courts of the State of Arkansas.


                                If there is a discrepancy between the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms and
                                Conditions of Testing and any provisions set forth in the Laboratory Report, Application
                                for Testing or any other writing other than a written agreement for testing services
                                which expressly provides that its provisions shall take precedence over these Terms and
                                Conditions of Testing, these Terms and Conditions of Testing shall govern regardless of
                                any inconsistent provisions of any other writing.

Best product testing websites - Save the Student                   Make Money Best product testing websites     by   Owen Burek   in  Make Money  Updated  30 June 2017   Tweet     Do you want to get sent products to test, keep them and earn money for reviewing them? Of course you do!The kitchen cupboards are empty, your purse is feeling rather light, and it's months until you receive your next student loan instalment.We've all been there, and if you don't fancy robbing a bank, you'll probably think that you have no option but to look for a part-time job.But if you don't want to venture into the world of regular employment just yet, check out this guide for the best product testing companies who often pay for your opinions.If you're interested in getting rewards for product testing, you'll probably also fancy getting paid for filling out online surveys. Check out our full guide here.Guide to product testing:An introduction to product testingWhat rewards can you get?Best product testing sitesTips to maximise your product testingAn introduction to product testingThere are companies out there who are willing to pay you decent money for giving your opinions and reviewing their stuff.  They'll sometimes send products free of charge in exchange for your feedback (which you could sell online), or they might just pay you cold, hard cash for your views. Sounds great, doesn't it?We've already shared some great ways to make money, but this nifty guide will teach you everything you need to know about making money specifically from product testing. From assessing the benefits to finding the best (and legit) sites, we've got the essentials covered! Read on…What rewards can I get?Let's get down to business. Are the rewards really worth the time and effort? Well, yes, often they are. Rewards differ from site to site, but there's sure to be something that floats your boat.A few of the things we've received from product testingWe've seen some of the following freebies up for grabs:Vouchers for stores such as Debenhams and AmazonGadgets and technology like Apple iPads and Samsung smartphonesFood items (sometimes limited edition)DrinksCosmeticsToiletriesBooks and magazinesCashClothing and footwearIt's worth noting at this stage that not every user of product testing sites gets sent something to test. This is because there are 1000s of users and they simply can't afford to send out 1000+ free TVs for example. But they do say, if you don't buy a ticket you can't win the raffle…The best product testing websitesIf you want to get involved with product testing, you'll obviously need to know which websites offer the best deals.There are more popping up all the time, but there are a select few with great reputations that you can be sure will deliver what they promise. After testing a whole range of sites ourselves we have come up with a list of the most trusted product testing sites below.TolunaWe say: Toluna is pretty much the best site out there when it comes to getting free products and rewards for your views. You simply sign up for a free account (click here), then you can choose to start testing products or select various polls to answer.How it works: To receive free products for testing, you can visit the 'testing' area of the site (under rewards), and apply to test products. If you are chosen to test the product then it will be sent out to you.You get to the keep the items, in exchange for filling in a short survey about what you thought of the product.Example testing items: The goods on offer change all the time, but often include shower gel, toothpaste and cosmetics.Likelihood of receiving products: Toluna generally have around 200-500 of each product to test and testers are chosen at random each time.Sign up to Toluna »UserTestingWe say: UserTesting is awesome because it lets you test websites for money. Although you won't be testing products it's really fun and the range of sites you get to test keeps you entertained.How it works: You sign up and complete a test review. If that all goes well you are then sent sites to review from time to time.You then get paid $10 to your PayPal for every review you do and they only take around 20 minutes.Example testing items: Just websites (which you don't get to keep)…Likelihood of receiving products: It's a trusted site and only 1% of reviews get declined.Sign up to UserTesting »PineconeWe say: Pinecone is an excellent and well trusted survey and product testing site and one of the best paying.The only problem with them is that invites are hard to come by and we only get them every now and then (check via the link below).How it works: You can sign up to Pinecone to answer surveys and from time to time you might be asked to test a product.Example testing items: Beauty products, food & drink & moreLikelihood of receiving products: The Pinecone products are a little more limited than other sites but you have less users to content with so chances of getting a product are actually higher.Sign up to Pinecone »IpsosWe say: Ipsos is one of the UK's leading market research companies, and they are more than happy to reward you for your opinions.How it works: It's simply a case of filling in surveys and letting them know what you think about certain products, or what your typical buying habits are.Sometimes the surveys require IPSOS to send you a product to test.Example testing items: NALikelihood of receiving products: We've yet to be sent any products from IPSOS but have earned a lot through answering their surveys so it's still well worth signing up.Sign up to Ipsos »Producttesting.uk.comWe say: Producttesting.uk.com have lots of differing products to test from expensive electronic items to beauty products and weekends away.It's worth noting that we've had mixed reviews when promoting them in the past so be sure to be careful with your details such as your email.How it works: The link below goes through to an offer to test a Toshiba laptop and once you've signed up for that you can browse other items on the site for testing.Example testing items: iPhone 5s, iPads, TVs, beauty products, weekend breaks & more.Likelihood of receiving products: As with any product testing there is only a limited number of each product and users are chosen at random.Sign up to Producttesting »You can also want to try the website BzzAgent as well as looking out for "supermarket home panels" or signing up to fashion magazine newsletters but these product tests are very rare and hard to get on to.Product testing tipsKnow your oddsIt would be easy to assume that just because you have signed up to test a product that you will automatically receive it. Unfortunately this is not the case!Most companies set aside around £5,000 – £10,000 of products every month to test and because most of these sites have 1000s of users it means that they cannot sent a product to everyone.It's best to see it as if you are entering a competition each time!Be selective about the products you chooseIt's easy to get carried away and sign up for every free product you can find, but you're just wasting your own time.If you have no real interest in receiving the latest copy of a baby and parenting magazine, don't fill in the form!Always follow-up with the companyNever forget that these companies are giving you free stuff because they want to know what you think of them. If you forget to send your reviews, they probably won't send you anything again.It usually only takes a few minutes to give your feedback, so make sure you do it.Don't give up after one dayIf you sign up to a product testing website then never return, you're not likely to receive anything. Make sure you check back on a regular basis to see what's available.On sites such as Toluna, you can even chat with fellow testers. If you prove that you're reliable, have a fully updated profile and that you plan to stick around, you're more likely to receive the best products.Set up a "testing" emailIf you don't want your personal emails to get in the way of your testing emails (meaning that you might miss out on an opportunity) then we recommend setting up a testing email.The good news is that you can also use this email for competitions, survey sites and any other times when you are unsure about handing over your personal email.It might seem a bit too good to be true, but the product testing sites reviewed in this guide really are genuine and, if you stick with it, they'll happily send you enough items to keep your spending as low as possible.Have you ever used any of these sites? Did they work for you?

This  cannabis testing kit is a unique Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)  mini-laboratory.  It is registered,  trademarked, patented, and university-certified. Known as Canalytics, Cannalyse, or  Alpha Nova, the test kit contains a uniquely standardized and high performance  developing protocol sometimes known as High Performance Thin Layer  Chromatography or HPTLC. 
With  these test kits the  cannabinoids will be separated and identified on specially impregnated TLC  plates.  Total extraction means that the  THC residing inside the resin-producing, stalked, glandular trichomic cells  will be released and therefore measured as well.  The extraction solvent disrupts the cell walls  so all cannabinoid compounds will be released.This action is in contrast to  analytical laboratories where alcohol or hexane is used as extraction solvent  which only washes the oil droplets on the trichomes.  The greenish color of the extraction solvent  is an indication of the total extraction.   Only a minimal amount of sample (100-120 mg) is needed for total  cannabinoid extraction. More
Note: Hemp by US law must have less then 1% thc  so it will show no visible signs on a tlc plate but if any substance in hemp is more than 1% cannabis then it will show on the plate like CBD or CBG or CBN The manual tells how to read the results using the charts included for samples other than straight cannabis plant material 
The Cannalytics� test kit is   designed for testing marijuana. However, besides marijuana, Cannalytics�   can also be used to test other cannabis products. The amount of sample to be used for the tests depends on the   cannabis product itself. 
The following guidelines are suggested:
                    Marijuana 100 mg Hashish: 50 mg (or: weigh 100 mg, ) Dissolve in the test fluid and dilute this solution once more 1:1 with test fluid ( Most test will be 100 mg sample, hot test, 4ul on the TLC plate ) 
                    Space cake, Hash cookies & other edibles:100 mg
                    Marijuana concentrate pure oil: 50 mg. All other mixed oils 100mg
