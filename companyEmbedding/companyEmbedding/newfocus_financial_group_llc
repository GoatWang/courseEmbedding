Our firm provides comprehensive financial planning and investment management services to individuals, families, business owners, and professionals as well as trusts, retirement and pension plans.
Preserving wealth is as important, if not more important than, building wealth.
We specialize in helping our clients build, maintain and preserve wealth by providing financial analysis, professional advice and asset management with objectivity, professional expertise and experience.
Our financial planning professionals will work with you to develop a comprehensive plan and investment strategy that will allow you to gain control over your financial life and help you meet your goals.

Retirement planning, including accumulation and distribution strategies
Managing retirement or inherited assets

Regardless of our clients’ goals, they have one thing in common: the desire to work with a trusted advisor who can help them make smart financial decisions and manage their assets with a disciplined strategy—designed to protect and maximize wealth.
Our clients pay either a flat fee for financial planning services or an investment management fee based upon a percentage of assets.
If you are serious about securing your financial future, we invite you to review our list of frequently asked questions and to contact us for a complimentary initial consultation to discuss your financial goals and investment portfolio.

NewFocus Financial






Customer:
NewFocus Financial Group, LLC, is an independent firm providing comprehensive financial planning and investment management services such as trusts, retirements and pension plans to individuals, families, business owners and professionals. As a fiduciary for their clients, the company offers services on a fee basis rather than commission. Led by Chief Executive Officer and co-founder Chad Burton, NewFocus was formed in 2004, currently manages over $200 million in assets and is growing at a rate of $2 million per month. It employs 10 people, with six of its employees holding the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation.
Challenge:
When NewFocus Financial was formed, it used the help of a local bank. However, during the financial crisis of 2008, the bank went out of business and the group’s notes were sold to investors. Faced with looming balloon payments, NewFocus Financial looked to refinance - a major obstacle given the impact the declining economy had on the value of their commercial real estate. After the first lender NewFocus approached was unable to find a solution for their unique situation, Chad struck up a conversation with the KeyBank Relationship Manager who had helped him finance his personal watercraft. Their discussion opened doors for both KeyBank and NewFocus, allowing the two to start forging a business banking relationship.
Solution:
Since conventional financing wasn’t an option with the collateral shortfall caused by the devaluation of the real estate, Chad’s Relationship Manager suggested an SBA 7(a) loan to help with his business’s needs. Initially reluctant to apply for such a loan due to the “horror stories” he had heard about the process, he soon learned his fears were unfounded. KeyBank’s extensive experience as one of the largest Small Business Administration (SBA) preferred loan lenders enabled Chad’s Relationship Manager to walk him seamlessly through the application. The ease with which everything happened impressed Chad, but not as much as the solution itself: KeyBank’s revised payment plan would actually save NewFocus a substantial amount of money. What’s more, KeyBank was able to provide NewFocus with additional value-added benefits, such as downloadable QuickBooks software, flexible spending accounts and more.
Results:
Chad and the team at NewFocus have been completely satisfied with the level of service and responsiveness they’ve received from KeyBank, and applaud the bank’s ability to move quickly and keep pace with the company’s needs. Even better, the SBA 7(a) loans did more than just reduce payments for NewFocus. They actually improved the company’s cash flow - enabling the company to hire four new employees. There are even plans to add at least one more person in the near future, which will fill their current office space to capacity.
Chad is also excited about the fact that the loans will help with launching two new technology initiatives for the company and allow them to find a new location to support future growth. KeyBank is fully aware of the company’s upcoming needs and is already part of the planning process.
Since KeyBank is an expert with SBA loans, they were able to offer a solution and a customer experience that other banks could not pull off. KeyBank knew how to make the process go smoothly for NewFocus, providing the much-needed guidance to complete the application process. NewFocus is now projecting over $3 million in revenue over the next 12 months.
“I heard horror stories from clients about getting an SBA 7(a) loan. But KeyBank really made [the process] easy. And the fact that they saved us thousands of dollars on our payment didn’t hurt, either.” – Chad Burton, Chief Executive Officer and co-founder of NewFocus Financial Group, LLC
