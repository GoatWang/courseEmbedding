FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Examining Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp: Is Two Harbors Spin-Off A Buy? - Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. (NYSE:SBY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Examining Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp: Is Two Harbors Spin-Off A Buy?Dec.31.12 | About: Silver Bay (SBY) Stephen Ryan Special situations, value, long/short equitySilver Bay Realty Trust Corp (NYSE:SBY), the single-family rental spinoff of Two Harbors Investment Corp (NYSE:TWO), recently engaged in a $245(m) IPO on December 14th 2012. Silver Bay Realty is externally managed by PRCM Realty Trust LLC, a joint venture between Pine River Domestic Management L.P and Provident Real Estate Advisors LLC. PRCM will manage the day to day operations of Silver Bay Realty, and collect fees for services such as asset management, property management and acquisitions. The initial portfolio of real estate is comprised of 3,100 single family homes, with an average rent of $1,170, and vacancy of 68%. Silver Bay Realty's core properties were acquired in two separate transactions with Two Harbors Realty and Provident Real Estate Advisors LLC.
I believe Silver Bay Realty has the potential to be a great long term value play. The company's balance sheet offers significant value in the form of $6.05 in cash per common share, and an NAV of $17.65 per share.
The value of the balance sheet above is not capitalized, and the properties are valued on a carrying basis at fair value. If Silver Bay Realty can generate and NOI of $5,500,000 to $6,000,000, Silver Bay Realty will be in a position to benefit from a higher valuation. Armed with an NOI in the range of $6,000,000, and a 12-13% cap rate for single family properties, the value of the real estate portfolio will increase exponentially. However, this value could quickly become diminished, if Silver Bay Realty, and PRCM are unable to manage overhead. The companies' $200 million in cash need to be allocated carefully, and aggressive acquisition, coupled with the six month stabilization period for properties, doesn't allow any room for mistakes. Dividends need to be paid, and share dilution or leverage could compromise a balance sheet, in its present state, that is mortgage free and cash rich.
The big test will be if Silver Bay Realty's manager, PRCM Realty Trust LLC, has the ability to turn around the core portfolios vacancy of 68%. Estimates provided by the company's prospectus paint a bleak picture for the first quarter, with 3,100 single family units, and a vacancy rate of 62% (illustrated below), the company will not be profitable until it can significantly stabilize its geographical diaspora of properties.

Corporate Structure

While the corporate chart above seems daunting, it is a modified version of an upREIT, or an "umbrella partnership REIT." Besides a few small differences in Silver Bay Realty Trust's fee structure, these structures are very common. Entities known as upREITs transfer operating units (OP) in exchange for interest commercial property, creating a tax deferred transaction for the "seller" (Two Harbors Investors and Provident Investors LLC). In addition to OP units, stock in Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. is now owned by Provident investors (17%), Two Harbors (48%), which were received in consideration for Silver Bay Realty's core portfolio.

Common shares represent ownership in Silver Bay Realty Trust, a public stock. Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. owns a general partner interest in Silver Bay Operating Partnership L.P., the source of operating units to be distributed in addition to common shares.
Provident Entities' 880 properties come from 5 managed funds: (1) Polar Cactus LLC, (2) Polar Cactus II LLC, (3) Cool Willow LLC, (4) Provident Residential Real Estate Fund LLC and (5) Resi II LLC, all of which are owned by private investors. Private investors of the Provident family of funds will receive, in aggregate, 6.1 million common shares in Silver Bay Realty Trust, 27,500 operating units (OP) in Silver Bay Operating Partnership L.P. and $5.3 million in cash. Two Harbors Investments' entire portfolio of foreclosed properties (2,220 properties) was exchanged in consideration for $1,000,000 of 10% cumulative redeemable preferred stock in Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp and 17.8 million shares of common stock in Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp.

The total amount of common shares and OP units outstanding, following the completion of the above transactions is 37,357,263.
The baseline gross rental income from the core properties acquired upon IPO on December 12th is the product of an average rent of $1,177 per unit (illustrated above), and 992 units (32% occupancy), which equals $1,167,584 per month, and $3,502,752 per quarter. PRCM Real Estate Investors LLC has a management agreement with Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. that gives PRCM the right to certain fees and reimbursements, in consideration for certain services. The following table illustrates the asset management and property management fee structure outlined in Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp's 2012/12/14 SEC Form 424B4; Prospectus (Rule 424(b)(4)). The fees described below will be paid to PRCM Realty Trust LLC and its subsidiary Silver Bay Realty Property Group (100% ownership by PRCM).




 
Advisory Management Fee
Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. will pay PRCM 0.375% of the daily average of its fully diluted market-cap for the preceding quarter (a 1.5% annual rate), less any property management fees received by PRCM subsidiary: Silver Bay Realty Property Corp.
 
Property Management and Acquisition Services Fees to Silver Bay Realty Property Corp. (PRCM Subsidiary)
5% of "certain costs and expenses" will be reimbursed to Silver Bay Realty Property Corp. stemming from the acquisition, marketing, leasing and management of single-family properties on Silver Bay Realty Management Corps behalf.
 
General and Administrative Expenses Reimbursement
Reimbursement for all expenses incurred by PRCM on Silver Bay Realty's behalf or otherwise in connection with the operation of its business, other than compensation for the CEO.

While it is impossible to determine what general and administrative expenses will be, as they have yet to be released, the addition of this line item creates further overhead, payable to PRCM. PRCM has an acquisition staff of 30 brokers and sales agents and 25 property managers. In states without a full time staff, PRCM subcontracts services with companies familiar with the market.

This creates a level of uncertainty that seems volatile. A few periods of operating results will be a key for investors to determine whether this strategy is organized enough to property manage costs and oversight into diverse markets.
The Best Case Scenario
The asset management fee of .375% multiplied by the average daily market cap (12/28/12) represents a 26% operating margin for asset management alone, assuming 68% vacancy. In other words, currently, 73.7% of gross rent is dedicated to paying asset management fees to PRCM. However, Silver Bay estimates that "a significant portion" of the 1,667 properties owned by Prudent Realty were purchased within the last six months. Should Silver Bay lease the remainder of its core portfolio and have a handful of new acquisitions stabilized, in six months, Silver Bay Realty can expect a maximum gross rent of $3,648,700 per month, and a maximum of $10,946,100 for its second quarter (estimate).
Unfavorable Scenarios
Reimbursements fees due to PRCM are a mystery, and PRCM's ability to manage a geographically diverse portfolio will be a serious challenge. Unfortunately, we may not know whether the company's strategy has been a success for another half year, as Silver Bay estimates the majority of the portfolio it has acquired from its predecessors have been purchased within the last six months. This is significant because Silver Bay Realty estimates properties will take, on average, six months to renovate market and lease. One troubling section of Silver Bay Realty's December Prospectus, is the companies estimate of "annual advisory fee" due to PRCM:

The estimate above indicates that the company believes its average market cap, if divisible by the same amount of shares outstanding, will be $18.48. In order to reconcile this, the company either expects to have a flat price through 2013, or plans on diluting shares.

In addition to internal challenges, the US Housing Bureaus last estimate, in September of 2012, was 8.2% vacancy rate for single family homes. Single family homes are among the one rental sector to experience a rise in vacancies, possible due to low interest rates.
The low interest rate environment could pose a problem for Silver Bay Realty Trust as existing home sales have begun to increase, while single family rental rates have decreased.


While economic conditions in the housing market are beginning to turn against single family rentals, housing recovery does offer one benefit to Silver Bay Realty Trust: price appreciation. The chart below, taken from Silver Bay Realty's December prospectus, illustrate home value appreciation in the markets Silver Bay Realty has a presence.

Conclusion
While I believe there is serious value on the balance sheet of Silver Bay Realty Trust, profitability and success is a waiting game. With an estimate of a 6 month stabilization period for properties acquired by Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. it has yet to be seen whether this can be accomplished in harmony with general and administrative expenses reimbursements, and additional fees. Should the portfolio stabilize, only to have its profit eaten away by fees, the endeavor will be useless and the company will have to re-examine its corporate structure. Waiting before investing also provides us with time to consider the economic impact of a housing recovery, and what role it will play in property stabilization.

If PRCM and Silver Bay Realty have success in the next six months endeavor, and generates a healthy NOI, I am a buyer. For now, I watch with great curiosity and anticipation. If Silver Bay Realty and PRCM can pull off a successful enterprise, they will be the pioneers of single family rentals in the public market, and I believe other mortgage REITs with massive portfolios of foreclosed portfolios will complete further spinoffs: Annaly Capital Management (NLY, Chimera Investments (NYSE:CIM) Crexus Investments (NYSE:CXS), CYS Investments (NYSE:CYS), Hatteras Financial (NYSE:HTS), Dynex Capital (NYSE:DX), Capstead Mortgage Company (NYSE:CMO), Apollo Residential (NYSE:AMTG) and Eastern Light Capital (OTCPK:ELCI) are all potential candidates.
In conclusion, I will say this: I love the idea, I love the concept, I am just not ready to marry it yet.

(NYSE:SBY) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Silver Bay Realty Trust - A Business Model Doomed To FailApr. 1.13 | About: Silver Bay (SBY) Alpha Shark Long/short equitySilver Bay Realty Trust - A Business Model Doomed to Fail
Background
Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. (NYSE:SBY), or "Silver Bay," is the first real estate investment trust (REIT) that focuses solely on the acquisition, renovation, leasing and management of single-family properties. It raised $263 million, mostly from foreign investors looking to capitalize on their currency advantage, in its initial public offering in December 2012.
But it is not the only company with this idea. Private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP and other companies are also gambling on the single-family home rental market. These include Colony Capital LLC, Maynada Investment Group, and Pacifica Companies LLC.
The following is based on information from the Prospectus dated December 14, 2012, 10-K filed March 1, 2013 for the period ending December 13, 2012, as well as other sources.
Silver Bay's Strategy
Silver Bay management believes they can create economies of scale through the large scale purchase of REO inventory held for sale by banks, government-sponsored entities (GSEs), and other mortgage lenders or guarantors. The idea is to use investment money to purchase homes at prices below replacement value and then renovate and lease them to former homeowners who lost property to foreclosure and are unable to buy.
As of December 31, 2012, Silver Bay owned approximately 3,400 single-family properties in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.
The Single-Family Home Business Model
The single family home rental market has historically been dominated by mom-and pop outfits, including retirees, real estate brokers, doctors and other professionals. Some of these were unwilling landlords, renting out their former home with the expectation that it could be sold at a later time after the value increased. Others viewed their rental properties as sideline or supplemental retirement income in an attempt to diversify and / or hedge inflation.
Depending on the tenant, the condition of the home, and the neighborhood, a landlord could expect to expend considerable time and money in managing the tenant and maintaining the home when the home is occupied. When unoccupied, the home will require more attention to keep it in shape for potential renters, especially if the area has many other rental properties available. The home will also need to be monitored for vandalism or theft. Many vacant homes are being scavenged for copper, appliances and other valuable fixtures.

After having issues with tenants, neighbors, and / or the homeowner's association, a landlord may decide a rental is too much to handle and may decide to either sell the home to remove the headache or hire a management company that takes a percentage of the rent to market, manage, and maintain the property.
Hiring a management company may seem convenient to a landlord that either does not have the time or lives far from the rented property, but it also has some drawbacks. Issues with the tenant or property may not be communicated timely to the homeowner by the management company, resulting in frustrated tenants and the possible loss of rental income. Many management companies job out repairs to parties that pay them kickbacks to receive their job referrals. The result is higher repair costs or substandard repairs.
Why Investing in Single-Family Properties is Not Profitable
1 - The ideal tenant does not exist
Per the prospectus, "Prospective tenants are required to undergo background checks that include income verification, employment history, criminal record check, income-to-rent ratios, and credit score." But the prospectus also states, "We expect that the residential rental market will continue to grow, driven in significant part by distressed owners who are displaced and converted to renters, and that many displaced homeowners will prefer to live in single-family rentals with similar characteristics and amenities to their former houses."
There is a reason this person could not afford to pay their mortgage. They either lost their job, they owed more than their home was worth and walked away, or they lacked money management skills. In any case, they likely have a poor credit score. These individuals would likely not qualify to rent out an apartment, so they would likely not qualify as a suitable tenant, even though this is supposedly the target market.
2 - There is a reason these homes are vacant in the first place
The portfolio of homes is located in states with some of the highest unemployment. This is per the chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).


The BLS statistics do not take into account the real unemployment rate as well as the number of underemployed. Shadow Stats provides a better indicator of the unemployment rate, but unfortunately a breakdown by state was not available.

3 - Dilution of shares is coming
Per the 10-K, "Shares distributed or issued to Two Harbors (NYSE:TWO) stockholders or Prior Provident Investors are subject to a lock-up period expiring March 13, 2013. Following such expirations, these shares will be freely transferable without restriction."
The total number of shares that will become available from the two entities above as well as a few other entities will total 23.9 million. The current outstanding shares are 37.3 million. This will create a dilution of approximately 64% to the current shareholders.
4 - Decentralized business operations create internal control issues
Running a decentralized business model to service single- family properties will create various opportunities for fraud. For example, unneeded or overbilled repairs could be performed by the third party vendors. As discussed above, many management companies receive kickbacks from vendors to perform repair and maintenance work. This would go unnoticed by management of the company.
The management company may also own or have available single-family homes for lease from other clients that may offer payments to steer tenants to their units.

Overhead is also higher as the management company will expend more time and expenses in traveling to various units within a metropolitan area to service and repair the company's homes, mow the yards etc.
Per the 10-K, "We are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective."
The key is "costly and challenging." These are overhead costs that are not burdensome to a mom-and pop outfit. These costs will likely increase as this decentralized business model will require more controls to provide reasonable assurance of compliance.
5 - Crowded Market Limits Margins
Other firms like Blackstone have purchased a larger number of homes with the same idea as Silver Bay. In addition, small mom and pop investors will also have established tenants in their areas. This competition will pressure profit margins as rent increases will be minimized. The supply of rental properties will also increase as more potential tenants minimize costs by moving in together or renting out rooms.
6 - Paying with Cash Exposes Asset Portfolio to Inflation
Blackstone's strategy was to obtain loans to finance home purchases. With their economy of scale and credit rating, this loan was likely at a very low long-term interest rate. This was a smart strategy as inflationary pressures should push interest rates and consequently home prices and rents down, but would also make the loan cheaper to service from increased revenue from their other revenue streams that rise with inflation. Buying homes for cash provides no such hedge against future price and rent decreases.
7 - Rents Will Not be Able to Keep Up with Inflation

Leases that run one year or longer will be unable to keep up with the price increases that occur more frequently in other consumer goods. As tenants spend more on food and energy, they will find less money available for rent. They will likely move back in with family or friends.
8 - No exit strategy
When interest rates go up, the ability to sell homes will become very difficult. The supply of potential buyers will shrink, forcing real estate prices as well as rent down. This will result in the company either selling properties into the market at a significant loss or renting below the amount expected, lowering or eliminating profits.
Investment Strategy
Investors should stay away from the US property market in general and Silver Bay in particular. SBY is particularly toxic due to its naked exposure to single-family residential real estate.
However, there is always the possibility that the US economy will come roaring back through the continual printing of paper money and growth of debt at permanently low interest rates. In addition, maybe the government will buy back the portfolio from the company should this next housing bubble pop.

TORONTO, ONTARIO, Feb 27, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- Transformative Acquisition for Tricon American Homes  TORONTO, ONTARIO--(Marketwired - Feb. 27, 2017) -  NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION TO U.S. NEWSWIRE SERVICES OR FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES.  All dollar amounts are expressed in U.S. Dollars unless otherwise stated  Tricon Capital Group Inc. ("Tricon" or the "Company") (TCN), a principal investor and asset manager focused on the residential real estate industry, announced today that it has entered into an agreement to acquire Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. ("Silver Bay") 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    SBY

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         a leading owner and operator of single-family rental homes in the United States, by way of an all-cash transaction valued at $21.50 per share of Silver Bay (the "Acquisition"). The transaction has a total enterprise value of approximately $1.4 billion, comprised of the equity purchase price of approximately $820 million and approximately $600 million of Silver Bay debt (net of cash on hand) that will be refinanced in conjunction with the Acquisition. The members of the Board of Directors of Silver Bay have unanimously approved the transaction, and are agreeing to vote their shares and interests in favour of the Acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of Q2 2017. Highlights of the transaction include:   Transformational acquisition for Tricon that will create the fourth largest publicly-owned single-family rental ("SFR") company in the U.S., with a focus on the U.S. Sun Belt and the Middle Market(1)  Combination of two geographically complementary SFR portfolios is expected to unlock substantial operating benefits and efficiencies  Expected to be accretive to Tricon's earnings per share and net asset value per share, driven by the expected strong Funds From Operations profile, home price appreciation and cost synergies  Provides a catalyst for Tricon's strategy to simplify its business model by focusing on scale and industry leadership in select housing verticals   Tricon will host an investor conference call to discuss the Acquisition today at 4:30 p.m. ET  Gary Berman, Tricon's President and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "The proposed acquisition of Silver Bay is an incredibly exciting and transformational event for Tricon. This acquisition will more than double the size of Tricon American Homes, establishing it as the fourth largest publicly-owned SFR company in the U.S. Silver Bay's high-quality and well managed portfolio of SFR homes is a natural complement to our TAH assets, in particular given the geographic overlap in the Sun Belt. We believe that the transaction will result in significant operating and overhead synergies creating immediate value for our shareholders. In conjunction with the Acquisition, we also intend to exit our smaller non-core businesses and take a meaningful step toward simplifying our overall corporate business model by focusing on scale, industry leadership, enhanced disclosure and operational integration across our investment verticals."  Detailed Transaction Highlights:  Enhanced Scale in High Growth Target Markets: Following the Acquisition, the Company's Tricon American Homes ("TAH") vertical will rank as the fourth largest publicly-owned SFR owner/operator in the U.S. with over 16,800 homes. At closing, the combined company will operate in 18 markets, including six markets with at least 1,000 homes and ten markets with at least 500 homes, resulting in enhanced scale and market density that is expected to drive meaningful operating cost savings. The combined portfolio will have a strategic focus on the high growth U.S. Sun Belt, with approximately 84% of Silver Bay's homes located in TAH's existing markets. The combination will position TAH among SFR industry leaders with compelling operational metrics across key performance indicators.  Established Leader in the Middle Market Rental Segment: The transaction enhances TAH's position as the leading SFR operator focused on the Middle Market as both TAH and Silver Bay have focused their portfolios on this segment. The Middle Market consists of approximately 11 million rental households that, in the opinion of management, tend to be stable, longer-term renters. This trend is evident in TAH's and Silver Bay's combined portfolio turnover rate of 28.3% for the twelve month period ended December 31, 2016 as compared to turnover for sector peers of 35-40%. Management expects a lower turnover ratio to result in lower operating costs and therefore enhanced financial performance over time.   Opportunity for Meaningful Cost Rationalization: Transaction synergies are expected to be recognized through two primary channels: (i) property-level efficiencies arising from enhanced operating scale in each market, which management estimates will add approximately 200 bps to Silver Bay's net operating income margin of approximately 58% for the full year of 2016; and (ii) general and administrative expense synergies through the elimination of corporate-level redundancies, Silver Bay public reporting costs and back office overhead expenses, which management estimates to be approximately $10 million per annum in aggregate.   Simplifying Tricon's Business Model: The Acquisition provides an opportunity for Tricon to further simplify and streamline its business model. Management believes that it can maximize shareholder value by focusing its efforts on complementary residential real estate verticals where Tricon can gain meaningful scale and be an industry leader while generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders.  In this regard, Tricon will be pursuing an orderly exit of its Tricon Lifestyle Communities manufactured housing land lease business after completing its existing value-add business plan, as well as disposing of its U.S. multi-family development assets upon their stabilization. Management has made the decision to exit these verticals because of the current challenges it faces in building effective scale and the prospect of better return opportunities in its core businesses. Going forward, Tricon will remain focused on growing its core investment verticals of Tricon American Homes, Tricon Housing Partners and Tricon Luxury Residences - Canada, all of which are well positioned for long-term leadership in their respective industry sectors.   Transaction Terms  The transaction is structured as a merger of a subsidiary of TAH and Silver Bay. Upon completion of the merger, Silver Bay shareholders will receive $21.50 in cash per Silver Bay share for each outstanding share of common stock held immediately prior to the closing of the merger, which represents a 22.3% premium to Silver Bay's 20-day volume-weighted average trading price as of February 24, 2017.  The members of the Board of Directors of Silver Bay have unanimously approved the Acquisition and have entered into support agreements, agreeing to vote their shares in favour of the Acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of Q2 2017, subject to the approval of Silver Bay shareholders and the satisfaction or waiver of other customary closing conditions.   Transaction Funding  To partially finance the Acquisition, the Company intends to use the net proceeds from one or more "bought deal" public offerings, the details of which the Company expects to announce shortly.   In addition, the Company has obtained a commitment from Royal Bank of Canada to increase its existing corporate revolving credit facility, conditional on the completion of the Acquisition, from $235 million to $350 million and expects to draw approximately $70 million on the facility to finance a further portion of the Acquisition price. Tricon has also obtained a commitment from Royal Bank of Canada for bridge Acquisition financing in an amount equal to approximately $265 million.  The balance of the Acquisition purchase price and amounts required to refinance Sliver Bay's existing debt and pay transaction costs will be drawn on a new TAH warehouse credit facility. Tricon has obtained a commitment from Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates for the new facility in an aggregate amount of approximately $1.2 billion.   Transaction Advisors  RBC Capital Markets is acting as the sole financial advisor to Tricon. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP, Goodmans LLP and Goulston & Storrs PC are acting as legal advisors to Tricon in connection with the Acquisition and proposed financing.  Conference Call  Management will host a conference call to discuss the transaction at 4:30 p.m. ET today. Please call 647-427-2311 or 1-866-521-4909 (conference ID #75934253).
