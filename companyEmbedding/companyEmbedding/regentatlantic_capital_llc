The very first choice to make?
A financial advisor who can turn your dreams into plans.
Our clients come first — period.
From what’s on your bucket list to what keeps you up at night, you need a financial advisor who truly understands you. We strive to make sure we do. Only then do we develop strategies to help you achieve your goals. And if life or the markets intervene, we’re there to guide you.
› Planning
› Specialty areas
We value our independence — so will you.
As your financial advisor, we’re not paid commissions for generating trades or recommending specific investment products. Because we’re independent — and committed to staying that way — our advice is unbiased and unconstrained by corporate mandates.
› Investing
Technology helps us enhance your experience.
It’s why we went paperless back in 1997. And why we use the cloud and iPads today to work more collaboratively with clients. We even create solutions if none exist, like our powerful portfolio rebalancing engine.
› Working with us
Our choice: Passion, integrity and trust
We’re passionate about enriching the lives of our clients. Our secret? Extraordinary employees and service. Leadership and innovation. And integrity and mutual trust. Plus a community-like culture where clients always feel welcome. It’s not just a better way of doing business. It’s the only way.
Giving back puts our communities ahead
From Habit for Humanity to holiday shopping for veterans, giving back is part of our culture. For more than 15 years, it’s been our privilege to help many of the local organizations that help our communities.

Planning 





Bringing all the pieces of your financial life together.
Everyone has a different view of their financial future. Some simply want peace of mind that they won’t outlive their money. Others want to pursue true dream goals — without sacrificing long-term security or legacy plans. At RegentAtlantic, we adhere to an in-depth process to understand your goals and the complex pieces of your financial life. Then we incorporate that knowledge into a customized financial plan.
A multi-faceted financial planning model.
Our model combines retirement planning, estate planning, investment management and tax considerations. Integrating all these elements, we evaluate your priorities, calculate different levels of spending and saving, and identify specific risk factors as well as strategies to help mitigate them. We show you your options and the trade-offs for each scenario.
You’ve got a lot on your mind. We can help.
Think about all those nagging questions: How can I reduce my estate tax bill? When should I exercise my stock options? How can I maximize Social Security benefits? Can I help my children in an equitable way? With RegentAtlantic, you’ll have the planning expertise you need to address your complete financial situation.

Planning Q&A“When can I retire? Can I even afford to retire?”Retirement is one of the biggest questions out there, and no wonder: many people had their assumptions shaken by the financial crisis. We’ll ask about your personal vision of retirement, then consider your complete financial picture and create a plan to help you reach your goal.
“My finances are so complicated. Can you make it less overwhelming?”Yes. We’ll do the heavy lifting for you, relieving you of the complexity and paperwork. Our team includes experts in both financial planning and investment management, so you’ll get a broad strategy that covers the key planning and investment management bases. We also ask pointed questions, and create projections to account for a wide range of potential outcomes, enabling you to see how everything fits together and the options you have.
“I’ve always handled our finances. What if something happens to me?”It’s crucial to protect your loved ones with a plan to manage financial matters after you’re gone. We understand that it’s not the easiest thing to talk about, and we know it’s important to work with someone you trust – so we make it our mission to earn your trust.
“I’d like my money to go to the people I love. How can RegentAtlantic help?”Planning your estate and creating structures that benefit your loved ones is a key component of a financial plan. We’ll work closely with your estate planning professionals and present plan options that balance often competing priorities. We also monitor the evolving trusts and estates environment for opportunities to help reduce the impact of taxes for both immediate and long-term wealth transfer.
“My retirement could last 30 years. Shouldn’t I be saving as much as possible?”Not necessarily. Retirement planning is about choices and balance. You want to enjoy your retirement, but not at the sacrifice of your life today. A sound financial plan can help you evaluate your choices and make a well informed decision about how much to save today for tomorrow.
