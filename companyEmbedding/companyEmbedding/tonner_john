It's a daunting task to stay on top of everything your body needs to stay healthy. Your face needs makeup, hair needs accessories, and the body welcomes a massage. Take time to examine an area of your health and beauty regime that needs improvement. Maybe you've been meaning to take vitamins and dietary supplements or want a new fragrance to lift your spirits. Now is the time to make it happen.
Access Where You Are
 The jar of night cream is probably over a year old and needs a facelift. Your skin care program consists of rubbing soap into your skin, rinsing off with water, patting dry, and turning off the light. Your skin doesn't get any kind of sun protection and is beginning to have that dreaded alligator look. You're beginning to see that health and beauty takes a dive when it comes to oral care practices. Other than a six-month checkup, there's not much going on.
Skin Care Choices
Cleansers and toners remove deep-down dirt and grime and help prevent acne-prone skin from erupting. Use skin masks and peels to hydrate skin, remove excess oil, and reduce pore size. A moisturizer improves the texture of facial skin helping to soften fine lines and wrinkles. Every so often, use an exfoliator to remove dead skin cells so your skin has a healthy look. Remember to use suntan lotion especially on your face, throat, and neck. Anyone that works outside should cover any sun-exposed area.
Oral Health Care
Dental floss literally saves your teeth and gums from decay. It helps prevent cavities between your teeth and gum disease called gingivitis. Tongue cleaners remove accumulated bacteria that may contribute to tooth decay and bad breath. Electric toothbrushes provide a more thorough cleaning than using a hand-held brush because the bristles reach further between the teeth. This helps to remove more plaque and tartar build up. To improve your appearance, use a teeth whitening product that removes stains and whitens teeth for a brighter smile. Mouthwash helps keep your teeth cleaner when used with other oral health care products.Side Refine PanelShop by CategoryBath & Body ProductsSee all in Bath & Body ProductsBath & Body Bar SoapsBath &

American Salon,...What Effects Does Heat Have on Hair?
Heat from blow dryers, curling irons,straighteners, and curlers can leave hair dry and dull. This is due to the temporary breakdown of hydrogen bonds present in each strand. When you repeat these actions on a daily basis, more permanent damage takes place. To limit the consequences, only apply heat to hair when absolutely necessary.
Is Hair Color Safe?
Coloring hair is not the best practice to encourage the growth of healthy hair, but it is not quite as damaging as bleaching or perming hair. When applying color, the dye needs ammonia and peroxide in order to work and take hold. Both of these chemicals cause damage to hair follicles and the chemical makeup of natural hair. While allergic reactions to the dye are rare, they do happen, so it is wise to test hair dye on a patch of skin prior to applying it all over the scalp area.
What Products Are Most Harmful for Hair?
Both styling and products can have negative effects on hair, which is a protein fiber much like wool. By using heated tools to style and applying harsh products, you can alter the natural composition of your hair and cause gradual damage over time. Some common beauty practices are worse than others, including bleaching, perms,coloring, and blow drying. Even shampooing with the wrong product can cause damage. Try to stay away from ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate,sodium chloride, polyethelyne, parabens, and alcohol, which are potentially harmful ingredients present in some styling products.You May Also LikeShowing slide {CURRENT_SLIDE} of {TOTAL_SLIDES} - You May Also LikeGo to previous slide - You May Also LikeMakeup & ProductsSkin Care ProductsVitamins & Dietary SupplementsHealth Care ProductsFragrancesGo to next slide - You May Also LikeTell us what you think - opens in new window or tabSide Refine PanelShop by CategoryHealth & BeautyHair Care & Styling ProductsHair Brushes & CombsHair Color ProductsHair DryersHair Extensions & WigsHair Loss TreatmentsHair Ties & Styling AccessoriesMedicated Hair TreatmentsHair PermsHair Relaxers & Straightening ProductsHair Rollers & CurlersShampoos & ConditionersShower CapsStraightening & Curling IronsHair Styling ProductsHair Treatments, Oils & Heat ProtectorsHair Care & Styling Sets & KitsOther Hair Care & Styling ProductsGendersee allWomenMenUnisexNot SpecifiedBrandsee allCHIConairL'OréalMoroccanoilUnbrandedHair Typesee allAll Hair TypesColor Treated HairCurly HairDamaged HairDry HairFine HairAge Groupsee allConditionsee allNewUsedNot SpecifiedPricePlease provide a valid price range$-$Buying Formatsee allAll ListingsAuctionBuy It NowItem Locationsee allDefaultWithindistance2 miles5 miles10 miles15 miles20 miles50 miles75 miles100 miles150 miles200 miles500 miles750 miles1000 miles1500 miles2000 milesofGoUS OnlyNorth AmericaWorldwideDelivery Optionssee allFree ShippingFree In-store PickupShow onlysee allReturns AcceptedCompleted ItemsSold ItemsDeals & SavingsMore refinements...
