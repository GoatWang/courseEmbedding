NOTES TO SCHEDULES OF PORTFOLIO INVESTMENTS                                     
Steward Funds, Inc.                                                             
July 31, 2007

1) PORTFOLIO VALUATION:                                                         
Fund investments are recorded at market value. Portfolio securities listed on a 
domestic or foreign exchange are valued at the last sale price on the day of    
valuation or, if there was no sale that day, at the last reported mean price as 
of the close of trading. Equity securities traded on NASDAQ use the official    
closing price. Equity securities which are traded in the over-the-counter market
only, but which are not included on NASDAQ, are valued at the last sale price on
the day of valuation. Debt securities with a remaining maturity of sixty days or
more are valued using a pricing service when such prices are believed to reflect
fair market value. Debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than sixty 
days are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. All other   
securities and securities with no readily determinable market values are valued 
using procedures determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.            

2) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:                               
For financial reporting purposes, portfolio security transactions are recorded  
on trade date. Net realized gains or losses on sales of securities are          
determined by the identified cost method. Interest income, adjusted for         
accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, is recorded on the accrual 
basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date, except that certain 
dividends from foreign securities are recorded as soon as the Funds are informed
of the ex-dividend date, if the ex-dividend date has passed.                    

3) FUTURES:                                                                     
When a Fund enters into a futures contract, it makes an initial margin deposit  
in a segregated account, in either cash or liquid securities. Thereafter, the   
futures contract is marked to market, and the Fund makes (or receives)          
additional cash payments known as variation margin to (or from) the broker.     
Changes in the value of the contract are recorded as unrealized appreciation    
(depreciation) until the contract is closed or settled, at which time a realized
gain or loss is recorded.                                                       

*For additional information regarding the Fund's valuation of investments and   
other significant accounting policies, please refer to the most recent annual or
semi-annual report.

Dear Shareholder:                                                               

October 1, 2005 marked the one year anniversary of the Steward Domestic All-Cap 
Equity and Steward Select Bond Fund. The Funds have grown over the past year    
to nearly $200 million in assets. This growth would not have been possible      
without the many referrals that we have received. We would like to thank you    
for selecting the Steward Funds.                                                

The Steward Funds are happy to announce the expansion of Fund offerings that    
will be available in 2006. Additional values-based investment options will      
include international equities, a multi-manager fund, a short-term bond fund    
and a small cap fund.                                                           

Steward is proud to offer investors funds that are screened to eliminate        
investment in pornography and abortion and companies that are substantial       
producers of alcohol, gambling and tobacco. The Funds' independent screening    
resource firm, Steward Fund Consulting, has been in the values-based investing  
business for many years and brings a wealth of knowledge of screening for       
Christian based investors.                                                      

Your business is important to us. We look forward to servicing your investment  
needs for many years to come.                                                   

Sincerely,

STEWARD FUNDS CULTURAL SCREENING                                                
Scott Fehrenbacher                                                              

                                                  Period ending October 31, 2005

Dear Steward Mutual Fund Shareholder;                                           

The Steward Funds seeks to prevent ownership in companies that choose to be in  
the business of, or are predominantly known for, the manufacture of             
pornography; abortion products and/or services; alcoholic beverages; tobacco    
products; and the increasingly popular business of gambling. As such, the Funds 
have engaged Steward Fund Consulting (SFC) to actively research the products    
and policies of public companies to protect the Fund's shareholders from        
unwittingly owning them through the Steward Fund Group.                         

In the course of SFC's research operations, SFC focuses entirely on identifying 
companies that the Funds may not invest in; a so-called "avoidance screening"   
methodology. The Funds do not engage in the practices of choosing companies to  
invest in for the purposes of promoting any kind of social policy. This         
practice, known as "positive screening" is often done in order to make a        
statement. The Fund believes that its role is one of upholding the beliefs of   
the Funds' shareholders while maximizing shareholder return and value, and not  
to set social policy.                                                           

Throughout the past year we have witnessed an increasing number of public       
companies involved in the businesses of gambling and alcohol. We have also      
witnessed a small, but concerning pattern of an increasing number of public     
companies deciding to participate in the destructive business of pornography.   
SFC will remain diligent in the coming months to protect your interests from    
these companies.                                                                

We thank you for your investment.                                               

Sincerely,

STEWARD DOMESTIC ALL - CAP EQUITY                                               
John Wolf, Portfolio Manager                                                    

                                                  Period ending October 31, 2005
EQUITY MARKET OVERVIEW                                                          

The equity market posted positive performance for the six months ended October
31, 2005. The volatility in energy prices increased during the period as        
Hurricane Katrina wreaked havoc on the Gulf Coast and damaged the oil           
infrastructure in the area. This was followed by Hurricane Rita which also      
impacted the gulf region with a second wave of destruction and delayed          
restoration efforts that were underway. The U.S. economy has remained resilient 
despite oil prices exceeding $60 a barrel. Corporate earnings as measured by    
the S&P 500, is expected to post a substantial 16.2% gain for the third quarter 
of 2005. Payrolls have remained strong despite the loss of jobs from the        
Hurricane affected regions with unemployment at a modest 5.0%.                  

While inflation has been benign, the recent spikes in energy prices will        
eventually filter through and create some pricing pressure in the near term.    
The Federal Reserve has now increased rates as measured by Fed Funds to 4.00%   
continuing their goal of achieving a neutral interest rate environment. The     
third quarter GDP report was stronger than expected at 3.8% indicating the      
economy is still growing at a healthy rate.                                     

PERFORMANCE                                                                     

The Steward All-Cap Equity Fund returned 8.19% for the six months ended October
31, 2005, outperforming its benchmark, the S&P Composite 1500 Index, which      
gained 6.05% for the same period. The individual S&P index component returns    
were: 5.27% for the S&P 500, 11.33% for the S&P MidCap 400 and 12.38% for the   
S&P SmallCap 600. The Fund's overweighting in the S&P MidCap 400 and SmallCap   
600 relative to the S&P Composite 1500 contributed to the higher performance.   

Performance is also affected by the values-based investment policies of the     
Fund which avoids investing in companies whose primary business is associated   
with alcohol, tobacco products, abortion, gambling and pornography. For the six 
month period ending October 31, 2005, the overall affect of the restricted      
securities on the Fund were minimal. The two largest capitalization restricted  
securities, Pfizer Inc. and Altria Group, Inc. illustrate the point as their    
returns for the period offset -18.86% vs. +18.03%.                              

OUTLOOK                                                                         

The resilience of the U.S. economy from the hurricane destruction and the       
subsequent spike in energy prices bodes well looking forward. Reconstruction    
activity from Hurricane Katrina should provide additional GDP growth over the   
coming year. The Federal Reserve appears to be well positioned to combat        
inflation should pricing pressure begin to increase. Energy is still a          
variable however as high prices reduce discretionary consumer spending and      
places a drag on economic growth. As production in the Gulf region comes back   
on line, we should see prices stabilize and trend lower from current levels.    
Corporate earnings are estimated to maintain double digit growth through the    
first quarter of 2006 and then slowing just slightly thereafter. Overall the    
economy appears to be on solid moderate growth for the near future. With rising 
corporate earnings anticipated, equity prices should trend upward to reflect    
the higher valuations.                                                          

PAST PERFORMANCE DOES NOT GUARANTEE FUTURE RESULTS. THE PERFORMANCE DATA QUOTED

STEWARD SELECT BOND FUND                                                        
Howard Potter, Portfolio Manager                                                

                                                  Period ending October 31, 2005
FIXED INCOME MARKET OVERVIEW                                                    

The Federal Reserve Bank Board policymakers continued to raise their short-term 
interest rate target in steady increments over the past six months. As a        
result, the Federal funds rate has increased from 2.75% to 4.00% on November    
1st. Other short-term interest rates rose in tandem during this period, but not 
as dramatically. The surprising effect of Federal Reserve policy is that it has 
had a diminished influence over the yield curve as the ten-year and thirty-year 
rates have remained practically unchanged. Since there was little, if any,      
price change to these securities since April 2005, total returns were resigned  
to the interest accruals and coupon re-investments in intermediate and longer   
dated issues and little, if any, additional total returns from the remainder of 
shorter-term securities.                                                        

The flattening of the yield curve, a condition where all U.S. Treasury          
maturities adjust to similar market yields, is a difficult market environment   
for fixed income investors to execute traditional value-adding strategies       
because the normally present incentive to invest for longer periods has         
dissipated. Driving the narrowing of yield relationships is a fundamental       
quandary for economic policymakers. In the current environment, market          
participants are torn, as is the Federal Reserve Board, as to how many more     
rate increases will be deemed necessary to successfully control price           
inflation, possibly further flattening the yield curve; or, if interest rates   
have already been pushed to the point where economic activity has been thwarted 
and rates will stabilize, possibly even be reduced in the near future.          

PERFORMANCE                                                                     

The Steward Select Bond Fund produced a -0.06% return during the six-month      
period ended October 31, 2005. The Fund's performance is in line with the       
Morningstar category average for funds with similar characteristics and sector  
allocation which produced 0.00% for the Morningstar category for the same       
period. The Fund's market benchmark, the Lehman Aggregate, earned a 0.15% over  
the same period. The reason for the similarity in return between the fund and   
its benchmark lies in the structure of the portfolio. The portfolio             
characteristics during the period were similar to that of the benchmark.        

OUTLOOK                                                                         

We believe that the key to providing long-term high current income with capital 
appreciation in fixed income portfolios in rising rate environments is to       
control interest market price risk and simultaneously maximize internal cash    
flows that can be compounded, in turn, at higher yields. To this end, the       
Fund's managers have sold traditional semi-annual coupon-paying bonds and       
invested in two alternative types of securities. Market yields have been        
increased, without additional maturity extension, through the purchase of       
callable and step-up securities that will increase their coupons if rates       
continue to rise. In addition, the Fund has purchased floating rate securities  
that change stated interest rates and pay monthly based on current rates of     
price inflation. As long as the Federal Reserve Board remains committed to      
raising interest rates, we will continue to search for these types of defensive 
investments. When the Federal Reserve Board signals that their policy will      
change, we will cease this strategy and become more aggressive toward future    
investments in terms of duration and yield curve selections.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - OCTOBER 31, 2005 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION:                                                          

The Steward Funds, Inc. (the "Company") was organized as a Maryland     
corporation on May 11, 1992 and is registered under the Investment Company Act  
of 1940 (the "1940 Act") as a diversified open-end management investment        
company. The Company currently consists of two diversified series: the Domestic 
All-Cap Equity Fund and the Select Bond Fund (individually, a "Fund," and       
collectively, the "Funds").                                                     

    The Company is authorized to issue 200,000,000 shares of beneficial interest
of $0.001 par value. The Funds currently offer two Classes of shares            
("Individual Class" and "Institutional Class"). Each Class of shares has equal  
rights as to earnings, assets and voting privileges, except that each Class     
bears different distribution expenses. Each Class of shares has exclusive voting
rights with respect to matters that affect just that Class. Income, expenses    
(other than expenses attributable to a specific Class) and realized and         
unrealized gains or losses on investments are allocated to each Class of shares 
based on its relative net assets.                                               

NOTE 2 - INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES:                                                 

The Steward Domestic All-Cap Equity Fund seeks long-term capital        
appreciation. The Fund invests primarily in common stocks of large, medium and  
small capitalization companies that represent a broad spectrum of the economy.  

The Steward Select Bond Fund seeks high current income with capital     
appreciation and growth of income. The Fund invests primarily in fixed income   
investments such as corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and government  
and agency bonds and notes.                                                     

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:                                       

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting   
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires          
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at   
the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and     
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those    
estimates. The following is a summary of the significant accounting policies    
consistently followed by the Funds in the preparation of its financial          
statements. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.                                       

A) PORTFOLIO VALUATION: Fund investments are recorded at market value. Portfolio
securities listed on a domestic or foreign exchange are valued at the last sale 
price on the day of valuation or, if there was no sale that day, at the mean    
between the last reported bid and asked price as of the close of trading. Equity
securities traded on NASDAQ use the NASDAQ Official Closing Price. Equity       
securities which are traded in the over-the-counter market only, which are      
included on NASDAQ, are valued at the last sale price on the day of valuation.  
Debt securities with a remaining maturity of sixty days or more are valued using
a pricing service when such prices are believed to reflect fair market value.   
Debt securities with a remaining maturity of less than sixty days are valued at 
amortized cost, which approximates market value. All other securities and       
securities with no readily determinable market values are valued using          
procedures determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.                  

B) SECURITIES TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME: Changes in holdings of        
portfolio securities shall be reflected no later than in the calculation of each
Fund's net asset value on the first business day following the trade date.      
However, for financial reporting purposes, portfolio security transactions are  
reported on trade date. Net realized gains or losses on sales of securities are 
determined by the identified cost method. Interest income, adjusted for         
accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums, is recorded on the accrual 
basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.                     

C) DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Dividends from net investment   
income of each Fund is declared and paid at least annually. For each Fund, all  
net realized long-term or short-term capital gains, if any, will be declared and
distributed at least annually. Interest and dividend payments will normally be  
distributed as income dividends on a quarterly basis for each of the Funds.     

Income dividends and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance    
with income tax regulations, which may differ from accounting principles        
generally accepted in the United States of America. These differences are       
primarily due to differing                                                      

P-->N-CSRS40th Page of 53TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 40th
treatments of income, gains and losses on various investment securities held by 
a Fund, timing differences in the recognition of income, gains and losses and   
differing characterizations of distributions made by the Fund.                  

D) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: It is each Fund's intention to qualify annually as a   
regulated investment company by complying with the appropriate provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Accordingly, no provision for federal
income tax has been made.                                                       

E) ALLOCATION OF EXPENSES: Expenses directly attributable to a Fund are charged 
directly to that Fund, while expenses which are attributable to more than one   
Fund of the Trust are allocated among the respective Funds based upon relative  
net assets or some other reasonable method.                                     

NOTE 4 - INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER AGREEMENTS:

CAMCO, on a monthly basis, an investment advisory fee.                          

   The advisory fees for the Domestic All-Cap Equity Fund are calculated daily
at the annual rate of 0.15% on the first $500 million of the Fund's average     
daily net assets. The rate declines to 0.125% on the next $500 million of       
average daily net assets, and to 0.10% on average daily net assets in excess of 
$1 billion. For the Select Bond Fund the advisory fees are calculated daily at

subsidiaries of Capstone Financial Services, Inc.                               

 Each Fund's Individual Share Class has adopted a Service and Distribution
Plan (the "Plan") pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act whereby each Individual  
Share Class' assets are used to compensate CAPCO for costs and expenses incurred
with the distribution and marketing of each Individual Class' shares and        
servicing each Individual Class' Shareholders. Distribution and marketing       
expenses include among other things printing of prospectuses, advertising       
literature and costs of personnel involved with the promotion and distribution  
of each Individual Class' Shares. Under the Plans, each Individual Class'       
average net assets includes reinvested dividends paid with respect to those     
assets. Of this amount, CAPCO may allocate to securities dealers (which may     
include CAPCO itself) and other financial institutions and organizations        
(collectively "Service Organizations") amounts based on each Individual Class'  
average net assets owned by shareholders for whom the Service Organizations have
a servicing relationship.                                                       

   Certain officers of the Company are also officers of the Investment Adviser
and the Distributor.                                                            

  Pursuant to the term of the Administrative Agreement, CAMCO will supervise
the Funds' daily business affairs, coordinate the activities of persons         
providing services to the Funds, and furnish office space and equipment to the  
Funds. As compensation for its services CAMCO receives a monthly fee from each  
Fund calculated at the annual rate of 0.075% on each Fund's first $500 million  
average daily net assets and 0.06% on average daily net assets in excess of $500
million.                                                                        

    BISYS Fund Services Ohio, Inc. ("BISYS Ohio"), serves as the Funds' transfer
agency and fund accountant. Under the terms of the Transfer Agency and Fund     
Accounting Agreement, BISYS Ohio is entitled to receive a monthly fee from each 
Fund calculated at the annual rate of 0.075% of each Fund's average daily net   
assets.

NOTE 8 - CONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS                                          

In the normal course of business, the Funds enter into contracts that   
contain various representations and warranties and provide general              
indemnifications. The Funds' maximum exposure under these arrangements is       
dependent on future claims against the Funds and is presently unknown. However, 
based on experience, the Funds consider the risk of loss from such potential    
claims to be remote.

THE ANNUAL CONSIDERATION BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISORY   
AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE FUNDS AND CAPSTONE ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY AND FRANK    
RUSSELL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    At its meeting held March 1, 2005, the Board of Directors ("Board"), and the
independent directors voting separately, unanimously approved (a) the           
continuation of the investment advisory agreement between Capstone Asset        
Management Company ("CAMCO") and Steward Funds, Inc. with respect to Steward    
Domestic All-Cap Equity Fund and Steward Select Bond Fund;(b) the investment    
advisory contract between Steward Funds, Inc. and Frank Russell Investment      
Management Company ("FRIMCo") with respect to Steward Multi-Manager Equity Fund 
("MME Fund")1; and (c) portfolio management contracts for MME Fund between      
FRIMCo and each of Alliance Capital Management, L.P.; Ark Asset Management Co., 
Inc.; Jacobs Levy Equity Management, Inc.; Lord, Abbett & Company; and MFS      
Investment Management, Inc. ("Money Managers"). In response to requests from    
counsel, CAMCO and FRIMCo had provided to the directors, in advance of the      
meeting, information deemed reasonably necessary to assist the directors in     
their review of the agreements with CAMCO and FRIMCo, and the portfolio         
management contracts with the Money Managers. The directors had also reviewed a 
memorandum from counsel discussing their responsibilities in reviewing          
investment advisory agreements.                                                 

 In considering the continuation of the investment advisory agreement with
CAMCO, the directors noted that Steward Domestic All-Cap Equity Fund and Steward
Select Bond Fund had been in operation only since October 1, 2004. They noted,  
based on the information provided to them and their experience with these Funds 
since their inception October 1, 2004, that the operation and growth of each    
Fund had been as expected and that CAMCO's services to each Fund were fully     
satisfactory. They determined that investment advisory and administration fee   
rates for the Funds were low relative to fees for similar services paid by funds
deemed to be comparable ("Peer Funds"). They noted that each Fund's expense     
ratio was low relative to that of the Peer Funds. They also noted that the      
investment advisory fee rate for each Fund, as well as fees paid to CAMCO for   
administrative services, would decline as each Fund reached higher asset levels 
and that these declines should provide each Fund with the benefit of potential  
economies of scale at higher asset levels. They reviewed CAMCO's soft dollar    
arrangements and other sources of compensation to CAMCO and its affiliates,     
including payments under the Funds' Service and Distribution Plans, which were  
in line with plans of Peer Funds. They also reviewed CAMCO's financial          
statements. Based on their review, the directors concluded that the information 
they had reviewed suggested that, in the short period of the Funds' operations, 
CAMCO's profitability with respect to each Fund was reasonable, although they   
would continue to monitor this issue as the Funds matured. They also concluded  
that the fees paid by each Fund to CAMCO for investment advisory services       
continued to be fair and reasonable and in the best interests of shareholders of
each Fund.                                                                      

  Information relevant to the Board's deliberations regarding the agreements
with FRIMCo and the Money Managers was presented to the Board in advance of, and
discussed with counsel at, its meetings held May 19, 2004 and November 16, 2004,
as well as at the March 1, 2005 meeting. In considering the proposed investment 
advisory agreement with FRIMCo and the proposed portfolio management agreements 
with each of the Money Managers, the Board was cognizant of FRIMCo's mode of    
operation as a manager-of-managers, acting pursuant to exemptive relief from the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board had also approved MME Fund's      
participation in the filing of a revised exemptive application that would make  
this relief available for MME Fund. The relief, when obtained, would permit     
FRIMCo to retain and replace money managers that are unaffiliated with FRIMCo,  
and to make changes to portfolio management contracts with such money managers, 
with Board approval, but without approval of shareholders.                      

(1) MME Fund has not commenced operations as of the date of the report.

EXPENSE EXAMPLES (UNAUDITED)                                                    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  As a shareholder of the Steward Funds, Inc., you may incur redemption fees
for certain transactions and fees if your account is small. You will also incur 
ongoing costs, including management fees; distribution [and/or service] 12b-1   
fees; and other Fund expenses. The following examples are intended to help you  
understand your ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Steward Funds,   
Inc. and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other    
mutual funds.                                                                   

    The Example is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of
the period and held for the entire period from May 1, 2005 through October 31,
2005.                                                                           

ACTUAL EXPENSES                                                                 

   The table below provides information about actual account values and actual
expenses. You may use the information below, together with the amount you       
invested, to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period. Simply divide 
your account value by $1,000 (for example, an $8,600 account value divided by   
$1,000 = 8.6), then multiply the result by the number in the table under the    
heading entitled "Expenses Paid During Period" to estimate the expenses you paid
on your account during this period.

HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE FOR COMPARISON PURPOSES                                    

  The table below provides information about hypothetical account values and
hypothetical expenses based on each Steward Funds, Inc.' actual expense ratio   
and an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses, which is not the  
Fund's actual return. The hypothetical account values and expenses may not be   
used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the 
period. You may use this information to compare this 5% hypothetical example    
with the 5% hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of     
other funds.                                                                    

    Please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your
ongoing costs only. The expenses do not include any redemption or small account 
fees which the Funds may, in certain circumstances, assess. The Funds do not    
charge transactional costs, such as sales charges (front or back end loads) or  
exchange fees, although other funds might. Therefore, this table is useful only 
in comparing ongoing costs and will not help you determine the relative total   
costs of owning different funds.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

  Steward Funds


 


A Leader in Values-Based Investing


Stewardship (noun): the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one’s care.


The Steward Family of Funds are values-based, screened funds consistent with widely held traditional values. The Funds invest in a broad range of investment options including enhanced index and quantitative index funds. Through disciplined asset allocation, the Steward Funds seek to provide long-term investment results that would reflect the returns of well-recognized indexes.
The Steward Funds are managed exclusively by Capstone Asset Management Company based in Houston, Texas.

Founded in 1987, Capstone manages $4.9 billion in equity, bond and balanced accounts with clients nationwide.
Capstone portfolio managers have provided faith-based screened investment portfolios for institutional investors since 1996.
Capstone provides a disciplined investment process that has been in place since its inception.
Capstone has extensive experience in enhanced and quantitative index methodology with a focus on controlling risk.



 


Values-Based Investing


The Funds apply a comprehensive set of screens during the portfolio management process that allows investors to avoid owning securities in companies that choose to profit from businesses that are at odds with values-based investing.

The funds apply strict exclusionary screens to companies involved in the businesses of abortion and pornography.
The Consulting Team screens businesses that are principally involved in gambling, as well as alcohol and tobacco products.
We use only avoidance screens and do not dilute the portfolio by seeking to invest in companies that promote any individual cultural or social issue.
This methodology gives the Funds the ability to serve the rapidly growing number of investors seeking competitive investment returns without compromising their personal convictions.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
You know that TRADING is different than investing. But the opportunity to take advantage of short-term trends is only won, if you get the direction right.
Whether you’re a bull or a bear, Direxion is with you. Our leveraged ETFs are powerful tools built to help you:

Magnify your short-term perspective with daily 3X leverage
Go where there’s opportunity, with bull and bear funds for both sides of the trade; and
Stay agile – with liquidity to trade through rapidly changing markets

Leveraged and inverse ETFs pursue daily leveraged investment objectives which means they are riskier than alternatives which do not use leverage. They seek daily goals and should not be expected to track the underlying index over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand leverage risk and who actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The MSCI India Index (NDEUSIA) is designed to measure the performance of the large- and mid-capitalization segments of the Indian market, covering approximately 85% of companies in the Indian equity securities market.  One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
