Sprott Flow-Through Limited Partnerships

What are Flow-Through shares?
The Federal Government allows Canadian resource companies that invest in the oil and gas, mining and renewable energy sectors to fully deduct certain exploration expenses, known as Canadian Exploration Expenses (CEE). To raise capital for exploration, those companies often issue flow-through shares and pass along the rights to claim the CEE to the purchasers of those shares. The shareholders are then able to deduct the CEE against their own income.
What is a Flow-Through Limited Partnership? 
Flow-through limited partnerships are professionally managed diversified portfolios of flow-through shares. The amounts invested in CEE are generally 100% deductible against taxable income in the year the investment is made.
The illustration below shows how flow-through limited partnerships work:
Tax benefits of flow-through limited partnerships 
Tax Savings The cost of flow-through limited partnerships is 100% tax-deductible in the year the investment is made. In addition, the proceeds from the disposition of the partnership are treated as capital gains and taxable only at a rate 50% of regular income.  
Tax Efficiency Investing in flow-through shares effectively converts income into capital gains, allowing investors to take advantage of any capital loss carry-forwards
