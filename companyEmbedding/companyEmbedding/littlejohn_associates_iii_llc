Investment Strategies



Private EquitySpotlightPortfolioSpecial SituationsPerforming Credit




Littlejohn’s investment platform is focused on our integrated core strategies—private equity and credit. Each strategy employs the same disciplined investment philosophy, and we seek to capitalize on the related synergies. This approach is particularly powerful in the middle market.

Private Equity
investments that Littlejohn targets range from solid performing
middle market companies, to complicated corporate carve-outs, to
businesses facing operating difficulties, inadequate capital
resources or an inability to drive growth.  Littlejohn focuses
on a limited number of situations and looks to develop a strong
partnership with management to drive a step-change in growth,
performance, and enterprise value.
Special Situations
that the Fund will consider include leveraged loans, second lien
debt, mezzanine debt, high yield bonds, equities, and related
securities, and obligations of leveraged or financially distressed
companies and/or other special situations. A key element of the
Firm's investment strategy with respect to Distressed Investments
is to become active in the restructuring process in order to drive
increases in enterprise value for all company stakeholders.
Performing
Credit  investments are generally investments
in secured term loan obligations of non-investment grade corporate
borrowers.  These investments are in loans to borrowers not
experiencing financial distress that are rated and sourced by
Littlejohn in the broadly syndicated loan market. 
Investments focus on generating income while avoiding credit
losses.

        Littlejohn & Co. | Our Story
    























Our StoryInvestment Strategies








Our Story



Building ValueLeadership




Littlejohn utilizes its unique culture and capabilities to make transformative equity and debt investments in a broad range of middle market companies. We complement this effort through our investments in the performing credit of large corporate borrowers.

The Firm is a private equity and
special situations investor focused on investing in companies
through all economic cycles.  The Firm has a long track record
of successfully investing in the middle market where it can help
management teams to drive meaningful improvements in strategy,
growth, and operations.
Littlejohn has always invested
exclusively in middle market companies, which it defines as
businesses, with revenues typically between $100M and $800M. 
The companies we invest in are all facing the opportunities and
challenges of significant change, and we partner with management to
transform these businesses.  Our approach includes:

Expand All | Collapse All

Transforming good companies into great companies












Littlejohn has extensive experience
in partnering with management teams who are leading companies with
solid performance at the time of the transaction. We work with
management to drive a step-change in sustainable growth and
operating performance through both organic initiatives and
strategic acquisitions.








Carving out divisions of large corporations












Littlejohn has acquired many
operating divisions from some of the world's most well-known
multinational corporations.  We have deep experience in
managing an efficient and confidential acquisition process,
negotiating and performing appropriate transition arrangements, and
executing the carve-out to minimize disruption for the parent while
maximizing the potential of the newly independent
business. 








Operational and financial restructurings












Littlejohn has a unique perspective
on companies dealing with financial and operational distress. 
We have deep experience dealing with the complicated and often
contentious, multi-party financial restructuring process.
 Given our experience in building long term value at our
companies, however, we focus beyond short-sighted recovery actions
in order to rebuild corporate momentum and maximize enterprise
value for the benefit of all stakeholders.








Rescue financings












Littlejohn's primary goal in
structured capital transactions is to deliver a solution that
provides business owners and management with the liquidity, time,
and capital for success.  In these situations, however,
Littlejohn looks to bring more to the table than capital.  Our
culture and experience in working closely with management teams to
drive long-term commercial and operational success differentiates
us from many players in structured capital investments.








Distressed securities investing












Littlejohn takes positions in the
securities of stressed and distressed middle market
companies.  We do this with an eye toward taking a leadership
role in working with management and all other stakeholders to craft
a financial solution that provides adequate "runway" for long term
strategic recovery and growth.








Performing credit investing












Littlejohn makes investments in performing debt instruments,
principally syndicated leveraged loans of corporate
borrowers.  Through active portfolio management, we seek to
generate attractive risk adjusted returns through a combination of
current income, capital appreciation and preservation of
principal.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.

5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
