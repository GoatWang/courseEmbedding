Commercial Financing
If you have never had to deal with commercial real estate financing, you may find it intimidating. That is certainly the case for most first-time commercial borrowers. Commercial real estate mortgages are quite different from their residential cousins in terms of both complexity and cost. But getting the facts before you apply for a loan should eliminate any fears about this fantastic business financing technique.

The Basics of Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial real estate financing is very similar to residential mortgage lending in that real property is pledged as collateral against a loan to either buy or refinance the property. A business may also borrow against the equity in property it owns, which like its residential counterpart can take the form of a business line of credit or a lump sum payment for any business purpose. Commercial real estate mortgages generally require regular payments of principal and interest -- commercial mortgage rates can be either fixed or variable -- until the loan is paid in full. Moreover, a commercial lender retains a security interest in the property throughout the loan term, with the same right to foreclose if the borrower defaults as a residential lender. 

What distinguishes commercial mortgage lending from residential lending are the characteristics of the property and the borrower. Unlike residential mortgages, which are geared toward the individual and 1-4 unit residential dwellings, commercial property financing is designed for business entities -- both for profit and not-for-profit -- to mortgage nearly any type of retail, office, industrial, multi-unit (5+) unit residential, or just about any other commercially zoned real property.

Because of these property and borrower characteristics, commercial real estate mortgages are viewed as higher risk transactions by the lending industry. The limited marketability of commercial property and higher risk of borrower default translates to less generous terms and more conservative underwriting by commercial mortgage lenders than those found in the residential arena. If a lender has to take possession of a commercial property through foreclosure, it will generally have much more difficulty selling it to recoup its money than it would a house. To compensate for the greater risk, commercial mortgage rates are substantially higher as are down payment requirements, and loan terms are shorter (typically a maximum of 25/30 years). 

Commercial mortgage lenders prefer a solid business borrower, but for newer businesses or companies that cannot meet the required financial performance standards, a personal guarantee of repayment from one or more of the firm's principals may be used to compensate. 

A final important difference between commercial real estate financing and the residential variety is that commercial real estate mortgages are more expensive to process and close. Not only are they much larger loans on average than residential mortgages, but nearly every aspect of the "due diligence" phase -- from valuation, to title, to underwriting -- is more complicated and, therefore, more costly. 

An Illustration: The "Vanilla" Commercial Mortgage Loan

To help you understand how commercial mortgage lending works in practice, here are the major characteristics of a standard "vanilla" commercial mortgage loan.

Debt Coverage Ratio

Commercial real estate financing is based primarily on the income of the property rather than the borrower. The lender will want evidence that the property will produce more than enough income to cover the mortgage payments. Generally, commercial mortgage lenders require the property to produce from 1.1 to 1.25 times the monthly mortgage payment in net rental income. For example, if the monthly mortgage payment is $2,000, the property should be producing $2,200 to $2,500 after all expenses are paid. 

Down Payment

Commercial mortgage loans typically require a borrower to put a minimum of 25% down. A higher down payment may be required for certain properties that carry greater risk, newer companies or those without a solid track record of consistent profitability.

Prepayment Penalties

Commercial real estate mortgages normally carry deescalating prepayment penalties, that is, a fee due to the lender if the loan is paid off within a certain period of time after it is made. For example, the fee might be 5% of the outstanding balance during the first year, 4% the second year, and so on, with no penalty after the fifth year. For obvious reasons, prepayment penalties are a particularly important consideration for a business that may not wish to -- or be able to -- own the property long enough to avoid them.

Although these characteristics illustrate a “standard” in commercial real estate mortgages, you can find many lenders with flexibility in any of them. Generally, deviating from a standard will entail an offsetting adjustment in others to compensate for the increased risk. For example, an up-front fee or higher interest rate might reduce or entirely eliminate a prepayment penalty, while a personal guarantee from one or more company owners might reduce the required down payment.
Where to Go For Commercial Real Estate Financing

Commercial mortgage lending is widely available throughout the U.S. The three most common sources of commercial real estate mortgages are:
1. Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities2. Regional Banks3. Private Equity Companies - i.e. Life Insurance Companies / Pension Manager / Hedge Funds4. Specialty Finance Companies - i.e. Third-Party ("Conduit") and Hard Money Lenders
Commercial Mortgage Brokers
Naturally, most business owners turn to banks -- particularly ones with whom they have established relationships -- for their commercial real estate financing. On the one hand, banks tend to offer the lowest commercial mortgage rates; on the other, they are the most rigid in their lending. Many banks will refuse loans on certain classes of property or exclude companies from specific industries. They also require more documentation and may charge higher fees than other commercial mortgage lending sources.

Conduit and hard money lenders can fund commercial mortgage loans with less documentation and more quickly than banks. Because their money comes from private sources, insurance companies, and commercial lines of credit, they can be much more flexible in their lending. You will find that hard money lenders, in particular, will loan money at lightning speed on virtually any type of property with much less stringent criteria for their borrowers -- all at a cost: Hard Money Lenders charge significantly higher mortgage rates than banks.

For larger capital needs, companies often turn to private equity companies. Private equity companies can provide critical commercial real estate financing on the total cost of a project. The equity range is the difference between the total cost of the real estate and the amount the senior lender is willing to provide -- normally no more than 75 percent of costs. So, for a $5 million project, commercial mortgage lenders would typically loan no more than $3.8 million, leaving $1.2 million in the equity range for the borrower to fund. If the borrowing entity has $200,000 in cash to put into the project, it could consider a mezzanine loan or an equity capital investment to come up with the remaining $1 million. Private Equity Companies are quite versatile and they can provide creative, flexible financing solutions, but they expect a good return on investment, so their interest rates are considerably higher than those charged by commercial lenders. Commercial mortgage brokers don't fund loans directly. Instead, a good broker will conduct a thorough assessment of your needs and research the programs offered by other commercial mortgage lending sources to find you the right mortgage solution with the most competitive rates and fees. A good commercial mortgage broker will have established relationships with many different lenders offering a wide variety of lending programs, giving you access to financing you might not be able to find on your own. As an added benefit, commercial mortgage brokers handle the tedious details of loan processing and packaging, making an otherwise complex transaction less stressful and saving you much time and energy. Using just any commercial mortgage broker could cost you either in up-front fees, a higher than market interest rate, or both. A good one, though, will orchestrate a smooth transaction with an optimal loan suited to your company's specific needs at a competitive rate.

With so many choices, it is important that you shop around, but the goal of your shopping should not be just to get the best rate. As is the case in residential mortgages, commercial mortgage rates and terms will vary from one lending source to the next. But with such a big financial commitment at stake, unless you have expertise in commercial real estate financing, you need a trusted advisor to both help you understand and to guide you through the complex process that defines a commercial mortgage loan. 

Regardless of the source you ultimately use, a little preparation before you begin your search for commercial real estate financing will go a long way towards reducing stress and assuring a good outcome.

Preparation: The Key to a Smooth Commercial Mortgage Lending Process

When you are ready to begin your search for a commercial mortgage lender, some advance preparation will serve you well. The complex nature of commercial real estate financing means you cannot expect to "rate shop" multiple lenders with a few minutes on the telephone -- at least, not with any reliability. 
Any prospective lender you contact should ask you for the following information, which is needed to give you an informed, accurate decision about your company's ability to borrow and the approximate rates and terms you can expect: 1. Year-to-date profit & loss statement and balance sheet 2. Three years business income tax returns 3. Projected cash flow for the next 36 months
4. Personal Financial Statement and Resume for the Principal5. Property information
6. Written business plan
Having these items available will not only make your task easier, it will make it more likely you receive both an accurate quote and solid feedback on your loan request. Be wary of any prospective lender who will quote rates and terms without the required information. You could be in for nasty surprises later!

Commercial real estate financing is another of the business financing power tools available to your company. Unlike other types of credit for business, which typically have less attractive terms and a relatively short repayment period, commercial mortgage loans offer an excellent means to acquire property and manage risk with long-term, asset based financing, at attractive interest rates and with favorable tax treatment.

Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C19 | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms JPMBB 2014-C19
    





March 30, 2016 04:54 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings on all 14 classes of and revised 
      the Rating Outlook to Negative for one class of J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust (JPMBB) commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates series 2014-C19. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based off of the overall stable performance of the 
      pool's underlying collateral since issuance and increased credit 
      enhancement (CE) due to continued amortization. As of the March 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate balance has been reduced by 1.2% 
      to $1.66 billion from $1.68 billion at issuance.
    

      Fitch modeled losses of 4.4% of the remaining pool; expected losses on 
      the original pool balance total 3.6%. The pool has experienced no 
      realized losses to date. Fitch has designated one loan (0.7%) as a Fitch 
      Loan of Concern. The pool contains no defeased or specially serviced 
      loans and there have been no interest shortfalls to date.
    

      The Fitch Loan of Concern is secured by a 147 room full-service hotel 
      located in Williston, ND. The hotel is within the Bakken shale region, 
      which is an area that has been severely affected by low oil prices. 
      During a recent tour of the region to assess market conditions, Fitch 
      visited the property and confirmed the low demand for lodging in the 
      area. Performance at the hotel has declined sharply since issuance. Per 
      servicer reporting, the net operating income (NOI) debt service coverage 
      ratio (DSCR) dropped to 0.14x as of year-end (YE) 2015 from 1.36x as of 
      YE 2014. Occupancy for the year fell to 46% in 2015 from 67% in 2014. 
      While the loan remains current, the drop in the NOI DSCR has triggered 
      the lockbox provision and the property is currently being cash managed. 
      Fitch will continue to monitor the loan for further deterioration in 
      performance. Given the decline in performance and market conditions, 
      Fitch modeled a significant loss on the loan.
    

      The largest loan in the pool is the Outlets at Orange loan (9%), which 
      is secured by a 787,697 square foot (sf) open air outlet mall located in 
      Orange, CA. The mall is anchored by Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, Last Call 
      by Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom Rack. Per servicer reporting, the NOI 
      DSCR increased to 2.82x as of YE 2015 from 2.75x as of YE 2014. 
      Occupancy at the property was 99% as of the December 2015 rent roll.
    

      The second largest loan in the pool is the NSP Multifamily Portfolio 
      loan (8.5%), which is secured by a portfolio of four multifamily 
      properties. The portfolio, totalling 1,382 units, is located throughout 
      several markets including Coraopolis, PA, Cranberry Township, PA, 
      Florence, KY and Lexington, KY. As of December 2015, portfolio-wide 
      occupancy was down to 83% from 88% as of YE 2014. The NOI DSCR dropped 
      slightly to 1.46x as of YE 2015 from 1.87x as of YE 2014.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on classes A-1 through E remain Stable as credit 
      enhancement is high due to continued amortization and downgrades are not 
      expected. Rating Upgrades are not likely until the pool has experienced 
      more significant paydown. Class F has been assigned a Negative Rating 
      Outlook due to an increase in expected losses stemming from the Fitch 
      Loan of Concern. A downgrade to the Rating for class F is possible if 
      more loans in the pool become distressed or if losses on the Fitch Loan 
      of Concern are recognized.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes and revises Rating Outlooks as 
      indicated:
    

      --$46.9 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$468.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$112.4 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$276.3 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$62.1 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$1.1* billion class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$98.7 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$89.9 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$89.9* million class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63.4 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$252 class EC at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$65.2 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31.7 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17.6 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook to Negative from Stable.
    

      *Notional and interest-only.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class NR, CSQ and the interest-only X-C 
      certificates. Class A-S, B, and C certificates may be exchanged for a 
      related amount of class EC certificates, and class EC certificates may 
      be exchanged for class A-S, B, and C certificates.

      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





April 22, 2014 03:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time

      (c)The aggregate certificate balance of class A-2FL certificates and 
      class A-2FX certificates will at all times equal the certificate balance 
      of the class A-2FL regular interest.
    

      (d) Privately placed pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of April 17, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $56,382,769 
      non-rated class, the $105,717,769 interest-only class X-C, and the 
      $21,703,000 class CSQ.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 69 loans secured by 100 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.41 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; KeyBank 
      National Association; and Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 81.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 75.1%, and asset summary reviews on 75.1% of the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.32x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 100.9%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 10.2%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 7.7% to issuer cash flows.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Improved Leverage from Recent Transactions: The pool's Fitch DSCR and 
      LTV are 1.32x and 100.9%, respectively, are better than the 2013 and 
      2014 year-to-date (YTD) averages of 1.29x and 101.6%, and 1.18x and 
      104.7%, respectively.
    

      Above-Average Property Quality: Fitch assigned property quality grades 
      of 'A-' or better to three of the 10 largest loans in the pool, which 
      represent 13.1% of the balance of properties inspected by Fitch. 
      Furthermore, property quality grades of 'B+' or better were assigned to 
      44.2% of the balance of properties inspected by Fitch.
    

      Limited Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 10.62% of the 
      initial pool balance prior to maturity. The pool's concentration of 
      partial interest loans of 29.4% is lower than the 2013 and 2014 YTD 
      averages of 34% and 37.63%, respectively. However, the pool's 
      concentration of full-term interest-only loans at 36.4% is higher than 
      the 2013 and 2014 YTD averages of 17.1% and 15.8%, respectively. There 
      is one fully amortizing loan, Centerville Square (2.7%), and Grand 
      Williston Hotel (0.8%) is a five-year loan amortizing on a 10-year 
      schedule.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 10.26% below the 
      most recent reported net operating income (NOI) (for properties that NOI 
      was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period).
    

      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severity on defaulted loans and could result in 
      potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 2014-C19 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 10% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'AAsf' 
      could result. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report includes a detailed 
      explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      accompanying pre-sale report.
    

      The master servicer will be KeyBank National Association, rated 'CMS1' 
      by Fitch. The special servicer will be Midland Loan Services, Inc. rated 
      'CSS1' by Fitch.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
