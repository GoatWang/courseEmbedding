The 2016 Business Longevity Awards


How 46 Northeast Ohio organizations demonstrate the key to longevity is to adapt with changing times
Entrepreneurship isn’t easy. Nine out of every 10 start-ups will fail within the first few years. There is little doubt the business world is difficult, and often cruel.

Success requires more than simply a good idea; it means having moxie, a belief in innovation, a willingness to adapt, and the ability to do what’s necessary to survive.
Reaching a milestone event, such as celebrating 50 years in operation, signifies you’ve accomplished something few others have.
Hitting 75, 100 or even 150 years? That’s even more impressive.
That’s why Smart Business has launched the inaugural Business Longevity Awards in partnership with the Western Reserve Historical Society, the authority on this region’s history — including businesses and nonprofits.
So why 50 years as the ticket to entry for a Business Longevity Award?
Simple. Fifty years ago, we lived in a completely different world.
Sure, technological advancements through 1966 made our lives easier. But man had not yet landed on the moon, the personal computer and cellular phones were still more than a decade away, and mobile technology was a mere twinkle in the eyes of the innovators who were born in the late 1950s and early ‘60s.
Reaching that 50-year mark is no small feat. In 1966, three of the five largest companies were automakers — GM, Ford and Chrysler — and four of the top 10 were oil companies — Exxon Mobil, Mobil, Texaco, and Gulf Oil. The only “technology” company that cracked the top 10 in 1966 was IBM, at No. 11.
Today, however, multi-national holding companies such as Berkshire Hathaway, and Koch Industries, banks like JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, and telecommunications firms like AT&T and Verizon dominate the landscape with such tech firms as Apple, Google, Microsoft and Facebook.
Our inaugural class of Business Longevity Award honorees represent a wide spectrum of industries and sizes. These organizations have been doing business from 51 years to 149 years, and counting—a true testament to their ability to read and adapt to the marketplace.
The 46 honorees demonstrate the power of innovation and perseverance, as well as an innate ability to understand their respective customers and evolve to meet their needs. And, as you read their stories, we hope you’ll be inspired to look at your organization and figure out how you, too, will celebrate longevity milestones of your own.
Take a look back at the inaugural Business Longevity Awards:

CELEBRATING 51 YEARS IN BUSINESS
ORBIT INDUSTRIES INC.
FOUNDED: 1965 • John Alexandrovic • CEO • www.orbitndt.com
Orbit Industries was founded in 1965 by James Clemons and a group of nondestructive testing experts with a commitment to excellence in ultrasonic, magnetic particle, liquid penetrant and radiographic inspection techniques. The company operated out of two facilities in Greater Cleveland until 1974 when it consolidated, eliminated the radiographic department and moved the operations to Middleburg Heights.
In 1979, the company was purchased by Robert Smetana, Dan Druso and current CEO John Alexandrovic. In 1992, Smetana divested his ownership of the company through the sale of his interests to Alexandrovic and Smetana’s daughters, Mary and Therese. In July 2001, Alexandrovic led a buyout of the Smetana family interests. Robert Aleksandrovic rejoined Orbit Industries in 2002 as an owner and its COO.
Through consistent training and coaching, the 51-year-old company continues to cultivate a high-quality NDT workforce. The company says it is committed to continuous improvement, and challenges its workforce in all facets of professional development.
Orbit works to derive the supply chain needs of its customer base and execute testing solutions that provide the best quality, lead time and price. The company is fostering partnerships and relationships that cross traditional manufacturing barriers, a strategy it expects will create long-term viability.

CELEBRATING 52 YEARS IN BUSINESS
CHAMPION PERSONNEL SYSTEM
FOUNDED: 1964 • Robert Schepens • CEO • www.championpersonnel.com
Ralph Schepens founded Champion Personnel System in 1964 as a clerical and office permanent hiring marketplace. Over its first 10 years, Schepens expanded the firm’s offerings to include search work in the financial, engineering, technical, IT and plant management arenas. Champion’s focus on permanent placement continued until 1994, when Schepens opened a small temporary placement division that specialized in office workers.
The following year, after dealing with ill health and coming perilously close to going out of business, Ralph sold the company to his son, Robert. Within two years, Robert had transformed the organization and, in doing so, turned around its finances.
He introduced one of the first staffing company websites in the nation, upgraded the computer systems, expanded the temporary staffing division, doubled the staff and became profitable. Over the next two decades, Robert strategically navigated Champion into new markets, such as light industrial and technical; he opened offices in Mentor, Twinsburg, Middlefield and North Olmsted; and he sought out new opportunities to grow the company.
One of those opportunities was staffing the special events marketspace, specifically for what is today Destination Cleveland, where Champion is the exclusive staffing firm for all events that come to town — more than 50 each year.

CELEBRATING 52 YEARS IN BUSINESS
SEA-LAND CHEMICAL CO.
FOUNDED: 1964 • Joe Clayton • president • www.sealandchemical.com
Since its founding in 1964, Sea-Land Chemical Co. has served the specialty chemical industry. Led by President Joe Clayton, it is an international distributor of specialty chemicals that has evolved through the years and today represents more than 30 different suppliers.
Sea-Land Chemical Co. incorporated in 1971; 10 years later it became an ESOP. Over the next 20 years, Sea-Land transitioned to 100 percent employee-ownership.
In 2011, the company established subsidiaries in Canada and Europe, which allowed the company to meet global distribution needs. It also added repackaging expertise and increased importation capabilities. Being a stocking distributor enables Sea-Land to offer multiple warehouses, nationwide coverage and inventory in stock. By 2015, the company was the 35th largest chemical distributor in North America.
As Sea-Land has adapted, leadership has taken additional steps to remain vibrant, including its current initiative to pursue ISO 9001 certification. Sea-Land’s newly formed subsidiary SLC Testing Services Inc., acquired the assets of Tribsys LLC, and offers Twist Compression Tests, which measure lubricant failure at high pressures in a variety of metalworking and industrial applications. As this business grows, the company will look to add further testing equipment to satisfy the innovation needs of companies supplying the lubricants industry.

CELEBRATING 54 YEARS IN BUSINESS
GUARDIAN TITLE & GUARANTY AGENCY INC.
FOUNDED: 1962 • Michael Maniche • president • www.guardiantitle.com
Guardian Title & Guaranty Agency Inc., the oldest independent locally owned title company in Northeast Ohio. was founded 54 years ago. While hundreds of title companies since then have come and gone, Guardian still successfully operates in its geographic footprint and continues to be a market leader.
Though the economy is constantly going through periods of growth, recession and depression, the real estate market is even more volatile. Guardian Title has made it through these periods because of its ability to adapt quickly and to use innovations and cutting edge technology to be more efficient.
Guardian Title was the first Northeast Ohio title company to do business using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). Implemented in the late 1980s, this technology allows the agency to provide services for a large amount of transactions with lenders quickly and efficiently. It also allows the agency to grow quickly during busy times by conducting more business with fewer employees, which helps Guardian Title keep employees rather than laying them off during slower times.
Most of employees have been in the business for 15 years or more. For instance, Michael Maniche, president, 36 years’ experience; Timothy Kalep, vice president 42 years; Diane Edmiston, operations manager, 22 years; and Kimberly McNally, general counsel, 20 years.

CELEBRATING 54 YEARS IN BUSINESS
TURNER CONSTRUCTION CO.
FOUNDED: 1962 • Jason Jones • vice president and general manager, Cleveland office • www.turnerconstruction.com/office-network/cleveland
Henry Turner founded Turner Construction Co. in 1902 based on the core values of teamwork, integrity and commitment. Today, Turner has a global reach and its people continue Henry’s vision, providing personalized services to clients, building partnerships in the community and delivering resources such as schools, hospitals, workplaces and social and cultural centers.
Building businesses in Cleveland has been Turner’s mission since 1907, when its first project, Murphy Varnish Co., was completed on East 87th Street. Turner evolved in subsequent years to become one of the most reputable contractors behind the development of downtown Cleveland’s iconic skyline.
The firm established its Cleveland office in 1962; it became a permanent office in 1964. Over the next five decades Turner forged its reputation as a trusted general builder and construction management firm. Today, it employs a staff of more than 120 people who call Northeast Ohio home and completes more than $300 million in construction each year. Among its notable local projects are Key Tower, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Global Center for Health Innovation and Cleveland Convention Center and the Hilton Cleveland Downtown.
By diversifying its expertise into such areas as Building Information Modeling (BIM), Turner has continued its evolution.

CELEBRATING 56 YEARS IN BUSINESS
EXECUTIVE CATERERS AT LANDERHAVEN
FOUNDED: 1960 • Harlan Diamond • CEO • www.executivecaterers.com
Executive Caterers has spent 56 years creating memorable events for the social, corporate and civic communities of Greater Cleveland as well as nationally. CEO Harlan Diamond holds the distinction of catering to every U.S. president since Lyndon Johnson, for every Ohio governor since James Rhodes and every mayor of Cleveland since Ralph Locher.
Diamond founded Executive Caterers in 1960, after considering becoming a social worker, but was advised that a successful caterer could help many more people. He has helped countless students get through college and has given jobs to those who needed a second or third chance in life.
Executive Caterers’ first event center was located on Chagrin Boulevard, but 25 years ago Diamond felt the need to expand and Landerhaven in Mayfield Heights became the purveyor’s home. A 40,000-square-foot event center with six venues, gardens and patios, Landerhaven has continually upgraded its facilities and has added its own in-house bakery, florist and cuisine.
Diamond and Executive Caterers/Landerhaven have been a part of the Northeast Ohio charity scene, and after the 9/11 tragedy, Diamond converted his Corporate Club into a fundraiser for local non-profits. Since then, Philanthropia has grown to a sold-out event annually of 1,000 people and has raised more than $1.7 million for local charities.

CELEBRATING 59 YEARS IN BUSINESS
HOWARD HANNA
FOUNDED: 1957 • Howard W. “Hoby” Hanna IV • president • www.howardhanna.com
Howard Hanna Real Estate Services has humble beginnings. Established in 1957, Howard and Anne Freyvogel Hanna started their family business in a single office in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Today, they are the fourth largest real estate company in the U.S. Founded as the Howard Hanna Company, the family business was an integral part of growing up in the Hanna household.
Today, Howard and Anne’s three children, Hoddy, Helen and Annie, and the third generation, Annie Hanna Engel, Hoby Hanna, Kelly Hanna Riley, Duffy Hanna and Dennis Cestra Jr., carry on the family tradition throughout the company in 205 offices across eight states with more than 7,000 sales associates and employees. In 2015, Howard Hanna assisted 66,714 buyers with home ownership, creating a volume of more than $12.6 billion in real estate value.
The company first came to Ohio in 1996 with the acquisition of Del Realty in the Youngstown area, and then acquired other smaller companies in the Mahoning Valley region before focusing on Cleveland.
Since 2013, Howard Hanna has grown exponentially in the area, with Hanna Commercial offices in the U.S. Bank Centre Building in Playhouse Square and in Pittsburgh where Hanna Commercial operates as Hanna Langholz Wilson Ellis.

INDEPENDENCE EXCAVATING INC.
FOUNDED: 1956 • Victor DiGeronimo Jr. • president • www.indexc.com
Don DiGeronimo started Independence Excavating Inc. 60 years ago with a backhoe, bulldozer, truck and a few employees. With the guidance and financial assistance of his father, Sam DiGeronimo, they quickly became a leader in the residential and small commercial excavation field.
In 1971, Don lost his battle with cancer and Don’s four brothers assumed leadership. This management team expanded and diversified the company, honoring Sam and Don’s legacy by performing quality work with honesty and integrity.
Today, Independence Excavating is a large diversified construction company that employs more than 500 people at peak operation; owns and operates a fleet of more than 400 major pieces of construction equipment; and remains loyal to its roots — more than 25 family members spanning four generations are involved in day-to-day operations.
Beginning with the 1972 excavation for the Justice Center, the company has performed most of the major building excavations in downtown Cleveland, including Progressive Field, Cleveland Browns Stadium, the “Q” and the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame. Recently, Independence Excavating has had a hand in the downtown resurgence with projects for the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Flats East Bank Redevelopment, ODOT Innerbelt Bridge reconstruction and the Global Center for Health Innovation, to name a few.

CELEBRATING 62 YEARS IN BUSINESS
NORDSON CORP.
FOUNDED: 1954 • Michael F. Hilton • president & CEO • www.nordson.com
Brothers Eric and Evan Nord founded the Nordson Corp. in 1954, but its roots trace back to the U.S. Automatic Co., which started in 1909. Initially specializing in screw machine parts for the automotive industry, Eric and Evan’s father shifted the company to producing high-precision parts critical for the United States’ defense during World War II.
Following the war, the Nords searched for a basis for future growth and found it by acquiring patents for the “hot airless” method of spraying paint and other coating materials.
By the 1960s, Nordson was a technological leader in paint finishing and innovator in all aspects of powder coating. It also established subsidiaries in Belgium and Japan. In the 1970s, Nordson started trading on the NASDAQ exchange.
In the ensuing decades, Nordson balanced organic and acquisitive growth, adding new capabilities like adhesive dispensing and electronic test and inspection. It also established subsidiaries in Latin America, China and India.
In 2010, Michael F. Hilton became president and CEO. He has focused on corporate and acquisition strategy, organic growth, talent development and continuous improvement. With annual sales exceeding $1 billion, the company is the global leader in precision technology solutions, while seeking to grow into new spaces like medical and polymer processing.

CELEBRATING 65 YEARS IN BUSINESS
R.E. WARNER & ASSOCIATES INC.
FOUNDED: 1951 • Ted Beltavski • president & chairman of the board • www.rewarner.com
R.E. Warner & Associates, a consulting engineering, architectural and surveying firm, was founded in 1951 by Robert Edward Warner. The firm has since grown from one to 85 employees, has moved through five generations of leadership and has grown its original three shareholders to 19.
In the 1950s and 1960s, mechanical, electrical and civil engineering kept the firm busy with projects for the steel industry throughout the Midwest. As the company grew, the professional disciplines of environmental, architectural, instrumentations and controls, structural, processing and piping, mechanical/HVAC and industrial engineering and surveying were added, and its client base expanded to include many large automotive and chemical producers, local manufacturers, electric power companies, commercial and institutional facilities and various government agencies.
Since the onset of computer-aided drafting, R.E. Warner has completed major technology upgrades, and this year acquired Accurate Technologies, giving the firm the capability to provide 3-D laser scanning and laser tracking. The firm also acquired an FAA-approved license to fly a 3-D mapping drone, enabling it to create mapping for surveying and engineering purposes.
Headed by President and Chairman of the Board Ted Beltavski, the company says its steady growth through the years is an excellent indication of client satisfaction.

CELEBRATING 68 YEARS IN BUSINESS
KURTZ BROS. INC.
FOUNDED: 1948 • John T. Kurtz • president • www.kurtz-bros.com
Kurtz Bros. Inc., around for more than six decades, is now on its fifth generation.
The company started as a supplier of topsoil, before evolving into an organics recycler and topsoil manufacturer. Then, in 1986, a budding relationship with Ford paved the way to recycling 6 million tons of foundry sand into horticultural soil blends and engineered fill, extending the company’s landscape supply product line and establishing it as a leader in waste-to-resource.
Around that same time, Kurtz Bros. saw a need for the management and recycling of construction and demolition debris (C&DD). As the need grew and technology advanced, Kurtz Bros. installed a materials recycling facility to sort and process locally generated C&DD debris — one of the first of the 56 C&DD landfills in Ohio to commit to recycling and reuse.
In 2015, it expanded its waste-to-resource services further by partnering with the Port of Cleveland to prevent landfilling and open lake dumping of dredged sediment.
The need for sustainable efforts in the industrial and residential markets has grown dramatically. Kurtz Bros.’s knowledge, experience and commitment to innovation has allowed it to remain a leader in waste-to-resource and landscape supply for 68 years and will carry it on for decades more.

In 1946, after splitting from his original business partner, Arthur Kuehn began installing and servicing dictating equipment under the name Warwick Recorder. His company had five employees and primarily sold wire recorder equipment from its headquarters off Euclid Avenue at E. 46th Street.
Within 10 years, Warwick outgrew its facility and moved into a larger office on Prospect Avenue, just in time to tackle a new project — installing an internal telephone system — known as a Private Automatic Exchange (PAX) — in the Cleveland area.
The project’s success led to a distributorship from the manufacturer for Northeast Ohio, which allowed Warwick to spend the remainder of the 1950s investing in and expanding its product line and services. By decade’s end, the company had 12 employees, was selling intercom and paging systems, and officially became Warwick Communications.
Over the next several decades, Warwick diversified into the growing field of telecommunications, expanding into wireless and networks. Along the way, Art transitioned the company to his son, Don, who in 2009 sold the company to a group of employees — Heidi Murphy, Steve Leopold and Ryan Shorts.
Today, Warwick employs nearly 40 people and continues to be a leader in providing voice and data technology solutions.

KIKO COMPANY
FOUNDED: 1945 • Richard T. Kiko Jr. • CEO • www.kikocompany.com
Founded in 1945, the Kiko Company started as Russ Kiko Associates. Russell T. Kiko Sr., current CEO Richard T. Kiko Jr.’s grandfather, conducted auctions on the family farm with help from his wife and 13 children. Seeing himself as an industry pioneer, he selected a covered wagon as the logo.
The company specialized in auctions, but Russ’s oldest son, Dick Sr., saw a lost opportunity so he became a licensed real estate broker. During the 1970s and ’80s, Russ, his six sons, son-in-law, brother-in-law and three nephews built up both businesses.
The third generation, including Dick Jr., grew up taking inventory in attics, emptying basements, handling livestock, tagging items for sale, setting up box lots and cashiering.
Dick Jr. worked for Fortune 500 companies, before returning to the company in 2002. He was instrumental in forming Coletta Holdings and a board of directors, as well as facilitating the third generation’s buyout of the second generation.
The company moved into a new office, expanded its geographic footprint and started a sign shop, while growing into four specialized brands.
Kiko now executes more than 1,100 auctions and lists about 450 properties annually. The company is owned by 24 first cousins and has 45 family members associated with it.

STANDBY SCREW MACHINE PRODUCTS CO.
FOUNDED: 1939 • William F. Marcell ll • COO | Frederick W. Marcell • owner • www.standbyscrew.com

Standby Screw Machine Products Co., a precision-turned metal component manufacturer in the automotive and outdoor power equipment markets, is a third-generation family-owned business. William Frederick Marcell started the company in 1939 with one machine in his garage. Over the years, the business grew and his son, Frederick William Marcell, took over.
In 2003, it was clear that in order to remain competitive, the company would need a lower price alternative for customers. A plant was established in China to meet that demand while still selling its products and growing the business in the U.S. That facility has complemented the Berea, Ohio plant and has helped keep the business financially stable even during the difficult period between 2008-2009.
The company continually invests in cutting-edge technology and automation. William Frederick Marcell II saw the need to incorporate robotics for better efficiencies and accuracies, and several robots have since been installed in its Berea and China facilities.
The business employs more than 120 people in the U.S., many of whom have been working for the company throughout their entire career. Standby is considered not only innovative and forward thinking, but to be a company that cares about every person it employs.

FOUNDED: 1938 • Robin Baum • managing partner • www.zinnerco.com
Harry Zinner began Zinner & Co. in 1938 as a bookkeeping and tax practice in the Cleveland Food Terminal, which at the time was the center of commerce. Zinner did work for numerous small businesses in Greater Cleveland.
In 1966, Harry’s son, Donald, left a large accounting firm to join his father. The next year, Donald became a partner and the firm was renamed Zinner & Zinner. Over the next few decades, the firm grew — adding talented professionals and merging with other firms until 1996, when it eventually became known as Zinner & Co.
While the firm’s core client base is in Northeast Ohio, it serves clients worldwide through its membership in The International Alliance Group (TIAG), a global alliance of independent accounting firms in 65 countries.
One area where the firm has established a niche is in not-for-profit services, where Zinner & Co. represents some of the most widely recognized regional nonprofits.
The firm’s ability to adapt to changing times — and evolving client needs — has been evident since the early days. Today, under managing partner Robin Baum, Zinner & Co. continues to build relationships and diversify its services beyond comprehensive CPA and accounting services to include business consultancy and a host of other related outsourced services.

GEIGER’S
FOUNDED: 1932 • Chas Geiger | Gordon Geiger • co-owners • www.shopgeigers.com
The name “Geiger’s” has been associated with clothing since the early 1900s when Charley Geiger and his brother Howard had a haberdashery business. They expanded to 17 stores at their height, in Downtown Cleveland and on the West Side.
When the Depression hit, the brothers reincorporated separately. Howard had a store at Kamm’s Corners in Cleveland for years. Charley made Lakewood his base in 1932.
When Charley Geiger passed away in 1949, his son Charley Jr., who had worked in the family-owned haberdashery from age 12 on, took over. He operated the business until he passed away in 1991 and built not only the shop’s reputation, but the family’s reputation as responsible citizens of the community.
Charley Geiger often was referred to as “Mr. Lakewood.” He had been president of the Lakewood Board of Education and Lakewood Chamber of Commerce. He was named Lakewood Citizen of the Year by the Veterans of Foreign Wars in 1972 and Man of the Year by the Lakewood Athletic Commission in 1981.
Under his leadership, the business expanded to include a children’s clothing store and ski and sports departments. The business is now operated by his sons, Chas and Gordon. Chas has also served on the Lakewood school board for many years, like his dad.

GREAT LAKES INTEGRATED
FOUNDED: 1931 • James Schultz• president, CEO and chairman • www.gll.com
Eighty-five years ago with a printing press and a dream, Joseph and Elsie Schultz started Great Lakes as a printing company.
Joseph had started in the industry at age 15 and in 1927 invented a time-saving device to clean the rolls of lithograph printing presses. The invention or variations of it were widely used in the printing industry.
While Joseph received 57 patents during his life, he was also a respected printer, which led to the founding of Great Lakes Lithograph, later Great Lakes Integrated.
He believed the most important factor for survival was emphasis on innovation and reinvention.
Their son George took over leadership of the operation in 1950, and grew the company by acquiring innovative printing technologies. His son James started with the company in 1971 and became CEO in 1986.
By the mid-1980s, GLI added desktop publishing. In the mid-1990s, customers sought marketing-related requests for print pieces so GLI created a fulfillment division. Soon after, GLI introduced digital asset management systems with Print on Demand.
GLI installed a new digital press last year that can print smaller jobs more economically with the same quality and efficiency. It’s a focus on the “little bets” that helped Great Lakes grow and stay ahead of the competition.

Even as Bendix has evolved and grown in the past 86 years, its story has always been one of ingenuity, initiative and intellect. Roadways and commercial vehicles have changed in many ways since 1930, but those qualities continue to drive and shape our efforts to improve highway safety and meet the commercial vehicle industry’s ever-changing needs.

Heinen, a German immigrant, the shop became one of the first supermarkets when Heinen moved it to larger quarters across the street in 1933, adding produce and groceries to the meat market.
The firm’s reputation for high quality, service and cleanliness grew. Heinen’s was one of the first to sell self-service meat in a package. Later, it introduced parcel pickup service.

By 1962 Heinen’s had five stores and a new warehouse and headquarters in Warrensville Heights. Also starting in the 1960s, Heinen’s expanded to Cleveland’s west suburbs.

Edgar F. Allen founded in 1919 what became known as the National Society for Crippled Children after he lost his son Homer, 17, in a tragic streetcar accident in Elyria, Ohio.

KARAMU HOUSE
FOUNDED: 1915 • Tony Sias • president & CEO • www.karamuhouse.org
In 1915, a pair of Oberlin graduates opened a settlement house in an area of Cleveland called “The Roaring Third” at the corner of East 38th and Central Avenue. With foresight and vision, Russell Jelliffe and Rowena Woodham set out to establish a common ground where people of different races, religions, social and economic backgrounds could come together to seek and share common ventures.
The idea was conceived out of the principle that the individual is not wholly determined by his environment, but has the capacity to transcend it. The arts provided the perfect common ground.
The early 1920s saw a number of African-Americans move into the area from the South. Resisting pressure to exclude their new neighbors, all races were welcome, and the “Playhouse Settlement” became a magnet for some of the best African-American artists of the day. Dancers, printmakers, actors and writers all found a place to practice their crafts.
The Playhouse Settlement was renamed Karamu, a Swahili word meaning “Place of enjoyment in the Center of the Community” in 1941. With a rich history dating back close to 100 years, the Karamu House, today under the direction of President and CEO Tony Sias, is a premiere theatre in the Cleveland region.

NACCO INDUSTRIES INC.
FOUNDED: 1913 • Alfred Rankin Jr. • chairman, president & CEO • www.nacco.com
In 1913, Frank E. Taplin Sr. founded The Cleveland & Western Coal Co. as a one-man brokerage firm, selling other companies’ coal. Over the next century, the company evolved into NACCO Industries Inc., a multi-billion-dollar diversified holding company.
Taplin’s small brokerage grew into an underground mining company by 1916. Ten years later, it rebranded as The North American Coal Corp. From there, a dual focus on safety and innovation spurred its transformation from an Eastern underground miner of bituminous coal to the largest lignite surface miner in the United States. And then a corporate diversification program launched in the early 1980s led to the creation in 1986 of NACCO Industries Inc.
The company’s expansion included taking a controlling investment in the lift truck industry and acquiring businesses in the housewares industry. By 2011, NACCO was a Fortune 1000 business with revenues of $3.3 billion.
Fittingly, during its 100th year, NACCO transformed itself yet again by spinning off its materials handling business in late 2012 as an independent public company, Hyster-Yale Materials Handling Inc.
Today, under the leadership of Alfred Rankin Jr., NACCO remains a strong, multi-industry company with leading businesses in the mining, small appliances and specialty retail industries.

Thompson was admitted to the Ohio Bar and established a commercial law practice in downtown Cleveland. He went into partnership with Charles P. Hine and later, in 1911, with Walter L. Flory.

Established as Cleveland Society for the Blind in 1906 and today known as Cleveland Sight Center (CSC), the agency has long been a resource and advocate for those who are blind or are vision-impaired. Led by Larry Benders, CSC’s president and executive director, the agency provides rehabilitation, social and independent living services to Northeast Ohio residents of all ages. In 1928, CSC opened the first summer camp, Highbrook Lodge in Chardon, Ohio, dedicated to serving those with blindness or low vision.
In 1907, Robert Irwin, a blind Harvard University graduate, proved visually impaired children could succeed in Cleveland public schools. His findings verified the idea of “mainstreaming” a half-century before it became an educational buzzword. Industrial giant Caesar Grasselli donated his home in 1918 to create the first permanent location for the Cleveland Society for the Blind.
In the 1930s, Lubrizol founder Kelvin Smith and his wife, Eleanor, became involved with Cleveland Sight Center, a commitment that lasted over 50 years and continues today through the Kelvin and Eleanor Smith Foundation. And in the 1980s, James P. Storer, a blind broadcasting executive, financed one of the nation’s first digital technology centers to provide technology to others with similar vision impairments.

The company started as a manufacturer of battery chargers for electric automobiles. It evolved into a leading provider of welding and cutting products, as well as and automation systems for a wide range of industries.
Lincoln Electric’s early growth came through its change from electrical charging to welding in 1909, when it began producing welding machines. A few years later, it began offering educational opportunities, such as a welding school and the publication of instructional technical materials. Since 1917, Lincoln Electric has trained more than 100,000 people at its Weld Technology and Training Center.
Shortly after James Lincoln became general manager in 1914, he established an Employee Advisory Board where elected representatives from each department met for bi-weekly meetings — a practice continued to this day. James also developed a worker incentive plan, which includes an incentive bonus for all employees based on annual revenue.
Today, Lincoln Electric is a publicly traded global manufacturer with 48 locations in 19 countries and generates more than $2.5 billion in annual sales.

OSWALD COMPANIES
FOUNDED: 1893 • Bob Klonk • CEO • www.oswaldcompanies.com
Founded in 1893, Oswald Companies is one of the nation’s largest independent, employee-owned insurance brokerage firms. James B. Oswald started the company by making this proposition to his friend, Harris Creech: “Let’s start a company based upon professionalism and customer service.”
Together, they conceived an insurance organization that would serve the businesses of a growing Cleveland. Creech left the partnership in the 1920s and Oswald Companies became a family venture, with Oswald’s son Robert joining the firm in the 1930s, son Thomas in the 1940s, and grandson James Pender in the 1950s. Today, more than 120 years later, Oswald Companies’ more than 350 professionals across six offices remain grounded in the founders’ values.
A “Focus Forward” philosophy guides the company and team members work with clients to not only solve today’s challenges but also create solutions of the future. It’s a reflection of how Oswald has maintained steady growth: talent development, acquisition, creative client service and continuous improvement.
Today, under CEO Bob Klonk, Oswald is an employee-owned family of firms and a member of Assurex Global, the world’s largest association of privately held insurance brokers. The company’s numerous acquisitions and expansion position it with four business units that provide a wide range of products and services to its clients.

CARR BROS. INC.
FOUNDED: 1892 • Floyd E. Carr Jr. • president | Duane A. Carr • vice president • www.carrbros.net
For more than a century, Carr Bros. Inc. has adapted to changing times by capitalizing on the achievements of prior generations. The company began in 1892 in Bedford as a coal company owned by the current millennial generation’s great grandfather. Using a horse and buggy, the company supplied coal and building supplies such as brick, plaster, sewer pipe and concrete to its customers.
As customer demand grew, the company adapted and grew. Carr Bros. expanded and relocated to Walton Hills in 1953. Supplying both commercial and residential concrete contractors, the company focused on growth and cost management. Over the years, the company has been dedicated to keeping up with the times and taking care of its customers. Although concrete jobs remain the same, the way in which these jobs get done has become more efficient and advanced.
Led by President Floyd E. Carr Jr. and Vice President Duane A. Carr, Carr Bros. boasts leading edge billing software and state-of-the-art equipment. In addition, the company utilizes dynamic routing and field service management software that optimizes delivery and routes.
Working together, each generation has added to the legacy of sound business management and decision-making skills that continues to make Carr Bros. a household name for ready-mixed concrete.

THE OSBORN ENGINEERING CO.
FOUNDED: 1892 • Gary Hribar • president and CEO • www.osborn-eng.com
Founded by Frank Osborn in 1892 at the height of the Industrial Revolution, The Osborn Engineering Co. has a history of seizing opportunity and driving innovation. In 1902, Frank Osborn authored the forerunner of today’s American Institute of Steel Construction Manual, The Osborn Tables, so that all steel shapes produced in the U.S., and now worldwide, could be standardized.
Osborn Engineering has always been a stalwart in its field. It capitalized on the booming automotive production of the early 1900s and designed more than 25 rubber product plants, including Goodyear and Firestone.
Through the next decade, the company designed many major-league, municipal and collegiate stadiums, including Cleveland Municipal Stadium, Fenway Park and Yankee Stadium.
World War II forced the company to reduce its staff to two. But after the war, it grew, expanding its services to include architectural, electrical design, and heating, piping and ventilation.
Through the 1960s, it branched into markets around the world, and purchased its first computer. Most recently the company has expanded into the health care market, combined its sports engineering and architectural legacies, and launched a technology group.
Now operating in its 124th year, under the guidance of President and CEO Gary Hribar, the company continues to capitalize on opportunity.

HORSBURGH & SCOTT
FOUNDED: 1886 • Pradeep Saha• president & CEO• www.horsburgh-scott.com
The streetcar business was booming in 1886 when Frank Horsburgh and Thomas Scott opened a machine shop to manufacture gears and pinions for the new mode of transportation.
Today, Horsburgh & Scott is a global leader in the engineering, manufacture and repair of large industrial gears and gearboxes for a range of industrial applications.
In 1903 the company moved to its current headquarters, which encompasses an entire city block at East 53rd street and St. Clair Avenue. The company has expanded considerably since then and now has more than 400,000 square feet of manufacturing space, including a repair/rebuild center on Chardon Road in Euclid and a heat treat facility on Hamilton Avenue in Cleveland.
Horsburgh & Scott evolved through the Great Depression of the 1930s and through World War II. When the war ended, there came new demands for gearing to support America’s capital expansion and the company experienced strong growth for 25 years.
As global markets have evolved, so has Horsburgh & Scott, which recently completed manufacture of its largest gearbox ever, weighing 366,000 pounds and producing 24.7 million foot-pounds of output torque.
President and CEO Pradeep Saha is focused on continued growth expanding the company’s gear and gearbox solutions into new markets in the U.S. and abroad.

THE DAVEY TREE EXPERT CO.
FOUNDED: 1880 • Karl Warnke • chairman, president and CEO • www.davey.com
Davey Tree was founded in 1880 on the idea of scientific tree care. The company’s founder, John Davey, was an entrepreneur who believed people loved trees but neglected them only because they didn’t know how to care for them. So he wrote a book, “The Tree Doctor,” that demonstrated his concepts for doctoring trees based on scientific methods. This innovative work is both the bedrock of Davey’s science-based methods and also core to the entrepreneurial spirit of its employees.
After publishing “The Tree Doctor” in 1901, the demand for John Davey’s tree care services continued to grow, expanding from Ohio into Pennsylvania, New York, Washington, D.C. and even the Canadian cities of Toronto and Ottawa.
From the introduction of chainsaws and other groundbreaking equipment to introducing a holistic way of caring for plants — Davey’s integration of new technology and equipment has revolutionized both how Davey and the industry cares for trees. More than 8,600 employees provide tree care, grounds maintenance and environmental consulting services for markets throughout North America.
Employees purchased the company in 1979, making Davey one of the oldest and largest employee-owned companies in the country. It is currently led by Karl Warnke, who serves as chairman, president and CEO.

THE AUSTIN CO.
FOUNDED: 1878 • Mike Pierce • president • www.theaustin.com
Samuel Austin came to the U.S. from England in 1872. By 1878, his quality craftsmanship allowed him to set out on his own.
In 1899, Samuel Austin’s son, Wilbert, began working with his father as an engineer. He introduced the idea of providing engineering services with construction services, a process called The Austin Method. It would quickly carry the company’s name throughout the U.S. and the world.
The father-son team would establish many innovations. In 1907, they constructed the first reinforced concrete structure in Cleveland, now the Tower Press building. In 1914, Wilbert created standardized factory design, which proved to be efficient, safe and cost effective.
During World War I, they developed the first prefabricated factories to be shipped to Europe. They began serving the aviation industry and would eventually help Cleveland during the development of its airport.
They became well-known design-builders of newspaper facilities and would design and construct more than 100 community newspaper and 30 metropolitan newspaper facilities.
Post-World War II, Austin designed and constructed facilities for major American broadcasting networks, including Cleveland’s WEWS-TV studio.
Today, led by President Mike Pierce, The Austin Co. continues to serve a diverse range of industries, including health care, aviation and aerospace, pharmaceuticals and nuclear support.

FRIENDLY INN SETTLEMENT HOUSE
FOUNDED: 1874 • Richgina Jeff-Carter • executive director • www.friendlyinn.org
Friendly Inn Settlement is the oldest existing settlement house in Cleveland and oldest continually operating one in the nation. Founded in 1874 by the Women’s Temperance Union League (W.T.U.L.) through the efforts of Laura Rockefeller and Flora Stone Mather, Friendly Inn originally provided a liquor-free gathering place for residents of poor neighborhoods. It evolved into one of the city’s first settlement houses, where affluent women mingled with the poor, distributed food and read passages from the Bible.
Within a few years, Friendly Inn had five locations and served recent immigrants with playgrounds and kindergartens, clubs for mothers, bathing facilities for men and vocational training for boys. Its benefactors included John D. Rockefeller and Stephen V. Harkness, co-founders of the Standard Oil Co.
In 1954, Friendly Inn’s demographics changed from primarily European immigrants to predominantly African-American. It moved its headquarters to the Central neighborhood and started offering programs that addressed issues faced by its clients, including employment training, housing assistance and G.E.D classes.
By 2003, Friendly Inn had outgrown its space and built a new facility. Today, it operates a licensed childcare center, provides after-school programming, offers college exposure trips for high school students and runs social service initiatives for families and expecting and new mothers as the preferred service provider for numerous state, local and regional agencies.

SP MOUNT PRINTING CO.
FOUNDED: 1867 • Scott C. McGill • president • www.spmount.com
Seeley P. Mount, a drummer boy during the last battles of the Civil war, teamed up with a partner and established the Mount & Carroll printing firm in 1867. Four years later, Mount bought out Carroll and renamed it The SP Mount Printing Co.
When the company began, printing was done directly from type, which had been set by hand and using foot-powered platen printing presses. The end of World War II ushered in offset printing. Production speeds doubled and anything that could be photographed could be reproduced in quantities at reasonable costs. As demand grew, better presses became available, leading up to the six or more color computer-controlled printing presses of today.
While SP’s modern printing presses make it possible to meet today’s demand, the company couldn’t exist without highly skilled people. Employees obtain on-the-job training and advanced class work from local universities. This has helped SP Mount’s employees produce award-winning projects.
Today, SP Mount’s great-great-grandsons, the fifth continuous generation of family operation and ownership, follow in the footsteps SP laid nearly 150 years ago. President Scott McGill and Executive Vice President Jerry McGill Jr. continue the family tradition as the oldest surviving printing company in this part of the U.S.

                Part of the
                Operations Research Proceedings
                book series (ORP, volume 1990)AbstractThe emergence of expert systems in marketing can be seen as the next step in the development of the use of computers in marketing management, where starting out with an almost exclusively mathematical model building/optimization approach, gradually more judgmental elements from managerial experience were added (decision calculus; marketing decision support systems).In this paper, twenty-one marketing expert systems which recently appeared in the literature are analyzed. It turns out that these systems tend to address relatively structured problems, often with a routine character. Acquisition of the knowledge base is not from practising marketing and product managers, but from the literature and other sources. Validation of marketing expert systems has taken place on a very limited scale. Many systems are still in prototype stage; few are implemented and used on an ongoing basis at this moment.The outlook is that the development of marketing expert systems for relatively structured problems will continue. There are many application area’s beyond the ones tackled by the current system (where sales promotion and market monitoring stand out). Especially promising for marketing are systems that integrate data bases, models and expert systems.In a farther perspective, new approaches from AI can help to get a ‘deeper’ understanding of marketing decision making and how managerial marketing knowledge can be captured, represented and brought to bear on the solution of more complex marketing problems.PreviewUnable to display preview. Download preview PDF.Unable to display preview. Download preview PDF.ReferencesBayer, Judy, Stephen Lawrence, and John W.

AbstractIn response to the problems associated with intensifying competition and slow growth in the demand for food, European businesses increasingly attempt to add value to the agricultural raw material. To adopt a successful differentiation strategy, they must make the transition from the well-known product-oriented approach to marketing (based on homogenization, and cost minimization through economies of scale) to a consumer-oriented approach (identifying and meeting the needs of particular groups of consumers). The best performing companies demonstrate an unwavering focus upon the market place and relate all their operating decisions to the dictates of customer needs. The strategic reorientation of agribusiness coincides with consumer trends demanding higher quality than ever before. Therefore, differentiation on product attributes that consumers deem important may be a viable strategy to agribusiness.PreviewUnable to display preview. Download preview PDF.Unable to display preview. Download preview PDF.ReferencesAaker, David A.

Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"

"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."
