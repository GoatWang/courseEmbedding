IN SITU TREATMENT OF SEED IN FURROW



Publication number:  20170181433
                                            

Abstract:  Methods, systems, and kits are provided for in situ seed treatment with liquid crop benefit compositions at planting in furrow.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Application
                                            

Filed: 
                        December 8, 2016
                    

Publication date: 
                                                        June 29, 2017
                        

Inventor:

Fluid bed coking process with decoupled coking zone and stripping zone



Patent number:  9670417
                                            

Abstract:  A fluid coking unit for converting a heavy oil feed to lower boiling products by thermal has a centrally-apertured annular baffle at the top of the stripping zone below the coking zone to inhibit recirculation of solid particles from the stripping zone to the coking zone. By inhibiting recirculation of the particles from the stripping zone to the coking zone, the temperatures of the two zones are effectively decoupled, enabling the coking zone to be run at a lower temperature than the stripping zone to increase the yield of liquid products.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Grant

Systems and methods for processing data flows



Patent number:  9525696
                                            

Abstract:  A flow processing facility, which uses a set of artificial neurons for pattern recognition, such as a self-organizing map, in order to provide security and protection to a computer or computer system supports unified threat management based at least in part on patterns relevant to a variety of types of threats that relate to computer systems, including computer networks. Flow processing for switching, security, and other network applications, including a facility that processes a data flow to address patterns relevant to a variety of conditions are directed at internal network security, virtualization, and web connection security. A flow processing facility for inspecting payloads of network traffic packets detects security threats and intrusions across accessible layers of the IP-stack by applying content matching and behavioral anomaly detection techniques based on regular expression matching and self-organizing maps.
