 Educational Background



 


Southern New Hampshire University

                  Since its founding in 1932, Southern New Hampshire University has strived
to provide a comprehensive and fulfilling postsecondary experience. The
university has expanded significantly in the past 25 years, adding extra
student housing, several academic and administrative buildings, and even
more graduate degree programs.

In total, SNHU’s academics consist of over 110 programs of study, from
associate’s degrees to doctorates. Its unique Community Economic
Development program is especially renowned. Recently, Southern New
Hampshire began offering a Ph.D. in Community Economic Development, in
addition to the master’s program that had been in place.

Southern New Hampshire makes every effort to keep tuition affordable.
Eligible students receive financial aid, and the school also offers a
number of programs to lessen its students’ financial burden. The SNHU
Advantage Program enables you to earn your associate’s degree while
saving 60% in tuition, and 3-year bachelor’s degree programs can save you
thousands.

Because college should be about much more than studying, SNHU offers a
rich and diverse student life. With over 50 student organizations, you’re
sure to find something you enjoy. SHNU also participates in NCAA Division
II athletics, with 16 varsity sports teams.

University of Portland


                  The University has been ranked 19 years consecutively in the top ten for western regional universities by U.S. News & World Report, and in Barron’s Best Buys as one of the best teaching universities in the West. It also has been ranked by Bloomberg BusinessWeek as the best return on investment for any university in Oregon and for five consecutive years has been on the President’s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll.
The University of Portland was founded in September 1901 by Portland Archbishop Alexander Christie, who had purchased property atop Waud’s Bluff with financial assistance from the Congregation of Holy Cross in South Bend, Indiana. Archbishop Christie named the school “Columbia University” after the mighty river that flowed nearby, and when it opened its doors, it was staffed with priests from the archdiocese.
In  2012, the University of Portland was named the top producer of Fulbright scholars in the nation among “master’s universities” for the third consecutive year, according to the Chronicle of Higher Education. The University had 16 alumni win the prestigious grants to work and study abroad over the past two years.
