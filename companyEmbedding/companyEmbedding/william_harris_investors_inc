Veridiam, Inc. Expands Health Care Market Capabilities with 
      Acquisitions of Allied Swiss Screw and Point Technologies






WHI Capital Partners Company Completes 2nd 
      and 3rd Medical Acquisitions in 
      Past 12 Months






September 19, 2007 01:54 PM Eastern Daylight Time



SAN DIEGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Veridiam, Inc., a major manufacturer of precision metal components and 
      WHI Capital Partners portfolio company, has acquired California-based 
      Allied Swiss Screw Inc. (Allied) and Costa Rica-based Point Technologies 
      (Point Tech). Allied and Point Tech each produce contract components 
      manufactured to customer specifications primarily for medical and dental 
      markets.
    


“These acquisitions address the rapidly 
      growing demand within health care markets for Veridiam’s 
      precision manufacturing solutions,” said 
      Veridiam CEO Neal Nordstrom. “Veridiam’s 
      ultimate goal is to serve as a world-class, one-stop metals fabricator 
      for all medical equipment companies.”


      Allied, based in Oceanside, Calif., provides precision machining 
      services, manufacturing small, ultra-precision machined components, 
      surgical tools and assemblies for the dental, medical and aerospace 
      markets. The company primarily serves the dental components market, 
      manufacturing thousands of different dental parts and instruments 
      including dental implants, abutments, screws, drills, taps and various 
      instruments including torque wrenches.
    

      Point Tech offers custom precision machining services to the medical and 
      semi-conductor industries. Its manufacturing capabilities are supported 
      by its fleet of CNC machining centers and custom-designed 
      electrochemical etching stations. Founded in 1997 in Boulder, Colo., 
      Point Tech relocated to Costa Rica to better serve customer needs in a 
      lower cost environment. Point Tech currently employs more than 100 
      people and occupies 14,000 sq. ft. of office and production space in San 
      Jose, Costa Rica.
    

“Precision, quality and responsiveness are the 
      driving forces behind Veridiam’s success,” 
      said Eric Cohen, WHI Capital Partners managing director. “Combining 
      Allied’s precision manufacturing techniques 
      and Point Tech’s highly skilled, yet lower 
      cost facilities allows Veridiam to offer a unique set of outsourcing 
      solutions to its medical device customers. There are tremendous organic 
      growth opportunities for Veridiam while it aggressively pursues its 
      targeted acquisition strategy.”

Philanthropy


 
 
Among the most fundamental values espoused by the Harris family are citizenship, service, and philanthropy. Over the last fifty years these values have inspired the Harris family’s charitable activities, and also have shaped the culture and capabilities of the Harris Family Office. Today at William Harris Investors, our team spends considerable time assisting our clients with almost every aspect of their philanthropic pursuits.
 
This includes: managing the assets of a wide range of non-profit organizations and private family foundations; assisting our clients with the development of estate plans with significant charitable components; establishing and advising new charitable entities and private foundations; coordinating grant-making efforts; and assisting clients in the design and implementation of dynamic, long-term plans in order to achieve their philanthropic goals.
 
Owing to the increasing complexity of tax regulations, and to the differential (tax and investment) treatment afforded to certain non-profit and charitable entities, we recognize the critical importance of understanding the unique opportunities available to foundations, charitable trusts, and other tax-advantaged non-profit entities, as well as the restrictions that often limit their activities.
 
All philanthropic plans are not created equal. At WHI we pride ourselves on our ability to bring together best practices in the tax, legal, and investment management areas, so as to ensure that our clients’ philanthropic plans are: (1) thoughtfully conceived; (2) mindful of a wide array of tax, legal, and portfolio management considerations; and (3) nimble enough to provide for flexibility in a constantly changing world.

Risk Management

 
 
Through the last five decades, our clients have come to count upon us not only to provide them with a broad spectrum of financial and wealth services, but also to shield them from harm. Today, among our greatest responsibilities is that of anticipating and mitigating risk on behalf of our clients.
 
Risks come in all shapes and sizes. Many of these risks are relatively obvious and lend themselves to straight-forward mitigation techniques. Some, however, are more veiled or complex, and require more  creative contingency planning.
 
Relatively obvious risks include permanent portfolio impairment, the failure to implement and maintain a proper estate plan, and exposure of personal assets to creditors. Less obvious risks may include health risks, the trustworthiness of household help, the robustness of one’s health insurance, or the potential for identity theft. Still other risks may be mitigated significantly by preventive measures, including educating our clients on many of the opportunities and responsibilities that accompany wealth.
 
At WHI, we see it as our responsibility to assist our clients in identifying potential sources of risk and uncertainty, and then, in a disciplined, thorough and methodical manner, implementing a broad spectrum of risk mitigation measures to reduce their exposure to sources of potential liability.
 
There are times when the best offense is a good defense. Precisely because so few things in life are certain, we see it as among our greatest responsibilities to ensure that our clients are protected from unnecessary exposure to risk.

About


 
 
William Harris Investors, Inc. (WHI) is a privately owned, Registered Investment Adviser that provides investment and wealth management services.  Initially founded in 1976 by Irving B. Harris to manage his own family’s capital, WHI became a Registered Investment Adviser in 1987.  Today, WHI invests in a broad array of investment strategies, including public and private equities, fixed income, venture capital, hedge funds and real estate.  The overall investment goal of WHI’s asset allocation process is to achieve attractive long-term, risk-adjusted returns while protecting capital during volatile markets.  Additionally, WHI provides clients with a broad range of professional and wealth management services, including financial planning, trust and estate services, cash management, accounting and administrative services, tax preparation, and a variety of philanthropic services.
 
In the pursuit of helping our clients achieve their financial objectives, WHI strives to maintain the high levels of integrity, loyalty, and excellence that Irving B. Harris expected when he began the company nearly half a century ago, and which enabled our founder to leave behind such a strong legacy of fairness, intelligence, and service for the benefit of others.
 
Second only to our insistence upon adhering to the very highest standards of honesty, integrity, and corporate citizenship is our devotion to building and maintaining an extremely high quality workforce. We recognize that the management of our clients’ assets is only as good as the quality of the trusted professionals we employ as stewards for our clients’ wealth; consequently, we have worked hard to align the interests of our employees and those of our clients, thereby giving them strong incentives to promote and protect the best interests of the people they serve.

Office History


 
 
William Harris & Company was established by William Harris in 1910 as a wholesale woolen jobber (selling wool fabric for garments), with its principal office in St. Paul, Minnesota. It continued with its primary line of business until William Harris’ death in 1953, at which point the woolen business was sold. The company’s name and corporate shell were retained by William’s oldest child, Irving.
 
In October of 1929, the Great Depression began with the crash of the U.S. stock market. This economic crisis continued well into the 1930s, and many families lost their life savings when the banks to which they had entrusted their assets failed.
 
In the wake of the Depression, people sought alternate means of safeguarding what remained of their financial assets. It was in this spirit that several friends and customers of William Harris who had lost faith in the banks came to him and asked him if he would be willing to safeguard their money for them. He was a highly trusted and well-regarded businessman, and they had more confidence in him than in the ailing financial institutions. 
 
Long after the liquidation of the woolen business, William Harris & Company continued to operate as a funds depository for, and a lender of capital to, members and close friends of the Harris family.
 
Beginning in the 1930s, William’s eldest son, Irving, was engaged in various business endeavors of his own, most notably the purchase of the Toni Company (a hair care company), which he and his brother bought, ran, and then sold to Gillette in 1948.  The wealth created from this sale allowed Irving to focus on his passion for managing investment assets.  In 1957 Irving became a partner of R.J. Levy and Company, a New York Stock Exchange firm headquartered in New York.  R.J. Levy eventually became the Harris Group, Inc. after Robert Levy’s death in 1962.
 
In 1975 Irving left the institutional investment counseling business to focus exclusively on managing his own family’s assets. A handful of the remaining partners at Harris group established Harris Associates, an investment counseling firm that has enjoyed considerable success since then.
 
In 1986, Irving’s family investment office adopted its current name – William Harris Investors, Inc. – in honor of Irving’s father.  In 1987 William Harris Investors, Inc. registered as an Investment Adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
 
Over the years, our office has expanded to keep pace with the expansion of Irving’s family and its asset base, and to accommodate the investment and wealth management needs of a select number of non-Harris family clients.

Portfolio Construction


 
 
At WHI, our investment management approach is predicated on the notion that a sensible asset allocation framework provides the basis for a properly constructed portfolio.
 
WHI’s Asset Allocation Committee is comprised of a handful of our most senior investment professionals who possess more than a century of collective investment experience. This committee conducts a quarterly asset allocation review, which is informed by the views of WHI’s investment teams as well as the outlooks of some of the most prominent institutions and astute investment managers globally.  From this review we establish our own prospective views of the market, including specific asset classes, geographies, and strategies where we expect there to be the potential for outsized returns and/or significant risks.
 
After overlaying upon this a quantitative framework to assess expectations for prospective correlations among asset classes, our team establishes a “Neutral” strategic asset allocation (for a typical, risk-neutral client), from which our team then defines more conservative and more aggressive portfolios as alternatives. We further tailor these allocation models to suit the specific goals and objectives of individual clients.
 
These models are modified, from time to time, to enable us to maintain longer-duration, balanced asset allocation targets while retaining the flexibility to make periodic tactical modifications to client accounts, thereby providing shorter-term opportunities to realize outsized yields.
 
We believe that this asset allocation process, along with a comprehensive understanding of a client’s needs, objectives, and constraints, will enable our team to design client portfolios that are properly balanced and likely to yield robust long-term investment returns while taking proper consideration of investment risks, liquidity constraints, and the client's current cash needs.
