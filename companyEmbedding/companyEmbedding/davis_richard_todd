History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Jamison. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are pleased with how our business performed during the third quarter. Even in the face of the FTC litigation, we saw growth across our cumulative ending member count and revenue. This reinforces the strength of our brand and further validates that our differentiated services that protect consumers from identity theft are highly valued.
Before I dive into the details of our third quarter, I am pleased to announce that LifeLock has reached agreement with both the staff of the Federal Trade Commission and representatives of a national class of consumers on a comprehensive settlement resolving outstanding litigation relating to our past marketing representations and information security program. These agreements are not yet final because the FTC staff recommendation to approve the settlement must still be approved by the Commission itself and a Federal Judge and the class action settlement will require review and approval by the court.
It is important to note that the proposed FTC settlement does not require us to change our current products, services, or business and information security practices, including in particular, our current marketing and advertising practices. In addition, there is no evidence that LifeLock has ever had its customers' data stolen and the FTC has not alleged otherwise. In light of these proposed settlements, LifeLock is accruing an additional $96 million in reserves, bringing the total reserve amount to $116 million. This includes a $3 million reserve for potential settlement with state attorneys general.

We look forward to turning the page on these issues. We believe that these agreements are in the best interest of shareholders, and if approved, will eliminate significant uncertainty for LifeLock. I'd like to thank LifeLock's employees for maintaining an unwavering focus on our mission to serve our customers as we address this matter.
In terms of the next steps for the proposed settlement, the agreement we have reached with the FTC staff is subject to final approval by the FTC Commission and the court. This afternoon, we have joined with the FTC in filing a joint motion with the court to stay the FTC litigation, while our settlement goes through the process of obtaining approval from the Commission and the court.
In terms of the class settlement, the Memorandum of Understanding will be submitted for the judge's preliminary approval and then would be subject to an objection period and hearing before gaining final approval. Because the Commission's approval is still pending, we cannot provide additional details at this time.
Now, let me turn my focus to our Q3 results. We are pleased that we were able to deliver our 42nd consecutive quarter of sequential growth in both revenue and cumulative ending members. While we exceeded our guidance for the quarter, as anticipated, we did feel an impact from the FTC actions on both new member acquisition and retention rates. Our member retention rate declined slightly to 86.6% in the quarter from 87.1% in the second quarter. This decline was primarily the result of a higher number of cancellations post the FTC announcement or the announcement of the FTC action.
Our quarterly gross new member additions were over 250,000 of a million. We did see some partners pull back or take a pause on some of their marketing initiatives and we also scaled back some of our marketing with partners, impacting our overall member acquisitions. We expect to see an ongoing impact over the next few quarters, but are hopeful that the proposed FTC and class action settlements will enable us to more effectively engage with our partners, an important part of our long-term growth.
We saw a continued pattern of strong adoption of our premium offerings with well over 40% of gross new members choosing either LifeLock Advantage, LifeLock Ultimate or LifeLock Ultimate Plus in the quarter. This represents the 11th consecutive quarter that over 40% of gross new members selected one of our premium offerings. On the Enterprise side of the business, we signed several new customers in the quarter including two large alternative lenders, and one of the leading small business marketplace lenders.
In addition, we expanded our relationships with several existing customers including one of our largest wireless carriers and two top 10 card issuers. On the organizational front, we are pleased to announce that Marco Wirasinghe joined the company in August, as Vice President of Consumer Applications. Marco is overseeing LifeLock's mobile division focusing on new and existing products in the safety, security and convenience space. Previously Marco served at Yahoo! where he led product management in mobile. We are also pleased that in August, as we previously announced, we were able to bring on BitYota's team of development data experts who are focusing on building out our consumer products.
In summary, while the last several months have been challenging with regulatory and legal distractions, it remains clear to us that we provide highly differentiated value to our members and believe we can now turn our complete focus back on our mission, protecting consumers from identity theft.
As a company, we have scaled our leadership team with the addition of Schwark Satyavolu, as our EVP of Product & Technology and particularly, in risk compliance and security with the addition of Ignacio Martinez as Chief Risk Officer and Neil Daswani, as Chief Information Security Officer. We have also strengthened our board and governance with the addition of Jaynie Miller Studenmund and the appointment of Roy Guthrie as Lead Independent Director.

We remain committed to continually improving our security architecture, operational processes, and marketing practices. We are in a strong financial position with ample cash balances and meaningful cash flow generation. I would also like to take a moment to thank our dedicated team of employees who over the last few months have continued to focus on executing their responsibilities at the highest level for our valued members.
Let me now turn the call over to Chris to walk you through the financials.
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Todd. Q3 total revenue was $152 million above our guidance of $147 million to $149 million and up 24% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Our Consumer business continued to power the overall business growing 25% year-over-year to $144.6 million. Gross new member adds during the quarter were 251,000 compared with 264,000 in the third quarter of last year as our year-over-year gross new member growth was impacted by the FTC announcement.
In terms of the monthly average revenue per member for Q3, we saw a 6% year-over-year growth to $11.91 driven by the continued success of our premium products. Our retention rate was 86.6% compared to 87.5% in Q3 of last year and 87.1% last quarter. We had expected our retention rate to decline due to the FTC announcement and the low renewal rates of the large – for each business signed during the first half of 2014. Overall, we are pleased with the loyalty of our members in the face of these headwinds. Revenue from the Enterprise segment was $7.3 million, up 10% sequentially and 6% year-over-year as ID Analytics continues to make progress, expanding the breadth and depth of its network.
Before I move down the income statement, I wanted to preface my comments by stating that my commentary will be focused on adjusted results, which for the quarter, exclude a total of $7.9 million of share compensation's expense, $2.1 million of amortization of acquired intangible assets, $5.7 million in cost associated with the FTC litigation, and $3.1 million of acquisition-related expenses. In addition, we are excluding $96 million from the proposed settlement with the FTC and class action including a $3 million reserve for potential settlement with the state attorneys general.
Adjusted gross margins grew by 230 basis points year-over-year to 77.9%. This was the ninth quarter in a row with a year-over-year improvement of over 100 basis points as we continued to see scale benefits from both our data partners and our infrastructure investments. Adjusted sales and marketing expenses were $61.6 million in the period compared to $51.1 million in Q3 of last year. This produced a cost of acquisition in the quarter of $237 compared to $184 in Q3 of 2014.
As reflected in our prior guidance, we saw a significant impact to our marketing effectiveness and COA post the announcement of the FTC litigation. In addition, some strategic partners reduced marketing initiatives in light of the FTC announcement. We continue to believe that the market opportunity is large and growing that is important to invest to drive awareness and growth for the long-term. With our strong retention rate and the continued market acceptance of our premium products, the lifetime value of our members remains healthy and validates the investment even at these COA levels.
Adjusted technology and development expenses were $13.9 million in the quarter, up from $11.5 million in the year ago period. Ongoing investments in product enhancements, security, infrastructure, and market research also contributed to the increase, and as we have discussed, you should expect us to continue on this path of investment.
Adjusted G&A expenses were $15.4 million in the quarter compared to $14.4 million in the year ago period. As a reminder, our adjusted G&A expenses now exclude costs associated with the FTC and related matters.

Overall, adjusted net income increased nearly 75% to $27.6 million in the third quarter compared to adjusted net income of $15.9 million in the year ago period. Adjusted net income per share in the third quarter was $0.28 based on $99.5 million shares compared to an adjusted income per share of $0.16 based on $98.1 million shares in Q3 of last year. This was above the high end of our guidance of adjusted net income per share of $0.25 to $0.26. Adjusted EBITDA was $29.8 million in Q3, driven by strong revenue performance compared to our $17.9 million in the third quarter of 2014. This was also above the high end of our guidance range.
Cash flow from operations for the quarter were $20.8 million compared to $26.1 million in the third quarter of last year. After taking into consideration $4.1 million of capital expenditures and the cash impact of $1.6 million in FTC litigation expenses, this drove free cash flow of $18.4 million. These results compare to $3.5 million of CapEx and free cash flow of $22.7 million in the year ago period. Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by the $3.1 million BitYota acquisition-related expenses and lower gross new member additions which affected deferred revenue.
We ended the third quarter with $332.2 million in cash and marketable securities compared to $326 million at the end of the second quarter. Our quarter ending cash balance was impacted by $15.9 million we paid to acquire the team from BitYota. We expect to use cash from our balance sheet to pay for the proposed settlement.
Turning to our fourth quarter and full year guidance, as Todd mentioned the impacts from the FTC on gross new member additions and retention rates are expected to continue for a few more quarters and will have an impact on our reported results. In addition, as we turn the page and move forward, we plan to continue to invest in security and product development to ensure that we provide the best protection to our members. We also look to maintain our strong brand advantage through continued spend in marketing. We believe these are the right steps to take for our long-term success.
It's also important to note that from a high-level perspective, we remain positive about our long-term prospects and that we will move past the current impacts to our business over time. We have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet and we continue to expect the company to generate meaningful revenue growth, cash flow and profitability going forward.
With that background, we are updating our full year 2015 guidance as follows: We are raising our total revenue guidance which is now expected to be in the range of $584 million to $586 million, above our previous range of $577 million to $582 million.
Adjusted net income per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $0.61 to $0.63 based on approximately 100 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding compared to our most recent guidance of $0.58 to $0.61. This guidance assumes a 5% cash tax rate.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $71 million to $73 million compared to our prior guidance of $70 million to $73 million. Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $95 million to $100 million compared to our prior range of $100 million to $105 million as a result of the $3.1 million in acquisition cost and the impact to deferred revenue from lower gross new member additions.
For the December quarter, we are initiating guidance as follows: Total revenue is expected to be in the range of $153 million to $155 million. Adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.28 to $0.30 based on approximately 101 million fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding. And finally, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $32 million to $34 million.

In summary, we're pleased to have reached a proposed settlement with both the FTC and consumer class. We continue to perform well under difficult circumstances further reinforcing the value that LifeLock delivers to consumers. Our entire management team and employee base are focused on delivering an outstanding service to our members.
And with that, we like to open the call up for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. The first question comes from David Hynes of Canaccord. Please go ahead.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Hey thanks, guys. Good news in the settlement. A couple of questions along those lines. Todd, how would you handicap the likelihood of this settlement being final? Is it 75% likely, is it 95% likely, just help us think about the possibility of outcomes from here?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. While I wouldn't put a percentage on it, I would certainly tell you we don't have any reason to believe that the Commission or the court would not approve the proposed settlement that we worked so closely with staff and the plaintiff attorneys to arrive at.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay, got it. And then with the additional reserves, which I guess now comes to a total of $115 million. Does that cover the entirety of the proposed agreed-upon settlement?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, certainly for this reserve, we're taking into account the agreed-upon terms of both the class and the FTC settlement. And then we place the reserve of $3 million of that with potential conclusion with the state attorneys general. So we have executed the proposed agreements that'll have to be approved, but of course our reserving practices are consistent with all that GAAP accounting rules. And beyond that, because we'll have to wait for the Commission's approval, I really can't give you more details on that.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Okay. And then, I guess, you guys really haven't talked about the details of the investigation or the litigation at all. The question we got, if you're willing to pay $115 million (21:30) as a settlement, there's clearly some admission of guilt somewhere along the lines. That begs the question, what was LifeLock guilty of? And what has changed since then that kind of rectifies the current business practices which you say were obviously unaffected?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I would just reiterate that while this agreement does not require LifeLock to admit or deny anything – and from a wrongdoing perspective, it doesn't require us to change any of our current practices too. So whether that's products, services, business and information security, but most in particular our current marketing and advertising practices require no changes.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.
Yeah. Got it, okay. That's helpful on FTC stuff. Maybe just one fundamental and then I'll pass the line. Can you talk about, kind of, Q4 marketing plans now that this is in the rear view of the particular channels that you plan to pursue more aggressively, or historically Q4 has been a period where you've reined back a bit on marketing spend? Does that change at all with the timing of the resolution here or just how you're thinking about that?
Hilary A. Schneider - President
Yeah. This is Hilary. As we look at Q4, I would say you won't see any material changes in terms of the mix. Recognize then it each quarter we are experimenting and documenting what we can do as we think about incrementally improving our overall app efficiency and effectiveness, and we will continue to invest in Q4.
David E. Hynes - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.

Got it, okay. Thank you guys for all the color; appreciate it.
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Thanks, C.J. (sic) [David].

The next question comes from Nandan Amladi of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. So, I guess, further on this settlement. Since you've agreed that there's no change necessary to your marketing and product practices, where do you now focus your R&D efforts, as well as your security efforts. You've touched on this a little bit in the script, but perhaps you can provide a little more detail on where your dollars are going to be focused heading into 2016?
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Nandan. I would tell you that we've made these investments along the way. So again, I'd reiterate where you really see it, most investing in the caliber of the talent that we brought onto the organization. As I mentioned in the names in the beginning of the call, the Schwark Satyavolus, the Neil Daswanis, the Ignacio Martinez really allowing us to look at both our product, the technologies, and our overall practices.
All those allow us that in conjunction with of course Ty Shay, who came on early in the year as our Chief Marketing Officer. We're really excited to allow everybody to go focus back on product development really responding to the consumers' needs and continue to elevate our position as the premier product in the category.
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
And, Nandan, I think I'd add to that is I think we've said for quite a while that technology development which is where our product and infrastructure and security investments are, is one of the line items that you're not going to see scale. So, I don't think this is necessarily a major shift, but nonetheless a continuation of a trend of us looking to continue to invest in these areas.
Nandan G. Amladi - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.
Thank you.

The next question comes from Scott Zeller of Needham & Company. Please go ahead.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC
Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on a strong performance in the headwinds. Regarding the news of the FTC, can you help us understand the language that's being used? So I'm looking on the Business Wire and they're using the words preliminary settlement right now, and as I look at your press release, I think the word used is agreement. So can you help us with which terminology we should be using to describe the discussions you've had?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. The key to that Scott is, while we're in agreement with the FTC staff, and with the class action attorneys, it won't be final until the FTC staff recommendation to approve those settlements is formally approved by the Commission itself. And then of course the class action settlement will require review and approval by a court. So we're all in agreement on those terms. The staff is making the recommendation to the commissioners to approve this agreement, but it needs to complete its process. That's why other people talk about pending.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. And can you tell us which group actually took the action to go to court? Was it the FTC staff or was it the Commission leaders that made that decision to move to go into court?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, what I would tell you is, they work on their side while we had fully anticipated reaching some sort of agreement previously. Unfortunately, we just were unable to do that. So both sides, at that point in time, could not arrive at amenable results for both. And so the next process, the next step in the process was the starting of the litigation. But of course now, we're extremely pleased that we were able to reach that agreement, find amendable terms to both sides and be able to put this matter hopefully very soon behind us.

Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. And can you tell us what's changed now? You referenced before the earlier negotiations you'd had with the agency, Todd. What's different now from when you last accrued for what you thought was going to be a settlement at that time versus this discussion now and your decision to accrue again? Can you describe the difference in those conversations and what gives you greater confidence now?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, certainly one key element is that this is a comprehensive settlement. So not just with the staff of the FTC, but also to include this class action that was being taken, that actually has even some broader time period and a broader audience to it. So the fact that we can bring all of that together into the comprehensive settlement that we announced today. That's the key difference in this resolution than what we have been talking about previously.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC
Okay. And then one question on the fundamentals, when you mentioned in the prepared remarks about the impact to partners, and I think you used the word pause, what does that essentially do for those of us on the other end of the line here in the field? Does that mean that as partners take a pause, the burden has increased on LifeLock to drive more traffic, more leaves, et cetera and that's why we saw the cost of acquisition increase because the burden was increasingly on you to spend rather than partners?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think for both. The burden is really on us that we want to make sure that we're a great partner to them. And that there's no, again, uncertainty in the market or what LifeLock – what we're producing and at what caliber we can deliver that. So this would really allow us to give certainty to our partner channels as they launch their marketing campaigns, as they talk to their populations that respect them and have an affinity to those groups, they can speak confidently about LifeLock who we are, and with certainty that we brought this matter to a closure and there is hopefully not going to be any unexpected surprises associated with the future, so to continue to reinforce their confidence in us.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC
So just to clarify that pause did not mean an increase in spend out of your own pocket necessarily. It was more of a waiting for them to feel comfortable working with LifeLock?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, and to launch campaigns that may have been planned, so some of the things that may have been considered in the works, some of our partners may have decided to pause to get that better certainty in the market before they launched marketing campaigns on their behalf.
Scott Zeller - Needham & Co. LLC
Great. Thank you.
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Scott.

The next question comes from Scott Shiao of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Scott S. Shiao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Hi. So I wanted to ask about the GNMs, the lower GNMs during the quarter. Was it more because of the partners pulling back, that sort of effect, or is it the overall kind of effect that the advertising was lower?
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
It was actually a combination of the two but the actually impact from the partners was the larger of the two impacts. As Todd referenced in his answers to the questions and his prepared remarks, we did had some of those partners pull back some. Perhaps delay some various marketing programs. We did see an impact to direct marketing side as well, but the larger impact was on the partner side of the business.
Scott S. Shiao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And how long do you see this effect persisting?

Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
I think it's a situation where we're going to, first of all these partners need to get comfortable with our settlement. And as we said, it's going to take a few quarters as we continue to gain that confidence back, and those partners continue to look to invest with us as well as convincing new partners to come onboard, so we think that this is a very, very positive first step in that process.
Scott S. Shiao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay, got it. And so then, the mix – and then you also mentioned 40% of the GNMs were premium. Was that due more to Advantage or Ultimate Plus?
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
I think we've continued to see the trend that's been consistent since we launched the products back over a year ago, which is that first of all, over 40% mark we continue to the above those levels and we're very pleased, in spite of the fact that we raised the prices relative to the prior products by about $5 dollars per month each. So even with those increases we continue to see over 40% and we continue to see the trend that there are more Ultimate Plus than Advantage within that premium mix.
Scott S. Shiao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. And then, the last question I had was that you mentioned that that LTV customers had changed. I guess it's presumed a little bit lower. Are we thinking 20%, lower 10%. How do we go about thinking about how the LTV – how the customers have changed?
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
I think the overall LTV, I think what you saw is just a continuation, first of all, of the growth in ARPU which we're very pleased with how consistently we've been able to drive that ARPU up over time. It's been 6% or more on a year-over-year basis for over five years now. So certainly, as those premium products continue to penetrate the base, we'll continue to see the lifetime value of our members moving up.
There was a slight impact as we mentioned in terms of the retention rate being slightly lower overall, but certainly more than offset by the increase in ARPU. I think where you would see it is in the COA that we reported and a piece of that is the fact that partner channel where we saw a little bit of a larger impact is typically the lower COA channel. And so when we see a little lower performance or a little lower growth within that channel, that tends to take the overall COA up over time. But in terms of the LTV of the members, we are continuing to be very, very pleased with the unit economics that we've been able to exhibit, and we really haven't seen a big change from an LTV perspective.
Scott S. Shiao - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Scott.

The next question comes from Dan Bergstrom of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Dan Bergstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. That's great news that there's no changes in the marketing message, no changes are needed there. That being said, how is the marketing message evolved? What are you emphasizing more than before perhaps where you see it going?
Hilary A. Schneider - President
Yeah. So, we do continue to test and iterate our marketing message. You may have noticed we have a new long form TV commercial in the marketplace. In that, we really are emphasizing the complete nature of what identity theft protection means from the alerting all the way through the remediation in terms of the idea that you are fully protected. We have based some of the changes in our messaging around our latest consumer research in terms of where there may be confusion in the marketplace. And helping people, once again, understand what identity protection really means in its complete nature, which just to remind you, we are the market-leading brand and we want to continue to educate the market to bring them along as their awareness of issues arise and they're looking for solutions.

Dan Bergstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC
Thanks. And then, perhaps, could you talk a little bit more about the BitYota team acquisition and what they are bringing to the table?
Hilary A. Schneider - President
Absolutely. We're absolutely thrilled to be onboarding the BitYota team. That is a team, as we've talked about our investments, as we continue to differentiate ourselves as a product-driven company that really understands the consumer needs, that BitYota team in particular has expertise in large scale data processing. So as you think about the massive amounts of data that we bring together and that we then create platforms in order to alert consumers effectively and quickly, it's really around thinking about scaling our abilities and coming up with new ways to surprise and delight our customers.
Dan Bergstrom - RBC Capital Markets LLC

The next question comes from Joe Maxa of Dougherty & Company. Please go ahead.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Thank you, and also congrats on that initial agreement. I was wondering if you could give us a little color on how the business has looked in Q4 so far as compared to Q3. Has it improved, has it got worse, has it maybe, I am thinking, maybe improved after the initial new FTC lawsuit?
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
So I don't think we're prepared to comment on performance in the quarter so far. Certainly, that's reflected in our guidance overall. And given that it's been about 40 minutes since we announced the settlement, I think we'll take a little more time to kind of gauge where we're going overall with that, Joe.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. And then on this proposed or potential settlement, do you have a idea how long that may take to become final, with kind of a best guess or timeframe that you're thinking about?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. Well, that's probably really a question for the Commission. So we have every hope that the settlement will be approved, and we hope it will be done expeditiously. But it's our understanding that in the general course, the FTC approval process can take anywhere from a few weeks to a couple of months.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Okay. So perhaps by year-end?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Perhaps. And certainly, we hope it expeditiously.
Joe Maxa - Dougherty & Co. LLC
Yeah. Okay, thanks guys.

The next question comes from Robert Breza of Wunderlich Securities. Please go ahead.
Rob Breza - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Hi, and again congratulations on getting this milestone put behind you. Just quickly, Todd, I think – how do you think about the Enterprise business, obviously maybe some of the Enterprise customers were reluctant to, or in your words, paused. How should we think about the Enterprise growth going forward into next year?
Richard Todd Davis - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. So, I certainly think we've been able to still announce even through this process growth with partnership, new signing. We've seen nice growth on the employee benefit side of the world with both broker networks and employer groups that are choosing LifeLock in this age of the mega data breach. We're certainly seeing that kind of interest. So we see this as being a critical part of our long-term strategy. And I think now that we've been able to address this, give certainty to the market, it will really allow them to focus on what's the next marketing campaigns, what can we go do together to allow some of the folks who are evaluating LifeLock as a partner, to be able to make those decisions with certainty in the market and without the overhang that we've had to date.

Rob Breza - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Great. And then maybe one quick follow-up question. Chris, how should we think about the customer acquisition cost? I mean, as we think about it maybe year-on-year or quarter-on-quarter going forward, I would assume we should start to expect that trend to come down a little bit, but could you just talk generally to how the trend should be around customer acquisition cost?
Christopher G. Power - Chief Financial Officer
Sure, Rob. So first of all I'd just remind everybody we do manage the business by lifetime value, right. So the cost of acquisition is really going to be driven by the quality of the members we're bringing on board, and clearly, a higher LTV member we'd be willing to pay a higher COA. So we're always going to have a level of variability associated with COA, kind of, from a quarter-to-quarter basis based on the mix of the types of members we're bringing on board. But we would, as we discussed with seeing the partner channel, will take a little bit of time to fully return to the levels that we've seen. And as a result, since that is typically the lower cost of acquisition channel, that will likely take us a few quarters to work through the system.
Rob Breza - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.
Great. Thanks.

LifeLock CEO's Identity Stolen 13 Times | WIRED




LifeLock CEO's Identity Stolen 13 TimesSubscribeSearchPhotoVideoBackchannelMagazineWired InsiderGet Our NewsletterWIRED's biggest stories, delivered to your inbox.submitAuthor: Kim ZetterKim Zettersecurity05.18.1002:37 pmLifeLock CEO's Identity Stolen 13 TimesSharesharetweetcommentemailAuthor: Kim ZetterKim Zettersecurity05.18.1002:37 pmLifeLock CEO's Identity Stolen 13 TimesApparently, when you publish your Social Security number prominently on your website and billboards, people take it as an invitation to steal your identity.LifeLock CEO Todd Davis, whose number is displayed in the company's ubiquitous advertisements, has by now learned that lesson. He's been a victim of identity theft at least 13 times, according to the Phoenix New Times.That's 12 more times than has previously been known.In June 2007, Threat Level reported that Davis had been the victim of identity theft after someone used his identity to obtain a $500 loan from a check-cashing company. Davis discovered the crime only after the company called his wife's cellphone to recover the unpaid debt.About four months after that story published, Davis' identity was stolen again by someone in Albany, Georgia, who opened an AT&T/Cingular wireless account using his Social Security number (.pdf), according to a police report obtained by the New Times. The perpetrator racked up $2,390 in charges on the account, which remained unpaid. Davis, whose real name according to police reports is Richard Todd Davis, only learned a year later that his identity had been stolen again after AT&T handed off the debt to a collection agency and a note appeared on his credit report.Then last year, Davis discovered seven more fraudulent accounts on his credit report that were opened with his personal information and have outstanding debt, according to the police report.Someone opened a Verizon account in New York, leaving an unpaid bill of at least $186. An account at Centerpoint Energy, a Texas utility, was delinquent $122. Credit One Bank was owed $573, and Swiss Colony, a gift-basket company, was seeking $312.In addition to these amounts, Davis's credit report showed five collection agencies were seeking other sums from accounts opened in his name: Bay Area Credit was pursuing $265; Associated Credit Services was seeking two debts in the amount of $207 and $213; Enhanced Recovery Corporation was chasing $250 and $381.A spokeswoman for the Albany police, who investigated the AT&T/Cingular account but never made any arrest, told the New Times that Davis' publication of his Social Security number created more victims than just himself."It's unfortunate he chose to conduct business in that way," spokeswoman Phyllis Banks said. "It's not fair to [AT&T] because they're losing a pretty substantial amount of money."LifeLock refused to discuss the issue with the New Times. The company did not respond to a request for comment from Threat Level.The company was fined $12 million in March by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.Lifelock promised in ads that its $10 monthly service would protect consumers from identity theft. The company also offered a $1 million guarantee to compensate customers for losses incurred if they became a victim after signing up for the service. The FTC called the claims bogus and accused LifeLock of operating a scam."In truth, the protection they provided left such a large hole … that you could drive that truck through it," said FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to a LifeLock TV ad showing a truck painted with Davis's Social Security number driving around city streets.Davis' history as an identity-theft victim would seem to call into question the company's ability to protect consumers from a similar fate.See also:LifeLock Dinged $12 Million for Deceptive Business PracticesLifeLock Founder Resigns Amid ControversyPolice Say LifeLock Coerced Unusable Confession from Identity Theft SuspectLifelock Sued for Corporate Identity Theft#Crime#identity theftMost PopulargearGoodbye iPod, and Thanks for All the TunesAuthor: David PierceDavid PiercetransportationThe Tesla Model 3 Launches the Electric Vehicle MarketAuthor: Aarian MarshallAarian MarshallbusinessOur Minds Have Been Hijacked by Our Phones.

History[edit]
LifeLock was co-founded in 2005 by Robert J. Maynard and Todd Davis. Amid controversy, Maynard left the company in 2007.[5][6]
In December 2008, LifeLock entered into an agreement with TransUnion, one of the three main credit bureaus, to automate the process of alerting customers of potential unauthorized access via their credit reports.[7] LifeLock acquired ID Analytics following a round of funding in March 2012.[8] ID Analytics operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8]
Following the announcement of the company's IPO in August 2012, Hilary Schneider joined the company as president.[9] Schneider had previously been working with TPG Capital after leaving Yahoo in 2010.[9]
In December 2013, LifeLock acquired Lemon Wallet for $42.6 million.[10][11] Lemon is a digital wallet platform which stores payment, loyalty, and identification cards on members' smartphones.[12] Lemon Wallet Plus was a premium service which offered lost wallet service, account monitoring, and some security measures. Wallet Plus has been folded into a new service offered by LifeLock which includes identity fraud alerts.[12] The company temporarily removed the app from mobile stores in May 2014 when the company learned that certain parts of the app were not in compliance with payment industry standards.[13]
As of February 2014, LifeLock had 3 million subscribers.[14]
In July 2015, CNN reported that FTC and 35 United State Attorneys General deemed LifeLock in violation of a previous settlement with the Federal Trade Commission.[15] In November 2016, Symantec announced its intent to acquire LifeLock for $2.3 billion.[16]
ID Analytics, Inc.[edit]
In March 2012, ID Analytics, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of LifeLock.[8] ID Analytics was founded in 2002.[17] It provides consumer risk management with real-time consumer behavior insights and in-depth visibility into identity risk and creditworthiness.[18] Both government agencies and U.S. companies utilize ID Analytics for risk based decision making on revenue enhancement, fraud reduction, cost saving drivers and customer protection.[17]
Funding[edit]
The company started with $2 million in seed funding, with another $5 million in its Series A funding in 2006 from Bessemer Ventures.[19][20]
In April 2007, LifeLock raised $6 million in its series B funding from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.[19] The following January, its Series C Funding ended with $25 million, led by Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.[21] In August 2009, a series D funding round raised $40 million for the company.[22] LifeLock raised $100 million in new equity funding from Bessemer Ventures Partners, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Symantec Corporation and River Street Management in March 2012.[23] The funds were used towards the acquisition of ID Analytics, an identity theft risk prediction technology.[8]
On August 28, 2012, LifeLock announced its plans to take its identity theft protection business public and filed for an initial public offering worth up to $175 million.[24] On October 3, the company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol LOCK, according to its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.[25]
Product[edit]
LifeLock offers Standard, Advantage, Ultimate Plus and Junior monitoring services. LifeLock Standard offers identity theft detection and alerts within its network, lost wallet protection, address change verification, black market website surveillance and reduced pre-approved credit card offers.[26] LifeLock Advantage contains everything in the Standard plan plus fictitious identity monitoring, court record scanning, and an online annual credit score and report and credit monitoring alerts through Equifax. LifeLock Ultimate Plus includes bank account takeover alerts within its network, enhanced credit application alerts and online credit reports and scores on top of the Standard and Advantage features.[27][28] Its Junior protection provides identity theft detection and alerts, credit file verification, black market website surveillance and file sharing network searches.[29]
LifeLock provides a $1 million guarantee in the event of identity theft.[30] The guarantee is that LifeLock will spend up to $1,000,000 on legal and associated fees necessary in restoring a customer's identity. The guarantee does not cover the direct losses such a customer incurs from identity theft or pay restitution to them for money lost.[30][31]
Marketing[edit]
LifeLock has partnered with major banks, national corporations and has celebrity endorsers.[32] In addition to sponsoring NPR programming,[citation needed] LifeLock advertises heavily on the Internet and radio; its ads can be heard on the radio shows of Paul Harvey, Rush Limbaugh, Adam Carolla, Kim Komando, and Charles Osgood.[33] Celebrity spokespersons for LifeLock have included Howard Stern, Paul Harvey, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh.[34]
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a spokesman and was featured in the company's TV commercials in 2013.[35] LifeLock entered a cross-promotional partnership with Universal Pictures in its 2013 movie Identity Thief.[36]
Affiliations[edit]
LifeLock sponsored the NASCAR Chicagoland Speedway LifeLock.com 400 Sprint Cup Series race from 2008 to 2010.[37][38][39]
In June 2009, it announced a sponsorship agreement with the Women's National Basketball Association's Phoenix Mercury. The sponsorship launched the first branded jersey in the Women's National Basketball Association and lasted through 2013.[40]
LifeLock has an ongoing [clarification needed] relationship with American Airlines via their AAdvantage program[41] as well as a partnership program with Northrop Grumman.[42]
LifeLock's advertising agency of record is Lowe Campbell Ewald.[43][44] In January 2014, LifeLock announced a new television commercial, called "Do Your Thing", and a redesigned company logo.[45]
Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Starting in 2010, LifeLock has partnered with the FBI-LEEDA (Law Enforcement Executive Development Association) to provide educational seminars to law enforcement officials on identity theft.[46] The seminars occur multiple times a year in various regions throughout the United States. In February 2014, the company partnered with the National Parent Teacher Association (PTA) with the goals of helping kids learn safe online habits.[47]
In April 2014, the company entered into partnership with Vivint to offer home and identity protection together.[48]
Controversies[edit]
Robert J. Maynard, Jr., a co-founder of the company, resigned in June 2007 amid questions about his past and the integrity of his story regarding his founding of LifeLock.[49] Maynard spent several days in a Maricopa County Jail in 2003 because of an alleged unpaid $16,000 casino marker from The Mirage. Under Nevada law, casino markers are considered the same as checks. Maynard reportedly came up with the plan for LifeLock while sitting in his jail cell. An investigation by the Phoenix New Times revealed that the $16,000 casino marker actually was his. The Mirage had gotten a copy of his Arizona driver's license when it made him the loan, and charges were dropped after Maynard repaid the marker. The New Times found that Maynard had been banned for life from the credit-repair industry after an agency he owned was shut down for numerous deceptive practices. It found evidence he ordered an American Express card in his father's name and ran up $150,000 in fraudulent charges. Maynard no longer has any affiliation with LifeLock.[5][6]
Also in 2007, co-founder Todd Davis publicly posted his Social Security number, 457-55-5462, as part of an ad campaign to promote the company's identity theft protection services. Davis was a victim of 13 cases of identity theft between 2007 and 2008.[50][51] Regarding the campaign, Davis said, "We were trying to make the point that … all it takes is one data breach. The point of that campaign was to take proactive steps to protect your identity."[14]
In February 2008, the credit information company Experian sued LifeLock for fraud and false advertising. Experian alleged that LifeLock placed false fraud alerts on behalf of its clients, thus keeping LifeLock clients' files in a constant state of alert.[52][52][53] As part of a 2009 settlement, LifeLock set up a new proprietary service that does not rely on setting fraud alerts.[54]
In March 2010, LifeLock was fined $12 million by the Federal Trade Commission for deceptive advertising.[55] The FTC called the company's prior marketing claims misleading to consumers by claiming to be a 100% guarantee against all forms of identity theft.[56]
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz, referring to the LifeLock TV ad showing the truck, said that "the protection they provided left such a large hole ... that you could drive that truck through it."[50] LifeLock agreed to pay $12 million to settle charges, by the FTC and 35 states, that the company's identity theft prevention and data security claims were false.[57]
In 2015, the FTC found LifeLock to be in contempt of the 2010 agreement, charging that they "failed to establish and maintain a comprehensive information security program", and "falsely advertised that it protected consumers' sensitive data". The FTC obtained a $100 million monetary penalty against LifeLock to settle the contempt charge.[58] Of that fine, $68 million is to be held for class-action refunds to LifeLock customers.[59]

The acting is competent.Joan Collins does her best as an also-ran love interest, but she is lumbered with that 'girls-are-made-to-look-pretty-and-be-kissed' 1950s-woman kind of character.Bette Davis gives her all,& now and again makes the sparks fly. As Elizabeth her gait is very manly.  Whether this was due to a very cumbersome costume, or to a thoroughly mistaken idea of what Elizabeth was actually like, I cannot say. Certainly Elizabeth's contemporaries - friend and foe - described the Queen as graceful even in old age, when she had lost her hair and her teeth & her fine skin.I would describe this as a Sunday afternoon film.  Suitable for passing an hour or so after a good meal, and made - it would seem - with no more than a Sunday afternoon's thought: unimaginative and pedestrian.The actors do their best with stagey direction and excessively clear lighting.Perhaps we now know too much about these historic figures; so many recent television series have made them familiar, warts and all.Read more0Comment|

It's been two months since the feds tried to gut LifeLock with a $12 million penalty for deceptive advertising, and the company's Web site still boasts that it can protect people from identity theft.The Tempe-based company has spent millions of dollars since 2006 on ads that broadcast CEO Todd Davis' Social Security number. Customers pay $10 to $15 a month for the supposed protection — and for LifeLock's "$1 million guarantee" if the protection fails.On one LifeLock Web page, www.todddavislifelock.com, active until early May, Davis stated that he's "absolutely confident LifeLock is protecting my good name and personal information, just like it will yours."

But the evidence shows that he shouldn't be the slightest bit confident in LifeLock's ability to protect his name or personal data.In June 2007, in the wake of a New Times article that exposed how LifeLock was founded with lies, news leaked that Davis had become the victim of identity theft. A man in Texas had used Davis' ID to take out a $500 loan, and Davis didn't know about it until the unpaid account went to a collection agency.In the following months, Davis and LifeLock worked hard to spin the story into something positive. Davis claimed in an interview with MSNBC in May 2008 that the Texas incident was the one and only time anything like that had ever happened to him.Another LifeLock page dedicated to Todd Davis, (www.lifelock.com/todd-davis) claimed (until it, like the other Davis page, was removed by LifeLock on May 4 following inquiries by New Times) that Davis "has looked to LifeLock for protection after an identity theft . . . but only once, and LifeLock was there to help."New Times has learned, though, that the Texas incident wasn't a fluke.In October 2007, a few months after news broke that Davis had become a victim, someone in Albany, Georgia, opened an AT&T wireless account using Davis' personal info, a Chandler police report shows. (See the PDF version of the report.)As Todd Davis tried to deflect the bad press in the wake of the Texas crime, the Albany resident was racking up hours on a cell phone in Davis' name.By the time AT&T cut off the person, he or she had amassed a large, unpaid bill. The amount with which AT&T was stuck wasn't disclosed, but in the fall of 2008, the phone company authorized a collection agency to try to recover a $2,390 debt.That's when LifeLock and Davis finally learned of the theft.A LifeLock employee reported the identity crime to Chandler police on November 21, 2008, while Todd Davis was traveling out of state.After a short time on the case, Chandler forwarded it to police in the Georgia city, which still is still investigating. Phyllis Banks, a spokeswoman for the Albany agency, tells New Times that investigators went to the address listed on the bill and interviewed a local woman, but no arrests had been made.When Albany investigators phoned Davis about the crime last year, "they were very familiar with him" and how he'd publicized his Social Security number, she says."It's unfortunate he chose to conduct business in that way," Banks says. "It's not fair to [AT&T] because they're losing a pretty substantial amount of money."Yet AT&T wasn't the only company getting screwed by LifeLock's advertising scheme — because plenty more criminals have made use of Davis' data.Records show that LifeLock representative Tamika Jones called the Chandler PD again in February 2009 to report a slew of fraudulent accounts opened in Davis' name.As with the AT&T account, the amounts owed on the fraudulent accounts were not revealed in the police report — only the amounts sought by various companies and collection agencies, listed below. Because these companies often forgive or waive a percentage of the bills of debtors, the dollar amount of the losses could easily be higher.More cell-phone service was fraudulently charged to Davis: Someone opened a Verizon account in New York, leaving behind unpaid bills of at least $186.An account at Centerpoint Energy, a Texas utility, was opened. At least $122 went unpaid.Fake Davises owe $573 to Credit One Bank and $312 to Swiss Colony, a gift-basket company.Two other accounts, one for USA Savings Bank and a Gap credit card, were opened successfully in Davis' name but showed zero balances as of early 2009.There were also multiple dings by collection agencies: Bay Area Credit, $265; two for Associated Credit Services, $207 and $213; and two for Enhanced Recovery Corporation, $250 and $381. Finally, there was a NCO/Fin 22 collection-agency account for $2,390, which could be the AT&T bill (considering the identical amount). Full details as to what happened with these accounts could not be obtained from Davis. But it's clear that criminals in different locales have used Davis' ID to obtain a host of loans, goods, and services.Davis' personal ID hasn't been merely abused since he began advertising his SSN — it's been gang-raped.Counting the Texas incident, he's been a victim at least 13 times since 2007.More such incidents may exist — Davis should know how many. He could reveal his credit reports from the past few years, if he wanted customers to know the truth. But LifeLock refused to discuss Davis' role as a frequent identity-theft victim or answer any other questions from New Times for this story.The fact that Davis has fallen victim to so many con artists illustrates how LifeLock cannot steel anyone from identity theft. Even with new features intended to improve upon LifeLock's original service, the company failed to save the boss' identity from getting used over and over again.And, as Davis insisted on the company's Web site, LifeLock customers can expect the same protection he himself has received.New Times' May 2007 story (linked above) showed how the company used deception and fear to drum up business.
LifeLock's co-founders, Richard Todd Davis and Robert J. Maynard Jr., told reporters across the country that Maynard had once spent a week in the Maricopa County jail, falsely accused of crimes, because his identity had been stolen. The 2003 incident was the inspiration for the company, they said.Official records and interviews with authorities in Nevada proved the story a fable. Maynard had been arrested and jailed here, all right — because he'd failed to pay back a $16,000 gambling marker at the Mirage casino in Las Vegas. Like bouncing a check, that's a crime. Nevada authorities dropped the charges after Maynard, from his cell, managed to scrape together the cash.The article also revealed that Maynard, the Valley businessman who was principally behind LifeLock during its 2005 inception, was banned for life in the 1990s from the credit-repair industry.Then there was this ironic tidbit: Maynard's own father, Valley optometrist Robert Maynard Sr., accused him of identity theft.Maynard Jr. resigned from the company that June, right about the time news broke of the $500 loan taken out in Davis' name. Before the summer of 2007, LifeLock had received barely a word of negative press. Since then, though, criticism and legal problems have plagued the company on a number of fronts — fueled partly by LifeLock's incessant, in-your-face (or ears, since the firm does lots of radio) advertising.A follow-up article in New Times, blasted the identity-theft-protection industry itself as a racket and gave examples of bogus claims put out by LifeLock. Blog sites and media outlets scrutinized LifeLock's ads and scolded Davis over the $500 loan from Texas.There were many arguably excellent reasons not to sign up for LifeLock, critics noted, one of the strongest being that anybody with average intelligence and a computer can perform its most touted service, setting fraud alerts on a personal credit file, for free in minutes. Supposed insiders also claimed LifeLock's customer data wasn't secure, putting customers at risk of the very sort of crime LifeLock purports to prevent.Lawyers began drawing up class-action lawsuits for aggrieved customers. And Experian, one of the big three national credit bureaus, sued LifeLock in early 2008 over its abuse of a federal law set up to help consumers.The Federal Trade Commission, despite agreeing with New Times that a case of false advertising could possibly be made on the story of Maynard's jailing, did nothing at the time. Neither did state Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard.Meanwhile, LifeLock, founded with millions of dollars in seed money from venture capitalists like Bessemer Venture Partners and Goldman Sachs, kept pumping out ads that grew its customer base to amazing heights.Despite naysayers' questions, LifeLock boasted in May 2008 that it had signed up its millionth customer. LifeLock was — and remains — a cash machine.Such phenomenal success helped the company weather its two biggest legal challenges: the first in October 2009, when the company settled with Experian and agreed to stop setting fraud alerts on behalf of its customers; the second when the FTC hit LifeLock with the $12 million penalty.Though the FTC took all the cash LifeLock had on hand, the settlement didn't stop investors from re-energizing the company with millions of dollars in new capital.From the start, one of LifeLock's strengths has been its aggressive marketing campaign, and the result hasn't just meant customers. LifeLock has wormed its way into Americana, holding itself up as a beacon of identity-theft awareness and education. It's bought its way onto race cars, the jerseys of the Phoenix Mercury, and onto the signage at US Airways Arena, where the Mercury and Phoenix Suns play. Davis and LifeLock's marketers, likened to "con artists" by the FTC's chairman, have even ingratiated themselves with law enforcement agencies around the country, using their ill-gotten gains to help pay for identity-theft summits. The arrangements give LifeLock the legitimacy it seeks to counter the claims of consumer advocates."They've successfully put the good before the bad," says Robert Siciliano, a Boston author and speaker on identity-theft issues. "That's a strategy that many politicians have perfected. It's one LifeLock has done well with, also."The FTC settlement is supposed to prevent the company from lying about the effectiveness of its service, but there's a fine line in American advertising as to such things. Authorities vow to keep monitoring LifeLock. In turn, LifeLock will probably try to keep refining its advertising messages — as in the examples of the Web pages taken down after questions by New Times — until it drops off the FTC's radar.Yet Robert J. Maynard's brainchild thrives mainly because it misrepresents the truth. It has to. Otherwise no one would believe it could keep his or her identity safe, the fundamental concept that drives customers to LifeLock.Even after it was toned down, the false promise of effective protection against identity theft remains integral to LifeLock's advertising.
LifeLock's modus operandi appears based on one of Sun Tzu's maxims in The Art of War: Deception is everything.When LifeLock began in 2005, its founders pushed for all the free publicity they could get in the news media. Maynard and Davis misrepresented the facts about the founder's jail stint, implying that the same thing could happen to people who don't try to protect themselves. And they lied about the level of prevention the company could offer."We prevent ID theft from ever occurring," Davis told the Phoenix Business Journal in 2005.Then they hit upon a unique idea for a major advertising campaign in early 2006. Davis, Maynard, and Mike Prusinski, the company's spokesman and vice president of communications, began giving out their Social Security numbers to the press.Wisely, Prusinski and Maynard quit the practice early on. But Davis put his nine-digit number on a flatbed truck, using the image in ads nationwide while claiming that LifeLock made his personal data "useless to criminals."Ads emphasized the "guarantee," claiming that LifeLock would "cover all losses and expenses up to $1 million."The claims were bogus. Savvy folks could see right through them.In the terms of the guarantee, if potential customers bothered to read them, the company doesn't promise to pay anyone a dime. That's if it covers a theft at all, because the guarantee is full of exceptions. For instance, LifeLock won't cover phishing scams or other popular ways to steal identities that involve duping someone into releasing personal data.The company agreement says if you become a victim "because of a failure or defect in the Services, LifeLock will retain and pay for those third party professional services that are reasonably necessary in LifeLock's judgment to assist you in restoring losses or recovering your lost out-of-pocket expenses caused by such fraud."Consider the phrase "reasonably necessary in LifeLock's judgment," for instance.Customers and non-customers complained. In May 2008, lawyers in New Jersey filed the first class-action lawsuit against LifeLock. Not only was the service a useless waste of money, the suit alleged, but the constant setting of fraud alerts harmed customers' credit scores.Credit bureau Experian beat the class to court. In a lawsuit filed in February 2008, Experian ripped LifeLock for its misleading marketing campaign but aimed primarily to kill LifeLock's fraud-alert feature.As mentioned, LifeLock's main service until last August was to set fraud alerts on consumers' credit files. The alerts are like red flags in the computer files of the Big Three credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax.If a thief tries to open a line of credit, the company offering the new account will stumble on the alert when it runs a credit report. That, in turn, should mean the thief's attempt to open the new account gets thwarted.LifeLock's main service used to be placing such a red flag on credit files for each of its customers, every 90 days. As its customer base grew by tens, then hundreds of thousands in 2006 and 2007, LifeLock became a burden and a competitor to Experian.Not that the credit bureaus deserve much sympathy, but Experian ended up stuck with a sizable unfunded mandate because of the way LifeLock exploited the law.When a person requests a fraud alert with one of the bureaus, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act requires the bureau to not only place the alert on file, but to notify the other two bureaus about it. The law allows only individuals, not companies, to call for the alerts. But LifeLock and one of its competitors, Texas-based Debix, put the law to the test.LifeLock called Experian's fraud hotline up to 15,000 times a day to request fraud alerts, the credit bureau's suit alleged. LifeLock apparently used Experian's system the most because it was more convenient, and every time the company called Experian's toll-free number, Experian was charged about 60 cents, its lawyers claimed.The wily LifeLock began by calling thousands of times a day from a Canadian phone number. When the credit bureau struck back, blocking calls from the number, LifeLock began using numbers in Pennsylvania to make the bulk calls. Every time the credit bureau tried to stem LifeLock's calls, the company switched its outgoing phone banks.Experian's chief competitors, TransUnion and Equifax, weren't anti-LifeLock; they even helped LifeLock "launder" some of the fraud alerts that Experian had to deal with, the suit stated.No doubt, much of Experian's problem with LifeLock had to do with Experian's running its own identity-theft protection racket.In 2005, Experian was slapped with a $950,000 penalty by the FTC for its misnamed www.freecreditreport.com Web site, which duped people into buying an expensive credit-monitoring service and lured away consumers from the government's real free credit report Web site, www.annualcreditreport.com.At one point during the antitrust trial, held in Santa Ana, California, Experian lawyer Thomas Malcolm admitted that Experian's "sister company," CIC (a.k.a. freecreditreport.com), even issued hundreds of fraud alerts for its customers between August 2007 and February 2008 — until Experian's legal department got wind of the program and shut it down."Experian doesn't compete with LifeLock," Malcolm argued. "Experian is being, essentially, bludgeoned to death — bloodied — by LifeLock on a daily basis."LifeLock's lawyer contended that CIC issued fraud alerts until the month that Experian filed its lawsuit. Experian was just sore that its fraud-alert service hit the market too late and failed, from LifeLock's point of view.Despite Experian's apparent hypocrisy, U.S. District Judge Andrew Guilford ruled in May 2009 that LifeLock's practice of setting the alerts for customers was illegal. LifeLock halted the practice a few months later as part of its settlement with Experian. (Debix dropped its fraud alerts, too.)The weirdest part of all this was that LifeLock's deception ran so deep that its target audience barely noticed what happened.Since its inception, the company had emphasized that the feature that made it different than competitors — the service that was the very backbone of LifeLock's ID-theft protection — was that it set fraud alerts for customers.After LifeLock lost the suit to Experian and the fraud alerts were stopped, the company claims, it went from 1.5 million customers in late 2009 to 1.6 million as of this year.LifeLock's customers, arguably a gullible group to begin with, must be asleep at the switch.
A few months after the Experian settlement, LifeLock settled complaints about its advertising practices with the FTC and 35 state attorneys general.FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz flew to Chicago to make the March 18 announcement alongside Illinois AG Lisa Madigan, who had spearheaded the authorities' effort. Arizona AG Terry Goddard merely was one of the 35, though the company is a short drive from his office.In a made-for-TV quote, Leibowitz referenced one of Davis' advertising stunts and told reporters, "The protection LifeLock actually provided left such a large hole in it that you could drive [a] truck right through it."Although LifeLock customers received "some benefits," they were far too few to justify the monthly fee of $10, Leibowitz said.LifeLock was ordered to pay $1 million to the states and $11 million to the feds, to be used for customer refunds and consumer education. The actual settlement was for $35 million, but the FTC agreed to take just what LifeLock had in the bank at the time. An "avalanche clause" would be triggered if the government found out LifeLock had more cash stuffed in some secret account.But there was no prohibition against taking in new funds from investors.Although LifeLock was a con, the company would be allowed to stay in business, Leibowitz said.Leibowitz said at the time that LifeLock's marketers had "changed their business model to some extent, and, going forward, it is far more within the realm of a legitimate business model with honest advertising to consumers."Besides the $12 million payment, the FTC order requires LifeLock to be truthful in its marketing claims and to develop a data-security program.LifeLock had all but the left the door wide open for a severe data breach, a lack of security for its customers' data that was "especially shameful" for a company that claimed to prevent identity theft, Leibowitz said. David Lincincum, a staff attorney with the FTC, tells New Times that the order also called for Davis to pay $10,000 personally for his role in the scheme.The government negotiated a separate settlement with Maynard (who left LifeLock in June 2007) that didn't require a payment from the co-founder.Still, the order bans Maynard from conning people through any data-security or identity-theft service he may start up in the future, Lincincum says. If he's in charge of data security anywhere, a third party has to audit his work.Of course, the 1996 FTC order banning Maynard for life from the credit-repair industry didn't stop him from launching LifeLock, which purports to help people fix problems with their credit files. Lincincum doesn't have much of an answer for why Maynard wasn't dealt with more harshly this time around."We obviously are not thrilled to see someone a second time," he says drily. "At the end of the day, we had to make a decision."
The FTC settlement also is taking care of the dozen class-action lawsuits against LifeLock that amassed in various states over time. As of last August, the suits had been consolidated and a Valley firm, Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro, was handling the case.Rob Carey, a partner in the firm and one of the lead lawyers in the case, says the class action will "go away" because of the settlement but that individual plaintiffs can opt out and sue on their own.The consolidated action had asked for an end to the fraud alerts, which has already happened thanks to the Experian suit, and demanded that LifeLock tell customers explicitly that the $1 million guarantee doesn't cover payment of losses because of identity theft.Some LifeLock clients were under the impression that the company would not only help them repair their credit but would also make them whole for their losses — only to find out that the company had misled them.A ruling by U.S. District Judge Mary Murguia on attorney fees in the various lawsuits is due by July — Carey says the amount LifeLock will have to pay should be no more than $1.9 million, to be split among the lawyers.Former and current LifeLock customers can apply for refunds by contacting the FTC (see www.ftc.gov/lifelock) or by waiting to receive an FTC letter stating they're eligible for refunds. There's no predicting how many customers will ask for their money back.The FTC settlement was embarrassing for at least two of the 35 participating state attorneys general, thanks to LifeLock's partnership with the national Law Enforcement Executive Development Association, known as FBI-LEEDA.The 19-year-old FBI-LEEDA, based in Malvern, Pennsylvania, helps educate cops in the latest crime-fighting trends and keeps them plugged in with veterans and specialists. It's affiliated with the FBI, to an extent: An FBI liaison to the association's executive board, currently Agent Charles Robb Jr., gets paid by the bureau for his work with the association. Robb didn't respond to a request for an interview.The nonprofit organization has two "Premiere Level" sponsors: Purdue Pharma and LifeLock. The Tempe company pays $25,000 a year for the honor, according to FBI-LEEDA's Web site. LifeLock makes DuPont (maker of Kevlar), Scottsdale-based Taser International, and Glock — who sponsor at the platinum, gold and bronze levels, respectively — look cheap.For the past couple of years, LifeLock also has sponsored high-profile ID-theft-focused training seminars with FBI-LEEDA, paying for keynote speakers, continental breakfasts, and box lunches for hundreds of attendees. The organization's executive director, Tom Stone, supports LifeLock wholeheartedly.Stone tells New Times that LifeLock pays all that money to FBI-LEEDA because "as a corporate citizen, they are giving something back to the community."The former chief of police from Virginia emphasizes that the FTC's settlement was a civil, not criminal, penalty. He dismisses concern about the company's reputation, saying he has no response to the FTC's findings."I'm not going to attempt to go there," Stone huffs. "As far as what happened with the FTC and anything civilly, it's not within my purview."Taking LifeLock's money, though, is apparently within his purview.For other government law offices, the relationship with LifeLock has soured after the FTC action.The first FBI-LEEDA/LifeLock summit following the FTC's March announcement about LifeLock was on April 20 in Charlotte, North Carolina.An FBI-LEEDA flier said the event would be hosted by North Carolina's Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department and its police chief, Rodney Monroe.Monroe had been scheduled to speak at the summit, but his planned participation irked North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper, one of the officials who had gone after LifeLock. Cooper called Monroe the week before the summit and asked him not to go, says Charlotte-Mecklenburg police Sergeant Walter Bowling. The chief acquiesced and skipped the summit. "It was out of respect for the AG's office," Bowling says. "There was some discomfort with [Chief Monroe] coming out, putting his face out to it."Stone claims he's "unaware" that the chief ever was supposed to go to the summit or give a speech. He notes that about 25 members of the Charlotte-Mecklenburg department still showed up.Bowling, who helped organize his department's participation in the summit, says he researched LifeLock beforehand and decided the company was sincere about improving. He's no apologist like Stone, admitting, "I'm not an idiot — I know they get some benefit from it."Cops benefited from the summit, he adds, by gaining valuable knowledge from the expert speakers on tackling identity crimes. LifeLock's funding helped make it happen."It's difficult in these economic times to find and attend training," Bowling writes in an e-mail.Nevada's another state whose law-enforcement connection to LifeLock — in light of the recent FTC ruling — comes off as both ironic and hypocritical.Last June, the Nevada attorney general's office co-hosted one of the summits with FBI-LEEDA and LifeLock.Nevada's AG, Catherine Cortez Masto, smiles in a picture with Todd Davis taken at the event as if they're the best of friends. LifeLock used the picture prominently on a Web page about the summits — even after Masto joined the FTC and the 34 other attorneys general in targeting the firm for legal action.A spokeswoman for the Nevada attorney general's office, Edie Cartwright, says there are "no plans" to host another LifeLock-linked summit. She thanked New Times for the heads-up on the photograph of Masto and Davis."We did not realize that was on their site," she said. "And they had not asked for permission so we requested that they remove it." (LifeLock took down the picture.)Though appreciative at first, Cartwright became terse when asked whether Masto could come to the phone to talk about the picture and past dealings with LifeLock."There's no quote," she said stiffly.
Now, a detour to Waikiki.No story about LifeLock would be complete without describing what happened to the charismatic, veracity-challenged Robert Maynard Jr. after he resigned from LifeLock. Maynard's a fascinating character — a former Marine, brilliant, ambitious to a fault, and a sufferer of bipolar disorder and depression.New Times' 2007 article covered Maynard's background in detail. The Northern Arizona University graduate emerged from a bankruptcy in the mid-1990s to become a millionaire as the head of the National Credit Foundation, a shady credit-repair company. But his overspending and risky investments had put him back into deep debt by 2005, when he filed another bankruptcy.Though he had to leave LifeLock well before its peak, he reportedly retained a 10 percent equity in the firm. LifeLock put millions of dollars into Maynard's bank accounts.Then, Maynard moved to Hawaii in 2008 and blew much — or possibly all — of his LifeLock fortune on a failed ocean-adventure business. The business hired more than 250 people for a time but later left employees hanging without a final paycheck.Kandoo Island, as the venture was called, sounded like great fun. Maynard and his partner, Dale Smith, bought a 148-foot catamaran, parked it in the water off Waikiki Beach and outfitted it with toys and amenities for tourists.It was a high-profile move that attracted lots of local interest. Maynard told the press he planned to invest about $7 million in Kandoo, which would offer parasailing, jet-skiing, scuba diving, and other water sports to thrill-seekers by the summer of 2009.When Honolulu Star-Bulletin reporter Susan Essoyan approached Maynard last June for an interview, the former Phoenix resident talked about his past scandals. He admitted that his credit-repair company had tried to "take advantage of the system," according to Essoyan's article, chocking up his bad decision-making to "youthful inexperience."He also claimed the "gambling spree," which resulted in his unpaid casino marker in 2003, was the result of "electroconvulsive" therapy in an unsuccessful bid to treat his depression. The treatment gave him manic spells and memory loss, Essoyan reported. He related how his marriage ended and that he attempted suicide in 2002.In 2005, he began taking proper medications for his illness and turned his life around, he told Essoyan. That was the year he founded LifeLock.The Star-Bulletin article seemed to contradict the accusation by Maynard's dad that his son had improperly taken out an American Express card using the elder Maynard's SSN. Though Robert Maynard Sr. had confirmed in July 2007 that New Times had quoted him correctly in "Money for Nothing," the optometrist told the Hawaii reporter that he and Maynard Jr. had acquired the card together. Apparently, father and son have mended fences. Maynard Sr. declined to comment for this article.The Coast Guard cleared Kandoo Island to launch in early August of last year. The "Big Doo" (as Maynard liked to be called at the time) and his crew took customers out on the catamaran every day for about two weeks. Then the money stream ran dry. Maynard and Smith had under-funded Kandoo Island, and they couldn't make scheduled payments for the substantial insurance premiums required for the adventure business.Jesse Berbig, 30, who worked as the kitchen manager, feels raw about getting stiffed for about $1,500 in final wages. He put in plenty of overtime, working six or seven days a week, he says."I did right by [Maynard] all summer, and now I can't get him on the phone," Berbig says.E-mails to the staff by Maynard, forwarded to New Times by Berbig, show the former LifeLock exec was struggling to find new funding within days of bringing the first customers on board."Money has turned incredibly tight," Maynard wrote in an e-mail to the "krew," as he called them, on August 10. "My family put every dollar, literally, that we had into getting this project ready, more than double what we had planned."Two financing deals "fell through literally at the closing table," he wrote. "We are in the crucible right now. If you can make it along with us through this difficult time, we will share in the rewards financially."By August 23, Maynard was apologizing for bounced checks, telling his workers that it was "absolutely mortifying to me that things got so out of control so fast here."Maynard has been named in at least two lawsuits regarding Kandoo. In one, the Hawaii National Bank seeks at least $4.1 million from another local business, Morning Star Cruises. The bank wants to put Maynard Jr. on the hook for $1.6 million of that, stating in the action that Maynard owes that amount to Morning Star for two smaller boats and ocean equipment.The other lawsuit alleges that Kandoo Island failed to pay a $19,000 bill for maintenance on the catamaran.Reached by phone in Hawaii, Maynard declined to discuss his financial situation, saying it's too personal. He was friendly enough, despite past avowals that he would never speak to this newspaper again.During the short conversation, he was asked why he risked the money he had made from LifeLock. "I got carried away," he said. "I loved the idea, and I ran out of money."He insists that Berbig and any other Kandoo employees who weren't paid will eventually get that last paycheck.And who knows? With Maynard's record, he could be sitting pretty again in a couple of years. As long as he stays away from false advertising, he may even keep the FTC off his back.
"My name is Montel Williams," the former talk-show host says on LifeLock's home page. "LifeLock offers me much more than identity-theft protection. They give me true peace of mind. Don't let thieves take what you and your family have worked so hard for."Considering Todd Davis' experience, Williams' testimonial appears ludicrous.Yet Williams' quote captures part of the reason for LifeLock's explosive growth and customer retention.It's like retail therapy. The important thing for customers is that they are paying for something that makes them feel good. Never mind that it's a placebo.But their "peace of mind" will indeed be shaken if they do fall victim. If thieves use your personal data, you will have to deal with it, LifeLock member or not.Not only can't LifeLock prevent identity theft, it can't do so much for customers who get ripped off. As the Davis example shows, LifeLock members still have to deal with the problems any victim would face.Surely, Davis' "peace of mind" must have been shaken by his myriad experiences with identity theft.He's gotten calls from collection agencies, from police. He's been asked to fill out forms and has had to work with his company (and possibly the folks it hires, because it can't do this stuff alone) in an attempt to convince the credit bureaus that he's not the deadbeat they're looking for. (It's possible they might not believe him, since he filed for personal bankruptcy in 2000, before he was involved with LifeLock.)The FTC's settlement has not stopped LifeLock from pushing its bogus message of protection and security on its Web site, or in its ads. The prominent testimonials on LifeLock's home page, like the one from Montel Williams, contain verbiage similar to catchphrases used in ads that the FTC says were misleading.For instance, the FTC expressed concern about this LifeLock message in its March 9 news release: "Do you ever worry about identity theft? If so, it's time you got to know LifeLock. We work to stop identity theft before it happens." Compare that to Ishana Wieczerzak's testimonial displayed on LifeLock's home page. Wieczerzak states that after a co-worker's theft of her personal information to obtain a credit card, "protecting my identity . . . was a full-time job. I had enough, so I found LifeLock, and now they help protect my identity."It's just a somewhat softer peddle of the same message.Perhaps the "old" LifeLock really offered a scintilla of protection, as the FTC acknowledged. It's possible that putting your credit file in a permanent state of red alert might have prevented some new-account crimes (though doing so may also have reduced your credit score, LifeLock's critics contend). But what about today's LifeLock, which no longer sets fraud alerts for its customers?In the middle of last year, LifeLock unveiled a "new" service to replace the fraud alerts. It really isn't that new. LifeLock's Web site states that the "better and broader identity-theft protection system" will:• "Use more sophisticated and more scientific algorithms to spot identity fraud.• "Examine patterns over time across the entire network to help predict future identity risks and vulnerable members.• "Mine more data sources than the credit bureaus, including retailers, banks, mortgage lenders, utilities, and auto lenders."The phrase "more sophisticated and more scientific algorithms" suggests that LifeLock already was employing "algorithms" — though less-scientific ones. And what are "algorithms," anyway? Just a fancy term for a "step-by-step, problem-solving procedure," according to one dictionary definition.The other two bullet points sound just as vague and hokey.In April 2008, LifeLock rolled out a major new feature called eRecon, which supposedly trolls thousands of Web sites used by hackers for signs of customers' personal data. The feature appears to have had little benefit for Todd Davis, since it was in effect during the year that criminals repeatedly exploited his identity.The service that LifeLock now provides seems so nebulous that customers ought to wonder whether they can qualify for the $1 million guarantee under any circumstances. After all, the guarantee is triggered only if LifeLock's service fails or is defective.Before, if LifeLock failed to place a fraud alert and a new account was opened in your name, you qualified for the guarantee. Now, judging by information LifeLock puts out, customers trying to take advantage of the guarantee must prove that LifeLock failed to "examine patterns over time" or perhaps used an "algorithm" that wasn't "scientific" enough.A testimonial used in the company's advertising from an alleged customer named "Gary Johnson" touches on this problem."If I had joined LifeLock sooner, they would have alerted me when my personal information was used to apply for credit or services within their network," Johnson states.LifeLock members would be wise to make the company spell out exactly what is "within [the company's] network" before signing up. New Times could find nothing on LifeLock's Web site that states what it considered inside or outside its "network."Customers may also want to inquire how many of the new accounts successfully opened in Davis' name would have fallen within this "network."LifeLock claims that its new service provides better protection than ever.As Davis should know, this isn't saying much.
