North American Rescue:Who We Are




Our Corporate Overview

 
 

 
 
Our Corporate Overview
North American Rescue (NAR) is dedicated to decreasing preventable death by providing the most effective and highest quality mission critical medical products to our military, federal agencies, civilian law enforcement, EMS and pre-hospital life savers. We design, develop and test these products based on the military's Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines, Rescue Human Factors® engineering, evidence based medicine and an in-depth understanding of the requirements from you – our customers.
Ensuring that we remain at the forefront of casualty care as a premier provider of life-saving products and supplies, NAR has assembled a seasoned staff of former Special Operations medics, experienced Law Enforcement / SWAT / EMS healthcare providers, credentialed product development and quality professionals, former senior military medical officers and expert consultants.

COMMUNITY


Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC)
Tactical Combat Casualty Care (TCCC) guidelines focus on the 3 leading causes of preventable combat death – extremity hemorrhage, tension pneumothorax and airway obstruction. NAR's mission critical medical products such as the C-A-T® (Combat Application Tourniquet), Combat Gauze Hemostatic Bandage, HyFin® Chest Seal and ARS® Needle Decompression Kit, to name a few, directly address these causes. Together, these products have potentially saved more lives on the modern battlefield than could have been saved at any other time in history. In addition to the 3 leading causes of preventable death, hypothermia has a significantly negative impact on a trauma patient's survival rate. Consequently, NAR developed the Hypothermia Prevention and Management Kit™ (HPMK®), with other new hypothermia products currently in the pipeline.




 
 
 
 

Commitment to Our Customers
Commitment to our customers is NAR's top priority. Whether you are on the battlefield, in an urban landscape or in austere environments, hostile conditions pose unique challenges for managing traumatic injury. At NAR, we recognize that in a post 9/11 world requirements are ever-changing for those dedicated combat lifesavers, tactical healthcare providers and law enforcement / EMS professionals who stand in harm's way to save the life of another. You are our customers and empowering you to save lives is the very heart of our business and our culture.
Our Commitment to Quality
Our Commitment to Quality is demonstrated by NAR being an ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 Certified medical device company. These certifications mean that we adhere to the highest standards of quality and to rigorous regulatory compliance, ensuring that our products are of the highest quality and safe to use. In addition, the NAR team possesses a unique insight into the unconventional challenges of tactical medicine and is committed to providing breakthrough products that span the full spectrum of tactical casualty care, from the point of wounding to the doors of the trauma center. Is your medical device provider committed to maintaining Medical Device standards through ISO 13485? We are.
Commitment to Our Community
Commitment to Our Community is an essential part of the NAR culture and focuses on our charitable giving program, Operation Giveback. NAR has donated over $17 Million to primarily support Wounded Warriors and their families. With a focus on combat medics and their families, we appreciate your sacrifice and through programs like the Ranger Medic Handbook, strive to make our contributions count to the community we serve.
As "Partners In Empowerment" in our community, our relationship with the South Carolina Vocational Rehabilitation Department (SCVRD) provides jobs and training for their clients, who are faced with a wide variety of disabilities. Giving back to the community provides us with focus to fulfill our Corporate social responsibilities.






OUR MISSION
To provide tailored, mission-enabling health care solutions to counter the rapidly evolving threats of the 21st century.



OUR VISION
To combine the knowledge of seasoned combat medics, leading technology providers and researchers, and asymmetrical warfare experts to be the world leader in tactical casualty care solutions.

North American Rescue embodies the innovative spirit, motivation and dedication of today's pre-hospital health care professional. Each emergency medical system has specialized and distinctive requirements such as response jurisdiction changes, varying degrees of terrorist threats, and budgetary and equipment limitations. Many systems have developed specialty teams such as tactical, hazmat or disaster response to help mitigate these challenges. However, the overwhelming responsibility in these events falls to the conventional pre-hospital providers. If we are able to take the lessons learned from these specialty teams and couple them with current innovations in military medicine, we can then integrate (when applicable) the treatment modalities and equipment that will allow us to be better prepared in our daily operations.

Product Overview
Supplement Facts




Introducing ResQue, a Resveratrol Plus Quercetin Formulation


Your Solution to the French Paradox
Queue Up your memory, cardiovascular, metabolic functions and so much more



emember the “French Paradox”? It was the question raised at the end of the 20th century about why the high-fat diet of the French did not cause more dire consequences. Data collected as far back as 1997 indicate that phenolic compounds (such as resveratrol and quercetin) found in red wine exhibit properties that may account in part for the fact that moderate drinking of red wine over a long period of time can protect cardiovascular function. Resveratrol appears to be the solution.
However, there are a number of questions to answer when it comes to resveratrol, a highly desirable nutrient that has startled the world with its promises and actualities.
First Up: Are you getting the right dose, not too much and not too little? Second Up: Are you maintaining high serum levels of trans-resveratrol (the most active form)?
The solution may be ResQue, found to up your memory function in a recent scientific study with an intake of resveratrol at 200 mg/day plus quercetin at 320 mg for increased bioavailability and blood level sustainability (by inhibiting the sulphation of resveratrol). 
So ring in the New Year with ResQue, and every year thereafter.




Suggested use: Take 1 capsule, twice per day, preferably with breakfast and dinner.

DISCOUNT PRICING INFORMATION

What is GSA pricing all about? The GSA Schedule is an agreed upon contract price that has been pre-negotiated with the U.S. Government to ensure best pricing for qualified buyers. This means that shoppers that have been qualified to receive GSA pricing can shop with confidence, knowing that they are getting NAR's superior quality products at the absolute best pricing available.
A GSA contract can be used across all federal agencies, from DOD and DHS, to FEMA and the Department of Energy.  Any federal customer can order with this special pricing and, in specific cases, other agencies and organizations can also order from a GSA Schedule. Our Customer Service Specialists will be happy to talk with you to determine your eligibility and set you up with the most cost effective price option that you qualify for.
Our website is set up to allow qualified buyers to shop our site while viewing the pricing and discounts that utilizing the GSA Schedule Contract gives them access to.

PRODUCTS WITH A MISSION: WHAT WE DO
Product Development remains a hallmark of North American Rescue. We bring a unique understanding of global technology development and implementation with a team of decorated, seasoned former Special Operations medics, experienced Law Enforcement / SWAT / EMS healthcare providers, credentialed product development and quality professionals, former senior military medical officers and experts with a proven track record in product development and deployment. The two major components of NAR's product development efforts are Developmental Testing Directorate (DTD) and the Voice of our Customers.
Developmental Testing Directorate (DTD)
The Developmental Testing Directorate (DTD) works hand-in-hand with our developers as we test and validate our entire product line, from advanced prototyping of a new concept through the upgrade engineering of a seasoned product. We rigorously evaluate and verify the capabilities of each product within its own operational environment, including the external fielding of equipment to key targeted user groups. The recently expanded indoor testing center now includes office space, a team room and lab in addition to our existing 20,000-square-foot facility. This state-of-the-art prototyping area offers simulated, extreme high-stress conditions commonly experienced in operational environments and also serves as an educational/training resource for tactical units, test teams and organizations worldwide.



To further support this robust product development agenda, NAR continues to aggressively enhance our growing Online Reference Library featuring our flagship 3D Medical Training Series in high definition. These invaluable audio visual aids explain the purpose and vision of specific gear, provide New Equipment Training (NET) and give guidelines for each product's intended use. Additional support materials, such as white papers, product information sheets and instructions for use are also available for download from the Video Download page or the "video tab" on the individual product pages. Our commitment to these educational resources ensures that you are informed, equipped and optimized for saving lives.
