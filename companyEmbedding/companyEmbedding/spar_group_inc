Kitchen & Dining Furniture


		The right table and seating are essential elements in creating a dining space that is stylish, welcoming, and functional. Of course the dining table is the largest and most central piece, so it can be helpful to choose this first, as it can set the tone for the rest of the room’s furnishings. Most dining tables are used on a daily basis, and they can play host to everything from formal dinners or family meal time to after-hours work or kid’s crafts. When selecting a table for your space, be sure to account for how you and your household will make use of it, and select materials and finishes that will give you the level of durability you need and create the look you want.
		

		The seating that complements a table is the next crucial component, and it can make the difference between a dining space that is welcoming, and one that is just uncomfortable. While most people think of dining chairs when they discuss seating to go with the table, dining benches are also a great option. A dining bench brings an air of casual charm, and the open arrangement of the bench can also add a lot of flexibility to a seating arrangement by not pre-determining how many seats it provides. That being said, dining chairs are the traditional option for meal time seating, and they come in an enormous variety of styles. From fabric and leather upholstery, or solid materials ranging from oak to acrylic, there are choices to accommodate every taste. 
		

		Once you have the essentials of a dining table and seating, most spaces could use a bit of extra storage. A buffet or sideboard are both classic additions that work well in almost any dining room or breakfast nook.  Either of these pieces can add a large amount of storage for dishes, linens, and other tableware. Alternately, if your storage needs are more geared towards food and drink, a bar cart or kitchen island cart can provide extra space with the added bonus of portability.

About Living Room Furniture


		The living room is a central space that brings family and friends together; it acts as a venue for everything from birthday parties and family game nights to entertaining and even quiet nights in, and you’ll find an endless array of furnishings available to create a perfect living room design.
		

		Most living room furnishings fall into one of two categories: seating and storage. Seating is a must in nearly all entertaining spaces, and seating options are as varied as the living areas they occupy, from individual sofas, loveseats, chaises and recliners, to gorgeous coordinated living room sets in just about any style you could want.
		

		When it comes to storage, media chests and TV stands offer two different solutions to taming the cords, consoles, cable boxes and movie collections that take over most living rooms. TV stands provide a pedestal that sets the TV at the ideal height for viewing, while media chests offer a space for the television that are more centered around storing movie, game and music collections.
		

		For general storage, bookcases and étagères both provide a large amount of usable shelf space for storing books, board games collections and throw blankets. The open shelves of an étagère are great way to display photos or keepsakes. Of course, not all storage options require shelves; coffee tables, side tables and ottomans all offer a flat space where you can rest a tray, set remotes or place lighting (in the case of end tables). Some tables and ottomans also offer internal storage with drawers or a lift-up lid, so no matter the size of your space, you can always fit a bit more functionality.

About Bedroom Furniture

Whether you’re looking to design a peaceful retreat, a vibrant and colorful space or something uniquely you, our bedroom furniture selection includes everything you need to create a bedroom that is both stylish and functional.
Of course, every bedroom style include a bed. Your bed is the most important addition to the bedroom, and it’s usually the largest furniture piece in the ensemble. As such, it helps determine the overall style of the space. Bed frames, headboards and footboards are configured in a wide variety of styles and designs ranging from sleek platform beds with modern upholstered headboards to traditional four-poster frames and even classic luxuries like canopy beds.
Once you’ve selected a bed, you can also select additional bedroom furniture and storage to make for a more functional living space. Dressers, nightstands, armoires and jewelry armoires all offer different options for organizing everything from clothing and accessories to extra bed linens. Dressers and nightstands also provide valuable surface space for lighting and displaying decor. Finally, bedroom vanities and floor mirrors add depth and light, and help make sure you can head out looking your best.
If you’re looking to add or switch out all of these pieces for a completely new look, a bedroom set is a great way to get everything at once. Most collections even allow you to build a custom set that include only the furniture pieces you need.

 WHAT WE DO 


                    WHAT WE DO
                


50 years ago, SPAR pioneered data based retail analytics. Responding to client requests, we soon applied our retail knowledge to merchandising. Today we are the world’s leader in retail merchandising and field marketing services, getting more of our clients’ products out of the store, more effectively, more efficiently and more profitably.
                    


                    We offer three categories of retail service to fit the specific needs of every client:
                




Regularly scheduled continuity service to meet our Retailer, Manufacturer and Distributor partners’ unique needs. The combination of our broad national – and international – coverage, focused personnel, efficient operations and state-of-the-art technology make us an ideal partner for these large-scale programs.
Syndicated Services


No other retail services company offers our level of flexibility to support your key projects when and how you need them supported, including new product launches, seasonal/promotional services, major category resets, and new store openings.
Project Services


The scope of work for some clients requires more than continuity. It requires dedication. We have the personnel, scale and coverage, nationally and internationally, to provide merchandising teams dedicated to the needs of specific clients.
Dedicated Services




And, we provide a variety of retail services: 





In-Store Merchandising

SPAR Group, Inc., SPAR Marketing Force, Inc., SPAR Assembly & Installation, Inc., SPAR Group International, Inc., SPAR Trademarks, Inc., SPAR Acquisition, Inc., SPAR Canada, Inc. and SPAR Canada Company Announces Amendment to Sterling Domestic Credit Facility
Jul 5 17
SGRP and certain of its US and Canadian subsidiaries, namely SPAR Marketing Force, Inc., SPAR Assembly & Installation, Inc., SPAR Group International, Inc., SPAR Trademarks, Inc., SPAR Acquisition, Inc., SPAR Canada, Inc. and SPAR Canada Company are parties to a revolving loan and security agreement dated as of July 6, 2010, as amended, with Sterling National Bank and their amended and restated secured revolving loan note in the amended maximum principal amounts of $9.0 million to Sterling National Bank, to document and govern their credit facility with the Lender (including such agreement and note, the "Sterling Credit Facility"). The Sterling Credit Facility as amended currently is scheduled to expire and the Borrowers' loans there under will become due on July 6, 2017 (with no early termination fee). The amendment to the Sterling Credit Facility effective as of June 27, 2017 (the "Eleventh Sterling Amendment"), extends the expiration date to September 6, 2017.


SPAR Group Receives Non-Compliance Notice From Nasdaq
May 30 17
SPAR Group, Inc. received a notification letter dated May 25, 2017 (Nasdaq Letter), from the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (Nasdaq), stating that SGRP is no longer in compliance with certain requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Capital Market. The Nasdaq Letter stated SGRP has failed to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share for its shares of its Common Stock for the prior 30 consecutive business days preceding its notice (i.e., April 12, 2017 – May 24, 2017) as required by NASDAQ Stock Market Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (Bid Price Rule). The Nasdaq Letter provides that SGRP has until November 21, 2017, as a grace period to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule by maintaining a closing bid price of $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. If at any time during the grace period the bid price of SGRP's Common Stock closes at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide SGRP with written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. In the event SGRP does not regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule prior to the expiration of the grace period, it will receive written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. The Corporation would then have the ability to appeal the Nasdaq Staff's decision to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel (Panel). Alternatively, SGRP may be eligible for an additional grace period if it meets the initial listing standards at the time, with the exception of bid price, for The Nasdaq Capital Market. If it meets the initial listing criteria, Nasdaq will notify SGRP that it has been granted an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. The NASDAQ Letter does not affect the listing of SGRP's Common Stock at this time, and those shares will continue to trade on The NASDAQ Capital Market.

Kitchen & Dining Furniture


		The right table and seating are essential elements in creating a dining space that is stylish, welcoming, and functional. Of course the dining table is the largest and most central piece, so it can be helpful to choose this first, as it can set the tone for the rest of the room’s furnishings. Most dining tables are used on a daily basis, and they can play host to everything from formal dinners or family meal time to after-hours work or kid’s crafts. When selecting a table for your space, be sure to account for how you and your household will make use of it, and select materials and finishes that will give you the level of durability you need and create the look you want.
		

		The seating that complements a table is the next crucial component, and it can make the difference between a dining space that is welcoming, and one that is just uncomfortable. While most people think of dining chairs when they discuss seating to go with the table, dining benches are also a great option. A dining bench brings an air of casual charm, and the open arrangement of the bench can also add a lot of flexibility to a seating arrangement by not pre-determining how many seats it provides. That being said, dining chairs are the traditional option for meal time seating, and they come in an enormous variety of styles. From fabric and leather upholstery, or solid materials ranging from oak to acrylic, there are choices to accommodate every taste. 
		

		Once you have the essentials of a dining table and seating, most spaces could use a bit of extra storage. A buffet or sideboard are both classic additions that work well in almost any dining room or breakfast nook.  Either of these pieces can add a large amount of storage for dishes, linens, and other tableware. Alternately, if your storage needs are more geared towards food and drink, a bar cart or kitchen island cart can provide extra space with the added bonus of portability.

About Living Room Furniture


		The living room is a central space that brings family and friends together; it acts as a venue for everything from birthday parties and family game nights to entertaining and even quiet nights in, and you’ll find an endless array of furnishings available to create a perfect living room design.
		

		Most living room furnishings fall into one of two categories: seating and storage. Seating is a must in nearly all entertaining spaces, and seating options are as varied as the living areas they occupy, from individual sofas, loveseats, chaises and recliners, to gorgeous coordinated living room sets in just about any style you could want.
		

		When it comes to storage, media chests and TV stands offer two different solutions to taming the cords, consoles, cable boxes and movie collections that take over most living rooms. TV stands provide a pedestal that sets the TV at the ideal height for viewing, while media chests offer a space for the television that are more centered around storing movie, game and music collections.
		

		For general storage, bookcases and étagères both provide a large amount of usable shelf space for storing books, board games collections and throw blankets. The open shelves of an étagère are great way to display photos or keepsakes. Of course, not all storage options require shelves; coffee tables, side tables and ottomans all offer a flat space where you can rest a tray, set remotes or place lighting (in the case of end tables). Some tables and ottomans also offer internal storage with drawers or a lift-up lid, so no matter the size of your space, you can always fit a bit more functionality.

About Bedroom Furniture

Whether you’re looking to design a peaceful retreat, a vibrant and colorful space or something uniquely you, our bedroom furniture selection includes everything you need to create a bedroom that is both stylish and functional.
Of course, every bedroom style include a bed. Your bed is the most important addition to the bedroom, and it’s usually the largest furniture piece in the ensemble. As such, it helps determine the overall style of the space. Bed frames, headboards and footboards are configured in a wide variety of styles and designs ranging from sleek platform beds with modern upholstered headboards to traditional four-poster frames and even classic luxuries like canopy beds.
Once you’ve selected a bed, you can also select additional bedroom furniture and storage to make for a more functional living space. Dressers, nightstands, armoires and jewelry armoires all offer different options for organizing everything from clothing and accessories to extra bed linens. Dressers and nightstands also provide valuable surface space for lighting and displaying decor. Finally, bedroom vanities and floor mirrors add depth and light, and help make sure you can head out looking your best.
If you’re looking to add or switch out all of these pieces for a completely new look, a bedroom set is a great way to get everything at once. Most collections even allow you to build a custom set that include only the furniture pieces you need.
