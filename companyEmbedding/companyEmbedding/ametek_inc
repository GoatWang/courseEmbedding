AMETEK, Inc is an American global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices with headquarters in the United States and over 220 manufacturing sites worldwide.[7]
The company was founded in 1930. The company's original name, American Machine and Metals, was changed to AMETEK in the early 1960s, reflecting AME's evolution from a provider of heavy machinery to a manufacturer of analytical instruments, precision components and specialty materials.[8]
Ametek today consists of two major groups (the Electronic Instruments Group and the Electromechanical Group).[9] Together, these two groups and their respective divisions combine a total of over 100 brands, including analytical instruments, monitoring, testing and calibration devices as well as electrical motors, pumps and interconnects.[10] The company's headquarters are in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.
AMETEK is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The common stock of AMETEK is a component of the S&P 500 index and the Russell 1000 index.
AMETEK's Corporate Growth Plan is founded on four key strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions & Alliances, Global & Market Expansion, and New Products.
During the 1980s, one AMETEK group partnered with the California Institute of Technology to assemble hypercube topology computers. It is not known how many systems were delivered, but the market came to be dominated by Intel, NCUBE, and Floating Point Systems.

AMETEK, Inc is an American global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices with headquarters in the United States and over 220 manufacturing sites worldwide.[7]
The company was founded in 1930. The company's original name, American Machine and Metals, was changed to AMETEK in the early 1960s, reflecting AME's evolution from a provider of heavy machinery to a manufacturer of analytical instruments, precision components and specialty materials.[8]
Ametek today consists of two major groups (the Electronic Instruments Group and the Electromechanical Group).[9] Together, these two groups and their respective divisions combine a total of over 100 brands, including analytical instruments, monitoring, testing and calibration devices as well as electrical motors, pumps and interconnects.[10] The company's headquarters are in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.
AMETEK is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The common stock of AMETEK is a component of the S&P 500 index and the Russell 1000 index.
AMETEK's Corporate Growth Plan is founded on four key strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions & Alliances, Global & Market Expansion, and New Products.
During the 1980s, one AMETEK group partnered with the California Institute of Technology to assemble hypercube topology computers. It is not known how many systems were delivered, but the market came to be dominated by Intel, NCUBE, and Floating Point Systems.

AMETEK, Inc is an American global manufacturer of electronic instruments and electromechanical devices with headquarters in the United States and over 220 manufacturing sites worldwide.[7]
The company was founded in 1930. The company's original name, American Machine and Metals, was changed to AMETEK in the early 1960s, reflecting AME's evolution from a provider of heavy machinery to a manufacturer of analytical instruments, precision components and specialty materials.[8]
Ametek today consists of two major groups (the Electronic Instruments Group and the Electromechanical Group).[9] Together, these two groups and their respective divisions combine a total of over 100 brands, including analytical instruments, monitoring, testing and calibration devices as well as electrical motors, pumps and interconnects.[10] The company's headquarters are in Berwyn, Pennsylvania.
AMETEK is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The common stock of AMETEK is a component of the S&P 500 index and the Russell 1000 index.
AMETEK's Corporate Growth Plan is founded on four key strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions & Alliances, Global & Market Expansion, and New Products.
During the 1980s, one AMETEK group partnered with the California Institute of Technology to assemble hypercube topology computers. It is not known how many systems were delivered, but the market came to be dominated by Intel, NCUBE, and Floating Point Systems.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
