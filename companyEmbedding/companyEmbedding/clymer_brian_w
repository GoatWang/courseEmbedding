This quote applies to many things in life, and fixing a motorcycle is definitely one of them. We all have a friend who, at some point, tried to wrench on his bike and ended up with a box full of "spare" parts. Sometimes a box of parts and a non-working motorcycle. I say "friend" since I've never done anything silly like that. [cough, cough]. -Luis
The Best Motorcycle Shop Manuals!
If you're looking for an easy-to-use motorcycle repair book, you've come to the right place. We have all the popular models here, so if you need a Honda motorcycle manual, a service manual for Suzuki motorcycles, a manual for a Harley-Davidson or anything else, we have it. Don't trust online Honda motorcycle repair manuals (free downloads), because they won't have the detailed instructions and quality photographs that you'll find in these professional guides.
Anyone with basic mechanical ability, a good assortment of the right tools and a good place to work on the bike can do the jobs necessary to keep a motorcycle running right and save money in the process.
Of course, the best insurance is to have and use the correct motorcycle repair manual, and The Motor Bookstore sells the best DIY repair and service manuals by Clymer and Haynes.
Unlike factory shop manuals, Clymer and Haynes motorcycle manuals are written specifically for the do-it-yourself mechanic.
During production of the manual, the models covered by the book are completely disassembled, then reassembled, in order to provide easy-to-follow photos and instructions which you can follow so you can maintain, service or completely rebuild your motorcycle.
So whether you need to give your motorcycle an oil change; replace the air filter; inspect, clean and gap the spark plugs; tune-up the bike or clean and rebuild the carburetor- all the way to tearing the engine apart, inspecting and replacing parts, then reassembling it and reinstalling it in the frame- get the right motorcycle repair manual, and fix your bike right!

Follow this contractor

















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Clymer, Brian W carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Clymer, Brian W



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Clymer, Brian W



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
