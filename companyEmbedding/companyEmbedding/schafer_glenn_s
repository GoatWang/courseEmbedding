Comes to find out Glenn taught me a thing or two about paying attention.

While working with Glenn over a period of about 12 months he taught me everything from, paying attention to ever detail, to putting out the best quality product available. It was our name on the line, not the company we worked for.

The standard, and quality of the work Glenn does is next to none. You can sleep well at night knowing that everything was done the right way.See moreSee lessSchaefer Compression Alignment has done some fine work under the guidence of Glenn through a number of packagers we've utilized in the past for new compression.  
Glenn is very attentative to the customer needs.
