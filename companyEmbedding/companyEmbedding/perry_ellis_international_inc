The Company enhances its roster of brands by licensing trademarks from third parties, including: Nike® and Jag® for swimwear, and Callaway®, PGA TOUR®, Champions Tour® and Jack Nicklaus® for golf apparel.
































Our apparel is distributed through regional, national and international department stores, national and regional chain stores, mass merchants, green grass (i.e., golf related) and other specialty stores, and corporate wear distributors throughout world. Belk, Bonton, Dillard's, JCPenney, Kohl's, Macy's, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Wal-Mart are only a few of our varied and esteemed retail partners. We also engage in direct-to-consumer business via company-owned retail stores and e-commerce websites.
Additionally, we license our proprietary brands to third parties for the manufacturing and marketing of various products in categories or territories in which we have no direct business operations, including men’s and women’s accessories, footwear, fragrances, underwear, formalwear, loungewear, eyewear, watches, home fashion and apparel in over 50 countries. As well as generating supplemental sources of revenue, these licensing arrangements expand collective brand awareness.
Through our "family of brands" marketing approach, we develop and enhance a distinct brand, style and pricing strategy for a range of product categories within each distribution channel to resonate with targeted consumer groups, including niche markets that are often overlooked by our competitors. We also produce goods sold under the private label program of various retail partners. By strategically marketing brands to a wide range of consumer segments, our company successfully reaches members of multiple demographic and psychographic groups.
We contract the manufacture of our products through a network of approximately 130 independent suppliers around the globe that meet our rigorous quality and compliance standards. With 10 sourcing offices and quality control centers to oversee all aspects of production and 45 years spent building our infrastructure, personal relationships and supplier connections, we maximize value by delivering the high-quality product at the best value.
At Perry Ellis International, we believe our competitive strengths, buoyed by the expertise of our family of talented industry professionals, position us to capitalize on several trends that have affected the apparel sector in recent years. These trends include the consolidation of the department and chain store sectors into a smaller number of stronger retailers which now represent some of our most important customers; the increased reliance of retailers on qualified partners with sourcing expertise and advanced systems and technology; and the continued importance of an omni-channel approach with strong brands as a source of product differentiation. Aided by these market conditions and backed by a proven eye for opportunity, we look forward to delivering continued growth through the creation of fashion that resonates uniquely with the lifestyles of consumers worldwide.

George Feldenkreis

George Feldenkreis serves as Executive Chairman of the Board of Perry Ellis International. Born in Havana, Cuba, to Russian immigrants, George moved to Miami in 1961 and founded Supreme International. Supreme International went public in 1993 and became Perry Ellis International (PEI) after acquiring the powerhouse brand in 1999 which he has since built into a multinational corporation with annual revenues of nearly $1 billion.
George has been a member of the Greater Miami Jewish Federation's Board of Directors for more than 40 years, and has organized many fundraising activities involving South Florida's Cuban-Jewish community. He was the Federation's first Hispanic board member, and was honored with the organization's "Friend of Israel Humanitarian Award" in 2016.
George was elected as a Trustee of the University of Miami in 1995 and has endowed the George Feldenkreis Program in Judaic Studies at the University. In 2015, the Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, Israel, bestowed the 'Rambam Award' upon George in recognition of his business and philanthropic achievements.
In 2007, he was recognized as Man of the Year during the American Apparel & Footwear Association's American Image Awards event and also received Yeshiva University's `A Perfect Fit Award' in 2006, along with the Ernst & Young Florida Entrepreneur of the Year Award in Manufacturing in 1998.
George holds a Juris Doctorate from the University of Havana, an honorary Doctor of Laws from Babson College and an honorary Associate of Arts and Letters from Miami Dade Community College. His numerous speaking engagements have included commencements and keynote addresses at Harvard University, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Babson College, Yeshiva University and the Miami International University of Art and Design.

Oscar’s extensive experience in the apparel business, including marketing, branding, sales and manufacturing has enabled PEI to become one of the leaders in the industry.
He is involved in numerous local and national civic causes, including the Kosher Food Bank, United Way, Israel Bonds, Temple Menorah and the YPO/WPO Organization. He is currently on the Advisory Board of My Mela, President of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces (FIDF), Greater Miami Chapter, on the Advisory Board of the Miami Fashion Institute for Miami Dade College and an Advisory Member for the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business Retail.
Most recently, Oscar will be honored as the 2016 Apparel Industry Honoree and Co-Chairman of the Ronald McDonald House of New York Annual Gala in June. He also received the National Human Relations award given by the American Jewish Committee, the 2008 Entrepreneur of the Year Award from the Wharton School of Business and the 2010 Achievement Award from the Kids in Distressed Situations (K.I.D.S.) organization.

About Suits

Men's Suits: Tailored Slim Fit Suits, Skinny & Classic Fit Suits
Just like every man’s suit doesn’t fit each person the same, particular men’s suits are specific to certain situations. Going for something casual but sophisticated? Trying to impress that boss of yours? Or that girl you’re going on a date with? Don’t worry, Perry Ellis has a three-piece suit that tailors to you and your setting. With every guy in mind, we put our distinctive designs — like herringbone, sharkskin, chambray and iridescent — into sizes that range from very slim fit to big & tall. And of course, regular fit for the not-so-regular man. Shopping for business, or for pleasure? Whether you call them pants, slacks or trousers, jackets, sport coats or blazers, we bring you the perfect pairing finished with a tailored fit.
For the traveling businessman, or just a guy who stays on the go, our non-iron, wrinkle-free Travel Luxe suit collection is perfect for you — and these washable suits are certified for every professional. Need wedding wear? Linen suits are lightweight, breathable and perfect to exchange beach nuptials in. Whether you’re the groom, best man or a groomsmen, suit up in style because those pictures really do last a lifetime. And you don’t want to be the one who goes underdressed to any formal affair. That statement holds true for prom, homecoming, graduation or a black-tie event. Solid, slightly striped, heathered? Play it fashion forward in your black, navy blue, gray or white suit when you add a sleek dress shirt, tie and pocket square for that extra pop of color. Guys in suits always tend to look better and feel better, so grab a suit be the best version of you.

About Dress Pants

Men's Dress Pants and Slacks: Slim Fit, Very Slim Fit & Classic Fit
No matter what the occasion or style of pant, we know the importance of finding that perfect-fitting pair. Something sleek, classy and dapper that you’ve been searching far and wide for. With four different fits — slim, regular, classic and modern — in each of various-styled slacks, every guy can find the style they strive for in the size that fits. After all, different guys like different styles, and dress pants can be the difference maker to any outfit. Keep it casual but classy when you pick up a pair of chinos, which give a perfect professional look while keeping a laid-back approach. They show that you’re trendy, but don’t take fashion too serious. Have an old-school business style with a modern touch? Then Perry Ellis Portfolio pleated or double-pleated pants are the exact trouser you’re looking for. Incorporating a non-iron, wrinkle-free finish into a style that’s never out of season, you can pay homage to the timeless looks of yesteryear while impressing everyone at the office. Skip the dry cleaner, because our trousers are machine washable, which means they’re an excellent wardrobe addition for the on-the-go businessman.
Headed to prom, homecoming, formal or just a black-tie event? Arrive in style when you pair your pants with suit separates to make a three-piece suit that’s sure to make you shine. Add a tie and pocket square to include a pop of color into your wardrobe. Or just go for the minimalist look in the office or on the weekend when you pair your dress pants with a polo or knit. With fabrications like sharkskin, herringbone, heather, chambray, melange, bengaline and linen in slim fit to big & tall, you’re assured to find the style you’re looking for in the fit you deserve.

Following only what felt right. In doing so, he redefined the fashion industry. This philosophy continues to inspire the Perry Ellis brand which offers modern style with versatile trend right looks that reflect the way people want to work, play and live today. "We are pleased to expand our collaboration with ACI International.  We currently have a license agreement with them for Perry Ellis men’s and boy’s dress, casual and sport footwear categories.  This new license rounds out the total footwear business," commented George Feldenkreis, Executive Chairman of Perry Ellis International.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
