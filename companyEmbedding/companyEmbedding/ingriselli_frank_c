This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

press release
Texaco Press Release - Texaco Establishes Texaco Technology Ventures; Frank C. Ingriselli Named








Frank C. Ingriselli Named PresidentWill Manage Company's Equity Interest in Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. and Related Joint Ventures in Advanced Energy Technologies
FOR RELEASE: THURSDAY, AUGUST 10, 2000
White Plains, N.Y., Aug. 10 - Texaco (NYSE: TX) announced today establishment of Texaco Technology Ventures (TTV), a new business unit that will manage the company's 20 percent equity interest in Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: ENER). Frank C. Ingriselli has been named President of TTV, effective immediately.
In June Texaco completed the purchase of a 20 percent interest in Energy Conversion Devices, Inc. (ECD) for $67.4 million. At the time of the announcement, the companies also agreed to establish joint ventures for the continued development and commercialization of advanced energy technologies.
In July William M. Wicker, Senior Vice President of Texaco and James R. Metzger, Vice President and Chief Technology Officer of Texaco, were elected to ECD's Board of Directors.
Commenting on the establishment of TTV, Wicker said, "Texaco Technology Ventures will lead Texaco's efforts in the commercialization of ECD's unique energy-related technologies in the areas of fuel cells, photovoltaics, batteries and hydrogen storage. In this manner, Texaco's significant marketing skills, distribution capabilities and capital base can be employed to maximize the value of ECD's technologies. As President of TTV, Frank Ingriselli will play a central role in the continued development of our advanced energy strategies."
Since 1998, Ingriselli has served as Assistant to Management in the office of Senior Vice President William M. Wicker. Ingriselli was graduated from Boston University in 1975 with a bachelor of science degree in business administration. He earned an MBA from New York University in finance and international finance in 1977, and a juris doctorate degree from Fordham University School of Law in 1979.
 Ingriselli joined Texaco in 1979 as a member of the negotiations and contracts group in the Producing - Eastern Hemisphere Department. Following several assignments with increasing responsibility in the Middle East/Far East Division and the Texaco International Exploration Company, Ingriselli was appointed to direct Texaco's Western Siberia Initiative in Russia in 1992. He was named Manager of Upstream Business Development for the Europe Division in 1993, with primary responsibility for identifying new business opportunities in the former Soviet Union. In 1994, Ingriselli led a team that reviewed Texaco's international marine requirements, which led to the formation of a strategic alliance with Stena, a Swedish marine transportation company. Ingriselli was appointed Manager of Texaco's Gorgon/Chrysaor liquefied natural gas project offshore northwest Australia in 1995. In 1996 he was named President and Chief Executive Officer of the Timan Pechora Company LLC, an affiliate joint venture company of Texaco, headquartered in Houston, Texas.
Ingriselli will continue to be located at Texaco's Corporate Center in White Plains, N.Y.

This press release contains a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In particular, statements made concerning Texaco's and TTV's expected performance and financial results in future periods are based upon Texaco's and TTV's current expectations and beliefs and are subject to a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. The following factors known to Texaco and TTV, among others, could cause Texaco's and TTV's actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements: mechanical and technological failures; decreased demand for advanced energies; worldwide and industry economic conditions; inaccurate forecasts of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum product prices; increasing price and product competition; price fluctuations; and higher costs, expenses and interest rates. In addition, you are encouraged to review Texaco's latest reports filed with the SEC, including Texaco's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 24, 2000, which describes a number of additional risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from those listed in the forward-looking statements made in this press release.

Frank C. Ingriselli 


Chairman and CEO, Pacific Energy Development 





With more than 35 years of experience in the energy industry, Frank Ingriselli is a seasoned leader and entrepreneur with wide-ranging exploration and production (E&P) experience in diverse geographies, business climates, and political environments. Mr. Ingriselli is the chairman and CEO of Pacific Energy Development (PEDEVCO Corp.), a publicly-traded energy company listed on the New York Stock Exchange engaged in the acquisition and development of strategic, high-growth energy projects in the United States.
Prior to Pacific Energy Development, Mr. Ingriselli was the founder and CEO of Pacific Asia Petroleum, Inc. (later known as CAMAC Energy Inc.), an energy company listed on the New York Stock Exchange with operations in Africa and China. Mr. Ingriselli also continues to serve as the president and CEO of Global Venture Investments LLC, an energy consulting firm.
Before founding Pacific Asia Petroleum, Mr. Ingriselli spent 23 years at Texaco, Inc. in diverse senior executive positions involving E&P, power and gas operations, merger and acquisition activities, pipeline operations, and corporate development.
Positions Mr. Ingriselli held at Texaco included: president of Texaco Technology Ventures, president and CEO of the Timan Pechora Company, and president of Texaco International Operations, Inc. Mr. Ingriselli also led Texaco’s global initiatives in exploration and development in key new countries, including China and Russia. Among Mr. Ingriselli’s achievements at Texaco was the signing of the first successful international oil contract in China in 1983, which today is still generating over $1 billion per year in revenues.
From 2000 to 2006, Mr. Ingriselli sat on the board of the Electric Drive Transportation Association (where he was also treasurer) and the Angelino Group. He was also an officer of several subsidiaries of Energy Conversion Devices, Inc., a U.S. public corporation engaged in the development and commercialization of environmental energy technologies. From 2001 to 2006, he was a director and officer of General Energy Technologies, Inc., a “technology facilitator” to Chinese industry serving the critical need for advanced energy technology and the growing demand for low-cost, high-quality components, and Eletra Ltd, a Brazilian hybrid electric bus developer.
Mr. Ingriselli is also the founder and executive officer of Brightening Lives Foundation, Inc., a charitable foundation headquartered in San Ramon, California.
Mr. Ingriselli graduated from Boston University in 1975 with a B.S. in business administration. He also earned an M.B.A. from New York University in both finance and international finance in 1977 and a J.D. from Fordham University School of Law in 1979.
