About us








PHI Group Background
Originally incorporated as JR Consulting, Inc., the Company was foremost engaged in mergers and acquisitions.  In 2000 it merged with a California-based financial services company and changed the corporate name to Providential Holdings, Inc. Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc.
During the previous decade, the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and hospitality development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, healthcare and private equity. Recently, the Company has been focused mainly on acquisitions and buyouts as a principal in select industries, investing in special situations that may potentially leapfrog shareholder value, and providing corporate and project finance services, including merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory and consulting services for other companies.

PHI Group Signs Term Sheet for $10 
Million Funding





PNew York, NY, February 28, 2017 -- PHI Group, Inc. (OTC:
PHIL) a U.S. public 
company focusing on acquisitions and investments in natural resources, other 
select industries and special situations (www.phiglobal.com), announced today 
that it has signed a term sheet with Azure Capital (the “Investor”) for a $10 
million equity line facility to fund working capital and potential acquisition 
needs.

According to the term sheet, the Investor will commit to purchase up to 
$10,000,000 of the Company’s stock over the course of 36 months, after a 
registration statement of the Company’s stock has been declared effective by the 
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

The Company may in its discretion draw on the facility from time to time as and 
when the Company determines appropriate in accordance with the terms and 
conditions of the Investment Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement to be 
signed 
by the Investor and the Company. 

Henry Fahman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, "The 
availability of this equity line enables the Company to raise capital as needed 
in a highly efficient manner. The combination of acquisition expenses, budgeting 
for the EB-5 Investor Visa Program, new product development, enhanced marketing 
and other corporate projects warrants that setting up this facility is prudent. 
There are no options or warrants associated with the equity line. We will seek 
to use the equity line, to the extent needed, at such times as are appropriate 
in view of the Company’s needs, market conditions and other factors."

After the signing of the Investment Agreement, the Company will promptly file a 
registration with the SEC. The securities in connection with this equity line 
facility may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the 
registration statement becomes effective. 

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an 
offer to buy any securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in 
any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be 
unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any 
such state or other jurisdiction.

PHI Group Upgrades Trading 
Venue to OTCQB While Aiming for Major Exchange Uplisting In the Future





New York, NY, February 21, 2017 -- PHI Group, Inc. (OTC:
PHIL) a U.S. public 
company focusing on acquisitions and investments in energy, natural resources 
and special situations (www.phiglobal.com) (OTCMarkets:PHIL), has submitted an 
application with the OTC Markets Group to upgrade its trading venue to OTCQB 
while continuing to work towards uplisting to a major exchange in the near 
future.

Historically fully reporting companies current in their filings with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) like PHI Group, Inc. would be included 
on the OTCBB Market, which was regulated by the SEC and overseen by the 
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). However, when FINRA decided not 
to maintain the OTCBB Market as previously, the OTC Markets Group created the 
OTCQB as the middle tier of the OTC market to better distinguish OTC-traded 
companies that have made the substantial commitment to investor disclosure by 
being registered and reporting with a U.S. regulator. Recent changes and 
innovations have also caused the OTC Markets to become more attractive to large 
foreign firms that use it as a means to access U.S. investors. 

As required, each company must verify via an annual OTCQB Certification, signed 
by the company CEO or CFO, that their company information is current, including 
information about a company’s reporting status, company profile, information on 
management and boards, major shareholders, law firms, transfer agents, and IR / 
PR firms. Investor confidence improves when there is more information about a 
company’s ownership structure, professional advisors and service providers. By 
segmenting the OTC marketplace, it is believed that issuers will be motivated to 
provide the highest level of disclosure and compliance that they are capable of 
supplying, which will ultimately lead to more efficient capital allocation by 
investors.

The trading of PHI Group’s stock is expected to be elevated to the OTCQB in the 
next few weeks after satisfactory review by the OTC Markets Group.

Henry Fahman, Chairman and CEO of PHI Group, Inc., stated, “We believe this an 
overdue step in the right direction, to demonstrate our commitment to investor 
disclosure as we prepare to reach a critical mass for uplisting to a national 
exchange in the near future.”

PHI Group Partners With Thai 
Agricultural Company Specializing in Sacha Inchi Products





New York, NY,  Jan 31, 2017 -- PHI Group, Inc. (OTC:
PHIL) a U.S. public 
company focusing on acquisitions and investments in energy, natural resources 
and special situations (www.phiglobal.com) (OTCMarkets:PHIL), has signed a 
Business Cooperation Agreement with Nathan Trading Company Ltd., a Thai company 
specializing in the promotion of the growing of sacha inchi plants and 
processing seeds into finished products (“NTC”), to develop raw material 
sources, production, and marketing and sales of sacha inchi products for 
international markets. 

According to the agreement, PHI will initially purchase NTC’s sacha inchi 
products for sale in several select international markets. NTC and PHI will 
jointly promote the growing of sacha inchi plants and secure harvests for raw 
material from Southeast Asia and other compatible geographical areas as well as 
increase NTC’s production capacity to meet future demand for sacha inchi 
products. PHI also will design and implement marketing and sales strategies for 
NTC’s sacha inchi products in the United States and other international markets.

Originally from the Amazon rainforest and the high Andes Mountains of Peru, 
sacha inchi has been part of the Inca diet for 3,000 years. The sacha inchi 
plant, plukenetia volubilis, a rainforest vine, with star-shaped seed pods, is 
currently cultivated primarily in parts of Southeast Asia and South America. 
Sacha inchi has been recognized for a number of health benefits:

Weight loss: As one of the richest sources of plant-based omega-3 fatty acids, 
sacha inchi nuts can help balance cortisol 
levels. When cortisol levels are controlled, food cravings and mood swings are 
reduced. In fact, medical personality Dr. Oz lists sacha inchi as one of his 
best snacks for weight loss.

Heart health: Medical studies have shown that sacha inchi's high concentration 
and proper balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids reduce the risk of heart 
disease. Its fats are largely monounsaturated and polyunsaturated.
Complete protein: As a complete protein, sacha inchi contains every amino acid 
our body needs to function properly. Sacha inchi provides 9 grams of protein per 
serving.

Bone health: Since sacha inchi is high in omega-3 fatty acids, it can support 
bone structure. Omega-3 fatty acids enhance bone mineral content by helping the 
body absorb calcium. Eating more foods rich in omega-3s can help protect bones 
as people age.

Skin and hair: Sacha inchi nuts provide nutrients that promote supple skin and 
silky hair. Omega-3 fatty acids support hydration and protect against 
inflammation, while the vitamin E found in sacha inchi prevents free radical 
damage that can harm skin.

Dr. Chansamone Saiyasak, President and Managing Director of NTC stated: “We look 
forward to working with PHI Group to promote the cultivation, production and 
consumption of sacha inchi because of its remarkable multiple health benefits 
and to make more of its products available to the global markets.”

Henry Fahman, CEO of PHI Group, said, “We are delighted to partner with NTC in 
this program because sacha inchi fits well into our premium organic farming 
initiative. Sacha inchi can be a very desirable component of specialty foods and 
a superior substitute for current regular cooking oil thanks to the benefits of 
its unparalleled combination of Omega 3, 6 and 9 fatty acids. U.S. sales of 
specialty foods surpassed $120 billion in 2015.”

Ubon Ratchathani, Thailand (www.nathantrad.com).

Agricultural Company Specializing in Cultivation and Processing of Turmeric
 





New York, NY,  Jan 27, 2017 -- PHI Group, Inc. (OTC:
PHIL) a U.S. public 
company focusing on acquisitions and investments in special situations (www.phiglobal.com) 
(OTCMarkets:PHIL), has signed a Memorandum of Agreement to acquire a minimum of 
51% interest in Hoang Minh Chau Hung Yen LLC, a Vietnamese company located in 
Chi Tan Village, Khoai Chau District, Hung Yen Province, Vietnam (“HMC”), that 
specializes in cultivating and processing of turmeric (curcuma longa).

According to the agreement, the Company will pay a combination of cash and stock 
in exchange for a majority interest in HMC. The acquisition is part of the 
Company’s plan to apply the proprietary enhanced bioavailable nutrients and 
natural symbiotic immune system to grow organic turmeric in Hung Yen Province, 
Vietnam and at the same time utilize HMC’s expertise and experience to grow 
premium organic turmeric in the U.S. for Abundant Farms, a PHI Group’s

HMC grows turmeric and buys harvested crops from other local farmers for its 
turmeric processing plant. It produces turmeric powder for food, healthcare and 
beauty supply and also contracts with the Vietnamese Institute of Industrial 
Chemistry to process curcuminoids from turmeric for various usages. 

According to www.webmd.com, turmeric can be used for arthritis, heartburn 
(dyspepsia), joint pain, stomach pain, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, 
bypass surgery, hemorrhage, diarrhea, intestinal gas, stomach bloating, loss of 
appetite, 
jaundice, liver problems, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, stomach 
ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gallbladder disorders, high cholesterol, 
a skin condition called lichen planus, skin inflammation from radiation 
treatment and fatigue and a variety of other ailments.

In food and manufacturing, the essential oil of turmeric is used in perfumes. 
Its resin is used as a flavor and color component in foods.

http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-662-turmeric.aspx?activeingredientid=662

Dong Quang Hoang, Director of HMC stated: “We look forward to working with PHI 
Group to utilize its enhanced bioavailable nutrients and natural symbiotic 
immune system to grow premium organic turmeric in Hung Yen Province to provide 
better quality and yields for our turmeric crops.” 

Henry Fahman, Chairman and CEO of PHI Group, said: “Since traditional turmeric 
rhizomes in Chi Tan Village, Hung Yen Province are among the very best in the 
world in terms of size and curcumin contents, we believe PHI Group’s Abundant 
Farms can greatly benefit from using these seed roots and HMC’s expertise and 
experience in our turmeric farming program.”

About PHI Group, Inc.:

Welcome to PHI GROUP!

Founded in June 1982, PHI Group, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, publicly traded 
and fully reporting with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (trading 
symbol: PHIL).

The Company is primarily engaged in:

Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) as a principal

Investing in special situations, and

Providing advisory and consulting services to international clients

PHI Group has recently engaged a number of private equity firms to turbocharge 
inorganic growth by acquiring cash-flow positive companies that can add 
significant revenues and bottom lines to the Company. The Company expects to 
qualify for uplisting to a U.S. senior exchange like Nasdaq or NYSE after the 
closing of one or more of such acquisitions. 

Business Strategy
Build, acquire, commit and deploy valuable resources with distinctive 
competitive advantages


Acquire, 
participate and compete in attractive businesses that have large, growing market 
potential

Design and implement robust management systems

Provide points of exit for investors through capital appreciation or spin-offs 
of business units

PHI Group Background
Originally incorporated as JR Consulting, Inc., the Company was foremost engaged 
in mergers and acquisitions. In 2000 it merged with a California-based financial 
services company and changed the corporate name to Providential Holdings, Inc. 
Subsequently, in April 2009, the Company changed its name to PHI Group, Inc.

During the previous decade, the Company and its subsidiaries were engaged in 
mergers and acquisitions advisory and consulting services, real estate and 
hospitality development, mining, oil and gas, telecommunications, technology, 
healthcare and private equity. 

Recently, the Company has been focused mainly on acquisitions and buyouts as a 
principal in select industries, investing in special situations that may 
potentially leapfrog shareholder value, and providing corporate and project 
finance services, including merger and acquisition (M&A) advisory and consulting 
services for other companies.

Acquisitions and buyouts

We seek to carry out a robust M&A strategy aimed at creating significant, 
sustainable value for our shareholders and all other stakeholders.

Develop acquisition criteria or strategy to create value for shareholders.
Research, identify and screen potential candidates
Establish contact with promising targets
Engaged buy-side/sell-side advisors, if needed
Valuation of targets
Due diligence of targets
Structure and negotiate transaction terms
Source and arrange for debt and equity financing, if needed
Post-acquisition integration plan

We currently work closely with a number of private equity firms to turbocharge 
inorganic growth by acquiring cash-flow positive companies that can add 
substantial revenues and bottom lines to the Company. These selective 
acquisitions will also serve as platforms for entry into new markets with 
potential for high growth, allowing us to create critical mass through further 
congruous consolidation.

We will actively explore options to add significant value to our acquired 
targets by providing smarter capital, offering managerial oversight, 
transferring valuable skills, and sharing beneficial resources. The Company 
expects to qualify for uplisting to a senior exchange like Nasdaq or NYSE after 
the closing of one or more of such transactions. - See more at: http://phiglobal.com/acquisitions-and-buyouts/#sthash.Z21sHJXW.dpuf

Investment in special situations

We will continue to adroitly seek special investment opportunities that may 
command warranted, justifiably extraordinary profit margins due to product 
and/or service attributes, that may open up new domestic and international 
markets otherwise not available, which are poised for high growth.

One of these opportunities could be a new biotechnology that can revolutionize 
organic farming for fruit, vegetable, medicinal herbs, livestock, poultry, fish 
and shrimp. Another one could be a technological innovation that may offer 
better logistical solutions than Uber and other systems that are already in the 
marketplace.
- See more at: http://phiglobal.com/investment-special-situations/#sthash.LXEqy2iX.dpuf

M&A advisory and consulting services

We work with private and public companies and financial sponsors to analyze 
strategic alternatives, recommend transaction strategies and execute buy-side 
and sell-side transactions. Our M&A advisory and consulting services include 
strategic and transaction advisory and consulting services related to 
acquisitions and divestitures aiming to create enhanced value for clients.

We advise and consult with buyers and sellers of businesses, provide corporate 
restructuring and turnaround management services and deliver post-closing value 
enhancement services to meet our clients’ short-term and long-term strategic 
objectives.

We assist private and public companies with sources of funding and capital 
structure, as well as the tools and analysis used to allocate financial 
resources to help corporate managers increase a firm’s value to the 
shareholders.

Some of the questions a corporate financial officer attempts to answer on a 
consistent basis with respect to capital investment decisions include:

Should a proposed investment be made?
How should the company pay for it; with equity or with debt, or combination of 
both?
Should shareholders be offered dividends on their investment in the company?

We provide analyses and recommendations for corporate managers to make the 
appropriate decisions, deal with short-term issues like the management of 
current assets and current liabilities, inventory control, investments and other 
short-term financial matters, as well as long-term commitments like new capital 
purchases and investments.
