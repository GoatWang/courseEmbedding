Stradella Series
Square with Dome Top

							Ledil
STRADELLA lenses are designed especially with the cost efficiency in mind. The single optics being only 14mm x 14mm and the arrays sharing the same 50mm x 50mm size as the STRADA-2X2 but having 8 or 9 optics attached can offer a huge amount of light from a relatively small area.
