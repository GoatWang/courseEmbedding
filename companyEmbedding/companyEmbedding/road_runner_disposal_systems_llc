Decent benefits.ConsMost your time is spent putting out fires because there is zero forward thinking from top operations management. They'd rather consistently cut corners and have sales go find new business instead of doing the right thing and taking care of current shippers. We work hard to earn the business and they destroy it all by trying to save another few bucks per trailer by having unskilled poorly trained dock workers cram freight in trailers. Their short sightedness of pinching pennies leads to unnecessary damages and lost freight. The $5 they save upfront turns into a $1500 freight claim and tons of phone calls/emails to sales and customer service. Furthermore the revenue stream from that shipper goes up in smoke and the chance future revenue and profits is gone. Company wide customer service is the worst I've ever seen, even Walmart takes better care of their customers. To survive you have to do almost all your own customer service while time could be better spent generating new business.Advice to ManagementStop being so greedy and driving all your business away. If you spend a little more money on the front end putting out a better quality process on handling freight you will avoid the majority of headaches down the line and also grow the business. Being an economy carrier doesn't mean you are allowed to be sloppy and run on skeleton crews. You can hire the right staff at each location, train them well, and even pay them good but if you don't change the culture and ignorance of senior management from the very top you will never succeed.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Roadrunner Transportation Systems Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Roadrunner Transportation Systems 2017-07-09 09:53 PDT Join the Roadrunner Transportation Systems team See Our Latest Jobs Jul 27, 2017"Words that come to mind: Greedy. Shady. Unethical. Immoral. Unstable. Disrespectful."StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Sales Account Executive in Livermore, CAFormer Employee - Sales Account Executive in Livermore, CADoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Roadrunner Transportation Systems full-time (Less than a year)ProsPay was decent (for a sales representative).Submitting expenses was a breeze with the system they use.ConsManagement shifts every 2 months.They don't pay their in-house staff enough money so those people don't care about their job.The terminal I worked in was brand new and beautiful, but the energy was pitiful due to lack of organization, high turn-over rate, and nobody caring about their responsibilities. Must join the "Good ol' boys club" to advance in your career.Upper management treats sales executives and office staff like peons.CEOs have changed since I worked there, but CEO apologized to the sales team who had worked with Roadrunner for more than two years at the sales conference because he admitted it must have been hard for them to sell for a company who, self-admittedly, did not care about the customer, and only cared about profit and making a name on Wall Street. He admitted that the company just refused to pay claims for almost 2 years without explanation to the customer because they wanted to report a higher profit. The only reason they decided to pay the claims was because a lawsuit was finally in place. There, he claimed that things were changing, but in my entire experience, this company let their customers suffer by:A) Not picking up freight, and not explaining why or following upB) Not following through with 90% of what they promised (if a shipment made it to it's destination without issue or damage, that was a miracle... assuming it was ever picked up)C) Not having functioning online systems allowing the customer to track their shipmentsD) Never responding to inquiries of claims, damages, late deliveries, and ANYTHING that required someone to do some research or handle an upset customer. Some of my customers went weeks without a response, IF they ever got one at all.This company is extremely unprofessional and disappointing. If you express that concern, management will assure you that they are doing everything they can to make things right, but then turn their backs and forget what they just said.The systems were a joke. The three systems I was required to use daily did not speak to each other, so data was constantly incorrect. Used an AS400 system. Reporting requirements and formats were constantly being changed, so it made it hard to get into a routine and report accurate information.The compensation structure I had originally began with was altered, and we went 3 months without goals to hit. When they finally DID give us our goals, they told us they could change them whenever they desired based on "trends". This meant that our goals could sky-rocket mid-month if something changed. It also meant that if you brought on a bigger account, you could not collect residual commission because your goals would increase the next month depending on how much that account shipped.We were asked to work accounts that were owned by the house. As a sales person, you are money-driven, and spending time trying to resolve issues in accounts that you cannot benefit from is a waste of time. We were also told that upper management did not want to hear a word about that being an issue and that we were required to do it regardless.The terminal I worked in was a complete train wreck when it came to functionality. It had all the proper mechanisms, but no working system. At one point, the management turn-over rate was 1 week! This made it hard for the terminal manager to do his job. He was constantly training new hires who would quit by the end of the next week. I worked there for a year and this specific issue never seemed to be resolved, and only grew worse.The people who were hired shortly before me who had management roles seemed to be morally sound and were trying to do the right thing by the company and by the customer. I found it funny that those are the people whose "positions were eliminated", only to be replaced by others who seemed to agree with the previous, extremely low customer service standards.No organization. Not solutions-driven. COMMUNICATION was NON-EXISTENT. Problems were always ignored...Advice to ManagementWhere to begin...? Create a culture that is upbeat and energetic. Commit to actually helping the customer (and follow through with it!). Agree to a routine or system that is easy to use and is universal for your teams. Cross-train your office staff. INVEST in a CRM as well as a data base that will communicate to each other and will easily allow visibility to everyone who works there.Treat your staff, sales team, drivers, and everyone who helps make the business model function, like they matter. Positive reinforcement does wonders to boost office moral (it also encourages people and makes them want to continue to do better).TRAINING!!!!! Provide proper training. Do not expect everyone to just know what to do or how to use these ancient computer systems. INVEST all that money you use to show Wall Street that business is getting better, in creating an environment that is organized and well-operated. INVEST in things that will benefit the company long-term (this includes the staff). The band-aid can only stay on for so long before the wound becomes infected...Maybe try to mask the greed and boasting a bit... Y'all are hot-shots and were super cool in your college days... we get it! Try to inspire your employees (you'd be amazed by what sales people can do when they are inspired) instead of making sure they know how awesome you are, or used to be.Keep in mind that your customers make your business. If you don't do the right thing by them first, there is no way the business will sustain. Respond and communicate with them, even when something goes wrong. It's the most important thing to them- the people who essentially pay your bills. They appreciate when upper management cares about their experience. Reputation is everything in this industry.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Roadrunner Transportation Systems Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Roadrunner Transportation Systems 2017-07-27 17:08 PDT Jul 18, 2017"Sinking Ship"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookDisapproves of CEOI have been working at Roadrunner Transportation Systems full-timeProsWill cater to a driver at the expense of a customer.ConsLack of leadership.

But if it wasn't for that I would have been long gone. The benefits are alright but not very competitive anymore.ConsIs there a max amount of characters I can use to describe this?? Hours are always changing. One day you work 7 hours, next day you work over 12. Fridays they beat every last ounce of energy out of you... then your short weekend is shot.
