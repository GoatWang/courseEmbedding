Frequently Asked Questions

What are stocks?

A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.

Stocks are bought and sold electronically through stock exchanges, the two primary ones in the United States being the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASDAQ). 



What is a market order?

There are different types of buy orders that you can place with your brokerage firm. The two most common order types are market orders and limit orders.

A market order tells the broker to buy the shares at the best available price in the market at the time the order is received. 

Pros: Market orders are usually filled quickly. 

Cons: Depending on market conditions, you might pay more for your shares than you expect. 

Example: You might place an order hoping for a share price of $10.00, but if the best available price in the market is $10.03, then your order will be filled at that price. 



What is a limit order?

There are different types of buy orders that you can place with your brokerage firm. The two most common order types are market orders and limit orders.

A limit order tells the broker to buy the shares only at, or below, a price that you specify.

Pros: You won’t pay more than you specify per share.

Cons: Your trade might take some time to be filled, or it might not be placed at all if the share price fails to fall to the level you specify.

Example: A $10.00 limit order will wait until it can be filled at $10.00 or less. If the market price stays above $10.00 over the life of the order, the order might never be filled. 



What is order timing?

When you place an order for a stock, you specify how long the brokerage firm should try to fill your order before giving up and canceling it. Order timing is generally less important with market orders because they tend to be filled quickly, but it can be an important consideration for other order types, such as limit orders. The two most common order timing options are day only and good-till-canceled.

Day-only orders: This type of order stays in force only until the end of the market day (typically 4:00 p.m. ET). If the trade is not filled by the end of the market day, the order will be canceled.

Good-till-canceled orders: This type of order stays in force for an extended period (for 60 calendar days at Schwab). Your broker will try to fill your order throughout each market day during that period.



How do I start trading stocks with Schwab?

You can apply for a Schwab brokerage account here. Once your account is approved and funded, you can place trades online at Schwab.com or using the Schwab Mobile app for smartphones and tablets. You can also place trades with a Schwab representative, over the phone or at one of over 300 branches nationwide.

Schwab Trading Services clients can also place trades using StreetSmart Edge, our most advanced and powerful trading platform. 



What are Schwab’s rules for pre-market and after-hours trading?2

Place stock trading orders pre-market between 8:05 p.m. ET (previous trading day) and 9:25 a.m. ET for execution between 8:00 a.m. and 9:25 a.m. ET. Or place orders post-market between 4:05 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET for execution between 4:15 p.m. and 8:00 p.m. ET.



What minimums are required to open a brokerage or investing account with Schwab?

There is a $1,000 minimum to open a brokerage account with Schwab. The suggested minimum for self-directed investing is $15,000.



How does Schwab handle order execution?

We are constantly evaluating the pricing our clients receive on equity trades and how quickly they are executed. Read all about Schwab’s execution quality  and how we evaluate these measures.

1. Restrictions apply: The $4.95 flat commission does not apply to foreign stock transactions, large block transactions requiring special handling, employer-negotiated commission schedules applicable to equity compensation transactions, or restricted stock transactions. Foreign ordinary shares that trade online in the U.S. over-the-counter (OTC) market and do not settle in the U.S. will have a $50 foreign transaction fee added to the cost of the transaction. All broker-assisted trades are subject to service charges. A minimum deposit of $1,000 is required to open most Schwab brokerage accounts. Waivers may apply. See the Charles Schwab Pricing Guide for details. Employee equity compensation transactions are subject to separate commission schedules.

2. Extended Hours Trading may not be suitable for all investors and poses certain risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, lower liquidity, higher volatility and wider spreads. To learn more call 800-435-4000. 

Schwab Equity Ratings and the general buy/hold/sell guidance are not personal recommendations for any particular investor or client and do not take into account the financial, investment or other objectives or needs of, and may not be suitable for, any particular investor or client. Investors and clients should consider Schwab Equity Ratings as only a single factor in making their investment decision while taking into account the current market environment.

3. Access to electronic services may be limited or unavailable during periods of peak demand, market volatility, systems upgrade, or maintenance, or for other reasons.

4. Not all securities are marginable. Main types that are not marginable include mutual funds for the first 30 days of purchase; unlisted, low-priced, or illiquid equities; and low-rated corporate bonds.Schwab may impose account-level requirements above 30% on concentrated positions.When considering a margin loan, you should determine how the use of margin fits your own investment philosophy. Because of the risks involved, it is important that you fully understand the rules and requirements involved in trading securities on margin:
- Margin trading increases your level of market risk. 
- Your downside is not limited to the collateral value in your margin account. 
- Schwab may initiate the sale of any securities in your account, without contacting you, to meet a margin call. 
- Schwab may increase its “house” maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you with advance written notice. 
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options .International investments are subject to additional risks such as currency fluctuation, political instability, economic risk and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks. Review Schwab’s disclosure statement about margin borrowing. Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund. Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") (Member SIPC) and optionsXpress, Inc. ("optionsXpress") (Member SIPC) are separate but affiliated companies and subsidiaries of The Charles Schwab Corporation. Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. You can request a prospectus by calling 888-311-4887 or by visiting schwab.com/annuity. Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully read the prospectus and consider the investment objectives and all risks, charges, and expenses associated with the annuity and its investment options.The strength of an annuity's guaranteed income stream is dependent upon the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. 

Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Withdrawals prior to age 59½, however, may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty in addition to applicable income taxes. 

The value of a variable annuity may be more or less than the premiums paid and it is possible to lose money.Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a licensed insurance agency, offers annuity products that are issued by leading insurance companies that are not affiliated with Schwab.

 If you have an existing variable annuity, use our Variable Annuity Expense Analyzer to see how much you could save by exchanging it for a low-cost Schwab annuity.1
Before considering an exchange of your current annuity, carefully consider surrender charges on your existing contract, loss of guaranteed benefits, and differences in features, costs, services, and company strength, as well as other factors that could reduce or eliminate the benefit of an exchange.






 
Annuity Frequently Asked Questions


What is an annuity?


Annuities are contracts between you and an insurance company that can provide you income through a unique combination of investment and insurance features. Annuities can complement other retirement plans and, depending on what type you select, they may provide guaranteed lifetime income, opportunities for tax-deferred growth, flexible withdrawals, and legacy protection for your beneficiaries. Guarantees subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. 




How do annuities work?


When purchasing an income annuity your assets become a guaranteed income stream for life, or for a specific period of time. Many clients purchase income annuities to cover their essential expenses, as defined by them, in retirement. For an additional cost, income annuities may offer a cost-of-living-adjustment, increasing your income each year, to help address inflation risk. 

Charles Schwab offers two types of income annuities: Single premium immediate annuities and deferred income annuities. The key difference between these two product types is when income begins. For single premium immediate annuities income generally begins “immediately”, whereas deferred income annuities, the income doesn't begin for at least 13 months from your last premium payment, but may be deferred by up to 40 years.
Fixed annuities, sometimes referred to as fixed deferred annuities, provide guaranteed asset growth at a fixed rate for a specific time period. The growth is tax-deferred which can help you accumulate more assets instead of paying taxes during the accumulation phase, and your assets are protected from market uncertainty. If you elect to receive guaranteed income, you can choose income for life or for a specific time period. 
Fixed indexed annuities provide principal protection with the option for fixed rate returns (similar to a fixed annuity), or capped growth dependent on a preselected market index over a specific period of time – you are not directly invested in the market. If the index is up then yield is credited to your account up to a capped percentage. If the index is down then your principal will not lose value (i.e. 0% return). The growth is tax-deferred which can help you accumulate more assets instead of paying taxes during the accumulation phase. If you elect to receive guaranteed income, you can choose income for life or a specific time period.
With a variable annuity, investments, often called sub-accounts, are chosen from within the annuity. The performance of the investments determines the value of the account and subsequently, the amount of income you will receive. The growth of the investments is tax-deferred which can help you accumulate more, instead of paying taxes during the accumulation phase. If you elect to receive guaranteed income, you can choose income for life or for a specific time period. 




What is the difference between fixed, fixed indexed, and variable annuities?


A fixed annuity provides principal protection with the stability of a fixed, guaranteed rate of return. Fixed indexed annuities offer principal protection with the opportunity to earn an attractive capped rate of return based a preselected market index, and you are not directly invested in the market. Variable annuities do not offer principal protection, but offer the potential for uncapped growth with a chance to participate in the market through a variety of professionally managed portfolios. Guarantees subject to the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.




What kinds of annuities does Charles Schwab offer?


Charles Schwab offers income annuities (single premium immediate annuities and deferred income annuities), fixed deferred annuities, fixed indexed annuities and low cost variable annuities1. The fixed indexed annuities and variable annuities offer an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB).
Income annuities provide guaranteed lifetime income or income for a specific period of time that you choose. A single premium immediate annuity provides income “immediately.” A deferred income annuity provides income at a future date that you select.
Fixed deferred annuities deliver guaranteed growth and principal protection of your assets.
Fixed indexed annuities may provide (a) principal protection of your assets, (b) market capped growth, (c) guaranteed lifetime income, (d) guaranteed death benefit options, and (e) tax-deferred growth potential. 

Low-cost variable annuities1 may provide (a) guaranteed lifetime income, (b) guaranteed death benefit options, (c) a variety of investment options, and (d) tax-deferred growth potential.




When might an annuity be a good option for your situation?


Depending on your needs, annuities may be a good addition to your financial plan.

Income annuities may be a fit if you're seeking a guaranteed, steady stream of income you can't outlive. The guaranteed lifetime income may help cover essential expenses in retirement, as defined by you, regardless of how long you live. If you need income "immediately", a single premium immediate annuity may be right for you. If you need income in the future, a deferred income annuity may be more appropriate. 

A fixed deferred annuity may be a good fit if you are looking for guaranteed growth, principal protection, and have other funds for near-term (at least three-years) liquidity needs.

Fixed indexed annuities allow you to protect your principal with the opportunity to generate market capped growth, and may provide protection of lifetime income for you and your spouse with an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit3, available for an additional cost. Additionally, fixed indexed annuities provide the potential for tax-deferred investment growth, and, with an optional death benefit, may provide you with the confidence in knowing your assets are protected for your beneficiaries4. 

Low-cost variable annuities1 through Schwab offer the ability to withdraw your assets at any time without surrender charges2, and may provide protection of lifetime income for you and your spouse with an optional guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit3, available for an additional cost. Additionally, variable annuities provide the potential for tax-deferred investment growth, and, with an optional death benefit, may provide you with the confidence in knowing your assets are protected for your beneficiaries4. 

A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuities would fit your financial plan. If you already have an annuity and feel it may not be meeting your current needs, a Schwab Financial Consultant can perform an analysis to determine whether it may make sense to exchange your current annuity to one at Schwab. 

Before deciding to replace your existing contract, however, please consider any surrender charges on your existing contract; possible loss of guaranteed benefits; differences in features, costs, services, and company strength; and other factors which could reduce or eliminate the benefit of the exchange.




What should I be aware of?


Annuity fees will vary depending on the product. Typically you will see insurance charges (pays for the guarantees that the insurance company provides), surrender charges (charges on an early withdrawal based on the time period of the policy or cancellation of the policy), investment fees (pays for the management of the underlying investment options), and fees for optional living benefits or optional death benefits.  
Withdrawals from an annuity will reduce the value of your annuity, and withdrawals of taxable amounts are subject to ordinary income tax. Also, note that withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty. 
The performance of the underlying investment options are subject to market fluctuation and are not guaranteed. 
A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuities may fit your retirement strategy.




How are annuities taxed?


Annuity earnings are tax-deferred during the accumulation phase, which means you do not pay taxes on any earnings each year; you pay taxes on earnings only when you withdraw your money. Any withdrawals of taxable amounts are taxed as ordinary income, and you may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty if you take them before age 59½. 




How do annuities compare to other retirement options?


Charles Schwab offers various financial tools to help you with your retirement and planning. Work with your Financial Consultant to determine which product or products are a good fit for you.




How might annuities benefit my heirs?


Many annuities have death benefits and optional death benefits. Optional death benefits are available for an additional cost. 
An account value death benefit will provide your beneficiaries the amount of your remaining contract value, if any. 
A return of premium or purchase payments death benefit provides your beneficiaries with the greater of the account value or the total premium payments less withdrawals. Premium taxes may apply. 
A stepped-up death benefit offers you the potential to lock in market gains for your beneficiaries. Adjustments are made for additional premium payments and withdrawals. 

A roll-up death benefit guarantees an annual growth rate credited to your contract for your beneficiaries. Adjustments are made for additional premium payments or withdrawals.




What goes into getting an annuity?


A Schwab Financial Consultant can help you determine which annuities may fit your retirement strategy.


Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. You can request a prospectus by calling 888-311-4887 or by visiting schwab.com/annuity. Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully read the prospectus and consider the investment objectives and all risks, charges, and expenses associated with the annuity and its investment options.1. Base annuity fee of 0.65% for the Schwab OneSource Choice Variable Annuity and base annuity fee of 0.60% for the Schwab Retirement. Income Variable Annuity compared to the 1.32% industry average according to a February 16, 2017, Morningstar survey of 2,192 variable annuities. This does not include fees associated with the optional death benefits, GLWB, or underlying investment options.

2. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty, in addition to applicable income taxes.

3. A guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit is not a contract value and is not available for withdrawal like a cash value. The actual contract value will deplete with each withdrawal.4. Optional death benefits will generally terminate if the contract is annuitized. Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. The value of a variable annuity may be more or less than the premiums paid and it is possible to lose money.

What kind of investment products does Schwab offer?


                    Our wide selection of investment products provides you with the numerous choices in building a diversified portfolio to help reach your goals.
                  



Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

                      1. Unlimited ATM fee rebates apply to cash withdrawals using the Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum debit card (also referred to as a "check card" or "Visa check card") wherever it is accepted. ATM fee rebates do not apply to any fees other than fees assessed for using an ATM to withdraw cash from your Schwab Bank account. Schwab Bank makes its best effort to identify those ATM fees eligible for rebate, based on information it receives from Visa and ATM operators. In the event that you have not received a rebate for a fee that you believe is eligible, please call a Schwab Bank Client Service Specialist for assistance at 888-403-9000. Schwab Bank reserves the right to modify or discontinue the ATM fee rebate at any time.
                      

                      2. Schwab Bank does not assess foreign transaction fees (i.e., a fee to convert US Dollars to local currency) to debit cardholders.
                      

                        3. Funds deposited at Charles Schwab Bank are insured, in aggregate, up to $250,000 based on account ownership type, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
                      

                        Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking accounts are available only as linked accounts with Schwab One® accounts.

An ETF, or exchange traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds or commodities. Most ETFs track market indexes, from the very broad to the very narrow. ETFs aren't purchased or sold once a day like a mutual fund, but instead trade like stocks on an exchange and experience price changes throughout the day as shares are bought and sold from one investor to another.

Learn More About Choosing an ETF So you're thinking about investing in an exchanged-traded fund.  You've decided on the asset class you want to invest in, and you found a few ETFs that could be right for your portfolio, but how do you know which of those ETFs is the right ETF for you?  Start by asking yourself these five important questions about any ETF you're considering.  Let's take them one-by-one. 
First, what's the expense ratio?  When you're choosing an ETF cost is an important factor.  The expense ratio is the percentage of fund assets that are deducted every year to cover management fees.  Check to make sure that your ETF has an expense ratio that's low compared to other funds in the same category.  
Question 2:  What will you pay in trade commission?  Trade commission is the second part of the cost equation.  It's the fee you pay every time you buy or sell an ETF.  Look for a low commission or no commission at all, if possible.  
Question 3:  What's the bid/ask spread?  The bid/ask spread is another cost.  This is the difference between the ETF's bid price, which is the price a buyer is willing to pay for a share, and its ask price, which is the price a seller is willing to accept for a share.  Often, the more an ETF is traded, the smaller the bid/ask spread, and the smaller the bid/ask spread, the more of your money goes to the actual investment, which is better for you.  Look for a spread of just a few pennies.
Question 4:  What are the fund's total assets under management?  You've considered the cost of your ETF.  Now, look at the quality.  Assets under management refers to the amount of money that's already been invested in the ETF.  It's a pretty good indicator of the fund's viability.  Schwab's experts prefer ETFs that have at least $20 million in assets, and, preferably, much more. In general, the more assets under management, the better.
Question 5:  How do the ETF's returns compare to its benchmarks' returns?  What you want to see is the ETFs performance tracking closely to the performance of its benchmark over time.  If there are significant differences between the two sets of returns, it could mean that you're looking at a potentially riskier investment. 
So those are our five questions.  Let's see how asking them can help you decide between two similar ETFs from the same asset class.  We'll take two hypothetical ETFs and ask what's the expense ratio, the trade commission, the bid/ask spread, what are the assets under management, and how well do its returns track to the benchmark?  While this is a simple example, working through these five questions really can help you see which ETF might be a better pick.  
Ready to find the ETF that's right for your portfolio?  Schwab's ETF evaluation tools are a great place to start.  You'll find them at Schwab.com/ETFTools.  And if you need help as you choose the right ETF for you, just call us at 877-769-8003.

Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

                      1. Unlimited ATM fee rebates apply to cash withdrawals using the Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum debit card (also referred to as a "check card" or "Visa check card") wherever it is accepted. ATM fee rebates do not apply to any fees other than fees assessed for using an ATM to withdraw cash from your Schwab Bank account. Schwab Bank makes its best effort to identify those ATM fees eligible for rebate, based on information it receives from Visa and ATM operators. In the event that you have not received a rebate for a fee that you believe is eligible, please call a Schwab Bank Client Service Specialist for assistance at 888-403-9000. Schwab Bank reserves the right to modify or discontinue the ATM fee rebate at any time.
                      

                      2. Schwab Bank does not assess foreign transaction fees (i.e., a fee to convert US Dollars to local currency) to debit cardholders.
                      

                        3. Funds deposited at Charles Schwab Bank are insured, in aggregate, up to $250,000 based on account ownership type, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
                      

                        Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking accounts are available only as linked accounts with Schwab One® accounts.

A mutual fund is an investment vehicle comprised of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds and other securities. When you purchase a mutual fund, you get exposure to all the investments in that fund. Mutual funds make it easy to build a diversified portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.

With thousands of mutual funds to invest in on the market, it can be difficult to find the right mutual funds for your portfolio. Schwab makes investing in mutual funds easier. We have the tools to research, compare and trade mutual funds all in one place.

What kind of investment products does Schwab offer?


                    Our wide selection of investment products provides you with the numerous choices in building a diversified portfolio to help reach your goals.
                  



Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

Brokerage and Insurance Products: Are Not Deposits • Are Not FDIC-Insured • Are Not Insured By Any Federal Government Agency • Are Not Guaranteed By the Bank or Affiliates of the Bank • May Lose Value

1. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. and Charles Schwab Bank are separate but affiliated companies and subsidiaries of The Charles Schwab Corporation. Brokerage products are offered by Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., member SIPC. Deposit and lending products and services are offered by Charles Schwab Bank, member FDIC and an Equal Housing Lender. 

Schwab’s short-term redemption fee of $49.95 will be charged on redemption of funds purchased through Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource® service (and certain other funds with no transaction fees) and held for 90 days or less. Schwab reserves the right to exempt certain funds from this fee, including Schwab Funds®, which may charge a separate redemption fee, and funds that accommodate short-term trading. For trade orders placed through a broker, a $25 service charge applies. Funds are also subject to management fees and expenses.

Trades in no-load mutual funds available through Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource service (including Schwab Funds), as well as trades in certain other funds, are available without transaction fees when placed through Schwab.com or our automated phone channels. For each of these trade orders placed through a broker, a $25 service charge applies. Schwab reserves the right to change the funds we make available without transaction fees and to reinstate fees on any funds. Funds are also subject to management fees and expenses.

Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., member SIPC, receives remuneration from fund companies participating in the Mutual Fund OneSource service for recordkeeping and shareholder services and other administrative services. Schwab also may receive remuneration from transaction fee fund companies for certain administrative services.2.

3. Access to electronic services may be limited or unavailable during periods of peak demand, market volatility, systems upgrade, or maintenance, or for other reasons.

4. Not all securities are marginable. Main types that are not marginable include mutual funds for the first 30 days of purchase; unlisted, low-priced, or illiquid equities; and low-rated corporate bonds.Schwab may impose account-level requirements above 30% on concentrated positions.When considering a margin loan, you should determine how the use of margin fits your own investment philosophy. Because of the risks involved, it is important that you fully understand the rules and requirements involved in trading securities on margin:
- Margin trading increases your level of market risk. 
- Your downside is not limited to the collateral value in your margin account. 
- Schwab may initiate the sale of any securities in your account, without contacting you, to meet a margin call. 
- Schwab may increase its “house” maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not required to provide you with advance written notice. 
- You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call.Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options .International investments are subject to additional risks such as currency fluctuation, political instability, economic risk and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks. Review Schwab’s disclosure statement about margin borrowing. Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund. Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. ("Schwab") (Member SIPC) and optionsXpress, Inc. ("optionsXpress") (Member SIPC) are separate but affiliated companies and subsidiaries of The Charles Schwab Corporation. Variable annuities are sold by prospectus only. You can request a prospectus by calling 888-311-4887 or by visiting schwab.com/annuity. Before purchasing a variable annuity, you should carefully read the prospectus and consider the investment objectives and all risks, charges, and expenses associated with the annuity and its investment options.The strength of an annuity's guaranteed income stream is dependent upon the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. 

Variable annuities are long-term investment vehicles designed for retirement purposes. Withdrawals prior to age 59½, however, may be subject to a 10% Federal tax penalty in addition to applicable income taxes. 

The value of a variable annuity may be more or less than the premiums paid and it is possible to lose money.Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., a licensed insurance agency, offers annuity products that are issued by leading insurance companies that are not affiliated with Schwab. Not all annuity contracts are available in every state. 
Brokerage Products: Not FDIC Insured • No Bank Guarantee • May Lose Value

When trading as principal, Schwab may also be holding the security in its own account prior to selling it to you and, therefore, may make (or lose) money depending on whether the price of the security has risen or fallen while Schwab has held it. Schwab will not act as both principal and agent simultaneously in the same transaction.
Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor's shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
No load mutual fund conditions:

Schwab's short-term redemption fee of $49.95 will be charged on redemption of funds purchased through Schwab's Mutual Fund OneSource® service (and certain other funds with no transaction fee) and held for 90 days or less. Schwab reserves the right to exempt certain funds from this fee, including Schwab Funds®, which may charge a separate redemption fee, and funds that accommodate short-term trading.
            Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., member SIPC, receives remuneration from fund companies participating in Schwab's Mutual Fund OneSource® service for record keeping, shareholder services and other administrative services. Schwab also may receive remuneration from transaction fee fund companies for certain administrative services.
Trades in no-load mutual funds available through Mutual Fund OneSource (including SchwabFunds) as well as certain other funds, are available without transaction fees when placed through schwab.com or our automated phone channels. For each of these trade orders placed through a broker, a $25 service charge applies. Schwab reserves the right to change the funds we make available without transaction fees and to reinstate fees on any funds. Funds are also subject to management fees and expenses.

Review commentary on issues facing today’s investors, like:

Dollar Decline: Time to Shift to International Bonds? Maybe Notby Kathy A JonesJuly 12, 2017
	The U.S. dollar weakened in the first half of 2017, leading some investors to wonder whether a key attraction of U.S. bonds is likely to fade away—and whether they should consider investing in international developed market bonds instead. Here’s what investors should know.

Corporate Bond Market Mid-Year Outlook: Further Price Gains Unlikely This Year by Collin MartinJuly 06, 2017
	Rising prices drove corporate fixed income returns in the first half of the year, but don’t expect that to continue. Coupon payments will likely drive returns the rest of the year

Straightforward, easy-to-understand pricing.
At Schwab, you’ll know up front the transaction costs of buying bonds. And unlike many brokers, we itemize bond costs, so you know exactly what you’re paying—trade confirmations clearly identify markups and commissions.
Low online pricing.*

$1 per bond markup on most secondary market trades; no markups on secondary Treasuries
Low expense ratios and $0 commission trading2,3 on Schwab Bond ETFs in your Schwab account; $4.95 for third-party ETFs
Hundreds of no-load, no-transaction-fee bond mutual funds

*Schwab uses the same pricing schedule for bond sell orders, which must be placed through a broker and are subject to a $25 broker-assisted transaction fee.

Why invest in fixed income investments?
Whether your goal is to diversify your investments, save for the future, receive dependable income, or minimize taxes, fixed income investments may have a place in your portfolio.
Diversification
Adding investment-grade bonds to a stock portfolio can help lower the portfolio's volatility over time.
Capital preservation
Research shows that since 1976, negative annual returns have been uncommon in a broadly diversified bond portfolio.
Receive dependable income
Fixed income securities are typically designed to provide a regular stream of interest payments. See how bonds pay income.
Gain potential tax benefits
Many bonds have preferential tax treatment under which coupon payments are tax-free at either the federal or state level, or both. So it’s important to know how tax treatment varies by bond type.
More Reasons to Invest in Fixed Income 






Easily find and manage your fixed income investments.

Identify the right fixed income investments for you using Schwab BondSource®, which lets you screen more than 50,000 bonds from more than 200 dealers.2 Schwab also simplifies managing your portfolio by providing you access to an extensive number of resources.
