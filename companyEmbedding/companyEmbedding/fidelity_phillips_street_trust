All ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntary basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. Featured reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and have been reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted). Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the Web site (after a delay for screening against guidelines), and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.   The ratings and experiences of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and are not indicative of future success.

Tell the shareholder that a new package will be mailed to him/her. Ask the shareholder to review the material upon

If YES: Do you have any questions?

If YES: Only answer questions using the proxy material.  (See attached list of approved Q&A). (DO NOT

Script for Leaving a Message on an Answering Machine

Hello, Mr./Ms. (Shareholder). My name is ___________.  I am calling on behalf of Fidelity Investments regarding the
Fidelity Daily Income Trust proxy mailing they sent you recently.  I'm assisting Fidelity in connection with the proxy
vote to approve several important proposals that affect these funds. I've been asked to let you know that your proxy
vote is urgently needed .

To vote, please sign, date and mail the proxy card in the return envelope provided to you.  For touch tone voting,
please see your proxy card. For independent, representative assisted voting, please call 1- 800-848-3155.  Thank
you very much.

If you have any questions  please call Fidelity at 1-800 544-3198.

Important information to help you understand and vote on the proposals

Please read the full text of the enclosed proxy statement.  Below is a brief overview of the proposals to be voted upon.  Your
vote is important.  We appreciate you placing your trust in Fidelity and look forward to helping you achieve your financial
goals.

What proposal am I being asked to vote on?

Shareholders of the fund are being asked to vote on the following proposal:

1.  To approve an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Agreement) between Fidelity Union Street Trust II and
Fidelity Phillips Street Trust providing for the merger of Fidelity Daily Income Trust into Fidelity Cash Reserves.

What is the reason for and advantages of this merger?

The proposed merger would simplify the Fidelity money market product line and provide
shareholders of Fidelity Daily Income Trust with an opportunity to participate in a larger fund
with similar investment objective and policies, a lower, less volatile management fee and
generally lower expected total expenses.  The funds have had comparable performance, with
Fidelity Cash Reserves slightly outperforming Fidelity Daily Income Trust in each of the last
six years.  Please keep in mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Do the funds being merged have similar investment policies?

Yes.  Both Fidelity Daily Income Trust and Fidelity Cash Reserves seek as high a level of current income as is consistent with
the preservation of capital and liquidity.

Is the merger considered a taxable event for federal income tax purposes?

Typically, the exchange of shares in a fund merger transaction does not result in a gain or loss for federal income tax purposes.

How will you determine the number of shares of Fidelity Cash Reserves that I will receive?

As of the close of business of the New York Stock Exchange on the Closing Date of the merger, a shareholder will receive the
number of full and fractional shares of Fidelity Cash Reserves that is equal to the number of full and fractional shares of Fidelity
Daily Income Trust held by the shareholder on that date.  The anticipated merger date is June 21, 2001.

What if there are not enough votes to reach quorum by the scheduled shareholder meeting date? 

To facilitate receiving sufficient votes, we will need to take further action.  We, or D.F. King & Co., Inc., a proxy solicitation
firm, may contact you by mail or telephone.  Therefore, we encourage shareholders to vote as soon as they review the enclosed
proxy materials to avoid additional mailings or telephone calls.

If there are not sufficient votes to approve the proposal by the time of the Shareholder Meeting (June 13, 2001), the meeting
may be adjourned to permit further solicitation of proxy votes.

Has the fund's Board of Trustees approved the proposal?

Yes.  The Board of Trustees has unanimously approved the merger proposal and recommends that you vote to approve the
merger.

How many votes am I entitled to cast?

As a shareholder, you are entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value you own of Fidelity Daily Income Trust on the
record date.  The record date is April 27, 2001.

How do I vote my shares?

You can vote your shares by completing and signing the enclosed proxy card, and mailing it in the enclosed postage paid
envelope.  If you need any assistance, or have any questions regarding the proposal or how to vote your shares, please call
Fidelity at 800-544-3198.

How do I sign the proxy card?

Individual Accounts:  Shareholders should sign exactly as their names appear on the account registration shown on the card.

Joint Accounts:  Either owner may sign, but the name of the person signing should conform exactly to a name shown in
the registration.

All Other Accounts:  The person signing must indicate his or her capacity.  For example, a trustee for a trust or other entity
should sign, "Ann B. Collins, Trustee."

The fund is subject to the following principal investment risks:                

(small solid bullet) INTEREST RATE CHANGES. Interest rate increases             
can cause the price of a money market security to decrease.                     

(small solid bullet) FOREIGN EXPOSURE. Entities located in foreign              
countries can be affected by adverse political, regulatory, market or           
economic developments in those countries.                                       

(small solid bullet) FINANCIAL SERVICES EXPOSURE. Changes in                    
government regulation    and interest rates and     economic downturns          
can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the financial              
services sector.                                                                

(small solid bullet) ISSUER-SPECIFIC CHANGES. A decline in the credit           
quality of an issuer or the provider of credit support or a                     
maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a           
money market security to decrease.

value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose             
money by investing in the fund.

Through     arrangements with the fund's custodian and transfer           
agent   ,     credits realized as a result of uninvested cash balances          
are used to reduce custodian and transfer agent expenses. Including             
these reductions, the total fund operating expenses would have been             
0.40    % for    U.S. Government Reserves    .                            

This EXAMPLE helps you compare the cost of investing in the funds with          
the cost of investing in other mutual funds.                                    

Let's say, hypothetically, that each fund's annual return is 5% and             
that your shareholder fees and each fund's annual operating expenses            
are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates             
the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or          
expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For               
every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total

DESCRIPTION OF PRINCIPAL SECURITY TYPES                                         

MONEY MARKET SECURITIES are high-quality, short-term    securities              
that pay a fixed, variable   ,     or floating interest rate.                   
Securities are often specifically structured so that they are eligible          
investments for a money market fund. For example, in order to satisfy           
the maturity restrictions for a money market fund, some money market            
securities have demand or put features   ,     which have the effect            
of shortening the security's maturity   .     Money market securities           
include bank certificates of deposit, bank acceptances, bank time               
deposits, notes, commercial pape   r,     and U.S. Government                   
securities.                                                                     

U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES are high-quality securities issued or                
guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or by an agency or instrumentality of           
the U.S. Government. U.S. Government securities may be backed by the            
full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury, the right to borrow from            
the U.S. Treasury, or the agency or instrumentality issuing or                  
guaranteeing the security.                                                      

A REPURCHASE AGREEMENT is an agreement to buy a security at one price           
and a simultaneous agreement to sell it back at an agreed-upon price.           

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS                                                      

Many factors affect each fund's performance. A fund's yield will                
change daily based on changes in interest rates and other market                
conditions. Although each fund is managed to maintain a stable $1.00            
share price, there is no guarantee that the fund will be able to do             
so. For example, a major increase in interest rates or a decrease in            
the credit quality of the issuer of one of a fund's investments could           
cause the fund's share price to decrease. While the funds will be               
charged premiums by a mutual insurance company for coverage of                  
specified types of losses related to default or bankruptcy on certain           
securities, a fund may incur losses regardless of the insurance. It is          
important to note that neither the fund   s    ' share prices nor               
their yields are guaranteed by the U.S. Government.                             

The following factors can significantly affect a fund's performance:            

INTEREST RATE CHANGES. Money market securities have varying levels of           
sensitivity to changes in interest rates. In general, the price of a            
money market security can fall when interest rates rise and can rise            
when interest rates fall. Securities with longer maturities and the             
securities of issuers in the financial services    sector     can be            
more sensitive to interest rate changes. Short-term securities tend to          
react to changes in short-term interest rates.                                  

FOREIGN EXPOSURE. Issuers located in foreign countries and entities             
located in foreign countries that provide credit support or a                   
maturity-shortening structure can involve increased risks. Extensive            
public information about the issuer or provider may not be available            
and unfavorable political, economic   ,     or governmental                     
developments could affect the value of the security.                            

FINANCIAL SERVICES EXPOSURE. Financial services companies are highly            
dependent on the supply of short-term financing. The value of                   
securities of issuers in the financial services sector can be                   
sensitive to changes in government regulation and interest rates and            
to economic downturns in the United States and abroad.                          

ISSUER-SPECIFIC CHANGES. Changes in the financial condition of an               
issuer, changes in specific economic or political conditions that               
affect a particular type of issuer, and changes in general economic or          
political conditions can affect the credit quality or value of an               
issuer's securities. Entities providing credit support or a                     
maturity-shortening structure also can be affected by these types of            
changes. If the structure of a security fails to function as intended,          
the security could decline in value.                                            

FUNDAMENTAL INVESTMENT POLICIES                                                 

The policies discussed below are fundamental, that is, subject to               
change only by shareholder approval.                                            

CASH RESERVES seeks as high a level of current income as is consistent          
with preservation of capital and liquidity by investing in money                
market instruments.                                                             

U.S. GOVERNMENT RESERVES seeks as high a level of current income as is          
consistent with the security of principal and liquidity. The fund may           
engage in repurchase agreements secured by obligations issued or                
guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States                    
Government or by any of its agencies or instrumentalities.                      

VALUING SHARES                                                                  

Each fund is open for business each day the New York Stock Exchange             
(NYSE) is open.                                                                 

Each fund's net asset value per share (NAV) is the value of a single            
share. Fidelity(registered trademark) normally calculates each fund's           
NAV as of the close of business of the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m.                 
Eastern time. However, NAV may be calculated earlier if trading on the          
NYSE is restricted or as permitted by the Securities and Exchange               
Commission (SEC). Each fund's assets are valued as of this time for             
the purpose of computing the fund's NAV.                                        

To the extent that each fund's assets are traded in other markets on            
days when the NYSE is closed, the value of the fund's assets may be             
affected on days when the fund is not open for business. In addition,           
trading in some of a fund's assets may not occur on days when the fund          
is open for business.                                                           

Each fund's assets are valued on the basis of amortized cost.

sellin   g    , and exchanging shares of a fund and the account

your investment in a fund, including a transaction fee if you buy or            
sell shares of the fund through a broker or other investment                    
professional.                                                                   

Certain methods of contacting Fidelity, such as by telephone or

BUYING SHARES                                                                   

The price to buy one share of each fund is the fund's NAV. Each fund's          
shares are sold without a sales charge.                                         

Your shares will be bought at the next NAV calculated after your                
investment is received in proper form.                                          

Short-term or excessive trading into and out of a fund may harm                 
performance by disrupting portfolio management strategies and by                
increasing expenses. Accordingly, a fund may reject any purchase                
orders, including exchanges, particularly from market timers or                 
investors who, in FMR's opinion, have a pattern of short-term or                
excessive trading or whose trading has been or may be disruptive to             
that fund. For these purposes, FMR may consider an investor's trading           
history in that fund or other Fidelity funds, and accounts under                
common ownership or control.                                                    

Each fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares only          
on a limited basis, for a period of time or permanently.                        

When you place an order to buy shares, note the following:                      

(small solid bullet) All of your purchases must be made in U.S.                 
dollars and checks must be drawn on U.S. banks.                                 

(small solid bullet) Fidelity does not accept cash.                             

(small solid bullet) When making a purchase with more than one check,           
each check must have a value of at least $50.                                   

(small solid bullet) Fidelity reserves the right to limit the number

(small solid bullet) If your check does not clear, your purchase will           
be canceled and you could be liable for any losses or fees a fund or            
Fidelity has incurred.

The price to sell one share of each fund is the fund's NAV.                     

Your shares will be sold at the next NAV calculated after your order            
is received in proper form.

protect you and Fidelity from fraud. Your request must be made in               
writing and include a signature guarantee if any of the following               
situations apply:

(small solid bullet) The check is being mailed to a different address

(small solid bullet) The check is being made payable to someone other           
than the account owner; or                                                      

(small solid bullet) The redemption proceeds are being transferred to           
a Fidelity account with a different registration.                               

You should be able to obtain a  signature guarantee from a bank,                
broker (including Fidelity Investor Centers), dealer, credit union (if          
authorized under state law), securities exchange or association,                
clearing agency, or savings association. A notary public cannot                 
provide a signature guarantee.                                                  

When you place an order to sell shares, note the following:                     

(small solid bullet) If you are selling some but not all of your                
shares, leave at least $2,000 worth of shares in the account to keep            
it open ($500 for retirement accounts), except accounts not subject to          
account minimums.                                                               

(small solid bullet) Normally, Fidelity will process redemptions by             
the next business day, but Fidelity may take up to seven days to                
process redemptions if making immediate payment would adversely affect          
a fund.                                                                         

(small solid bullet) Redemption proceeds (other than exchanges) may be

redemption has been received and collected. This can take up to seven           
business days    after a purchase.

(small solid bullet) Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or           
other    property     rather than in cash if    FMR     determines it           
is in the best interests of a fund.                                             

(small solid bullet) If you sell shares by writing a check and the              
amount of the check is greater than the value of your account, your             
check will be returned to you and you may be subject to additional              
charges.

EXCHANGING SHARES                                                               

An exchange involves the redemption of all or a portion of the shares           
of one fund and the purchase of shares of another fund.                         

As a shareholder, you have the privilege of exchanging shares of a              
fund for shares of other Fidelity funds.                                        

However, you should note the following policies and restrictions                
governing exchanges:                                                            

(small solid bullet) The fund you are exchanging into must be                   
available for sale in your state.                                               

(small solid bullet) You may exchange only between accounts that are            
registered in the same name, address, and taxpayer identification               
number.                                                                         

(small solid bullet) Before exchanging into a fund, read its                    
prospectus.                                                                     

(small solid bullet) Exchanges may have tax consequences for you.               

(small solid bullet) Currently, there is no limit on the number of              
exchanges out of a fund.                                                        

(small solid bullet) Each fund may refuse exchange purchases by any             
person or group if, in FMR's judgment, the fund would be unable to              
invest the money effectively in accordance with its investment                  
objective and policies, or would otherwise potentially be adversely             
affected.                                                                       

The funds may terminate or modify the exchange privileges in the                
future.                                                                         

Other funds may have different exchange restrictions,        and may            
impose trading fees of up to 3.00% of the amount exchanged. Check each          
fund's prospectus for details.

AUTOMATIC INVESTMENT        PROGRAMS. Fidelity offers convenient                
services that let you automatically transfer money into your account            
or between accounts. While automatic investment programs do not                 
guarantee a profit and will not protect you against loss in a                   
declining market, they can be an excellent way to invest for                    
retirement, a home, educational expenses, and other long-term                   
financial goals. Automatic exchange programs can be a convenient way            
to move money between your investments.

The following policies apply to you as a shareholder.                           

STATEMENTS AND REPORTS that Fidelity sends to you include the                   
following:                                                                      

(small solid bullet) Confirmation statements (after transactions                
affecting your account balance except reinvestment of distributions in          
the fund or another fund and certain transactions through automatic             
investment or withdrawal programs).                                             

(small solid bullet) Monthly or quarterly account statements                    
(detailing account balances and all transactions completed during the

(small solid bullet) Financial reports (every six months).                      

To reduce expenses, only one copy of most financial reports and                 
prospectuses will be mailed to your household, even if you have more            
than one account in a fund. Call Fidelity at 1-800-544-8544 if you              
need additional copies of financial reports or prospectuses.                    

Electronic copies of most financial reports and prospectuses are                
available at Fidelity's Web site. To participate in Fidelity's                  
electronic delivery program, call Fidelity or visit Fidelity's Web              
site for more information.                                                      

You may initiate many TRANSACTIONS BY TELEPHONE OR ELECTRONICALLY.              
Fidelity will not be responsible for any losses resulting from                  
unauthorized transactions if it follows reasonable security procedures          
designed to verify the identity of the investor. Fidelity will request          
personalized security codes or other information, and may also record           
calls. For transactions conducted through the Internet, Fidelity                
recommends the use of an Internet browser with 128-bit encryption. You          
should verify the accuracy of your confirmation statements immediately          
after you receive them. If you do not want the ability to sell and              
exchange by telephone, call Fidelity for instructions.                          

When you sign your ACCOUNT APPLICATION, you will be asked to certify            
that your social security or taxpayer identification number is correct          
and that you are not subject to 31% backup withholding for failing to           
report income to the IRS. If you violate IRS regulations, the IRS can           
require a fund to withhold 31% of your taxable distributions and                
redemptions.                                                                    

Fidelity may deduct an ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE of $12.00 from accounts           
with a value of less than $2,500, subject to an annual maximum charge           
of $24.00 per shareholder. It is expected that accounts will be valued          
on the second Friday in November of each year. Accounts opened after            
September 30 will not be subject to the fee for that year. The fee,             
which is payable to Fidelity, is designed to offset in part the                 
relatively higher costs of servicing smaller accounts. This fee will            
not be deducted from Fidelity brokerage accounts, retirement accounts           
(except non-prototype retirement accounts), accounts using regular              
investment plans, or if total assets with Fidelity exceed $30,000.              
Eligibility for the $30,000 waiver is determined by aggregating                 
accounts with Fidelity maintained by Fidelity Service Company, Inc. or          
FBSI which are registered under the same social security number or              
which list the same social security number for the custodian of a               
Uniform Gifts/Transfers to Minors Act account.                                  

If your ACCOUNT BALANCE falls below $2,000 (except accounts not                 
subject to account minimums), you will be given 30 days' notice to              
reestablish the minimum balance. If you do not increase your balance,           
Fidelity may close your account and send the proceeds to you. Your              
shares will be sold at the NAV on the day your account is closed.               

Fidelity may charge a FEE FOR    CERTAIN     SERVICES, such as                  
providing historical account documents   .                                      

DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS                                        

Each fund earns interest, dividends   ,     and other income from its           
investments, and distributes this income (less expenses) to                     
shareholders as dividends. Each fund may also realize capital gains             
from its investments, and distributes these gains (less losses), if             
any, to shareholders as capital gain distributions.                             

Distributions you receive from each fund consist primarily of                   
dividends. Each fund normally declares dividends daily and pays them            
monthly.                                                                        

EARNING DIVIDENDS                                                               

Shares begin to earn dividends on the first business day following the          
day of purchase.                                                                

Shares earn dividends until, but not including, the next business day           
following the day of redemption.                                                

DISTRIBUTION OPTIONS                                                            

When you open an account, specify on your application how you want to           
receive your distributions. The following options may be available for          
each fund's distributions:                                                      

1. REINVESTMENT OPTION. Your dividends and capital gain distributions,          
if any, will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of the            
fund. If you do not indicate a choice on your application, you will be          
assigned this option.                                                           

2. CASH OPTION. Your dividends and capital gain distributions, if any,          
will be paid in cash.                                                           

3. DIRECTED DIVIDENDS(registered trademark) OPTION. Your dividends              
will be automatically invested in shares of another identically                 
registered Fidelity fund. Your capital gain distributions, if any,              
will be automatically invested in shares of another identically                 
registered Fidelity fund, automatically reinvested in additional                
shares of the fund, or paid in cash.                                            

Not all distribution options are available for every account. If the            
option you prefer is not listed on your account application, or if you          
want to change your current option, call Fidelity.                              

If you elect to receive distributions paid in cash by check and the             
U.S. Postal Service does not deliver your checks, your distribution             
option may be converted to the Reinvestment Option. You will not                
receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed distribution                
checks.                                                                         

TAX CONSEQUENCES                                                                

As with any investment, your investment in a fund could have tax                
consequences for you. If you are not investing through a                        
tax-advantaged retirement account, you should consider these tax                
consequences.                                                                   

Distributions     you receive from each fund are subject to federal       
income tax, and may also be subject to state or local taxes.                    

For federal tax purposes, each fund's dividends and distributions of            
short-term capital gains are taxable to you as ordinary income,                 
while each     fund's distributions of long-term capital gains, if        
any, are taxable to you generally as capital gains.                             

Any taxable distributions you receive from a fund will normally be              
taxable to you when you receive them, regardless of your distribution           
option. If you elect to receive distributions in cash or to invest              
distributions automatically in shares of another Fidelity fund, you             
will receive certain December distributions in January, but those               
distributions will be taxable as if you received them on December 31.           

FUND SERVICES                                                                   
FUND MANAGEMENT                                                                 

Each fund is a mutual fund, an investment that pools shareholders'              
money and invests it toward a specified goal.                                   

FMR is each fund's manager.                                                     

As of M   arch 25, 199    9, FMR had approximately $   521.7                    
billion in discretionary assets under management.                       

As the manager, FMR is responsible for choosing    each                         
fund'   s     investments and    handling     its business affairs.             

Fidelity Investments Money Management, Inc. (FIMM), in Merrimack, New           
Hampshire, serves as sub-adviser for each fund. FIMM is primarily               
responsible for choosing investments for each fund.                             

FIMM is an affiliate of FMR. As of    March 29, 199    9, FIMM had              
approximately    $159.8 billion     in discretionary assets under               
management.                                                                     

A fund could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by FMR          
and other service providers do not properly process and calculate               
date-related information from and after January 1, 2000. FMR has                
advised each fund that it is actively working on necessary changes to           
its computer systems and expects that its systems, and those of other           
major service providers, will be modified prior to January 1, 2000.             
However, there can be no assurance that there will be no adverse                
impact on a fund.                                                               

From time to time a manager, analyst, or other Fidelity employee          
may express views regarding a particular company, security, industry,           
or market sector. The views expressed by any such person are the views          
of only that individual as of the time expressed and do not                     
necessarily represent the views of Fidelity or any other person in the          
Fidelity organization. Any such views are subject to change at any              
time based upon market or other conditions and Fidelity disclaims any           
responsibility to update such views. These views may not be relied on           
as investment advice and, because investment decisions for a Fidelity           
fund are based on numerous factors, may not be relied on as an                  
indication of trading intent on behalf of any Fidelity fund.                    

Fidelity investment personnel may invest in securities for their own            
investment accounts pursuant to a code of ethics that establishes               
procedures for personal investing and restricts certain transactions.           

Each fund pays a management fee to FMR. The management fee is                   
calculated and paid to FMR every month. The fee for each fund is                
calculated by adding a group fee rate to an individual fund fee rate,           
dividing by twelve and multiplying the result by the fund's average             
net assets throughout the month, and then adding an income-based fee.           

The income-based fee is 6% of the fund's monthly gross income in                
excess of an annualized 5% yield, but it cannot rise above an annual            
rate of 0.24% of the fund's average net assets throughout that month.           

The group fee rate is based on the average net assets of all the                
mutual funds advised by FMR. This rate cannot rise above 0.37%, and it          
drops as total assets under management increase.                                

For    November 1999,     the group fee rate was    0.1275    %. The            
individual fund fee rate is    0.03    % for    Cash Reserves and U.S.          
Government Reserves                                                             

The total management fee for the fiscal year ended    November                  
30    ,    1999,     was    0.18    % of the fund's average net assets          
for    Cash Reserves     and    0.17    % of the fund's average net             
assets for    U. S. Government Reserves.                                        

FMR pays FIMM for providing assistance with investment advisory                 
services.                                                                       

FMR may, from time to time, agree to reimburse the funds for                    
management fees and other expenses above a specified limit. FMR                 
retains the ability to be repaid by a fund if expenses fall below the           
specified limit prior to the end of the fiscal year. Reimbursement              
arrangements,    which may be discontinued     by FMR at any time, can          
decrease a fund's expenses and boost its performance.                           

FUND DISTRIBUTION                                                               

Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC) distributes each fund's                 
shares.                                                                         

Each fund has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule          
12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that recognizes that             
FMR may use its management fee revenues, as well as its past profits            
or its resources from any other source, to pay FDC for expenses                 
incurred in connection with providing services intended to result in            
the sale of fund shares and/or shareholder support services. FMR,               
directly or through FDC, may pay intermediaries, such as banks,                 
broker-dealers and other service-providers, that provide those                  
services. Currently, the Board of Trustees of each fund has authorized          
such payments.                                                                  

To receive payments made pursuant to a Distribution and Service Plan,           
intermediaries must sign the appropriate agreement with FDC in                  
advance.                                                                        

FMR may allocate brokerage transactions in a manner that takes into             
account the sale of shares of a fund, provided that the fund receives           
brokerage services and commission rates comparable to those of other            
broker-dealers.                                                                 

No dealer, sales representative, or any other person has been

p    rospectus and the related SAI do not constitute an offer by          
the funds or by FDC to sell    shares of the funds     to or to buy

T    he financial highlights tables are intended to help you              
understand each fund's financial history for the past 5 years. Certain          
information reflects finan   cial results for a single fund share. The          
total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor would            
have earned (or lost) on an investment in the fund (assuming                    
reinvestment of all dividends and distributions). This information              
has     been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent                 
accountants, whose    reports, along with each fund's financial                 
highlights and financial statements, are    included in each fund's             
annual report. A free copy of each annual report is     available upon          
request.

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND LIMITATIONS                                             

The following policies and limitations supplement those set forth in            
the    p    rospectus. Unless otherwise noted, whenever an investment           
policy or limitation states a maximum percentage of a fund's assets             
that may be invested in any security or other asset, or sets forth a            
policy regarding quality standards, such standard or percentage                 
limitation will be determined immediately after and as a result of the          
fund's acquisition of such security or other asset. Accordingly, any            
subsequent change in values, net assets, or other circumstances will            
not be considered when determining whether the investment complies              
with the fund's investment policies and limitations.                            

A fund's fundamental investment policies and limitations cannot be              
changed without approval by a "majority of the outstanding voting               
securities" (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the              
1940 Act)) of the fund. However, except for the fundamental investment          
limitations listed below, the investment policies and limitations               
described in this SAI are not fundamental and may be changed without            
shareholder approval.

than 5% of its total assets would be invested in the securities of              
such issuer, provided however, that with respect to 25% of its total            
assets, 10% of its total assets may be invested in the securities of            
any single issuer;                                                              

(2) issue senior securities, except in connection with the insurance

than borrowings). Any borrowings that come to exceed this amount will           
be reduced within three days (not including Sundays and holidays) to            
the extent necessary to comply with the 33 1/3% limitation;

assets would be invested in the securities of companies whose                   
principal business activities are        in the same industry, except           
that the fund will invest more than 25% of its total assets in the              
financial services industry;                                                    

(7) purchase or sell real estate unless acquired as a result of                 
ownership of securities or other instruments (but this shall not                
prevent the fund from investing in securities or other instruments              
backed by real estate or securities of companies engaged in the real            
estate business);

(11) invest in companies for the purpose of exercising control or

policy or limitation, invest all of its assets in the securities of a           
single open-end management investment company with substantially the            
same fundamental investment objectives, policies, and limitations as            
the fund.                                                                       

THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS ARE NOT FUNDAMENTAL, AND MAY BE            
CHANGED WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL.                                           

(i) The fund does not currently intend to purchase a security (other            
than obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by           
the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities) if, as a                
result, more than 5% of its total assets would be invested in                   
securities of a single issuer; provided the fund may invest up to 10%           
of its total assets in the first tier securities of a single issuer             
for up to three business days and in the securities of money market             
funds.                                                                          

(ii) The fund does not currently intend to sell securities short,               
unless it owns or has the right to obtain securities equivalent in              
kind and amount to the securities sold short, and provided that                 
transactions in futures contracts and options are not deemed to                 
constitute selling securities short.                                            

(iii) The fund may borrow money only (a) from a bank or from a                  
registered investment company or portfolio for which FMR or an                  
af   filiate serves as investment adviser or (b) by engaging in                 
reverse repurchase agreements w    ith any party.                               

(iv) The fund does not currently intend to purchase any security if,            
as a result, more than 10% of its net assets would be invested in               
securities that are deemed to be illiquid because they are subject to           
legal or contractual restrictions on resale or because they cannot be           
sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at                       
approximately the prices at which they are valued.                              

(v) The fund does not currently intend to lend assets other than                
securities to other parties, except by lending money (up to    15    %          
of the fund's net assets) to a registered investment company or                 
portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as investment adviser.           
(This limitation does not apply to purchases of debt securities or to           
repurchase agreements.)                                                         

(vi) The fund does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in          
the securities of a single open-end management investment company with          
substantially the same fundamental investment objectives, policies,             
and limitations as the fund.                                                    

For purposes of li   mitati    on   s    : (1) and (i), certain                 
securities subject to guarantees (including insurance, letters of               
credit and demand features) are not considered securities of their              
issuer, but are subject to separate diversification requirements, in            
accordance with industry standard requirements for money market funds.          

With respect to limitation: (iv), if through a change in values, net            
assets, or other circumstances, the fund were in a position where more          
than 10% of its net assets were invested in illiquid securities, it             
would consider appropriate steps to protect liquidity.

backed by real estate or securities of companies engaged in the real            
estate business);

same fundamental investment objective, policies, and limitations as             
the fund.                                                                       

THE FOLLOWING INVESTMENT LIMITATIONS ARE NOT FUNDAMENTAL, AND MAY BE

(i) The fund does not currently intend to purchase the voting

(ii) The fund does not currently intend to sell securities short,

as a result, more than 10% of its net assets would be invested in

legal or contractual restrictions on resale or because they cannot be           
sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business at                       
approximately the prices at which they are valued.                              

(v) T   he fund doe    s not currently intend to lend assets other

portfolio for which FMR or an affiliate serves as investment adviser.           
(This limitation does not apply to purchases of d    ebt securities or          
to repurchase agreements.)                                                      

(vi) The fund does not currently intend to invest all of its assets in          
the securities of a single open-end management investment company with          
substantially the same fundamental investment objectives, policies,             
and limitations as the fund.                                                    

For purposes of limitation (1), certain securities subject to                   
guarantees (including insurance, letters of credit and demand                   
features) are not considered securities of their issuer, but are                
subject to separate diversification requirements, in accordance with            
industry standard requirements for money market funds.                          

With respect to limitation (iv), if through a change in values, net             
assets, or other circumstances, the fund were in a position where more          
than 10% of its net assets    were     invested in illiquid                     
securities, it would consider appropriate steps to protect liquidity.           

The following pages contain more detailed information about types of            
instruments in which a fund may invest, strategies FMR may employ in            
pursuit of a fund's investment objective, and a summary of related              
risks. FMR may not buy all of these instruments or use all of these             
techniques unless it believes that doing so will help    a     fund             
achieve its goal.                                                               

AFFILIATED BANK TRANSACTIONS. A fund may engage in transactions with            
financial institutions that are, or may be considered to be,                    
"affiliated persons" of the fund under the 1940 Act. These                      
transactions may involve repurchase agreements with custodian banks;            
short-term obligations of, and repurchase agreements with, the 50               
largest U.S. banks (measured by deposits); municipal securities; U.S.           
Government securities with affiliated financial institutions that are           
primary dealers in these securities; short-term currency transactions;          
and short-term borrowings. In accordance with exemptive orders issued           
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Board of Trustees          
has established and periodically reviews procedures applicable to               
transactions involving affiliated financial institutions.                       

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES represent interests in pools of mortgages,              
loans, receivables or other assets. Payment of interest and repayment           
of principal may be largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by          
the assets backing the securities and, in certain cases, supported by           
letters of credit, surety bonds, or other credit enhancements.                  
Asset-backed security values may also be affected by other factors              
including changes in interest rates, the availability of information            
concerning the pool and its structure, the creditworthiness of the              
servicing agent for the pool, the originator of the loans or                    
receivables, or the entities providing the credit enhancement. In               
addition, these securities may be subject to prepayment risk.                   

BORROWING. Each fund may borrow from banks or from other funds advised          
by FMR or its affiliates, or through reverse repurchase agreements,             
and may make additional investments while borrowings are outstanding.           

CENTRAL CASH FUNDS are money market funds managed by FMR or its                 
affiliates that seek to earn a high level of current income (free from          
federal income tax in the case of a municipal money market fund) while          
maintaining a stable $1.00 share price. The funds comply with                   
industry-standard requirements for money market funds regarding the             
quality, maturity   ,     and diversification of their investments.             

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN INVESTMENTS include U.S. dollar-denominated time           
deposits, certificates of deposit, and bankers' acceptances of U.S.             
banks and their branches located outside of the United States, U.S.             
branches and agencies of foreign banks, and foreign branches of                 
foreign banks. Domestic and foreign investments may also include U.S.           
dollar-denominated securities issued or guaranteed by other U.S. or             
foreign issuers, including U.S. and foreign corporations or other               
business organizations, foreign governments, foreign government                 
agencies or instrumentalities, and U.S. and foreign financial                   
institutions, including savings and loan institutions, insurance                
companies, mortgage bankers, and real estate investment trusts, as              
well as banks.                                                                  

The obligations of foreign branches of U.S. banks may be general                
obligations of the parent bank in addition to the issuing branch, or            
may be limited by the terms of a specific obligation and by                     
governmental regulation. Payment of interest and repayment of                   
principal on these obligations may also be affected by governmental             
action in the country of domicile of the branch (generally referred to          
as sovereign risk). In addition, evidence of ownership of portfolio             
securities may be held outside of the United States and a fund may be           
subject to the risks associated with the holding of such property               
overseas. Various provisions of federal law governing the                       
establishment and operation of U.S. branches do not apply to foreign            
branches of U.S. banks.                                                         

Obligations of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks may be               
general obligations of the parent bank in addition to the issuing               
branch, or may be limited by the terms of a specific obligation and by          
federal and state regulation, as well as by governmental action in the          
country in which the foreign bank has its head office.                          

Obligations of foreign issuers involve certain additional risks. These          
risks may include future unfavorable political and economic                     
developments, withholding taxes, seizures of foreign deposits,                  
currency controls, interest limitations, or other governmental                  
restrictions that might affect repayment of principal or payment of             
interest, or the ability to honor a credit commitment. Additionally,            
there may be less public information available about foreign entities.          
Foreign issuers may be subject to less governmental regulation and              
supervision than U.S. issuers. Foreign issuers also generally are not           
bound by uniform accounting, auditing, and financial reporting                  
requirements comparable to those applicable to U.S. issuers.                    

ILLIQUID SECURITIES cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary               
course of business at approximately the prices at which they are                
valued. Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or may            
be costly to a fund. Under the supervision of the Board of Trustees,            
FMR determines the liquidity of a fund's investments and, through               
reports from FMR, the Board monitors investments in illiquid                    
securities. In determining the liquidity of a fund's investments, FMR           
may consider various factors, including (1) the frequency and volume            
of trades and quotations, (2) the number of dealers and prospective             
purchasers in the marketplace, (3) dealer undertakings to make a                
marke   t    , and (4) the nature of the security and the market in             
which it trades (including any demand, put or tender features, the              
mechanics and other requirements for transfer, any letters of credit            
or other credit enhancement features, any ratings, the number of                
holders, the method of soliciting offers, the time required to dispose          
of the security, and the ability to assign or offset the rights and             
obligations of the security).                                                   

INTERFUND BORROWING AND LENDING PROGRAM. Pursuant to an exemptive               
order issued by the SEC, a fund may lend money to, and borrow money             
from, other funds advised by FMR or its affiliates. A fund will borrow          
through the program only when the costs are equal to or lower than the          
costs of bank loans   ,     and will lend through the program only              
when the returns are higher than those available from an investment in          
repurchase agreements. Interfund loans and borrowings normally extend           
overnight, but can have a maximum duration of seven days. Loans may be          
called on one day's notice. A fund may have to borrow from a bank at a          
higher interest rate if an interfund loan is called or not renewed.             
Any delay in repayment to a lending fund could result in a lost                 
investment opportunity or additional borrowing costs.                           

M    ONEY MARKET INSURANCE. Each fund participates in a mutual            
insurance company solely with other funds advised by FMR or its                 
affiliates. This company provides insurance coverage for losses on              
certain money market instruments held by a participating fund                   
(eligible instruments), including losses from nonpayment of principal           
or interest or a bankruptcy or insolvency of the issuer or credit               
support provider, if any. The insurance does not cover losses                   
resulting from changes in interest rates or other market developments.          
Each fund is charged an annual premium for the insurance coverage and           
may be subject to a special assessment of up to approximately two and           
one-half times the fund's annual gross premium if covered losses                
exceed certain levels. A participating fund may recover no more than            
$100 million annually, including all other claims of insured funds,             
and may only recover if the amount of the loss exceeds 0.30% of its             
eligible instruments. Each fund may incur losses regardless of the              
insurance.                                                                      

MONEY MARKET SECURITIES are high-quality, short-term obligations.               
Money market securities may be structured to be, or may employ a trust          
or other form so that they are, eligible investments for money market           
funds. For example, put features can be used to modify the maturity of          
a security or interest rate adjustment features can be used to enhance          
price stability. If a structure fails to function as intended, adverse          
tax or investment consequences may result. Neither the Internal                 
Revenue Service (IRS) nor any other regulatory authority has ruled              
definitively on certain legal issues presented by certain structured            
securities. Future tax or other regulatory determinations could                 
adversely affect the value, liquidity, or tax treatment of the income           
received from these securities or the nature and timing of                      
distributions made by the funds.                                                

MUNICIPAL SECURITIES are issued to raise money for a variety of public          
or private purposes, including general financing for state and local            
governments, or financing for specific projects or public facilities.           
They may be issued in anticipation of future revenues and may be                
backed by the full taxing power of a municipality, the revenues from a          
specific project, or the credit of a private organization. The value            
of some or all municipal securities may be affected by uncertainties            
in the municipal market related to legislation or litigation involving          
the taxation of municipal securities or the rights of municipal                 
securities holders. A municipal security may be owned directly or               
through a participation interest.                                               

PUT FEATURES entitle the holder to sell a security back to the issuer           
or a third party at any time or at specified intervals. In exchange             
for this benefit, a fund may accept a lower interest rate. Securities           
with put features are subject to the risk that the put provider is              
unable to honor the put feature (purchase the security). Put providers          
often support their ability to buy securities on demand by obtaining            
letters of credit or other guarantees from other entities. Demand               
features, standby commitments, and tender options are types of put              
features.                                                                       

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS involve an agreement to purchase a security and           
to sell that security back to the original seller at an agreed-upon             
price. The resale price reflects the purchase price plus an                     
agreed-upon incremental amount which is unrelated to the coupon rate            
or maturity of the purchased security. As protection against the risk           
that the original seller will not fulfill its obligation, the                   
securities are held in a separate account at a bank, marked-to-market           
daily, and maintained at a value at least equal to the sale price plus          
the accrued incremental amount. The value of the security purchased             
may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has                
agreed to purchase the security. In addition, delays or losses could            
result if the other party to the agreement defaults or becomes                  
insolvent. The funds will engage in repurchase agreement transactions           
with parties whose creditworthiness has been reviewed and found                 
satisfactory by FMR.                                                            

RESTRICTED SECURITIES are subject to legal restrictions on their sale.          
Difficulty in selling securities may result in a loss or be costly to           
a fund. Restricted securities generally can be sold in privately                
negotiated transactions, pursuant to an exemption from registration             
under the Securities Act of 1933, or in a registered public offering.           
Where registration is required, the holder of a registered security             
may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expense and a           
considerable period may elapse between the time it decides to seek              
registration and the time it may be permitted to sell a security under          
an effective registration statement. If, during such a period, adverse          
market conditions were to develop, the holder might obtain a less               
favorable price than prevailed when it decided to seek registration of          
the security.                                                                   

REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. In a reverse repurchase agreement, a             
fund sells a security to another party, such as a bank or                       
broker-dealer, in return for cash and agrees to repurchase that                 
security at an agreed-upon price and time. The funds will enter into            
reverse repurchase agreements with parties whose creditworthiness has           
been reviewed and found satisfactory by FMR. Such transactions may              
increase fluctuations in the market value of fund assets and a fund's           
yield and may be viewed as a form of leverage.                                  

SHORT SALES "AGAINST THE BOX" are short sales of securities that a              
fund owns or has the right to obtain (equivalent in kind or amount to           
the securities sold short). Short sales against the box could be used           
to protect the net asset value per share (NAV) of the fund in                   
anticipation of increased interest rates, without sacrificing the               
current yield of the securities sold short. If a fund enters into a             
short sale against the box, it will be required to set aside                    
securities equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short           
(or securities convertible or exchangeable into such securities) and            
will be required to hold such securities while the short sale is                
outstanding. The fund will incur transaction costs in connection with           
opening and closing short sales against the box.                                

SOURCES OF    LIQUIDITY OR CREDIT     SUPPORT. Issuers may employ               
various forms of credit and liquidity enhancements, including letters           
of credit, guarantees, puts, and demand features, and insurance                 
provided by domestic or foreign entities such as banks and other                
financial institutions. FMR may rely on its evaluation of the credit            
of the liquidity or credit enhancement     provider in determining        
whether to purchase a security supported by such enhancement. In                
evaluating the credit of a foreign bank or other foreign entities, FMR          
will consider whether adequate public information about the entity is           
available and whether the entity may be subject to unfavorable                  
political or economic developments, currency controls, or other                 
government restrictions that might affect its ability to honor its              
commitment. Changes in the credit quality of the entity providing the           
enhancement could affect the value of the security or a fund's share            
price.                                                                          

STRIPPED SECURITIES are the separate income or principal components of          
a debt security. The risks associated with stripped securities are              
similar to those of other money market securities, although stripped            
securities may be more volatile. U.S. Treasury securities that have             
been stripped by a Federal Reserve Bank are obligations issued by the           
U.S. Treasury.                                                                  

Privately stripped government securities are created when a dealer              
deposits a U.S. Treasury security or other U.S. Government security             
with a custodian for safekeeping. The custodian issues separate                 
receipts for the coupon payments and the principal payment, which the           
dealer then sells.                                                              

Because the SEC does not consider privately stripped government                 
securities to be U.S. Government securities for purposes of Rule 2a-7,          
a fund must evaluate them as it would non-government securities                 
pursuant to regulatory guidelines applicable to money market funds.             

VARIABLE AND FLOATING RATE SECURITIES provide for periodic adjustments          
in the interest rate paid on the security. Variable rate securities             
provide for a specified periodic adjustment in the interest rate,               
while floating rate securities have interest rates that change                  
whenever there is a change in a designated benchmark rate. Some                 
variable or floating rate securities are structured with put features           
that permit holders to demand payment of the unpaid principal balance           
plus accrued interest from the issuers or certain financial                     
intermediaries.                                                                 

WHEN-ISSUED AND FORWARD PURCHASE OR SALE TRANSACTIONS involve a                 
commitment to purchase or sell specific securities at a predetermined           
price or yield in which payment and delivery take place after the               
customary settlement period for that type of security. Typically, no            
interest accrues to the purchaser until the security is delivered.              

When purchasing securities pursuant to one of these transactions, the           
purchaser assumes the rights and risks of ownership, including the              
risks of price and yield fluctuations and the risk that the security            
will not be issued as anticipated. Because payment for the securities           
is not required until the delivery date, these risks are in addition            
to the risks associated with a fund's investments. If a fund remains            
substantially fully invested at a time when a purchase is outstanding,          
the purchases may result in a form of leverage. When a fund has sold a          
security pursuant to one of these transactions, the fund does not               
participate in further gains or losses with respect to the security.            
If the other party to a delayed-delivery transaction fails to deliver           
or pay for the securities, a fund could miss a favorable price or               
yield opportunity or suffer a loss.                                             

A fund may renegotiate a when-issued or forward transaction and may             
sell the underlying securities before delivery, which may result in             
capital gains or losses for the fund.                                           

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS                                                          

All orders for the purchase or sale of portfolio securities are placed          
on behalf of each fund by FMR pursuant to authority contained in the            
management contract. FMR is also responsible for the placement of               
transaction orders for other investment companies and investment                
accounts for which it or its affiliates act as investment adviser. In           
selecting broker-dealers, subject to applicable limitations of the              
federal securities laws, FMR considers various relevant factors,                
including, but not limited to: the size and type of the transaction;            
the nature and character of the markets for the security to be                  
purchased or sold; the execution efficiency, settlement capability,             
and financial condition of the broker-dealer firm; the broker-dealer's          
execution services rendered on a continuing basis; the reasonableness           
of any commissions; and, if applicable, arrangements for payment of             
fund expenses.                                                                  

If FMR grants investment management authority to a sub-adviser (see             
the section entitled "Management Contracts"), that sub-adviser is               
authorized to place orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio               
securities, and will do so in accordance with the policies described            
above.                                                                          

Each fund may execute portfolio transactions with broker-dealers who            
provide research and execution services to the fund or other                    
investment accounts over which FMR or its affiliates exercise                   
investment discretion. Such services may include advice concerning the          
value of securities; the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or           
selling securities; and the availability of securities or the                   
purchasers or sellers of securities. In addition, such broker-dealers           
may furnish analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries,                
securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy, and                
performance of investment accounts; and effect securities transactions          
and perform functions incidental thereto (such as clearance and                 
settlement).                                                                    

For transactions in fixed-income securities, FMR's selection of                 
broker-dealers is generally based on the availability of a security             
and its price and, to a lesser extent, on the overall quality of                
execution and other services, including research, provided by the               
broker-dealer.                                                                  

The receipt of research from broker-dealers that execute transactions           
on behalf of a fund may be useful to FMR in rendering investment                
management services to that fund or its other clients, and conversely,          
such research provided by broker-dealers who have executed transaction          
orders on behalf of other FMR clients may be useful to FMR in carrying          
out its obligations to a fund. The receipt of such research has not             
reduced FMR's normal independent research activities; however, it               
enables FMR to avoid the additional expenses that could be incurred if          
FMR tried to develop comparable information through its own efforts.            

Fixed-income securities are generally purchased from an issuer or               
underwriter acting as principal for the securities, on a net basis              
with no brokerage commission paid. However, the dealer is compensated           
by a difference between the security's original purchase price and the          
selling price, the so-called "bid-asked spread." Securities may also            
be purchased from underwriters at prices that include underwriting              
fees.                                                                           

Subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws, a             
fund may pay a broker-dealer commissions for agency transactions that           
are in excess of the amount of commissions charged by other                     
broker-dealers in recognition of their research and execution                   
services. In order to cause a fund to pay such higher commissions, FMR          
must determine in good faith that such commissions are reasonable in            
relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided           
by such executing broker-dealers, viewed in terms of a particular               
transaction or FMR's overall responsibilities to that fund or its               
other clients. In reaching this determination, FMR will not attempt to          
place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research services            
provided, or to determine what portion of the compensation should be            
related to those services.                                                      

To the extent permitted by applicable law, FMR is authorized to                 
allocate portfolio transactions in a manner that takes into account             
assistance received in the distribution of shares of the funds or               
other Fidelity funds and to use the research services of brokerage and          
other firms that have provided such assistance. FMR may use research            
services provided by and place agency transactions with National                
Financial Services Corporation (NFSC) and Fidelity Brokerage Services           
Japan LLC (FBSJ), indirect subsidiaries of FMR Corp., if the                    
commissions are fair, reasonable, and comparable to commissions                 
charged by non-affiliated, qualified brokerage firms for similar                
services. Prior to December 9, 1997, FMR used research services                 
provided by and placed agency transactions with Fidelity Brokerage              
Services (FBS), an indirect subsidiary of FMR Corp.                             

FMR may allocate brokerage transactions to broker-dealers (including            
affiliates of FMR) who have entered into arrangements with FMR under            
which the broker-dealer allocates a portion of the commissions paid by          
a fund toward the reduction of that fund's expenses. The transaction            
quality must, however, be comparable to those of other qualified                
broker-dealers.                                                                 

Section 11(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits members          
of national securities exchanges from executing exchange transactions           
for investment accounts which they or their affiliates manage, unless           
certain requirements are satisfied. Pursuant to such requirements, the          
Board of Trustees has authorized NFSC to execute portfolio                      
transactions on national securities exchanges in accordance with                
approved procedures and applicable SEC rules.                                   

The Trustees of each fund periodically review FMR's performance of its          
responsibilities in connection with the placement of portfolio                  
transactions on behalf of the fund and review the commissions paid by           
the fund over representative periods of time to determine if they are           
reasonable in relation to the benefits to the fund.                             

For the fiscal years ended November    30    , 199   9, 1998, and               
1997,     the funds paid no brokerage commissions.                              

For the fiscal year ended November    30    , 199   9     the funds             
paid no brokerage commissions to firms that provided research                   
services.                                                                       

The Trustees of each fund have approved procedures in conformity with           
Rule 10f-3 under the 1940 Act whereby a fund may purchase securities            
that are offered in underwritings in which an affiliate of FMR                  
participates. These procedures prohibit the funds from directly or              
indirectly benefiting an FMR affiliate in connection with such                  
underwritings. In addition, for underwritings where an FMR affiliate            
participates as a principal underwriter, certain restrictions may               
apply that could, among other things, limit the amount of securities            
that the funds could purchase in the underwriting.                              

From time to time the Trustees will review whether the recapture for            
the benefit of the funds of some portion of the brokerage commissions           
or similar fees paid by the funds on portfolio transactions is legally          
permissible and advisable. Each fund seeks to recapture soliciting              
broker-dealer fees on the tender of portfolio securities, but at                
present no other recapture arrangements are in effect. The Trustees             
intend to continue to review whether recapture opportunities are                
available and are legally permissible and, if so, to determine in the           
exercise of their business judgment whether it would be advisable for           
each fund to seek such recapture.                                               

Although the Trustees and officers of each fund are substantially the           
same as those of other funds managed by FMR or its affiliates,                  
investment decisions for each fund are made independently from those            
of other funds managed by FMR or investment accounts managed by FMR             
affiliates. It sometimes happens that the same security is held in the          
portfolio of more than one of these funds or investment accounts.               
Simultaneous transactions are inevitable when several funds and                 
investment accounts are managed by the same investment adviser,                 
particularly when the same security is suitable for the investment              
objective of more than one fund or investment account.                          

When two or more funds are simultaneously engaged in the purchase or            
sale of the same security, the prices and amounts are allocated in              
accordance with procedures believed to be appropriate and equitable             
for each fund. In some cases this system could have a detrimental               
effect on the price or value of the security as far as each fund is             
concerned. In other cases, however, the ability of the funds to                 
participate in volume transactions will produce better executions and           
prices for the funds. It is the current opinion of the Trustees that            
the desirability of retaining FMR as investment adviser to each fund            
outweighs any disadvantages that may be said to exist from exposure to          
simultaneous transactions.                                                      

VALUATION                                                                       

Each fund's NAV is the value of a single share. The NAV of each fund            
is computed by adding the value of the fund's investments, cash, and            
other assets, subtracting its liabilities, and dividing the result by           
the number of shares outstanding.                                               

Portfolio securities and other assets are valued on the basis of                
amortized cost. This technique involves initially valuing an                    
instrument at its cost as adjusted for amortization of premium or               
accretion of discount rather than its current market value. The                 
amortized cost value of an instrument may be higher or lower than the           
price a fund would receive if it sold the instrument.                           

Securities of other open-end investment companies are valued at their           
respective NAVs.                                                                

At such intervals as they deem appropriate, the Trustees consider the           
extent to which NAV calculated by using market valuations would                 
deviate from the $1.00 per share calculated using amortized cost                
valuation. If the Trustees believe that a deviation from a fund's               
amortized cost per share may result in material dilution or other               
unfair results to shareholders, the Trustees have agreed to take such           
corrective action, if any, as they deem appropriate to eliminate or             
reduce, to the extent reasonably practicable, the dilution or unfair            
results. Such corrective action could include selling portfolio                 
instruments prior to maturity to realize capital gains or losses or to          
shorten average portfolio maturity; withholding dividends; redeeming            
shares in kind; establishing NAV by using available market quotations;          
and such other measures as the Trustees may deem appropriate.                   

PERFORMANCE                                                                     

A fund may quote performance in various ways. All performance                   
information supplied by the funds in advertising is historical and is           
not intended to indicate future returns. Each fund's yield and return           
fluctuate in response to market conditions and other factors.                   

YIELD CALCULATIONS. To compute the yield for a fund for a period, the           
net change in value of a hypothetical account containing one share              
reflects the value of additional shares purchased with dividends from           
the one original share and dividends declared on both the original              
share and any additional shares. The net change is then divided by the          
value of the account at the beginning of the period to obtain a base            
period return. This base period return is annualized to obtain a                
current annualized yield. A fund also may calculate an effective yield          
by compounding the base period return over a one-year period. In                
addition to the current yield, a fund may quote yields in advertising           
based on any historical seven-day period. Yields for a fund are                 
calculated on the same basis as other money market funds, as required           
by applicable regulation.                                                       

Yield information may be useful in reviewing a fund's performance and           
in providing a basis for comparison with other investment                       
alternatives. However, a fund's yield fluctuates, unlike investments            
that pay a fixed interest rate over a stated period of time. When               
comparing investment alternatives, investors should also note the               
quality and maturity of the portfolio securities of respective                  
investment companies they have chosen to consider.                              

Investors should recognize that in periods of declining interest rates          
a fund's yield will tend to be somewhat higher than prevailing market           
rates, and in periods of rising interest rates a fund's yield will              
tend to be somewhat lower. Also, when interest rates are falling, the           
inflow of net new money to a fund from the continuous sale of its               
shares will likely be invested in instruments producing lower yields            
than the balance of the fund's holdings, thereby reducing a fund's              
current yield. In periods of rising interest rates, the opposite can            
be expected to occur.                                                           

RETURN CALCULATIONS. Returns quoted in advertising reflect all aspects          
of a fund's return, including the effect of reinvesting                         
divi   dends     and capital gain distributions, and any change in a            
fund's NAV over a stated period. A cumulative return reflects actual            
performance over a stated period of time. Average annual returns are            
calculated by determining the growth or decline in value of a                   
hypothetical historical investment in a fund over a stated period, and          
then calculating the annually compounded percentage rate that would             
have produced the same result if the rate of growth or decline in               
value had been constant over the period. For example, a cumulative              
r    eturn of 100% over ten years would produce an average annual         
return of 7.18%, which is the steady annual rate of return that would           
equal 100% growth on a compounded basis in ten years. While average             
annual returns are a convenient means of comparing investment                   
alternatives, investors should realize that a fund's performance is             
not constant over time, but changes from year to year, and that                 
average annual returns represent averaged figures as opposed to the             
actual year-to-year performance of a fund.                                      

In addition to average annual returns, a fund may quote unaveraged or           
cumulative returns reflecting the simple change in value of an                  
investment over a stated period. Average annual and cumulative returns          
may be quoted as a percentage or as a dollar amount, and may be                 
calculated for a single investment, a series of investments, or a               
series of redemptions, over any time period. Returns may be broken              
down into their components of income and capital (including capital             
gains and changes in share price) in order to illustrate the                    
relationship of these factors and their contributions to return.                
Returns may be quoted on a before-tax or after-tax basis.    Returns            
may or may not include the effect of a fund's small account fee.                
Excluding a fund's small account fee from a return calculation                  
produces a higher return figure.     Returns, yields and other                  
performance information may be quoted numerically or in a table,                
graph, or similar illustration.

Note: If FMR had not reimbursed certain fund expenses during these              
periods, U.S. Government Reserves' returns would have been lower.               

The following table shows the income and capital elements of each               
fund's cumulative return. The table compares each fund's return to the          
record of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500   (registered                
trademark)    ), the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), and the cost          
of living, as mea   sured     by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), over           
the same period. The S&P 500 and DJIA comparisons are provided to show          
how each fund's return compared to the record of a    market                    
capitalization-weighted     index of common stocks and a narrower set           
of stocks of major industrial companies, respectively, over the same            
period. Because each fund invests in short-term fixed-income                    
securities, common stocks represent a different type of investment              
from the funds. Common stocks generally offer greater growth potential          
than the funds, but generally experience greater price volatility,              
which means greater potential for loss. In addition, common stocks              
generally provide lower income than fixed-income investments such as            
the funds. The S&P 500 and DJIA returns are based on the prices of              
unmanaged groups of stocks and, unlike each fund's returns, do not              
include the effect of brokerage commissions or other costs of                   
investing.                                                                      

The following tables show the growth in value of a hypothetical                 
$10,000 investment in each fund during the 10-year period ended                 
November 30, 199   9    , assuming all distributions were reinvested.           
Returns are based on past results and are not an indication of future

Explanatory Notes: With an initial investment of $10,000 in    Cash             
Reserves     on    November 30, 198    9, the net amount invested in            
fund shares was $10,000. The cost of the initial investment ($10,000)           
together with the aggregate cost of reinvested dividends and capital            
gain distributions for the period covered (their cash value at the              
time they were reinvested) amounted to $   16,452    . If                       
distributions had not been reinvested, the amount of distributions              
earned from the fund over time would have been smaller, and cash                
payments for the period would have amounted to $   4,990     for                
dividends. The fund did not distribute any capital gains during the             
period.

Explanatory Notes: With an initial investment of $10,000 in U.S.                
Government Reserves on November 30, 19   89    , the net amount                 
invested in fund shares was $10,000. The cost of the initial

PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS. A fund's performance may be compared to the            
performance of other mutual funds in general, or to the performance of          
particular types of mutual funds. These comparisons may be expressed            
as mutual fund rankings prepared by Lipper    Inc.     (Lipper), an             
independent service located in Summit, New Jersey that monitors the             
performance of mutual funds. Generally, Lipper rankings are based on            
return, assume reinvestment of distributions, do not take sales                 
charges or trading fees into consideration, and are prepared without            
regard to tax consequences. Lipper may also rank based on yield. In             
addition to the mutual fund rankings, a fund's performance may be               
compared to stock, bond, and money market mutual fund performance               
indexes prepared by Lipper or other organizations. When comparing               
these indexes, it is important to remember the risk and return                  
characteristics of each type of investment. For example, while stock            
mutual funds may offer higher potential returns, they also carry the            
highest degree of share price volatility. Likewise, money market funds          
may offer greater stability of principal, but generally do not offer            
the higher potential returns available from stock mutual funds.                 

From time to time, a fund's performance may also be compared to other           
mutual funds tracked by financial or business publications and                  
periodicals. For example, a fund may quote Morningstar, Inc. in its             
advertising materials. Morningstar, Inc. is a mutual fund rating                
service that rates mutual funds on the basis of risk-adjusted                   
performance. Rankings that compare the performance of Fidelity funds            
to one another in appropriate categories over specific periods of time          
may also be quoted in advertising.                                              

A fund may be compared in advertising to Certificates of Deposit (CDs)          
or other investments issued by banks or other depository institutions.          
Mutual funds differ from bank investments in several respects. For              
example, a fund may offer greater liquidity or higher potential                 
returns than CDs, a fund does not guarantee your principal or your              
return, and fund shares are not FDIC insured.                                   

Fidelity may provide information designed to help individuals                   
understand their investment goals and explore various financial                 
strategies. Such information may include information about current              
economic, market, and political conditions; materials that describe             
general principles of investing, such as asset allocation,                      
diversification, risk tolerance, and goal setting; questionnaires               
designed to help create a personal financial profile; worksheets used           
to project savings needs based on assumed rates of inflation and                
hypothetical rates of return; and action plans offering investment              
alternatives. Materials may also include discussions of Fidelity's              
asset allocation funds and other Fidelity funds, products, and                  
services.                                                                       

Ibbotson Associates of Chicago, Illinois (Ibbotson) provides                    
historical returns of the capital markets in the United States,                 
including common stocks, small capitalization stocks, long-term                 
corporate bonds, intermediate-term government bonds, long-term                  
government bonds, Treasury bills, the U.S. rate of inflation (based on          
the CPI), and combinations of various capital markets. The performance          
of these capital markets is based on the returns of different indexes.          

Fidelity funds may use the performance of these capital markets in              
order to demonstrate general risk-versus-reward investment scenarios.           
Performance comparisons may also include the value of a hypothetical            
investment in any of these capital markets. The risks associated with           
the security types in any capital market may or may not correspond              
directly to those of the funds. Ibbotson calculates returns in the              
same method as the funds. The funds may also compare performance to             
that of other compilations or indexes that may be developed and made            
available in the future.                                                        

A money market fund may compare its performance or the performance of           
securities in which it may invest to averages published by IBC                  
Financial Data, Inc. of Ashland, Massachusetts. These averages assume           
reinvestment of distributions. IBC's MONEY FUND REPORT                          
AVERAGES(trademark)/All Taxable, which is reported in IBC's MONEY FUND          
REPORT(trademark), covers over    947     taxable money market funds.           
IBC's MONEY FUND REPORT AVERAGES(trademark)/Government, which is          
reported in IBC's MONEY FUND REPORT(trademark), covers over 215                 
government money market funds.                                                  

In advertising materials, Fidelity may reference or discuss its                 
products and services, which may include other Fidelity funds;                  
retirement investing; brokerage products and services; model                    
portfolios or allocations; saving for college or other goals; and               
charitable giving. In addition, Fidelity may quote or reprint                   
financial or business publications and periodicals as they relate to            
current economic and political conditions, fund management, portfolio           
composition, investment philosophy, investment techniques, the                  
desirability of owning a particular mutual fund, and Fidelity services          
and products. Fidelity may also reprint, and use as advertising and             
sales literature, articles from Fidelity Focus(registered trademark),           
a quarterly magazine provided free of charge to Fidelity fund                   
shareholders.                                                                   

A fund may present its fund number, Quotron(trademark) number, and              
CUSIP number, and discuss or quote its current portfolio manager.               

A fund may be available for purchase through retirement plans or other          
programs offering deferral of, or exemption from, income taxes, which           
may produce superior after-tax returns over time. For example, a                
$1,000 investment earning a taxable return of 10% annually would have           
an after-tax value of $1,949 after ten years, assuming tax was                  
deducted from the return each year at a 31% rate. An equivalent                 
tax-deferred investment would have an after-tax value of $2,100 after           
ten years, assuming tax was deducted at a 31% rate from the                     
tax-deferred earnings at the end of the ten-year period.                        

As of November 30,    1999    , FMR advised over $   34     billion in          
municipal fund assets, $   136     billion in taxable fixed-income              
fund assets, $   141 billion     in money market fund assets,                   
$   586     billion in equity fund assets, $   20     billion in                
international fund assets, and $   42     billion in Spartan fund               
assets. The funds may reference the growth and variety of money market          
mutual funds and the adviser's innovation and participation in the              
industry. The equity funds under management figure represents the               
largest amount of equity fund assets under management by a mutual fund          
investment adviser in the United States, making FMR America's leading           
equity (stock) fund manager. FMR, its subsidiaries, and affiliates              
maintain a worldwide information and communications network for the             
purpose of researching and managing investments abroad.                         

Cash Reserves may be advertised as an investment choice under the               
Fidelity College Savings Plan mutual fund option. Advertising may               
contain illustrations of projected future college costs based on                
assumed rates of inflation and examples of hypothetical performance.            
Advertising for the Fidelity College Savings Plan mutual fund option            
may be used in conjunction with advertising for the Fidelity College            
Savings Plan brokerage option, a product offered through Fidelity               
Brokerage Services, Inc.                                                        

In addition to performance rankings, a fund may compare its total               
expense ratio to the average total expense ratio of similar funds               
tracked by Lipper. A fund's total expense ratio is a significant                
factor in comparing bond and money market investments because of its            
effect on yield.                                                                

ADDITIONAL PURCHASE, EXCHANGE AND REDEMPTION INFORMATION                        

For Select Cash Reserves account shareholders, a deferred sales           
charge of 1% of the redemption amount will be deducted when you redeem          
shares purchased prior to October 12, 1990. The deferred sales charge           
does not apply to exchanges to the Select Portfolios.                           

A fund may     make redemption payments in whole or in part in            
readily marketable     securities or other property, valued for this            
purpose as they are valued in computing each fund's NAV   , if FMR              
determines it is in the best interests of the fund.     Shareholders            
that receive     securities or other property on redemption may           
realize a gain or loss for tax purposes, and will incur any costs of            
sale, as well as the associated inconveniences.                                 

DISTRIBUTIONS AND TAXES                                                         

DIVIDENDS. Because each fund's income is primarily derived from                 
interest, dividends from the fund generally will not qualify for the            
dividends-received deduction available to corporate shareholders.               
Short-term capital gains are taxable as dividends, but do not qualify           
for the dividends-received deduction.                                           

CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS. Each fund may distribute any net realized           
capital gains once a year or more often, as necessary.                          

As of November 30, 199   9    ,    Cash Reserves     had a capital              
loss carryforward aggregating approximately    $1,899,000    . This             
loss carryforward, of which $   105,000    , $   1,634,000    , and             
$   160,000     will expire on November 30,    2001    ,    2002    ,           
and    2004    , respectively, is available to offset future capital            
gains.                                                                          

STATE     AND LOCAL TAX ISSUES. For mutual funds organized as             
business trusts, state law provides for a pass-through of the state             
and local income tax exemption afforded to direct owners of U.S.                
Government securities. Some states limit this pass-through to mutual            
funds that invest a certain amount in U.S. Government securities, and           
some types of securities, such as repurchase agreements and some                
agency-backed securities, may not qualify for this benefit. The tax             
treatment of your dividends from a fund will be the same as if you              
directly owned a proportionate share of the U.S. Government                     
securities. Because the income earned on certain U.S. Government                
securities is exempt from state and local personal income taxes, the            
portion of dividends from a fund attributable to these securities will          
also be free from state and local personal income taxes. The exemption          
from state and local personal income taxation does not preclude states          
from assessing other taxes on the ownership of U.S. Government                  
securities.                                                                     

TAX STATUS OF THE FUNDS. Each fund intends to qualify each year as a            
"regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal               
Revenue Code so that it will not be liable for federal tax on income            
and capital gains distributed to shareholders. In order to qualify as           
a regulated investment company, and avoid being subject to federal              
income or excise taxes at the fund level, each fund intends to                  
distribute substantially all of its net investment income and net               
realized capital gains within each calendar year as well as on a                
fiscal year basis, and intends to comply with other tax rules                   
applicable to regulated investment companies.                                   

OTHER TAX INFORMATION. The information above is only a summary of some          
of the tax consequences generally affecting each fund and its                   
shareholders, and no attempt has been made to discuss individual tax            
consequences. It is up to you or your tax preparer to determine                 
whether the sale of shares of a fund resulted in a capital gain or              
loss or other tax consequence to you. In addition to federal income             
taxes, shareholders may be subject to state and local taxes on fund             
distributions, and shares may be subject to state and local personal            
property taxes. Investors should consult their tax advisers to                  
determine whether a fund is suitable to their particular tax                    
situation.

the year to oversee each fund's activities, review contractual                  
arrangements with companies that provide services to each fund, and             
review each fund's performance. Except as indicated, each individual            
has held the office shown or other offices in the same company for the

Advisory Board also serve in similar capacities for other funds                 
advised by FMR or its affiliates. The business address of each

and     Thomas R. Williams, $   62,319.                                         

B Compensation figures include cash, and may include amounts required           
to be deferred and amounts deferred at the election of Trustees.                

C The following amounts are required to be deferred by each

$   4,597    ; and Thomas R. Williams, $   4,597    .                           

D     Certain of the non-interested Trustees' aggregate                   
compensation from a fund includes accrued voluntary deferred                    
compensation as follows:    Thomas R. Williams, $3,830, Cash                    
Reserves.                                                                       

Under a deferred compensation plan adopted in September 1995 and                
amended in November 1996 (the Plan), non-interested Trustees must               
defer receipt of a portion of, and may elect to defer receipt of an             
additional portion of, their annual fees. Amounts deferred under the            
Plan are subject to vesting and are treated as though equivalent                
dollar amounts had been invested in shares of a cross-section of                
Fidelity funds including funds in each major investment discipline and          
representing a majority of Fidelity's assets under management (the              
Reference Funds). The amounts ultimately received by the Trustees               
under the Plan will be directly linked to the investment performance            
of the Reference Funds. Deferral of fees in accordance with the Plan            
will have a negligible effect on a fund's assets, liabilities, and net          
income per share, and will not obligate a fund to retain the services           
of any Trustee or to pay any particular level of compensation to the            
Trustee. A fund may invest in the Reference Funds under the Plan                
without shareholder approval.                                                   

As of    November 30, 1999,     the Trustees, Members of the Advisory           
Board, and officers of each fund owned, in the aggregate, less than             
1    % of each fund's total outstanding shares.

and is entitled to 51% of the vote on any such matter. The Johnson              
family group and all other Class B shareholders have entered into a             
shareholders' voting agreement under which all Class B shares will be           
voted in accordance with the majority vote of Class B shares. Under             
the 1940 Act, control of a company is presumed where one individual or          
group of individuals owns more than 25% of the voting stock of that             
company. Therefore, through their ownership of voting common stock and          
the execution of the shareholders' voting agreement, members of the             
Johnson family may be deemed, under the 1940 Act, to form a                     
controlling group with respect to FMR Corp.                                     

At present, the principal operating activities of FMR Corp. are those           
conducted by its division, Fidelity Investments Retail Marketing                
Company, which provides marketing services to various companies within          
the Fidelity organization.                                                      

Fidelity investment personnel may invest in securities for their own            
investment accounts pursuant to a code of ethics that sets forth all            
employees' fiduciary responsibilities regarding the funds, establishes          
procedures for personal investing and restricts certain transactions.           
For example, all personal trades in most securities require                     
pre-clearance, and participation in initial public offerings is                 
prohibited. In addition, restrictions on the timing of personal                 
investing in relation to trades by Fidelity funds and on short-term             
trading have been adopted.                                                      

MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS 

Each fund has entered into a management contract with FMR, pursuant to          
which FMR furnishes investment advisory and other services.                     

MANAGEMENT SERVICES. Under the terms of its management contract with            
each fund, FMR acts as investment adviser and, subject to the                   
supervision of the Board of Trustees, directs the investments of the            
fund in accordance with its investment objective, policies and                  
limitations. FMR also provides each fund with all necessary office              
facilities and personnel for servicing the fund's investments,                  
compensates all officers of each fund and all Trustees who are                  
"interested persons" of the trust or of FMR, and all personnel of each          
fund or FMR performing services relating to research, statistical and           
investment activities.                                                          

In addition, FMR or its affiliates, subject to the supervision of the           
Board of Trustees, provide the management and administrative services           
necessary for the operation of each fund. These services include                
providing facilities for maintaining each fund's organization;                  
supervising relations with custodians, transfer and pricing agents,             
accountants, underwriters and other persons dealing with each fund;             
preparing all general shareholder communications and conducting                 
shareholder relations; maintaining each fund's records and the                  
registration of each fund's shares under federal securities laws and            
making necessary filings under state securities laws; developing                
management and shareholder services for each fund; and furnishing               
reports, evaluations and analyses on a variety of subjects to the               
Trustees.                                                                       

MANAGEMENT-RELATED EXPENSES. In addition to the management fee payable          
to FMR and the fees payable to the transfer, dividend disbursing, and           
shareholder servicing agent        and pricing and bookkeeping agent,           
each fund pays all of its expenses that are not assumed by those                
parties. Each fund pays for the typesetting, printing, and mailing of           
its proxy materials to shareholders, legal expenses, and the fees of            
the custodian, auditor   ,     and non-interested Trustees. Each                
fund's management contract further provides that the fund will pay for          
typesetting, printing, and mailing prospectuses, statements of                  
additional information, notices, and reports to shareholders; however,          
under the terms of each fund's transfer agent agreement, the transfer           
agent bears the costs of providing these services to existing                   
shareholders. Other expenses paid by each fund include interest,                
taxes, brokerage commissions, the fund's proportionate share of                 
insurance premiums and Investment Company Institute dues, and the               
costs of registering shares under federal securities laws and making            
necessary filings under state securities laws. Each fund is also                
liable for such non-recurring expenses as may arise, including costs            
of any litigation to which the fund may be a party, and any obligation          
it may have to indemnify its officers and Trustees with respect to              
litigation.                                                                     

MANAGEMENT FEES. For the services of FMR under each management                  
contract, each fund pays FMR a monthly management fee which has three           
components: a group fee rate, an individual fund fee rate, and an               
income-based component of 6% of the fund's monthly gross income in              
excess of an annualized 5% yield. For this purpose, gross income                
includes interest accrued and/or discount earned (including both                
original issue discount and market discount) on portfolio obligations,          
less amortization of premium on portfolio obligations. The maximum              
income-based component is an amount equal to an annual rate of 0.24%            
of the fund's average net assets throughout the month.                          

The group fee rate is based on the monthly average net assets of all            
of the registered investment companies with which FMR has management            
contracts.

The group fee rate is calculated on a cumulative basis pursuant to the          
graduated fee rate schedule shown above on the left. The schedule               
above on the right shows the effective annual group fee rate at                 
various asset levels, which is the result of cumulatively applying the          
annualized rates on the left. For example, the effective annual fee             
rate at $   800     billion of group net assets - the approximate               
level for November 199   9     - was    0.1275    %, which is the               
weighted average of the respective fee rates for each level of group            
net assets up to $   800     billion.                                           

Each fund's individual fund fee rate is 0.03%.                                  

One-twelfth of the sum of the group fee rate and the individual fund            
fee rate is applied to the fund's average net assets for the month,             
giving a dollar amount which is the fee for that month to which the             
income-based component is added.                                                

Cash Reserves' management contract further provides that FMR will               
reimburse the fund, in an amount not in excess of the fund's                    
management fee for any fiscal year, if the fund's aggregate operating           
expenses exceed 1% of the average net assets of the fund.                       

The following table shows the amount of management fees paid by each            
fund to FMR for the past three fiscal years.

FMR     may, from time to time, voluntarily reimburse all or a            
portion of a fund's operating expenses (exclusive of interest, taxes,           
brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses). FMR retains the             
ability to be repaid for these expense reimbursements in the amount             
that expenses fall below the limit prior to the end of the fiscal               
year.                                                                           

Expense reimbursements by FMR will increase a fund's returns and                
yield, and repayment of the reimbursement by a fund will lower its              
returns and yield.                                                              

SUB-ADVISER. FMR has entered into a sub-advisory agreement with FIMM            
pursuant to which FIMM has primary responsibility for choosing                  
investments for each fund.    Prior to January 23, 1998    , FMR Texas          
Inc. (FMR Texas) had primary responsibility for providing investment            
management services to    each     fund. On January 23, 1998, FMR               
Texas was merged into FIMM, which succeeded to the operations of FMR            
Texas.                                                                          

Under the terms of the sub-advisory agreements,        FMR pays FIMM            
fees equal to 50% of the management fee payable to FMR under its                
management contract with each fund. The fees paid to FIMM are not               
reduced by any voluntary or mandatory expense reimbursements that may           
be in effect from time to time.                                                 

Fees paid to FMR Texas and FIMM by FMR on behalf of    the funds                
for the past three fiscal years are shown in the table below.

DISTRIBUTION SERVICES                                                           

Each fund has entered into a distribution agreement with FDC, an                
affiliate of FMR. FDC is a broker-dealer registered under the                   
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the National                    
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. The distribution agreements             
call for FDC to use all reasonable efforts, consistent with its other           
business, to secure purchasers for shares of the fund, which are                
continuously offered at NAV. Promotional and administrative expenses            
in connection with the offer and sale of shares are paid by FMR.                

The Trustees have approved Distribution and Service Plans on behalf of          
each fund (the Plans) pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act (the            
Rule). The Rule provides in substance that a mutual fund may not                
engage directly or indirectly in financing any activity that is                 
primarily intended to result in the sale of shares of the fund except           
pursuant to a plan approved on behalf of the fund under the Rule. The           
Plans, as approved by the Trustees, allow the funds and FMR to incur            
certain expenses that might be considered to constitute indirect                
payment by the funds of distribution expenses.                                  

Under each Plan, if the payment of management fees by the fund to FMR           
is deemed to be indirect financing by the fund of the distribution of           
its shares, such payment is authorized by the Plan. Each Plan                   
specifically recognizes that FMR may use its management fee revenue,            
as well as its past profits or its other resources, to pay FDC for              
expenses incurred in connection with providing services intended to             
result in the sale of fund shares and/or shareholder support services.          
In addition,    each     Plan provides that FMR, directly or through            
FDC, may pay intermediaries, such as banks, broker-dealers and other            
service-providers, that provide those services. Currently, the Board            
of Trustees has authorized such payments for    Cash Reserves and U.S.          
Government Reserves     shares.                                                 

Prior to approving each Plan, the Trustees carefully considered all             
pertinent factors relating to the implementation of the Plan, and               
determined that there is a reasonable likelihood that the Plan will             
benefit the fund and its shareholders. In particular, the Trustees              
noted that each Plan does not authorize payments by the fund other              
than those made to FMR under its management contract with the fund. To          
the extent that each Plan gives FMR and FDC greater flexibility in              
connection with the distribution of fund shares, additional sales of            
fund shares or stabilization of cash flows may result. Furthermore,             
certain shareholder support services may be provided more effectively           
under the Plans by local entities with whom shareholders have other             
relationships.                                                                  

The Glass-Steagall Act generally prohibits federally and state                  
chartered or supervised banks from engaging in the business of                  
underwriting, selling or distributing securities. Although the scope            
of this prohibition under the Glass-Steagall Act has not been clearly           
defined by the courts or appropriate regulatory agencies, FDC believes          
that the Glass-Steagall Act should not preclude a bank from performing          
shareholder support services, or servicing and recordkeeping                    
functions. FDC intends to engage banks only to perform such functions.          
However, changes in federal or state statutes and regulations                   
pertaining to the permissible activities of banks and their affiliates          
or subsidiaries, as well as further judicial or administrative                  
decisions or interpretations, could prevent a bank from continuing to           
perform all or a part of the contemplated services. If a bank were              
prohibited from so acting, the Trustees would consider what actions,            
if any, would be necessary to continue to provide efficient and                 
effective shareholder services. In such event, changes in the                   
operation of the funds might occur, including possible termination of           
any automatic investment or redemption or other services then provided          
by the bank. It is not expected that shareholders would suffer any              
adverse financial consequences as a result of any of these                      
occurrences. In addition, state securities laws on this issue may               
differ from the interpretations of federal law expressed herein, and            
banks and other financial institutions may be required to register as           
dealers pursuant to state law.                                                  

Each fund may execute portfolio transactions with, and purchase                 
securities issued by, depository institutions that receive payments             
under the Plans. No preference for the instruments of such depository           
institutions will be shown in the selection of investments.                     

FDC may compensate intermediaries that satisfy certain criteria           
established from time to time by FDC relating to the level or type of           
services provided by the intermediary, the sale or expected sale of             
significant amounts of shares, or other factors.                                

TRANSFER AND SERVICE AGENT AGREEMENTS                                           

Each fund has entered into a transfer agent agreement with FSC, an              
affiliate of FMR. Under the terms of the agreements, FSC performs               
transfer agency, dividend disbursing, and shareholder services for              
each fund.                                                                      

For providing transfer agency services, FSC receives an account fee             
and an asset-based fee each paid monthly with respect to each account           
in a fund. For retail accounts and certain institutional accounts,              
these fees are based on account size and fund type. For certain                 
institutional retirement accounts, these fees are based on fund type.           
For certain other institutional retirement accounts, these fees are             
based on account type and fund type. The account fees are subject to            
increase based on postage rate changes.                                         

FSC also collects small account fees from certain accounts with                 
balances of less than $2,500.                                                   

FSC also collects each fund's $5.00 wire redemption fee.                        

In addition, FSC receives the pro rata portion of the transfer agency           
fees applicable to shareholder accounts in a qualified state tuition            
program (QSTP), as defined under the Small Business Job Protection Act          
of 1996, managed by FMR or an affiliate and in each Fidelity Freedom            
Fund    and Fidelity Four-in-One Index Fund    , funds of funds                 
managed by an FMR affiliate, according to the percentage of the                 
QSTP's, Freedom Fund's    or Fidelity Four-in-One Index Fund's                  
assets that is invested in a fund,    subject to certain limitations            
in the case of Fidelity Four-in-One Index Fund.                                 

FSC pays out-of-pocket expenses associated with providing transfer              
agent services. In addition, FSC bears the expense of typesetting,              
printing, and mailing prospectuses, statements of additional                    
information, and all other reports, notices, and statements to                  
existing shareholders, with the exception of proxy statements.                  

Each fund has also entered into a service agent agreement with FSC.             
Under the terms of the agreement   ,     FSC calculates the NAV and             
dividends for each fund and maintains each fund's portfolio and                 
general accounting records.                                                     

For providing pricing and bookkeeping services, FSC receives a            
monthly fee based on each fund's average daily net assets throughout            
the month.                                                                      

The annual rates for pricing and bookkeeping services for money market          
funds are 0.0150% of the first $500 million of average net assets,              
0.0075% of average net assets between $500 million and $10 billion,             
0.0021    % of average net assets    between     $10 billion    and       
$25 billion, and 0.00075% of average net assets in excess of $25                
billion    . The fee, not including reimbursement for out-of-pocket             
expenses, is limited to a minimum of $40,000 per year.                          

Pricing and bookkeeping fees, including reimbursement for                       
out-of-pocket expenses, paid by the funds to FSC for the past three             
fiscal years are shown in the table below.

DESCRIPTION OF THE TRUST                                                        

TRUST ORGANIZATION. Fidelity Cash Reserves and Fidelity U. S.                   
Government Reserves are funds of Fidelity Phillips Street Trust, an             
open-end management investment company organized as a Delaware                  
business trust on September 17, 1992. Currently, there are two funds            
in Fidelity Phillips Street Trust: Fidelity Cash Reserves and Fidelity          
U. S. Government Reserves. The Trustees are permitted to create                 
additional funds in the trust.                                                  

The assets of the trust received for the issue or sale of shares of             
each fund and all income, earnings, profits, and proceeds thereof,              
subject to the rights of creditors, are allocated to such fund, and             
constitute the underlying assets of such fund. The underlying assets            
of each fund in the trust shall be charged with the liabilities and             
expenses attributable to such fund. Any general expenses of the trust           
shall be allocated between or among any one or more of the funds.               

SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY. The trust is a business trust organized under            
Delaware law. Delaware law provides that shareholders shall be                  
entitled to the same limitations of personal liability extended to              
stockholders of private corporations for profit. The courts of some             
states, however, may decline to apply Delaware law on this point. The           
Trust Instrument contains an express disclaimer of shareholder                  
liability for the debts, liabilities, obligations, and expenses of the          
trust. The Trust Instrument provides that the trust shall not have any          
claim against shareholders except for the payment of the purchase               
price of shares and requires that each agreement, obligation, or                
instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the Trustees                
relating to the trust or to a fund shall include a provision limiting           
the obligations created thereby to the trust or to one or more funds            
and its or their assets. The Trust Instrument further provides that             
shareholders of a fund shall not have a claim on or right to any                
assets belonging to any other fund.                                             

The Trust Instrument provides for indemnification out of each fund's            
property of any shareholder or former shareholder held personally               
liable for the obligations of the fund solely by reason of his or her           
being or having been a shareholder and not because of his or her acts           
or omissions or for some other reason. The Trust Instrument also                
provides that each fund shall, upon request, assume the defense of any          
claim made against any shareholder for any act or obligation of the             
fund and satisfy any judgment thereon. Thus, the risk of a shareholder          
incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is                 
limited to circumstances in which Delaware law does not apply, no               
contractual limitation of liability was in effect, and a fund is                
unable to meet its obligations. FMR believes that, in view of the               
above, the risk of personal liability to shareholders is extremely              
remote.                                                                         

VOTING RIGHTS. Each fund's capital consists of shares of beneficial             
interest. As a shareholder, you are entitled to one vote for each               
dollar of net asset value you own. The voting rights of shareholders            
can be changed only by a shareholder vote. Shares may be voted in the           
aggregate, by fund and by class.                                                

The shares have no preemptive or conversion rights. Shares are fully            
paid and nonassessable, except as set forth under the heading                   
"Shareholder Liability" above.                                                  

The     trust or any of its funds may be terminated upon the sale         
of its assets to another open-end management investment company or              
series thereof, or upon liquidation and distribution of its assets.             
Generally such terminations must be approved by a vote of                       
shareholders. In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of                 
the     trust, shareholders of each of its funds are entitled to          
receive the underlying assets of such fund available for distribution.          
In the event of the dissolution or liquidation of a fund, shareholders          
of that fund are entitled to receive the underlying assets of the fund          
available for distribution.                                                     

Under the Trust Instrument, the Trustees may, without shareholder               
vote,        in order to change the form of organization of the trust           
cause the trust to merge or consolidate with one or more trusts,                
partnerships, associations, limited liability companies or                      
corporations, as long as the surviving entity is an open-end                    
management investment company, or is a fund thereof, that will succeed          
to or assume the trust's registration statement, or cause the trust to          
incorporate under Delaware law.                                                 

CUSTODIAN. The Bank of New York, 110 Washington Street, New York, New           
York, is custodian of the assets of each fund. The custodian is                 
responsible for the safekeeping of a fund's assets and the appointment          
of any subcustodian banks and clearing agencies. The Chase Manhattan            
Bank, headquartered in New York, also may serve as a special purpose            
custodian of certain assets in connection with repurchase agreement             
transactions.                                                                   

FMR, its officers and directors, its affiliated companies, and members          
of the Board of Trustees may, from time to time, conduct transactions           
with various banks, including banks serving as custodians for certain           
funds advised by FMR. Transactions that have occurred to date include           
mortgages and personal and general business loans. In the judgment of           
FMR, the terms and conditions of those transactions were not                    
influenced by existing or potential custodial or other fund                     
relationships.                                                                  

AUDITOR. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 160 Federal Street, Boston,                
Massachusetts, serves as independent accountant    for each fund    .           
The auditor examines financial statements for the funds and provides            
other audit, tax, and related services.                                         

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                            

Each fund's financial statements and financial highlights     for         
the fiscal year ended November 30, 1999, and report of the auditor,             
are included in    the     fund's annual report and are incorporated            
herein by reference.

Item 24. Trusts Controlled by or under Common Control with this Trust           

The Board of Trustees of the Trust is the same as the board of other          
Fidelity funds, each of which has Fidelity Management & Research                
Company, or an affiliate, as its investment adviser. In addition, the           
officers of the Trust are substantially identical to those of the               
other Fidelity funds.  Nonetheless, the Trust takes the position that           
it is not under common control with other Fidelity funds because the            
power residing in the respective boards and officers arises as the              
result of an official position with the respective trusts.                      

Item 25. Indemnification                                                        

Pursuant to Del. Code Ann. title 12 (sub-section) 3817, a Delaware            
business trust may provide in its governing instrument for the                  
indemnification of its officers and trustees from and against any and           
all claims and demands whatsoever. Article X, Section 10.02 of the              
Trust Instrument sets forth the reasonable and fair means for                   
determining whether indemnification shall be provided to any past or            
present Trustee or officer. It states that the Trust shall indemnify            
any present or past trustee or officer to the fullest extent permitted          
by law against liability, and all expenses reasonably incurred by him           
or her in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding in              
which he or she is involved by virtue of his or her service as a                
trustee or officer and against any amount incurred in settlement                
thereof. Indemnification will not be provided to a person adjudged by           
a court or other adjudicatory body to be liable to the Trust or its             
shareholders by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross                 
negligence or reckless disregard of his or her duties (collectively,            
"disabling conduct"), or not to have acted in good faith in the                 
reasonable belief that his or her action was in the best interest of            
the Trust. In the event of a settlement, no indemnification may be              
provided unless there has been a determination, as specified in the             
Trust Instrument, that the officer or trustee did not engage in                 
disabling conduct.                                                              

Pursuant to Section 11 of the Distribution Agreement, the Trust               
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Distributor and each of its           
directors and officers and each person, if any, who controls the                
Distributor within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act against            
any loss, liability, claim, damages or expense (including the                   
reasonable cost of investigating or defending any alleged loss,                 
liability, claim, damages, or expense and reasonable counsel fees               
incurred in connection therewith) arising by reason of any person               
acquiring any shares, based upon the ground that the registration               
statement, Prospectus, Statement of Additional Information,                     
shareholder reports or other information filed or made public by the            
Trust (as from time to time amended) included an untrue statement of a          
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be                
stated or necessary in order to make the statements not misleading              
under the 1933 Act, or any other statute or the common law. However,            
the Trust does not agree to indemnify the Distributor or hold it                
harmless to the extent that the statement or omission was made in               
reliance upon, and in conformity with, information furnished to the             
Trust by or on behalf of the Distributor. In no case is the indemnity           
of the Trust in favor of the Distributor or any person indemnified to           
be deemed to protect the Distributor or any person against any                  
liability to the Issuer or its security holders to which the                    
Distributor or such person would otherwise be subject by reason of              
willful misfeasance, bad faith or gross negligence in the performance           
of its duties or by reason of its reckless disregard of its                     
obligations and duties under this Agreement.                                    

Pursuant to the agreement by which Fidelity Service Company, Inc.             
("FSC") is appointed transfer agent, the Trust agrees to indemnify and          
hold FSC harmless against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or           
expenses (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses) resulting             
from:                                                                           

(1) any claim, demand, action or suit brought by any person other             
than the Trust, including by a shareholder, which names FSC and/or the          
Trust as a party and is not based on and does not result from FSC's             
willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence or reckless disregard of           
duties, and arises out of or in connection with FSC's performance               
under the Transfer Agency Agreement; or                                         

(2) any claim, demand, action or suit (except to the extent                   
contributed to by FSC's willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence            
or reckless disregard of its duties) which results from the negligence          
of the Trust, or from FSC's acting upon any instruction(s) reasonably           
believed by it to have been executed or communicated by any person              
duly authorized by the Trust, or as a result of FSC's acting in                 
reliance upon advice reasonably believed by FSC to have been given by           
counsel for the Trust, or as a result of FSC's acting in reliance upon          
any instrument or stock certificate reasonably believed by it to have           
been genuine and signed, countersigned or executed by the proper                
person.
