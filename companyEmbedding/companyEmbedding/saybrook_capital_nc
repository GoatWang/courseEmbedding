The performance numbers for Saybrook Capital are based on the results of a composite of fully discretionary accounts,  which contain stocks, bonds, and cash and have no restrictions on minimum yield or percent of the portfolio invested in common stocks.  The annual performance figure for Saybrook is calculated as a dollar-weighted average of the performance of each of these accounts.  The "Saybrook Portfolio"  results are computed to reflect the payment of investment management fees (performance is 'net' of fees). 

The "Saybrook Stocks" performance is compiled by measuring the portion of these representative accounts invested in stocks.  Unlike the "Saybrook Portfolio" performance, these numbers do not reflect the payment of investment management fees, since fees are deducted from cash balances.

Saybrook�s long-term record is compared to that of the S&P 500 (total return including dividends), because the latter is the most commonly accepted  index of performance for U.S. equities.  Since this index represents a 100% investment in a broad range of stocks, while Saybrook Capital�s portfolios are sometimes not fully invested, our managed accounts tend to be less volatile than the broad market averages, which means they often rise less in ascending markets and decline somewhat less in falling markets.  Moreover, while Saybrook�s index of performance has been positive on an annual basis during this period, there is definitely no assurance that a portfolio will not decline in the future.  In a sharply down stock market, our accounts will probably lose some value.

Investment Goals - Saybrook Capital Investment Counselors














 


















 



 








Investment Goals for Our Clients



• Expand capital and income at a rate well in excess of inflation, thus achieving a meaningful real rate of return
• Preserve Principal  in an era of volatile markets
 
Long-Term Record

Since the firm was founded in 1976, our cumulative returns have exceeded the S&P 500 benchmark. Saybrook Capital’s longer-term performance, as well as our results during the recent years of down markets, demonstrates the firm’s success in pursuing our investment goals.  Mitigating losses during  market declines has been the key reason for this achievement. For instance, the broad market experienced three years of significantly negative returns from 2000 to 2003, and Saybrook Capital’s average account had a cumulative positive return over the same time.

During the credit crisis beginning in 2007, nearly all asset classes and stocks declined significantly. In 2008, our clients had less exposure to severe market losses, in part due to the avoidance of the financial sector, our focus on high-quality companies, and our willingness to hold cash balances. Saybrook Capital also recognizes the opportunities in challenging markets to invest in exceptional companies at reduced cost. We have provided meaningful real growth through turbulent investment eras.

CORPORATEOPPORTUNITYFUNDS















STRATEGY


Our funds invest in lower middle market companies with operational or capital structure complexity that causes many investors to shy away. These situations are often undervalued in the marketplace and present highly attractive investment opportunities.



The catalyst for the investment opportunity can be financial or operational distress, a complicated capital structure involving difficult-to-value securities or a dysfunctional ownership group.



Our goal in each situation is to establish the downside protection of a debt investment while creating the potential for an equity-type return.



We view management as critical to the success of each of our investments.  When we have a successful outcome, we seek to have management win alongside us.



The recent economic crisis and the resulting changes to the financial industry have significantly restricted the capital that is available to lower middle market companies that have complexity.  We believe this dynamic will continue to create numerous opportunities for our strategy.
