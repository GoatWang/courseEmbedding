Supplement will be construed in accordance with and governed by the
laws of the State of New York, including Section 5-1401 of the
General Obligations Law, without reference to its conflict of law
provisions and the obligations, rights, and remedies of the parties
hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such laws.

(b)        Each party hereto
hereby consents and agrees that the state or federal courts located
in the Borough of Manhattan in New York City shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to hear and determine any claims or disputes between
them pertaining to this Indenture Supplement or to any matter
arising out of or relating to this Indenture Supplement;
provided , that each party hereto acknowledges that any
appeals from those courts may have to be heard by a court located
outside of the Borough of Manhattan in New York City;
provided , further , that nothing in this Indenture
Supplement shall be deemed or operate to preclude the Indenture
Trustee from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any
other jurisdiction to realize on the Receivables or any security
for the obligations of the Issuer arising hereunder or to enforce a
judgment or other court order in favor of the Indenture Trustee.
Each party hereto submits and

consents in advance to such jurisdiction in any action or suite
commenced in any such court, and each party hereto hereby waives
any objection that such party may have based upon lack of personal

in this Section 1.02 shall affect the right of any
party hereto to serve legal process in any other manner permitted

arising in connection with complex financial transactions are most
quickly and economically resolved by an experienced and expert
person and the parties wish applicable state and federal laws to
apply (rather than arbitration rules), the parties desire that
their disputes be resolved by a judge applying such applicable
laws. Therefore, to achieve the best combination of the benefits of
the judicial system and of arbitration, the parties hereto waive
all rights to trial by jury in any action, suit, or proceeding
brought to resolve any dispute, whether sounding in contract, tort
or otherwise, arising out of, or connection with, related to, or
incidental to the relationship established among them in connection

provided , however , that the Indenture

Investment if, prior to the maturity of such Eligible Investment, a
default occurs in the payment of principal, interest or any other
amount with respect to such Eligible Investment; provided

deliver prompt written notice to the Indenture Trustee of any such

capacity, in accordance with their terms.

Business Days) establish a new Principal Funding Account meeting
the conditions specified in Section 4.06(a)(i) above as
an Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any funds or other
property to such new Principal Funding Account or (ii) the Issuer
determines for any reason that the Principal Funding Account should
be held at a different Eligible Institution, then upon prior
written notice to the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer shall establish
or cause to be established a new Principal Funding Account that is
an Eligible Deposit Account and shall transfer any funds or other
property from such Principal Funding Account to such new Principal
Funding account. From the date each such new Principal Funding
Account is established, it shall be the “Principal Funding
Account.”

(ii)                
Pursuant to the authority granted to the Servicer in
Section 3.1 of the Servicing Agreement, the Servicer shall
have the power to instruct the Indenture Trustee to make
withdrawals and payments from the Principal Funding Account for the
purposes of carrying out the Servicer’s or Indenture
Trustee’s duties hereunder.

(c)                
The Controlled Accumulation Period is scheduled to commence the
first Business Day of the month that is twelve (12) calendar months
prior to the Expected Final Payment Date; provided ,
however , that if the Controlled Accumulation Period Length
(determined as described below) is less than twelve (12) months,
then the date on which the Controlled Accumulation Period actually
commences will be the first Business Day of the month that is the
number of whole months prior to the Expected Final Payment Date at
least equal to the Controlled Accumulation Period Length. On or
before the second Business Day immediately preceding the first
Business Day of the month that is twelve (12) months prior to the
Expected Final Payment Date, the Servicer shall determine the
“ Controlled Accumulation Period Length ,” which
shall equal the number of months not less than the number of whole
calendar months reasonably expected by the Servicer to be necessary
to accumulate from Series 2016-1 Available Principal Collections
and Shared Excess Available Principal Collections expected to be
available to Series 2016-1 from other Shared Excess Available
Principal Collections Series during the Controlled Accumulation
Period an amount equal to the Series 2016-1 Stated Principal
Amount; provided , however , that the Controlled
Accumulation Period Length shall not be determined to be less than
one month.

Section 4.07.        
Investor Charge-Offs . On or prior to each Note Transfer
Date, the Servicer shall calculate the Series 2016-1 Default
Amount, if any, for the related Payment Date. If, for any Payment
Date, the Series 2016-1 Default Amount for the related Monthly
Period exceeds the amount available therefor pursuant to
Section 4.04(d) with respect to such Monthly Period,
the Allocation Amount will be reduced by the amount of such excess,
but not by more than the Series 2016-1 Default Amount for such
Payment Date (such reduction, an “ Investor Charge-Off
”).

Section 4.08.        
Reallocated Principal Collections . On each Payment Date,
the Servicer shall apply, to the extent permitted herein, or shall
instruct the Indenture Trustee in writing to apply Reallocated
Principal Collections with respect to such Payment Date, in an
amount equal to the lesser of (a) the Series 2016-1 Principal
Collections, less any amount released and used to purchase
Receivables under Section 4.01(f) , for the related Monthly
Period or (b) the Monthly Subordination Amount for such
Payment Date in accordance with the priority

set forth in Sections 4.04(a) and (b) . On each
Payment Date, the Allocation Amount shall be reduced by the amount
of Reallocated Principal Collections for such Payment Date.

Section 4.09.

(a)                
Series 2016-1 shall be included in Shared Excess Available Finance
Charge Collections Group One for the purpose of sharing Shared

Charge Collections with respect to any Monthly Period shall be
shared within Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections
Group One to cover the applicable Series Available Finance Charge
Collections Shortfalls for such Monthly Period, if any, and applied
on the Note Transfer Date in the immediately succeeding Monthly
Period for each Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections
Group Series with a Series Available Finance Charge Collections
Shortfall for such Monthly Period. Shared Excess Available Finance
Charge Collections allocable to Series 2016-1 with respect to each
Monthly Period shall mean an amount equal to the Series Available
Finance Charge Collections Shortfall, if any, with respect to
Series 2016-1 for such Monthly Period; provided ,
however , that if the aggregate amount of Shared Excess
Available Finance Charge Collections for all Series in Shared
Excess Available Finance Charge Collections Group One for each
Monthly Period is less than the Aggregate Series Available Finance
Charge Collections Shortfall for such Monthly Period, then Shared
Excess Available Finance Charge Collections allocable to Series
2016-1 with respect to such Monthly Period shall equal the product
of (i) Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections for
all Series in Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections
Group One for such Monthly Period and (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Series Available Finance Charge
Collections Shortfall with respect to Series 2016-1 for such
Monthly Period and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Series
Available Finance Charge Collections Shortfall for such Monthly
Period.

(c)                
Unless otherwise specified in the Indenture Supplement for any
other Series in Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections
Group One, any Shared Excess Available Finance Charge Collections
for each Series in Shared Excess Available Finance Charge
Collections Group One for any Monthly Period which shall remain

applicable Series Available Principal Collections Shortfalls for
such Monthly Period, if any, for each Shared Excess Available
Principal Collections Series with a Series Available Principal
Collections Shortfall for such Monthly Period, and such Shared
Excess Available Principal Collections allocable to Series 2016-1
shall be distributed or deposited on the dates and in the order of
priority provided for under Sections 4.05(b)(i)-(iii) .
Shared Excess Available Principal Collections allocable to Series
2016-1 with respect to each Monthly Period shall mean an amount
equal to the Series Available Principal Collections Shortfall, if
any, with respect to Series 2016-1 for such Monthly Period;
provided , however , that if the aggregate amount of
Shared Excess Available Principal Collections for all Series in
Shared Excess Available Principal Collections Group One for each
Monthly Period is less than the Aggregate Series Available
Principal Collections Shortfall for such Monthly Period, then
Shared Excess Available Principal Collections allocable to Series
2016-1 with respect to such Monthly Period shall equal the product
of (i) Shared Excess Available Principal Collections for all
Series in Shared Excess Available Principal Collections Group One
for such Monthly Period and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Series Available Principal Collections Shortfall with
respect to Series 2016-1 for such Monthly Period and the
denominator of which is the Aggregate Series Available Principal
Collections Shortfall for such Monthly Period.

(c)                
Unless otherwise specified in the Indenture Supplement for any
other Series in Shared Excess Available Principal Collections Group
One, any Shared Excess Available Principal Collections for each
Series in Shared Excess Available Principal Collections Group One
for any Monthly Period which shall remain after application
pursuant to clause (b) above shall be paid to the holders of
the Transferor Interest. Shared Excess Available Principal
Collections will not be available for application by other Series
of Notes that are not included in Shared Excess Available Principal
Collections Group One.

Section 4.11.        
Accumulation Reserve Account .

(a)                
The Servicer shall cause to be established and maintain an Eligible
Deposit Account (the “ Accumulation Reserve Account
”) bearing a designation clearly indicating that the funds
and other property credited thereto are held for the benefit of the
Indenture Trustee and the Series 2016-1 Noteholders in accordance
with Section 5.02(c) of the Indenture. The Indenture Trustee
shall possess all right, title and interest in all funds and
property from time to time credited to the Accumulation Reserve
Account and in all proceeds thereof. The Accumulation Reserve
Account shall be under the exclusive control of the Indenture
Trustee for the benefit of the Series 2016-1 Noteholders. If at any
time (i) the Accumulation Reserve Account ceases to be an Eligible
Deposit Account, the Transferor shall notify the Indenture Trustee,
and the Indenture Trustee upon being notified in writing of such
ineligibility (or the Servicer or the Owner Trustee for the Issuer)
shall within thirty (30) Business Days (or such longer period
not to exceed forty-five (45) Business Days upon satisfaction
of the Note Rating Agency Condition) establish a new Accumulation
Reserve Account meeting the conditions specified above as an
Eligible Deposit Account, and shall transfer any funds or other
property to such new Accumulation Reserve Account or (ii) the
Issuer determines for any reason that the Accumulation Reserve
Account should be held at a different Eligible Institution, then
upon prior written notice to the Indenture Trustee, the Issuer
shall establish or cause to be established a new Accumulation
Reserve Account that is an Eligible Deposit Account and shall
transfer any funds or other property from such Accumulation Reserve
Account to such new Accumulation Reserve

Account. From the date each such new Accumulation Reserve Account
is established, it shall be the “Accumulation Reserve
Account.” The Indenture Trustee, at the direction of the
Servicer, shall (i) make withdrawals from the Accumulation
Reserve Account from time to time in an amount up to the Available
Accumulation Reserve Account Amount at such time, for the purposes
set forth in this Indenture Supplement, and (ii) on each
Payment Date during the Accumulation Reserve Account Funding Period
make a deposit into the Accumulation Reserve Account in the amount
specified in, and otherwise in accordance with,
Section 4.04(f) .

(b)               
If a securities intermediary has been appointed, funds on deposit
in the Accumulation Reserve Account, on any Note Transfer Date,
after giving effect to any withdrawals from the Accumulation
Reserve Account on such Note Transfer Date, shall be invested by
the Indenture Trustee in Eligible Investments selected by the
Servicer in accordance with written instructions from the Servicer;
provided , that the funds are invested in investments that
shall mature so that such funds shall be available for withdrawal
on or prior to the following Note Transfer Date. No such Eligible
Investment shall be disposed of prior to its maturity;
provided , however , that the Indenture
Trustee shall sell, liquidate or dispose of any such Eligible
Investment if, prior to the maturity of such Eligible Investment, a
default occurs in the payment of principal, interest or any other
amount with respect to such Eligible Investment; provided
further , however , that the Servicer shall
deliver prompt written notice to the Indenture Trustee of any such
default; and provided further , that, subject to
Section 8.01 of the Indenture, the Indenture Trustee shall not
in any way be held liable by reason of any insufficiency in such
Accumulation Reserve Account resulting from any loss on any
Eligible Investment included therein except for losses attributable
to the Indenture Trustee’s failure to make payments on such
Eligible Investments issued by the Indenture Trustee, in its
commercial capacity, in accordance with their terms. On each Note
Transfer Date, all interest and earnings (net of losses and
investment expenses) accrued since the preceding Note Transfer Date
on funds on deposit in the Accumulation Reserve Account shall be
retained in the Accumulation Reserve Account (to the extent that
the Available Accumulation Reserve Account Amount is less than the
Required Accumulation Reserve Account Amount) and the balance, if
any, shall be deposited in the Collection Account for application
in accordance with Section 4.04 . For purposes of
determining the availability of funds or the balance in the
Accumulation Reserve Account for any reason under this Indenture
Supplement, except as otherwise provided in the preceding sentence,
investment earnings, if any, on such funds shall be deemed not to
be available or on deposit.

(c)                
On the Note Transfer Date preceding (i) each Payment Date with
respect to the Controlled Accumulation Period and (ii) the first
Payment Date of the Early Amortization Period, the Servicer shall
calculate the “ Accumulation Reserve Draw Amount
” which shall be equal to the excess, if any, of the Covered
Amount with respect to such Payment Date over the Principal
Funding Account Investment Proceeds with respec

Forward - looking Statements This document contains certain forward - looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Section 27A of the US Securities Act of 1933, as amended,  with respect to certain of the Barclays PLCs and its subsidiaries (the Group) plans and its current goals and expectations  rel ating to its future financial condition and performance. Barclays cautions readers that no  forward - looking statement is a guarantee of future performance and that actual results could differ materially from those contai ned in the forward - looking statements. These forward - looking statements can be identified by  the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts. Forward - looking statements sometimes use words such as ma y, will, seek, continue, aim, anticipate, target, projected, expect, estimate, intend,  plan, goal, believe, achieve or other words of similar meaning. Examples of forward - looking statements include, among ot hers, statements regarding the Groups future financial position, income growth, assets,  impairment charges and provisions, business strategy, capital, leverage and other regulatory ratios, payment of dividends (in clu ding dividend pay - out ratios), projected levels of growth in the banking and financial markets,  projected costs, original and revised commitments and targets in connection with the Transform Programme or any other strateg ic  programme. , deleveraging actions, estimates of capital expenditures and plans and  objectives for future operations and other statements that are not historical fact. By their nature, forward - looking statements  involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. These may  be affected by changes in legislation, the development of standards and interpretations under International Financial Reporti ng  Standards (IFRS), evolving practices with regard to the interpretation and application of  accounting and regulatory standards, the outcome of current and future legal proceedings and regulatory investigations, futur e l evels of conduct provisions, the policies and actions of governmental and regulatory  authorities, geopolitical risks and the impact of competition. In addition, factors including (but not limited to) the follow ing may have an effect: capital, leverage and other regulatory rules (including with regard to the future  structure of the Group) applicable to past, current and future periods; UK, US, Africa,  Eurozone and global macroeconomic and business conditions; the effects of continued volatility in credit markets; market related risks such as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates; effects of changes in valuation of credit market exposures; cha nge s in valuation of issued securities; volatility in capital markets; changes in credit ratings of  the Group; the potential for one or more countries exiting the  Eurozone ; the implementation of the Transform Programme; and the success of future acquisitions, disposals and other strategic transa cti ons. A number of  these influences and factors are beyond the Groups control. As a result, the Groups actual future results, dividend payment s,  and capital and leverage ratios may differ materially from the plans, goals, and expectations  set forth in the Groups forward - looking statements. Additional risks and factors are identified in our filings with the U.S. Se curities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) including in our Annual Report on Form 20 - F for the  fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, which is available on the SECs website at  http://www.sec.gov . Any forward - looking statements made herein speak only as of the date they are made and it should not be assumed that they have b een revised or updated in the light of new information or future events. Except as  required by the Prudential Regulation Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority, the London Stock Exchange plc (the LSE) or  app licable law, Barclays expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly  any updates or revisions to any forward - looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in Barclays expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such  statement is based.

(a)
               
In accordance
with Section 18-301(d) of the Delaware Act, the Initial Member has
not made, and is not required to make, a contribution to the
Company.  Except as otherwise agreed by all Members, the
Initial Member shall have no right or obligation to make any
capital contributions to the Company.  Persons or entities
hereafter admitted as Members of the Company shall make such
contributions of cash, property, services or promissory obligations
to the Company as shall be determined by the Members, acting
unanimously, at the time of each such admission.

(b)
              
As of the date of
this Agreement, the Initial Member is the sole Member of the
Company.  At all times that the Company has only one Member,
the Company shall be disregarded for federal and, where applicable,
state, local and foreign income tax purposes and all items of
income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or the like of the Company
shall be treated as items of income, gain, loss, deduction, credit
or the like of the Member.

(c)
               
If at any time
the Company has more than one Member, the Members may determine
that the Company shall be taxed as a “partnership” for
federal and, where applicable, state, local and foreign income tax
purposes, and, if they so determine, the following provisions shall
apply:

(i)
                
A single,
separate capital account shall be established and maintained for
each Member.  Each Member’s capital account shall be
credited with the amount of money and the fair market value of
property (net of any liabilities secured by such contributed
property that the Company assumes or takes subject to) contributed
by that Member to the Company; the amount of any Company
liabilities assumed by such Member (other than in connection with a
distribution of Company property); and such Member’s
distributive share of Company profits (including tax exempt
income).  Each Member’s capital account shall be debited
with the amount of money and the fair market value of property (net
of any liabilities that such Member assumes or takes subject to)
distributed to such Member; the amount of any liabilities of such
Member assumed by the Company (other than in connection with a
contribution); and such Member’s distributive share of
Company losses (including items that may be neither deducted nor
capitalized for federal income tax purposes).

(ii)
              
Notwithstanding
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each
Member’s capital account shall be maintained and adjusted in
accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
“Internal Revenue Code”), and the regulations
thereunder (the “Regulations”), including, without
limitation, (x) the adjustments permitted or required by Internal
Revenue Code Section 704(b) and, to the extent applicable, the
principles expressed in Internal Revenue Code Section 704(c) and
(y) adjustments required to maintain capital accounts in accordance
with the “substantial economic effect test” set forth
in the Regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section
704(b).  No Member shall have any obligation to contribute any
amount to the Company in the event of a negative balance of its
capital

account, and the
Members’ intend to use a “qualified income
offset” provision as defined in Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)
of the Regulations.

(iii)
            
Any Member,
including any substitute Member, who shall receive an Interest (or
whose Interest shall be increased) by means of a transfer to him of
all or a part of the Interest of another Member, shall have a
capital account that reflects the capital account associated with
the transferred Interest (or the applicable percentage thereof in
case of a transfer of a part of an Interest).

(iv)
            
All items of
Company income, gain, loss, deduction, credit or the like shall be
allocated among the Members in accordance with their respective
Percentage Interests as set forth on Schedule I . 

(d)
              
The fiscal year
of the Company shall be a calendar year.  Unless otherwise
determined by the Board of Directors, the books and records of the
Company shall be maintained in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

(e)
               
(i) 
Each
Member’s Interest shall be recorded on the books of the
Company and, unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors,
no certificate evidencing a Member’s Interest in the Company
(each, a “Certificate”) shall be issued. The Company shall keep or cause to be kept
a register in which, subject to such regulations as the Board of
Directors may adopt, the Company will provide for the registration
of Interests and the registration of transfers of Interests. 
The Company shall maintain such register and provide for such
registration.  The books of the Company shall be
conclusive evidence of the ownership of all Interests in the
Company.  Subject to the further terms of this Agreement,
including the restrictions and limitations on transfer set forth in
Section 10 hereof, the Interests in the Company shall be
transferable on the books of the Company by the record holder
thereof or by its duly authorized agent upon delivery to the
Company of a duly executed instrument of transfer, a written
agreement of the transferee to be bound by all terms and conditions
hereof and such other instruments as the Board of Directors may
reasonably require and such evidence of the genuineness of the
execution and authorization of the foregoing as may be required by
the Board of Directors.  Subject to the further terms of this
Agreement, including the restrictions and limitations on transfer
set forth in Section 10 hereof, upon delivery of the foregoing
instruments and compliance with the foregoing conditions, the
transfer shall be recorded on the books of the Company.  Until
a transfer is so recorded, the owners of record of Interests shall
be deemed to be the owners for all purposes hereunder and neither
any Member nor the Company shall be affected by any notice of a
proposed transfer.

(ii)
              
In the event that
the Board of Directors determines to issue Certificates, the
following shall apply:

(A)             
Each Certificate shall be executed
by such persons as are designated by the Board of
Directors.

(B)              
Upon surrender for registration of
transfer of any Certificate, and subject to the further provisions
of this Section 7(e) and the limitations on transfer contained
elsewhere in this Agreement, the Company will cause the execution,
in the

name of the registered holder or
the designated transferee, of one or more new Certificates,
evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest as did the
Certificate surrendered.  Every Certificate surrendered for
registration of transfer shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Board of Directors duly executed, by the registered holder thereof
or such holder's authorized attorney.

(C)              
The Company
shall issue a new Certificate in place of any Certificate
previously issued if the record holder of the Certificate (w) makes
proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to
the Board of Directors
, that a previously issued
Certificate has been lost, destroyed or stolen, (x) requests the
issuance of a new Certificate before the Company has received
notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for
value in good faith and without notice of an adverse claim, (y) if
requested by the Board of Directors , delivers to the Company a bond, in form
and substance satisfactory to the Board of Directors
, with such surety or sureties
and with fixed or open liability as the Board of Directors
may direct, to indemnify the
Company, as registrar, against any claim that may be made on
account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the
Certificate, and (z) satisfies any other reasonable requirements
imposed by the Board of Directors . 

(iii)
            
An Interest in
the Company evidenced by a Certificate shall constitute a security
for all purposes of Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code
promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform
State Laws, as in effect in Delaware or any other applicable
jurisdiction (the “UCC”). An Interest in the Company
not evidenced by a Certificate shall not constitute a security for
all purposes of Article 8 of the UCC. Delaware law shall constitute
the local law of the Company’s jurisdiction in its capacity
as the issuer of Interests.

8.
                 
Management of
the Company . 

(a)
               
Subject to the
delegation of rights and powers as provided for herein and except
as otherwise herein provided, management of the Company is vested
in the Board of Directors and the Board of Directors shall have the
sole right and authority to manage and conduct the business and
affairs of the Company and shall have all powers and rights
necessary, appropriate or advisable to effectuate and carry out the
purposes, powers, business and other activities of the
Company. 

(b)
              
The Board of
Directors may appoint, employ or otherwise contract with any
persons or entities for the transaction of the business of the
Company or the performance of services for or on behalf of the
Company, and the Board of Directors may delegate to any such person
(who may be designated an officer of the Company) or entity such
authority to act on behalf of the Company as the Board of Directors
may from time to time deem appropriate.  No Member, by reason
of its status as such, shall have any authority to act for or bind
the Company or otherwise take part in the management of the
business or affairs of the Company; provided that the Members shall
have the right to vote on or approve the actions specified herein
or in the Delaware Act (or hereafter specified by the Board of
Directors) to be voted on or consented to by the Members.  At
any time that there is only one Member, any and all action provided
for herein to be taken or approved by the “Members”
shall be taken or approved by the sole Member.

(c)
