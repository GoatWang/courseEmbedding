An Introduction to Patch of Land
Patch of Land is a Peer-to-Real-Estate (P2RE ®) lending marketplace that matches accredited and institutional investors seeking high-yield, short-term, asset-collateralized investments to borrowers seeking more timely and consistent sources of funding for rehabbing properties across America.
Patch of Land’s goal is to solve the problem of inefficient, fragmented, and opaque real estate private lending by using technology and data-driven processes to create transparency and to efficiently underwrite projects for borrowers with real estate projects that are routinely bypassed by traditional lenders.

We Are Patch of Land
“If you want to go quickly, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together.”
—African Proverb







Our Mission
Patch of Land aims to solve the problem of slow, inefficient, fragmented and obscure private real estate lending by using the latest technology, data and process efficiency to more accurately assign risk profiles and project viability, while greatly reducing time and cost of loan underwriting for borrowers with real estate projects that are overlooked or rejected by banks and traditional lenders.





Our Approach

We make it possible to invest and make a good return while also contributing to something good.
We make it possible to get funding for projects that might otherwise be overlooked by traditional funding streams.
We do this with complete transparency.
We are expanding our borrower network throughout the United States, and aim to keep growing beyond borders. Our investor network is global.
We have come a long way. We still have a long road ahead. The more of us who come together here at Patch of Land, the farther we will go.











What We Are
Patch of Land is crowdfunding real estate through its P2RE (peer-to-peer) online marketplace offering various typologies of secured real estate debt on assets backed by first position liens and personal guarantees. We match investors and lenders seeking alternative fixed income opportunities to borrowers seeking alternative sources of financing for their real estate investment needs.


What We Do
Patch of Land originates, underwrites and services loans, offering these back to accredited investors through Crowdfunding exemptions of the JOBS Act and SEC regulations: Title II, Reg D 506(c).
Patch of Land currently serves accredited, institutional and international investors.






Our Story
Jason Fritton, a successful e-commerce entrepreneur, wanted to help repair communities across the country that were devastated by the real estate crash and implement changes to keep it from happening again. He was an early lobbyist for exemptions that would encourage and democratize capital formation for new business to be written into the JOBS Act (Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act). The law passed in 2012, including the crowdfunding exemptions he’d worked for.
He joined forces with his brother Brian Fritton, an award-winning enterprise-level software engineer and system architect with the same passion for encouraging growth through economic development – and state of the art technology, to put the opportunities the JOBS Act enabled into affect.

The Founders united their ideas, experience and resources to form Patch of Land, where transparency, low minimums, project-by-project investment and ease of transaction would set the stage for real change and real profit.

We also complete an independent background check of the borrower and the corporation .
Once we review all the items, the developer is called to discuss details and answer any questions. If everything looks good, the loan is presented to our Executive team to determine the Interest Rate, Points & Structure of the loan.
It is important to note, that many factors go into the underwriting of a loan. We typically like the developer to put money into the deal (the more, the better). How “seasoned” is the developer? Are they buying under market value? What is the LTV? More importantly, what will the ARV (After Renovated Value) be? We typically look for an ARV to be around 60% of the loan. Is it in an appreciating market?
We then call the developer to present the Letter of Engagement and answer any questions they may have. Once the developer agrees to the Terms, an appraisal and legal work are ordered.


All of this usually takes about 24 hours at this point. Then the appraisal is ordered.
The appraisal will usually take 4-5 days to be completed and returned to the Underwriter for review. This is a crucial part of the underwriting process because we always use a licensed independent third appraiser to evaluate the property and give us two values: the “AS IS” value and the “SUBJECT TO” value. This can make or break a deal or at the very least, renegotiate the loan size. The appraiser is our eyes and ears at the property and helps ensure our due diligence to protect our investors’ capital.
Once everything is signed off by the Underwriter, it is scheduled to close.
In total, a loan can close as quickly as 5 days but on average it’s about 10 business days.

We Are Patch of Land
“If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”
—African Proverb





Our Mission
Patch of Land aims to solve the problem of slow, inefficient, fragmented and obscure private real estate lending by using the latest technology, data and process efficiency to more accurately assign risk profiles and project viability, while greatly reducing time and cost of loan underwriting for borrowers with real estate projects that are overlooked or rejected by banks and traditional lenders.





Our Approach

We make it possible to invest and make a good return while also contributing to something good.
We make it possible to get funding for projects that might otherwise be overlooked by traditional funding streams.
We do this with complete transparency.
We are expanding our borrower network throughout the United States, and aim to keep growing beyond borders. Our investor network is global.
We have come a long way. We still have a long road ahead. The more of us who come together here at Patch of Land, the farther we will go.










What We Are
Patch of Land is crowdfunding real estate through its P2RE (peer-to-peer) online marketplace offering various typologies of secured real estate debt on assets backed by first position liens and personal guarantees. We match investors and lenders seeking alternative fixed income opportunities to borrowers seeking alternative sources of financing for their real estate investment needs.


What We Do
Patch of Land originates, underwrites and services loans, offering these back to accredited investors through Crowdfunding exemptions of the JOBS Act and SEC regulations: Title II, Reg D 506(c).
Patch of Land currently serves accredited, institutional and international investors.






Our Story
Jason Fritton, a successful e-commerce entrepreneur, wanted to help repair communities across the country that were devastated by the real estate crash and implement changes to keep it from happening again. He was an early lobbyist for exemptions that would encourage and democratize capital formation for new business to be written into the JOBS Act (Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act). The law passed in 2012, including the crowdfunding exemptions he’d worked for.
He joined forces with his brother Brian Fritton, an award-winning enterprise-level software engineer and system architect with the same passion for encouraging growth through economic development – and state of the art technology, to put the opportunities the JOBS Act enabled into affect.
The Founders united their ideas, experience and resources to form Patch of Land, where transparency, low minimums, project-by-project investment and ease of transaction would set the stage for real change and real profit.
 


Our people are the backbone of our community.

Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration.

Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.

Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.

Composite Score:





                        Patch of Land, Inc. has received 3.46 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 05/07/2014
            

                BBB has determined that Patch of Land, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by:

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Patch of Land, Inc. has received 3.46 out of 5 stars based on 1 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Patch of Land, Inc.











los angeles 
k 2 






Launched 2013
Patch of Land (POL) is a crowdfunding solution for real estate financing that brings borrowers and lenders together through a simple online interface. Patch of Land’s goal is to solve the problem of inefficient, fragmented, and opaque real estate lending by using proprietary technology and data-driven processes to create transparency and efficiently underwrite projects. We offer accredited investors the ability to easily diversify their funds while helping borrowers gain access to money for rehabilitating properties in need. In fact, we prefund every loan with our own money so we look at each investment opportunity as if our own skin was in the game - because it is. This way, borrowers receive the funding for their projects without delay, while lenders can start earning interest on their investment right away.
Patch of Land fills the void in between slow, over-regulated banks, and hard money lenders that cannot supply timely or consistent sources of capital. Our transparent, simple and efficient solution allows accredited investors to easily diversify their funds while giving borrowers reliable access to funds for rehabilitating properties in need. Together with our marketplace of investors and borrowers, we facilitate the work of rebuilding neighborhoods, increasing property values, creating jobs, and stimulating local economies throughout the nation.

An Introduction to Patch of Land
