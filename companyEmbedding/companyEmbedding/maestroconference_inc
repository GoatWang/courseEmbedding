About MaestroConference

MaestroConference, a 500 Startups company, is the leader in Social Conferencing™, a technology that allows people to participate in large-scale, truly interactive virtual events featuring real conversations. Using social conferencing, thousands of people can convene around a topic or cause, engage in small group conversation to learn and share, and inspire one another to action and change.
Our mission is to light up the world with the power of meaningful, large-scale conversations. We believe intentional conversations that connect live voices can build relationships, develop minds, open hearts, and change the world.
Our social conferencing platform and its unique patent-pending features are dramatically more engaging than passive video or audio streaming, typing-based social media, or 1-to-many conference calls or webinars - allowing our clients to teach, inspire and sell more effectively.
Our customers include BarackObama.com/Organizing for America, the Democratic National Committee, numerous best-selling authors such as Jack Canfield, Jean Houston, and Barbara Marx Hubbard, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Greenopolis/Waste Management, and over 700 others in more than 15 countries.
In January 2016, MaestroConference was accepted into Silicon Valley's top technology accelerator, 500 Startups. MaestroConference joins this highly selective accelerator as one of the 50 companies (out of 1,500+ applications) comprising 500 Startups' Batch 16. With 500 Startups' funding and mentorship, the MaestroConference team is working closely with some of the Valley's top investors and founders to grow the company towards our mission.
