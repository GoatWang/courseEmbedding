David Pauldine masterfully united a group of leaders in Higher Education known for seeing the purpose of education in strikingly different ways. His effortless style bringing data to life in a way that spoke to the specific and often unique challenges to then address what everyone had in common won the day.

Under Dave’s guidance we revitalized a longtime program for campus leaders.

Easily approachable and affable, he is a terrific presenter and speaker.
– Diane Miller, Senior Vice President, The Association of Private Sector Colleges & Universities

Paul to Succeed Pauldine as President of DeVry University






March 18, 2014 04:45 PM Eastern Daylight Time



DOWNERS GROVE, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--DeVry Education Group (NYSE:DV), a global provider of educational 
      services, today announced that Robert Paul will succeed David J. 
      Pauldine as president of DeVry University effective July 1, 2014. The 
      DeVry University board of trustees in conjunction with the DeVry Group 
      board of directors began an exhaustive internal and external search 
      following Pauldine’s announcement last November that he intended to 
      retire. Paul is currently president of Carrington College California, a 
      part of DeVry Education Group. Prior to that, Paul served as vice 
      president of metro operations at DeVry University.
    


      “Rob is a proven leader having successfully led Carrington through its 
      ongoing turnaround. Given his in–depth knowledge of the operations at 
      DeVry University, he is the perfect choice to succeed Dave,” said 
      Richard Rodriguez, chairman of the board of trustees of DeVry 
      University. “We would like to thank Dave for his many years of dedicated 
      service to the students of DeVry University and will wish him well once 
      he retires. Until then, we look forward to working closely with him as 
      he helps Rob transition into his new role.”
    

      Pauldine will remain with DeVry Group through September to ensure a 
      smooth transition of leadership. The governing board of Carrington 
      College California plans to conduct an internal and external search for 
      Paul’s successor. Contact Constantine Alexandrakis at constantine.alexandrakis@russellreynolds.com 
      for more information.
