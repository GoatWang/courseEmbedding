Wear Strips 








Submitted by kaman_admin on Mon, 2015-12-14 14:08 




Kaman offers multiple types of Wear Strips with each providing unique characteristics to prevent metal-to-metal wear and fretting damage from sliding or rubbing surfaces.






Wear Strips Products





KAron V Wear Strip 


P54 Wear Strip 


Ultra-Light Duty ST Wear Strip 















KAron V Wear Strip



KAron V Wear Strip consists of standard KAron Grade V self-lubricating bearing material applied on to a thin fiberglass substrate. The KAron V bearing material provides a low sliding friction for wear resistance. KAron V Wear Strip comes with a removable woven nylon peel - ply on the back of the fiberglass to protect the bonding surface from dirt and debris.
KAron V Wear Strip is designed for surfaces that are subjected to light to medium duty rubbing pressure, or as a fretting resistant barrier. The mating sliding material should be smooth, hard, and a corrosion resistant surface. For optimal KAron V liner performance, the sliding component should have a minimum surface roughness of 16 RMS (0.4 μm), and be in full contact with the KAron V Wear Strip to avoid line or point loads.
karon 










P54 Wear Strip



P54 Wear Strip is a thin sheet self-lubricating bearing material comprised of a resilient thermoset resin matrix with synthetic fibers in a laminate construction for strength and durability. P54 Wear Strip comes with a removable woven nylon peel-ply on one surface to protect the bonding surface from dirt and debris.
P54 Wear Strip is designed for applications where standard off – the - shelf wear resistant plastics fall short in performance. P54 Wear Strip can be used where impact resistance is required, under edge loading, in heavy abrasion applications, and where gross amounts of contaminants can be expected. P54 Wear Strip can operate against rough surfaces and against soft materials such as aluminum or composites.
p54 










P54 Thin Wear Strip



P54 Thin Wear Strip consists of the same resilient thermoset resin matrix and type of synthetic fibers as P54 with a thinner cross section of 0.010" (0.25mm). P54 Thin Wear Strip comes with a removable woven nylon peel-ply on one surface to protect the bonding surface from dirt and debris.
P54 Thin Wear Strip is ideal for applications that require impact, fretting, or abrasion resistance along a thin cross section. The mating sliding material should be smooth, hard, and a corrosion resistant surface.

Titanium Diffusion Hardening (TDH) 








Submitted by kaman_admin on Mon, 2015-12-14 16:07 




Alleviate wear scarring with highly efficient, high load, lightweight bearings


 








Titanium Diffusion Hardening (TDH) is a surface-hardening process for titanium alloys that significantly improves its tribological properties in lined self-lubricating bearing systems by providing a high-hardness outer surface to the titanium base material. This is a diffusion hardening process (not a coating); conducted in a controlled atmosphere that yields a deep, uniform, hardened case layer within the titanium component. TDH will consistently yield a high-hardness case layer with an affected depth that is unmatched by other titanium surface engineering processes.
“Using our proprietary Titanium Diffusion-Hardening process, we’ve really been able to raise the bar for lightweight self-lubricating plain bearing systems. Using a diffusion-hardened Ti64 mating surface, we’ve been able to achieve KAron wear and friction results equivalent to those we experience with high-hardness stainless steels (at nearly half the assembly weight)” said Mat Mormino, VP of Engineering, KAMAN Specialty Bearings & Engineered Products. 
In applications that require low overall weight, titanium alloy is a popular choice for bearing material. For years customers using these bearings struggled with the fact that at very high bearing loads (such as those specified in AS81820), titanium alloys tend to exhibit less-stable dynamic friction coefficients. Titanium alloy bearings can also be subject to surface distress (wear scarring of the titanium). Using a diffusion-hardened Ti64 mating surface within self-lubricating bearing systems, KAMAN Specialty Bearings & Engineered Products has been able to alleviate wear scarring, providing customers with a solution for highly efficient, high load, lightweight bearings.
TDH treated titanium Journal bearings have successfully passed the test requirements of AS81934 (High Load-Wear) at four times the required cycles with only one-tenth the allowable wear. From the figure below one can easily discern that during high load-wear testing, bearings utilizing the TDH capability significantly outperform those that have not been treated. In addition to the AS81934 test, TDH treated titanium spherical bearings have also passed the respective tests of AS81820 (high-load spherical bearing tests).

History[edit]
The company began as Kaman Music Corporation /kəˈmɑːn/, a part of the Kaman Corporation founded by Charles Kaman. In addition to his business interests in aviation, Kaman was a guitarist who came to explore the use of composite materials technologies in guitar building. He and his engineers created the round-backed, composite-body Ovation guitar in 1966.
In January, 2008, Kaman Corporation sold Kaman Music Corporation to Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) for $117 million.[2]
In 2011, Kaman Music Corporation and Musicorp, sister companies under the FMIC umbrella, united their sales and catalog divisions as KMC Musicorp.[3][4][5]
In 2014, FMIC sold KMC's Gretsch Drums, TOCA Percussion, Latin Percussion, KAT Percussion, Ovation guitar and Gibraltar Hardware brands to Drum Workshop.[6]
In February 2015, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation sold KMC to JAM Industries[1]

History[edit]
The company began as Kaman Music Corporation /kəˈmɑːn/, a part of the Kaman Corporation founded by Charles Kaman. In addition to his business interests in aviation, Kaman was a guitarist who came to explore the use of composite materials technologies in guitar building. He and his engineers created the round-backed, composite-body Ovation guitar in 1966.
In January, 2008, Kaman Corporation sold Kaman Music Corporation to Fender Musical Instruments Corporation (FMIC) for $117 million.[2]
In 2011, Kaman Music Corporation and Musicorp, sister companies under the FMIC umbrella, united their sales and catalog divisions as KMC Musicorp.[3][4][5]
In 2014, FMIC sold KMC's Gretsch Drums, TOCA Percussion, Latin Percussion, KAT Percussion, Ovation guitar and Gibraltar Hardware brands to Drum Workshop.[6]
In February 2015, Fender Musical Instruments Corporation sold KMC to JAM Industries[1]

About Kaman Industrial Technologies



About Kaman

		Kaman Industrial Technologies is a subsidiary of Kaman Corporation, a diversified $1   billion company providing high technology products and services. 
With nearly 200 branches and major regional distribution centers   and over 35 years in the business, we are one of North America's largest   industrial distributors. We provide a wide range of products and systems related   to bearings, mechanical and electrical power transmission, automation & control,   material handling, and fluid power for the MRO and OEM markets.
Kaman Industrial Technologies brings our commitment of   technological leadership and value-added services to the Industrial Distribution   business. While our core business lies in the supply and application of standard   components, we also offer customers single-source responsibility and   accountability for each product line.
We offer programs that go beyond the role of product provider;   programs proven to deliver a reduction in the total cost of doing business. With   the same spirit of innovation that drove Charles Kaman to found Kaman   Corporation 50 years ago, our people are thinkers, problem solvers, engineers,   and solution providers.
Our focus on customer service is facilitated both by this   dedication to innovation, as well as our hands-on local presence. A Professional   Account Manager has direct responsibility for each individual plant location we   service. The primary contact on a day-to-day basis, this person works closely   with branch operating staff to handle the daily requirements. This relationship   between customer and branch is the grass roots of our day-to-day business, and   is supported by sales and operational management teams within our organization.   The core of our business, our local facilities are backed by national   resources.
A dedication to ingenuity is only as deliverable as the   capability of the people involved. To this end, we seek out and employ product   specialists throughout the company with established expertise in the areas of   automation & control, mechanical, electrical, fluid power, and material handling.   Specialists provide our customers specific product expertise in   trouble-shooting, upgrading from a current product, and securing cost-effective   alternatives.
