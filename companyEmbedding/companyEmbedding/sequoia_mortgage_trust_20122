Kroll Bond Rating Agency Affirms Ratings On Sequoia Mortgage Trust 2012-2 Certificates | Business Wire
























































Kroll Bond Rating Agency Affirms Ratings On Sequoia Mortgage Trust 
      2012-2 Certificates






March 28, 2013 04:22 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) affirms eight classes of mortgage 
      pass-through certificates from Sequoia Mortgage Trust (SEMT) 2012-2, a 
      jumbo prime RMBS transaction (see ratings listed below).
    

      The rating affirmations follow our review of the transaction which 
      utilized information obtained from the Trustee, U.S. Bank National 
      Association. The SEMT 2012-2 mortgage pool has experienced no loss and 
      minimal delinquency since issuance. There are currently no delinquent 
      loans in the mortgage pool. Additionally, principal payments on the pool 
      have resulted in increased credit enhancement to each of the rated 
      classes. KBRA’s analysis of home price trends indicate that the mortgage 
      pool also benefits from home prices which on average have risen since 
      issuance.
    

      For more information on SEMT 2012-2, please see our report, Sequoia 
      Mortgage Trust 2012-2 Surveillance Report which was published today 
      at www.krollbondratings.com.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
