Jared Padalecki Does a Keg Stand for His Birthday!

Eneas Benito |
Domingo, Julio 23, 2017







Jared Padalecki Does A Birthday Keg Stand After His 'Supernatural' Co-Star Jensen Ackles Surprises Him: Watch!
Jared Padalecki celebrated his 35th birthday on Wednesday (July 19) by appearing on Conan's special Comic-Con episode alongside Jensen Ackles! The show is set to release a 13th season this fall."When the show first started, we used to sneak kegs into each other's trailers", Ackles explained. The two definitely have traits that mirror their characters Dean and Sam Winchester - wild children with no supervision who run around drunk sometimes.
As they've aged, however, the kegs turned into half kegs then pint kegs and then eventually no kegs, but this year Ackles made a decision to bring the tradition back. As Padalecki was getting nostalgic on Conan, Ackles joined in with the ideal blast from the past - a full keg from Ackles' own brewing company, Family Business Beer Co.Ackles told Conan O'Brien that he had a surprise for Jared since it happened to be his birthday.
