But don't take our word for it




























"PitchBook data shows who the investors, founders, and other key players are of start-ups and venture capital firms. As simple as this may seem, it's not information that's widely avaliable - espcially not all in one place!"

The US Capital Partners team is led by experienced professionals with years of investment banking, financial advisory, operational, and direct lending experience.



Jeffrey Sweeney

Chairman & CEO, US Capital Partners Inc.
Mr. Sweeney has a strong entrepreneurial approach, which he has applied in the investment banking and equipment leasing arena for nearly 15 years. He has extensive operational knowledge and experience in manufacturing, finance, machine tools, and equipment leasing—all gained as both a consumer of machine tools and later as a principal of US Capital Corporation.
In 1998, Mr. Sweeney purchased the assets of US Capital Corporation, a small equipment leasing company. Changing the focus of the company to structured asset-based lending and investment banking, Mr. Sweeney grew the business to over $4 billion in funding opportunities each year. The new firm, US Capital Partners, both syndicates and provides asset-backed loans for business acquisitions, working capital, equipment leases, recapitalizations, and commercial real estate transactions.
 Until September 2014, Mr. Sweeney served as a Managing Partner at Breakwater Investment Management, LLC and as a member of the firm’s Investment Committee. Breakwater Investment Management is a Los Angeles-based private investment firm that specializes in direct growth-capital investments into promising lower middle market companies, especially businesses with expanding global operations. Mr. Sweeney was seminal in architecting the firm’s inaugural $250 million credit fund, Breakwater Structured Growth Opportunities Fund, LP. As a member of Breakwater’s Investment Committee, Mr. Sweeney played a key role in structuring the firm’s debt investments and also brought in a majority of its investors.
Prior to setting up US Capital Partners, Mr. Sweeney served as a principal and CEO of Machine Works Corporation, a lower middle-market aerospace manufacturing company, from 1979 until its sale in the mid-1990s. An avid sailor, world traveler, and certified yoga instructor, Mr. Sweeney is a regular contributor to several non-profit organizations, including Food for Life, an international humanitarian non-profit association in India. Mr. Sweeney also works with the San Francisco Food Bank and with Educational Opportunities of Los Angeles, which provides educational services for youth.
 Mr. Sweeney graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara with a bachelor’s degree in Business Economics. He is active in the southern California and San Francisco chapters of ACG, TMA, CFA, and other financial organizations.
