PROFESSIONAL INFORMATION


Biographical Notes:

Judge Barry C. Schneider (Ret.) began Schneider Mediation after retiring from the Maricopa County Superior Court. He served on the Court for 21 years from 1986 to 2007. From his first assignment on the civil department through his tenure as civil presiding judge, he took an active leadership role in establishing ADR as part of the legal culture in this community. He was part of the initial pilot project where he conducted hundreds of settlement conferences in all types of civil cases, i.e., medical and ordinary negligence, products liability, and commercial. That project led to the adoption first of a local and then a statewide rule of procedure requiring mandatory settlement conferences. He also provided early leadership in the promotion and development of summary jury trials in Maricopa County, leading to the adoption of the highly successful short trial program in Maricopa County. Judge Schneider published articles in the ABA publication Litigation describing his experiences.

About Attorney
Summary
Office Information





Judge Barry C. Schneider (Ret.) served on the Maricopa County Superior Court for 21 years, from 1986 to 2007. He first practiced in New York City and moved to Phoenix in 1971. He was an associate at Langerman, Begam, Lewis, Leonard & Marks until 1977, when he formed the partnership Rosen & Schneider, Ltd. He has a strong background in Arizona civil litigation from the perspective of both a judge and a civil trial attorney. While on the bench, he served on the Criminal Department, in addition to serving as Presiding Civil Department Judge and Presiding Family Law Judge. His 18-month tenure on the Arizona Supreme Court’s Committee on Jury Reform led to groundbreaking changes in the rules and practice of jury trials in Arizona.
 

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Expertise
 Judge Schneider has been instrumental in establishing ADR as part of the legal culture in the Arizona community. Shortly after his appointment to the bench, Judge Schneider attended the Arizona Supreme Court’s first-ever Settlement Conference Workshop and recognized the need for the court to provide ADR services to the public. He was one of four judges to participate in a pilot project giving judges the authority to order parties to attend settlement conferences conducted by one of the pilot judges. The settlement conferences occurred in cases assigned to the pilot judges approximately 60–90 days before the trial date. The success of the project ultimately led to the adoption of a statewide rule of civil procedure, which gave all the Superior Court judges in the state, as well as any party in the litigation, the power to compel settlement conferences to be held at the courthouse at no cost to the parties. That rule is still in effect and is widely used. Judge Schneider trained many Arizona judges in ADR proceedings and techniques, and conducted hundreds of settlement conferences in all types of civil cases, including medical and ordinary negligence, products liability, and commercial litigation. He also provided early leadership in the promotion and development of summary jury trials in Maricopa County, leading to the adoption of the highly successful short trial program in Maricopa County. He has published articles in  the  American  Bar Association publication Litigation describing his experiences.  He is certified by the American Arbitration Association as a neutral.

About Attorney
Summary
Office Information





Judge Barry C. Schneider (Ret.) served on the Maricopa County Superior Court for 21 years, from 1986 to 2007. He first practiced in New York City and moved to Phoenix in 1971. He was an associate at Langerman, Begam, Lewis, Leonard & Marks until 1977, when he formed the partnership Rosen & Schneider, Ltd. He has a strong background in Arizona civil litigation from the perspective of both a judge and a civil trial attorney. While on the bench, he served on the Criminal Department, in addition to serving as Presiding Civil Department Judge and Presiding Family Law Judge. His 18-month tenure on the Arizona Supreme Court’s Committee on Jury Reform led to groundbreaking changes in the rules and practice of jury trials in Arizona.
 

Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Expertise
  Judge Schneider has been instrumental in establishing ADR as part of the legal culture in the Arizona community. Shortly after his appointment to the bench, Judge Schneider attended the Arizona Supreme Court’s first-ever Settlement Conference Workshop and recognized the need for the court to provide ADR services to the public. He was one of four judges to participate in a pilot project giving judges the authority to order parties to attend settlement conferences conducted by one of the pilot judges. The settlement conferences occurred in cases assigned to the pilot judges approximately 60–90 days before the trial date. The success of the project ultimately led to the adoption of a statewide rule of civil procedure, which gave all the Superior Court judges in the state, as well as any party in the litigation, the power to compel settlement conferences to be held at the courthouse at no cost to the parties. That rule is still in effect and is widely used. Judge Schneider trained many Arizona judges in ADR proceedings and techniques, and conducted hundreds of settlement conferences in all types of civil cases, including medical and ordinary negligence, products liability, and commercial litigation. He also provided early leadership in the promotion and development of summary jury trials in Maricopa County, leading to the adoption of the highly successful short trial program in Maricopa County. He has published articles in  the  American  Bar Association publication Litigation describing his experiences.  He is certified by the American Arbitration Association as a neutral








Mediation
 Judge Schneider provides mediation services for a large variety of civil cases:


Partnership/LLC dissolution
Marital dissolution
Probate disputes
Condemnation
Defective highway design
1983 actions (deprivation of rights)
Debt collection
Ordinary negligence
Subrogation cases

 
Special Discovery Master
 Judge Schneider’s experience on the Bench has enabled him to be appointed as a Special Discovery Master both in federal and state courts. His assignments have included:


Federal lawsuit on an accelerated schedule for a trial between a national railroad company and major utility companies involving a breach of contract claim with millions of dollars at stake
Wrongful death/products liability suit against a national tire company involving sensitive trade secret issues
Wrongful death/product liability suit involving a gas explosion allegedly caused by major utility
Probate/divorce case involving complicated discovery issues concerning millions of dollars
Attorney/client privilege issues in an insurance company bad faith case


 

Expert Witness
 Judge Schneider has been asked to serve as an expert in a variety of cases, including:


Reasonableness of attorneys’ fees alleged as damages in an arbitration against a title insurance company
Reasonable settlement amount in a Himes v. Safeway, 205 Ariz. 31, 66 P.3d 74 (App. 2003) hearing
Reasonableness of guardian ad litem fees in probate proceeding
Reasonableness of on award of child support in a dissolution proceeding

Item Description: Taylor Francis Ltd, United Kingdom, 2016. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book. In the second edition of his unique study of peer relationships in childhood, Dr Barry Schneider re-examines this fundamental aspect of childhood. Taking the work of Jacob Moreno as its starting point, the book provides an up-to-date and accessible understanding of how children develop social competence in different environments, from school to cyberspace. It is informed by a cross-cultural perspective that examines how peer relationships vary in different cultures, as well as among children who have migrated to a new culture, and provides increased coverage of how bullying is perceived and managed within peer groups. The book is informed, too, by new research techniques, both qualitative and quantitative, which mean we know far more about how children relate to each other than ever before. Childhood Friendships and Peer Relations is a fascinating and very timely overview of what we know about making friends and enemies in childhood, showing how these relationships can have lasting effects. It will be essential reading to all students of Developmental Psychology and Educational Psychology, as well as anyone training towards a career working with children and young people.
