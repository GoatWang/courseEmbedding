Assumes all shares currently registered are sold in the continuous offering. Shares will be offered during an initial public offering period at the offering price and
in a continuous offering thereafter at the Funds then current net asset value, as described herein. The Fund expects to incur organizational costs and initial offering costs of approximately $[        ].
The Funds offering costs are being capitalized and amortized over the 12 month period beginning on [            ], 2013. The Fund will also bear certain ongoing offering costs
associated with the Funds continuous offering of Shares. See Fund Expenses.  The Fund is
offering on a continuous basis up to 1,000,000 shares of beneficial interest (Shares). EnTrust Securities LLC (the Distributor) acts as the distributor of the Funds Shares on a best efforts basis, subject to various
conditions. See Plan of Distribution. There is no minimum aggregate amount of Shares required to be purchased in the offering. No arrangements have been made to place funds received in connection with the Shares offering in an
escrow, trust or similar arrangement. Shares will be sold only to Eligible Investors (as defined herein). Shares will not be listed on any securities exchange. See Fund Expenses. 
Investment Portfolio. The Fund invests substantially all of its assets in private investment funds (commonly referred to as hedge
funds) managed by a range of alternative investment managers that employ a variety of investment strategies, including, but not limited to, hedging, distressed securities, event-driven and relative value/arbitrage and special situations. Alternative
investment strategies allow Investment Managers (as defined herein) the flexibility to use leveraged or short-sale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets. These strategies are in contrast to the
investment programs of traditional registered investment companies, such as mutual funds. For a further discussion of the Funds principal investment strategies, see Investment Program. 
Risk Factors and Restrictions on Transfer. Investing in Shares involves a high degree of risk. See Types of Investments and
Related Risks beginning on page [    ]. With very limited exceptions, Shares are not transferable and liquidity will be provided only through repurchase offers, which may be made from time to time by the Fund as
determined by the Funds Board of Trustees in its sole discretion. See Repurchases and Transfers of Shares. 


Management Fee. The Fund pays EnTrust Partners LLC (the Adviser) a
monthly fee of 0.125% (1.50% on an annualized basis) of the Funds month end net asset value (the Management Fee). The Management Fee is an expense paid out of the Funds net assets and is computed based on the value of the net
assets of the Fund as of the close of business on the last business day of each month (including any assets in respect of Shares that will be repurchased as of the end of the month). The Management Fee is in addition to the asset-based fees and
incentive fees/allocations paid by the Investment Funds and indirectly paid by investors in the Fund. See Management Fee.  Eligible Investors. Shares are being sold only to investors that represent that they are both (i) accredited investors within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and (ii) qualified clients as defined in Rule 205-3(d)(1) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The minimum initial investment in the Fund by any
investor is $25,000 and the minimum additional investment in the Fund by any investor is $10,000. The minimum initial and additional investments may be reduced by the Fund with respect to certain individual investors or classes of investors
(specifically, with respect to employees, officers or Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser or their affiliates). Investors may only purchase their shares through the Distributor or through a registered investment adviser (a RIA) that has
entered into an arrangement with the Distributor for such RIA to offer Shares in conjunction with a wrap fee, asset allocation or other managed asset program sponsored by such RIA. Any such RIA may impose additional eligibility
requirements for investors who purchase Shares through such RIA.  This Prospectus concisely provides the information that
a prospective investor should know about the Fund before investing. You are advised to read this Prospectus carefully and to retain it for future reference. Additional information about the Fund, including a statement of additional information
(SAI) dated [            ], 2013, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The SAI is available upon request and without charge by writing to the Fund [c/o
EnTrust Partners LLC, 375 Park Avenue, 24th Floor, New
York, NY 10152 or by calling (212) 888-1040]. The table of contents of the SAI appears on page [    ] of this Prospectus. The SAI, and other information about the Fund, is also available on the SECs website
(http://www.sec.gov). The address of the SECs Internet site is provided solely for the information of prospective investors and is not intended to be an active link.  Shares are not deposits or obligations of, and are not guaranteed or endorsed by, any bank or other insured depository institution, and Shares are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board or any other government agency.  You should rely only on the information
contained in this Prospectus. The Fund has not authorized anyone to provide you with different information. The Fund is not making an offer of Shares in any state or other jurisdiction where the offer is not permitted.

SUMMARY OF TERMS 
 






THE FUND
  
EnTrust Multi-Strategy Master Fund (the Fund) is a Delaware statutory trust that is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940
Act), as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company.




INVESTMENT PROGRAM
  
The Fund seeks long-term capital growth by investing substantially all its assets in investment funds (Investment Funds) managed by a range of unaffiliated
third-party investment managers (Investment Managers) specializing in alternative investment strategies. The Investment Managers employ a variety of investment strategies, including, but not limited to, hedging, distressed securities,
event driven and relative/value arbitrage and special situations. Alternative investment strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leveraged or short-sale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global
capital markets. These strategies are in contrast to the investment programs of traditional registered investment companies, such as mutual funds. Traditional investment companies are generally characterized by long-only
investments and limits on the use of leverage. Because Investment Funds pursuing alternative investment strategies (whether hedged or unhedged) are often described as hedge funds, the Funds investment program can be broadly
referred to as a fund of hedge funds. The investment objective of the Fund is fundamental and may only be changed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities (as defined in the 1940 Act) of the
Fund.





  
Investment Funds are commingled asset pools that engage primarily in the alternative investment strategies described above. Among other things, Investment Funds invest primarily
in U.S. and non-U.S. equity and debt securities and may engage in leverage, short selling and derivative transactions. Investment Funds typically offer their securities privately without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
1933 Act), in large minimum denominations (often at least $1 million) to a limited number of high net worth individual and institutional investors. Investment Funds are excluded from the definition of investment company, and
hence are not registered as investment companies, under the 1940 Act. The managers or investment advisers of these Investment Funds are usually compensated through both asset-based fees and incentive-based fees/allocations. The Fund does not
follow a rigid asset allocation policy, but instead invests in a combination of Investment Funds utilizing a range of strategies. The Adviser (as hereinafter defined) attempts to select individual Investment Managers that offer a variety of
different strategies in an effort to further balance the Funds portfolio and to provide for opportunities for capital growth. Some of the Investment Funds selected by the Adviser may have Investment Managers that use leverage as a material
component of their overall trading strategy.










  
The Fund may seek to gain investment exposure to certain Investment Funds, to adjust market or risk exposure or to increase overall returns by seeking leveraged
market exposure in certain investments by entering into derivative transactions, such as total return swaps, options and futures. For example, to achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an Investment Manager in whose Investment
Fund the Fund could not invest directly, perhaps because of its high investment minimum or its unavailability for direct investment, the Fund may enter into one or more swap agreements under which the Fund may agree, on a net basis, to pay a return
based on a floating interest rate, and to receive the total return of the reference Investment Fund over a stated time period. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Special Investment Instruments and Techniques  Futures
Contracts,  Options Trading and  Swap Agreements. The Fund may incur leveraged exposure through its investments in derivatives, which may, in some circumstances, involve significant risks of loss and may
increase the volatility of the Funds returns. These risks may increase dramatically during times where general access to credit is severely impaired (i.e., a credit crunch) and/or during general market turmoil, such as that
experienced during late 2008/2009. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Leverage Utilized by the Fund.





  
The Adviser is responsible for the allocation of assets to various Investment Funds, subject to policies adopted by the Funds Board of Trustees. These Investment Funds will
have investors other than the Fund.





  
The Adviser allocates Fund assets among the Investment Funds that, in its view, represent attractive investment opportunities. Allocation depends on the Advisers assessment
of the likely risks and returns of the investment strategies that the Investment Funds utilize and the likely correlation among the Investment Funds under consideration. The Adviser generally seeks to invest substantially all of the Funds
assets in Investment Funds whose expected risk-adjusted returns are deemed attractive. The Adviser periodically reallocates the Funds investments among Investment Funds in order to increase the Funds expected risk-adjusted return. There
is no guarantee that the Fund will be able to avoid substantial losses due to poor returns by any Investment Fund or that the Advisers expectations regarding Investment Funds limited correlations among each other or with fixed income or
equity indices will prove correct.

  - 2 -










  
The Adviser employs a multi-manager approach and invests in a wide variety of Investment Funds managed by Investment Managers specializing in different alternative
investment strategies. The Adviser attempts to select individual Investment Managers that offer a variety of different skills in an effort to further balance the Funds investment portfolio and to maximize opportunities for capital growth. The
Adviser considers a number of factors in selecting Investment Managers, including the Investment Managers basic investment strategy and policies; reputation; prior performance; use of fundamental analysis and other analytical methods; use of
leverage and other techniques; and trading acumen. On an ongoing basis, the Adviser conducts similar, periodic reviews with respect to Investment Funds in which the Fund has invested.





  
The Adviser typically endeavors to limit investments in any one Investment Fund to no more than 10% of the Funds gross assets (measured at the time of purchase), and to
limit investments in any one Investment Manager to no more than 15% of the Funds gross assets (measured at the time of purchase). The Adviser limits Fund investments in any one Investment Fund to less than 5% of an Investment Funds
outstanding voting securities. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  Investments in Non-Voting Stock; Inability to Vote.





  
While the Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act, the Fund has elected, and intends to qualify, to be treated as a
regulated investment company (a RIC) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). To qualify as a RIC under the Code, the Fund must, among other things, (i) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of
its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing
in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (as defined in the Code); and (ii) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year,
(A) at least 50% of the market value of the Funds assets is represented by cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with such other securities of any one issuer
limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Funds total assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (B) not more than 25% of the market value of the
Funds total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities and the securities of other regulated investment companies) of (1) any one issuer, (2) any two or more issuers that the Fund controls and that
are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or (3) any one or more qualified publicly traded partnerships.

  - 3 -










  
The Investment Funds in which the Fund invests are not subject to the Funds investment restrictions and are generally subject to few investment limitations. In response to
adverse market, economic or political conditions, the Fund may invest temporarily in high quality fixed income securities, money market instruments and money market funds or may hold cash or cash equivalents for temporary defensive purposes. In
addition, the Fund may also make these types of investments pending the investment of assets in Investment Funds or to maintain the liquidity necessary to effect repurchases of Shares and pay Fund expenses.




LEVERAGE
  
The Fund may borrow money in connection with its investment activities  i.e., the Fund may utilize leverage. Specifically, the Fund may borrow money through a credit
facility or other arrangements, to manage timing issues in connection with the acquisition of its investments (i.e., to provide the Fund with temporary liquidity to acquire investments in Investment Funds in advance of the Funds receipt of
redemption proceeds from one or more Investment Funds or the receipt of proceeds from the sale of additional Shares). The Fund also may borrow money to fund repurchase payments to Shareholders pending the receipt of redemption proceeds from one or
more Investment Funds.





  
The 1940 Act requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of 300% of its indebtedness, including amounts borrowed, measured at the time the
investment company incurs the indebtedness (the Asset Coverage Requirement). This requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness may not exceed one-third of the value of its total assets (including
the indebtedness). The Funds borrowings will at all times be subject to the Asset Coverage Requirement. In addition to borrowing money, the Fund may also incur leveraged exposure via the use of derivatives.





  
Investment Funds may also utilize leverage in their investment activities. Borrowings by Investment Funds are not subject to the Asset Coverage Requirement. Accordingly, the
Funds portfolio may be exposed to the risk of highly leveraged investment programs of certain Investment Funds and the volatility of the value of Shares may be great, especially during times of a credit crunch and/or general market
turmoil, such as that experienced recently (particularly during late 2008/2009). In general, the use of leverage by Investment Funds or the Fund may increase the volatility of the Investment Funds or the Fund. See Types of Investments and
Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Leverage Utilized by the Fund and See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Leverage Utilized by Investment Funds.

  - 4 -









DISTRIBUTIONS
  
Distributions will be paid at least annually on the Shares in amounts representing substantially all of the net investment income and net capital gains, if any, earned each year.
The Fund is not a suitable investment for any investor who requires regular dividend income.





  
Each Shareholder (as hereinafter defined) whose Shares are registered in its own name will automatically be a participant under the DRIP (as defined herein) and have all income
dividends and/or capital gains distributions automatically reinvested in Shares unless such Shareholder specifically elects to receive all income dividends and/or capital gain distributions in cash.




POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF INVESTING IN THE FUND
  
An investment in the Fund enables investors to invest with Investment Managers whose services generally are not available to the investing public or who otherwise may place
stringent restrictions on the number and type of persons whose money they will manage. An investment in the Fund also enables investors to invest with a number of Investment Managers without incurring the high minimum investment requirements that
Investment Managers typically would impose on investors. Investment Funds in which the Fund may invest also may close from time to time. If the Fund has previously invested in an Investment Fund that has closed, an investor would nevertheless be
able to invest indirectly in such Investment Fund by investing in the Fund.





  
In addition to benefiting from the Investment Managers individual investment strategies, the Fund as a whole should achieve the benefits of exposure to a number of
different alternative investment strategies and Investment Managers. By investing through multiple Investment Managers, the Fund may reduce the volatility inherent in a direct investment with a single Investment Manager.




THE OFFERING
  
The Fund is offering on a continuous basis through EnTrust Securities LLC (the Distributor) $[1,000,000,000] of shares of beneficial interest (Shares).
Shares will be offered during an initial public offering period at an initial rate of $1,000 per Share, and in a continuous offering thereafter at the Funds current net asset value per Share. See Purchases of Shares. The initial
closing date for subscriptions for Shares is currently anticipated to be on or about [            ], 2013 (the Initial Closing Date). Subsequent to the Initial Closing Date,
Shares may be purchased as of the first business day of each month at the Funds then current net asset value per Share from the Distributor or through a registered investment adviser (a RIA) that has entered into an arrangement
with the Distributor for such RIA to offer Shares in conjunction with a wrap fee, asset allocation or other managed asset program sponsored by such RIA. See Calculation of Net Asset Value and Plan of
Distribution.

  - 5 -










  
Investors purchasing Shares in the Fund (Shareholders) will not be charged a sales load.




BOARD OF TRUSTEES
  
The Fund has a Board of Trustees (each member a Trustee and, collectively, the Board of Trustees) that has overall responsibility for monitoring and
overseeing the Funds investment program and its management and operations. A majority of the Trustees are not interested persons (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the Fund or the Adviser. See Management of the
Fund.




THE ADVISER
  
EnTrust Partners LLC serves as the Funds investment adviser (the Adviser). The Adviser, a limited liability company formed under the laws of the State of
Delaware, is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the Advisers Act). An affiliate of the Adviser also performs certain administrative and investor services for the Fund pursuant to a
services agreement with the Fund (Fund Services Agreement).





  
[The day-to-day portfolio management, short-term cash management and operations of the Fund are the responsibility of the Investment Committee of the Adviser (Investment
Committee) whose members consist of Gregg S. Hymowitz, Christopher T. Keenan, CFA and Jeffrey Chan.] The Investment Committee is subject to oversight by the Board of Trustees.




MANAGEMENT FEE
  
In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by the Adviser to the Fund, the Fund pays the Adviser a monthly fee of 0.125% (1.50% on an annualized basis) of the
Funds month end net asset value (the Management Fee). The Management Fee is an expense paid out of the Funds net assets and is computed based on the value of the net assets of the Fund as of the close of business on the last
business day of each month (including any assets in respect of Shares that will be repurchased as of the end of the month). The Management Fee is in addition to the asset-based fees and incentive fees/allocations paid by the Investment Funds and
indirectly paid by investors in the Fund. See Management Fee.




[ADVISER PAYMENTS
  
[The Adviser may pay additional compensation, out of its own funds and not as an additional charge to the Fund, to selected brokers, dealers or other financial intermediaries
(Intermediaries) for the purpose of introducing a RIA to the Fund and/or promoting the recommendation of Shares of the Fund by a RIA. Such payments are made quarterly by the Adviser. The payments made by the Adviser may be based on the
net asset value of the Fund as determined by the Adviser. The amount of these payments is determined from time to time by the

  - 6 -










  
Adviser and may be substantial. Such additional compensation to the Intermediary will not exceed [    ]% of the average net asset value of the outstanding
Shares beneficially owned over the applicable quarter ([    ]% on an annualized basis) by clients of the RIA by virtue of the efforts of such Intermediary.]




FEES AND EXPENSES
  
The Fund bears all expenses incurred in the business of the Fund, including any charges and fees to which the Fund is subject as an investor in the Investment Funds. The Fund
expects to incur organizational expenses and initial offering costs of approximately $[        ]. The Funds offering costs are being capitalized and amortized over the 12 month period beginning on the
Initial Closing Date. The Fund will also bear certain ongoing costs associated with the Funds continuous offering of Shares (mostly printing expenses). The Investment Funds will bear all expenses incurred in the business of the Investment
Funds. See Summary of Fees and Expenses and Fund Expenses.




ADMINISTRATOR
  
[                    ]
([                    ]), as Fund administrator, performs certain administration, accounting and investor services for the Fund. In
consideration for these services, the Fund pays [                ] a fee for services calculated based upon the average net assets of the Fund and reimburses certain of
[                    ]s expenses. See Management of the Fund - Administrator.




CUSTODIAN
  
[                    ] (Custodian) will serve as the custodian of
the Fund. See Management of the Fund - Custodian.




CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
  
The investment activities of the Adviser, the Investment Managers and their affiliates for their own accounts and other accounts they manage may give rise to conflicts of
interest that may disadvantage the Fund. See Conflicts of Interest.




PURCHASE OF SHARES
  
The minimum initial investment in the Fund by an investor is $25,000. Additional investments in the Fund must be made in a minimum amount of $10,000. The minimum initial and
additional investments may be reduced by the Fund with respect to certain individual investors or classes of investors (specifically, with respect to employees, officers or Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser or their affiliates). Additionally, the
Fund may waive or reduce such minimum initial and additional investment amounts (as well as the application and funding deadlines described above) with respect to any investor funding its purchase of Shares with redemption proceeds from another fund
sponsored, managed, or advised by the Adviser. The Fund will notify Shareholders of any changes in the investors that are eligible for such reductions.

  - 7 -










  
Subsequent to the Initial Closing Date, the Fund will accept initial and additional purchases of Shares as of the first business day of each calendar month. The investor must
submit a completed application form eight business days before the applicable purchase date. All purchases are subject to the receipt of immediately available funds four business days prior to the applicable purchase date in the full amount of the
purchase (to enable the Fund to invest the proceeds in Investment Funds as of the applicable purchase date). An investor who misses one or both of these deadlines will have the effectiveness of its investment in the Fund delayed until the following
month.





  
Despite having to meet the earlier application and funding deadlines described above, the Fund does not issue the Shares purchased (and an investor does not become a Shareholder
with respect to such Shares) until the applicable purchase date, i.e., the first business day of the relevant calendar month. Consequently, purchase proceeds do not represent capital of the Fund, and do not become assets of the Fund, until
such date.





  
Any amounts received in advance of the initial or subsequent purchases of Shares are placed in a non-interest-bearing account with the Transfer Agent (as defined herein) prior to
their investment in the Fund, in accordance with Rule 15c2-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Fund reserves the right to reject any purchase of Shares in certain limited circumstances (including, without limitation, when it
has reason to believe that a purchase of Shares would be unlawful). Unless otherwise required by applicable law, any amount received in advance of a purchase ultimately rejected by the Fund will be returned to the prospective investor. See
Other Risks  Possible Exclusion of a Shareholder Based on Certain Detrimental Effects.




ELIGIBLE INVESTORS
  
Each investor will be required to certify that the Shares are being acquired directly or indirectly for the account of both (i) an accredited investor as defined
in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the 1933 Act and (ii) a qualified client as defined in Rule 205-3(d)(1) under the Advisers Act. Investors who are both accredited investors and qualified
clients are referred to in this Prospectus as Eligible Investors. Existing Shareholders seeking to purchase additional Shares will be required to qualify as Eligible Investors at the time of the additional purchase. Any
RIA who offers Shares may impose additional eligibility requirements for investors who purchase Shares through such RIA.




INVESTOR SUITABILITY
  
An investment in the Fund involves a considerable amount of risk. A Shareholder may lose money. Before making an investment decision, a prospective investor should
(i) consider the suitability of this investment with respect to the investors investment objectives and personal situation and (ii) consider factors such as the investors personal net worth, income, age, risk tolerance and
liquidity needs. The Fund is an illiquid investment. Investors have no right to require the Fund to redeem their Shares in the Fund. See Other Risks  Closed-End Fund; Liquidity Risks.

  - 8 -









VALUATION
  
Certain securities and other financial instruments in which the Investment Funds invest may not have a readily ascertainable market price and will be valued pursuant to policies
and procedures adopted by the Investment Managers. The Fund will only invest in Investment Funds whose portfolios are valued by independent third parties. In addition, the procedures approved by the Funds Board of Trustees provide that the
Adviser will review the valuations provided by the Investment Managers to the Investment Funds. However, neither the Adviser nor the Board of Trustees will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by the Investment
Managers (which are unaudited). Accordingly, such valuations generally will be relied upon by the Fund. In addition, the net asset values or other valuation information received by the Adviser from the Investment Funds will typically be estimates
only, subject to revision through the end of each Investment Funds annual audit. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  Valuation.




UNLISTED CLOSED-END STRUCTURE; LIMITED LIQUIDITY AND TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS
  
The Fund has been organized as a closed-end management investment company. Closed-end funds differ from open-end management investment companies (commonly known as mutual funds)
in that investors in a closed-end fund do not have the right to redeem their shares on a daily basis. To meet daily redemption requests, mutual funds are subject to more stringent regulatory limitations than closed-end funds.





  
A Shareholder will not be able to redeem his, her or its Shares on a daily basis because the Fund is a closed-end fund. In addition, with very limited exceptions, the Funds
Shares are not transferable and liquidity will be provided only through limited repurchase offers described below. An investment in the Fund is suitable only for investors who can bear the risks associated with the limited liquidity of the Shares
and should be viewed as a long-term investment. See Other Risks  Closed-End Fund; Liquidity Risks.




REPURCHASES OF SHARES BY THE FUND
  
No Shareholder has the right to require the Fund to redeem his, her or its Shares. The Fund may from time to time offer to repurchase Shares pursuant to written tenders by
Shareholders, and each such repurchase offer will generally be limited to up to 15% of the net assets of the Fund. Repurchases will be made at such times, in such amounts and on such terms as may be determined by the Board of Trustees, in its sole
discretion. In determining whether the Fund should offer to repurchase Shares, the Board of Trustees will consider the recommendations of the Adviser as to the timing of such an offer, as well as a variety of

  - 9 -










  
operational, business and economic factors. The Adviser expects that, generally, it will recommend to the Board of Trustees that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares from
Shareholders quarterly, with such repurchases to occur as of each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (or, if any such date is not a business day, on the immediately preceding business day). Each repurchase offer will
generally commence approximately 125 days prior to the applicable repurchase date. The first offer to repurchase Shares from Shareholders is expected to occur on or about [            ],
201[4].





  
If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by Shareholders who tender Shares, the Fund will repurchase a pro rata portion of the Shares tendered by each Shareholder, extend the
repurchase offer, or take any other action with respect to the repurchase offer permitted by applicable law. The Fund also has the right to repurchase all of a Shareholders Shares at any time if the aggregate value of such Shareholders
Shares is, at the time of such compulsory repurchase, less than the minimum initial investment applicable for the Fund. In addition, the Fund has the right to repurchase Shares of Shareholders if the Fund determines that the repurchase is in the
best interest of the Fund or upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the Funds Agreement and Declaration of Trust.





  
The Fund is subject to certain Investment Funds initial lock-up periods beginning at the time of the Funds initial investment in an Investment Fund, during which the
Fund may not withdraw its investment. In addition, certain Investment Funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions (such as those
experienced by many hedge funds in late 2008/2009). During such periods, the Fund may not be able to liquidate its holdings in such Investment Funds in order to meet repurchase requests. In addition, should the Fund seek to liquidate its investment
in an Investment Fund that maintains a side pocket, the Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay, which could be considerable. The Fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of
its interests in Investment Funds in a timely manner. See Repurchases and Transfers of Shares  No Right of Redemption and  Repurchases of Shares.





  
A 3.0% early repurchase fee will be assessed to any Shareholder that tenders his or her Shares to the Fund prior to the business day immediately preceding the one-year
anniversary of the Shareholders purchase of the respective Shares (Repurchase Fee). The Repurchase Fee would apply separately to each purchase of Shares made by a Shareholder. For example, if a Shareholder purchases
Shares in January of year 1 and then purchases additional interests in December of year 1, such

  - 10 -










  
Shareholder would be subject to an early repurchase fee on the additional Shares purchased in December of year 1 until December of year 2. The purpose of the Repurchase Fee
is to reimburse the Fund for the costs incurred in liquidating investments in the Funds portfolio in order to honor the Shareholders repurchase request, and to discourage short-term investments, which are generally disruptive to the
Funds investment program.




SUMMARY OF TAXATION
  
 The Fund expects to qualify, and to continue to qualify, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. For each taxable year that the Fund
so qualifies, the Fund is not subject to federal income tax on that part of its taxable income that it distributes to Shareholders. Taxable income consists generally of net investment income and any capital gains.
  The Fund will distribute substantially all of its net investment income and gains to
Shareholders. These distributions generally will be taxable as ordinary income to the Shareholder. Shareholders not subject to tax on their income will not be required to pay tax on amounts distributed to them. The Fund will inform Shareholders of
the amount and character of its distributions to Shareholders. See Distribution Policy.   Subchapter M imposes strict requirements for the diversification of a funds investments, the nature of a funds income and a funds distribution and timely reporting of income and gains.
In order to satisfy these requirements, the Fund will generally invest its assets in Investment Funds organized outside the United States that are treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes and are expected to be classified as passive foreign
investment companies (PFICs). See Tax Considerations.




ERISA PLANS AND OTHER TAX-EXEMPT ENTITIES
  
Investors subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), and other tax-exempt entities, including employee benefit plans,
individual retirement accounts (each, an IRA), and 401(k) and Keogh Plans may purchase Shares. Because the Fund will be registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the underlying assets of the Fund will not be considered to
be plan assets of the ERISA Plans investing in the Fund for purposes of ERISAs fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules. Thus, the Adviser will not be a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA with respect to the
assets of any ERISA Plan that becomes a Shareholder, solely as a result of the ERISA Plans investment in the Fund. See ERISA Considerations.

  - 11 -











REPORTS TO SHAREHOLDERS
  
The Fund furnishes to Shareholders, as soon as practicable after the end of each taxable year, information on Form 1099 as is required by law to assist the
Shareholders in preparing their tax returns. The Fund prepares, and transmits to Shareholders, an unaudited semi-annual and an audited annual report within 60 days after the close of the period for which the report is being made, or as otherwise
required by the 1940 Act. Shareholders also are sent reports on at least a monthly basis regarding the Funds operations during each month. In addition, the Fund expects to communicate regularly with Shareholders through periodic investor
conference calls and other events. The Funds fiscal year end is [                    ].




TERM
  
The Funds term is perpetual unless the Fund is otherwise terminated under the terms of the Funds organizational documents.




RISK FACTORS
  
An investment in the Fund involves a high degree of risk. These risks include the following:






  

  
investing in the Fund can result in loss of capital, up to the entire amount of a Shareholders investment






  

  
investing in a fund that has a limited operating history and whose Investment Managers with which the Fund invests, in some cases, may be newly organized with limited operating
histories upon which to evaluate their performance






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests may invest their assets in securities for which trading activity may be dramatically impaired or cease at
any time (whether due to general market turmoil, problems experienced by a single issuer or market sector or other factors)






  

  
investing in a fund whose performance depends upon the performance of the Investment Managers and selected strategies, the adherence by such Investment Managers to their selected
strategies, the instruments used by such Investment Managers and the Advisers ability to select Investment Managers and strategies and effectively allocate Fund assets among them






  

  
investing in a fund that may borrow money (i.e., incur leverage) to make investments in Investment Funds and/or incur leveraged exposure via the use of derivatives, which may
increase the volatility of the Fund






  

  
investing in a fund whose underlying Investment Funds may also incur leverage (whether via borrowing money or utilizing derivatives) for investment or other purposes, which may
increase the volatility of the Investment Funds






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers may sell securities held by Investment Funds short, which involves the theoretical risk of unlimited loss because of increases
in the market price of the security sold short
  - 12 -












  

  
investing in a fund where the underlying Investment Funds investment activities may be adversely affected by regulatory changes and/or restrictions (such as those relating
to short selling) that may be imposed at any time






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers may invest the Investment Funds assets in securities of non-U.S. issuers, including those located in emerging markets, and
where the Fund may invest in Investment Funds that may be denominated in non-U.S. currencies, thus exposing the Fund to various risks that may not be applicable to U.S. securities






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers may change their investment strategies (i.e., may experience style drift) at any time






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers may invest the Investment Funds assets in restricted and illiquid securities






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers may invest the Investment Funds assets in equity securities without limitation as to market capitalization, such as those
issued by smaller capitalization companies, including micro cap companies, the prices of which may be subject to erratic market movements






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers may charge investors in the Investment Funds, such as the Fund, asset-based fees and incentive fees/allocations of generally 20%
of an Investment Funds net profits, which incentive fees/allocations may create incentives for Investment Managers to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than in the absence of these fees






  

  
investing in a fund where an Investment Manager may focus on a particular industry or industries, which may subject the Investment Fund, and thus the Fund, to greater risk and
volatility than if investments had been made in issuers in a broader range of industries






  

  
investing in a fund where an Investment Funds assets may be invested in a limited number of securities, which may subject the Investment Fund, and thus Fund, to greater
risk and volatility than if investments had been made in a larger number of securities
  - 13 -












  

  
investing in illiquid securities of an unlisted closed-end fund, which are not listed on any securities exchange or traded in any other market and are subject to substantial
restrictions on transfer






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers may use derivatives for hedging and non-hedging purposes of the Investment Funds






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Funds returns may exhibit greater correlations among each other and/or with fixed income or equity indices than anticipated by the
Adviser, especially during times of general market turmoil such as that experienced during late 2008/2009






  

  
investing in a fund whose Adviser and Investment Managers may have conflicts of interest






  

  
investing in a non-diversified fund that may allocate a higher percentage of its assets to the securities of any one issuer than if it were a diversified fund






  

  
investing in a fund that intends to qualify as a RIC under the Code and may be subject to tax liabilities if it fails to so qualify






  

  
investing in a fund that will be subject to certain risks associated with its strategy of investing in PFICs






  

  
investing in a fund that is subject to, and invests in Investment Funds that are subject to, risks associated with legal and regulatory changes applicable to financial
institutions generally or hedge funds such as the Investment Funds in particular





  
Because the Fund invests in Investment Funds, investors are subject to additional risks, including:






  

  
investing in a fund whose underlying Investment Funds will not be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act, and, therefore, the Fund, as an investor in such
Investment Funds, and thus the Shareholders, as indirect investors in such Investment Funds, will not be able to avail themselves of 1940 Act protections






  

  
investing in a fund whose investors may not have complete information about the Investment Funds or Investment Managers, and who will have no recourse against Investment Funds or
their Investment Managers
  - 14 -












  

  
investing in a fund whose investments in certain underlying Investment Funds may be subject to initial lock-up periods during which the Fund may not withdraw its
investment






  

  
investing in a fund where certain underlying Investment Funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time, possibly
requiring the Fund to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in Investment Funds in a timely manner






  

  
investing in a fund that may not be able to invest in certain Investment Funds that are oversubscribed or closed or that may only be able to allocate a limited amount of assets
to an Investment Fund that has been identified as an attractive opportunity






  

  
investing in a fund whose investors will bear the operating expenses of the Fund, as well as two layers of asset-based fees and expensesone at the Fund level and one at the
Investment Fund leveland incentive fees/allocations at the Investment Fund level






  

  
investing in a fund that may at times have a negative return, but that may at the same time (as an investor in an underlying Investment Fund) be compensating the Investment
Manager of the relevant Investment Fund for the positive performance of the relevant Investment Fund, in the form of asset-based fees, incentive fees/allocations and other expenses






  

  
investing in a fund where the Investment Managers make investment decisions independent of the Adviser and each other, which may result in the pursuit of opposing investment
strategies or result in performance that correlates more closely with broader market performance






  

  
investing in a fund many of whose assets will be priced in the absence of a readily available market and may be priced based on determinations of fair value, which may prove to
be inaccurate;






  

  
investing in a fund that invests in Investment Funds that may hold a portion of their assets in side pockets (i.e., a sub-account established by an Investment Fund in
which certain assets (which generally are illiquid and/or hard to value) are held and segregated from the other assets of the Investment Fund until some type of realization event occurs), which may further restrict the liquidity of the Funds
investments in such Investment Funds, and thus the Shareholders investments in the Fund
  - 15 -












  

  
investing in a fund that may not be able to vote to the fullest extent on matters that require the approval of the investors of an underlying Investment Fund, including a matter
that could adversely affect the Funds investment in such an Investment Fund






  

  
investing in a fund that, upon its redemption of all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Fund, may receive an in-kind distribution of securities that are illiquid or
difficult to value






  

  
investing in a fund that invests in Investment Funds located outside of the U.S. and thus may be subject to withholding taxes in such jurisdictions, which may reduce the
Funds, and thus the Shareholders, return





  
Accordingly, the Fund should be considered a speculative investment and entails substantial risks, and a prospective investor should invest in the Fund only if it can
sustain a complete loss of its investment. See Types of Investments and Related Risks.

**
The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses include the operating expenses and performance-based incentive fees/allocations of the Investment Funds in which the Fund plans to
invest. The operating expenses consist of management fees, administration fees, professional fees (i.e., audit and legal fees), and other operating expenses. In addition to operating expenses, the Investment Funds also incur trading expenses
(primarily interest and dividend expenses and brokerage commissions), which are the byproduct of leveraging or hedging activities employed by the Investment Funds managers in order to enhance investor returns. The impact of trading expenses to
the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses Ratio would be [    ]%. The information used to determine the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses is generally based on the most recent shareholder reports received from the respective Investment
Funds or, when not available, from the most recent communication from the Investment Funds. The agreements related to investments in Investment Funds provide for compensation to the Investment Funds managers/general partners in the form of
management fees generally ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% annually of net assets and performance incentive fees/allocations are generally 20% of net profits earned. Fees and expenses of Investment Funds are based on historic fees and expenses. Some
Investment Funds employ a pass-through expense arrangement with no stated management fee. Future Investment Funds fees and expenses may be substantially higher or lower because certain fees are based on the performance of the Investment Funds,
which may fluctuate over time. See below for the breakdown of the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses:

[The Adviser has agreed to waive and/or reimburse the Funds expenses (other than Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses and extraordinary expenses and the following
investment related expenses: foreign country tax expense and interest expense on amounts borrowed by the Fund) to the extent necessary in order to cap the Funds total annual operating expenses at [    ]% [until the
termination of the Funds investment advisory agreement, the initial term of which is currently scheduled to terminate on
[                    ]]. The Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are not subject to this expense cap. Extraordinary Expenses are expenses
incurred by the Fund outside of the ordinary course of its business, including, without limitation, costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or similar proceedings, indemnification
expenses and expenses in connection with holding and/or soliciting proxies for a meeting of Shareholders.]  The
purpose of the table above is to assist investors in understanding the various fees and expenses Shareholders will bear directly or indirectly. For a more complete description of the various fees and expenses of the Fund, see Fund
Expenses, Management Fee and Purchases of Shares.  THE FUND
 The Fund, which is registered under the 1940 Act as a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company, was organized as a
Delaware statutory trust on April 12, 2013. The Fund intends to commence operations on or about the Initial Closing Date, as defined above. The Funds principal office 
  - 18 -




is located at 375 Park Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10152, and its telephone number is (212) 888-1040. Investment advisory services are provided to the Fund by the Adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement.
Responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the Funds investment program and its management and operation is vested in the individuals who serve on the Board of Trustees. See Management of the Fund  Board of Trustees.
 USE OF PROCEEDS  The proceeds from the sale of Shares, net of the Funds fees and expenses, are invested by the Fund to pursue its investment program and objectives as soon as practicable (but not in excess of six
months), consistent with market conditions and the availability of suitable investments, after receipt of such proceeds by the Fund. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  Investment
Managers May Have Limited Capacity to Manage Additional Fund Investments for a discussion of certain limitations applicable to the Funds ability to make investments in Investment Funds. See also Other Risks  Availability of
Investment Opportunities for a discussion of the timing of Investment Funds subscription activities, market conditions and other considerations relevant to the timing of the Funds investments generally. 
The Fund will pay the Adviser the full amount of the Management Fee during any period prior to which any of the Funds assets
(including any proceeds received by the Fund from the offering of Shares) are invested in Investment Funds.  
STRUCTURE  The Fund is a specialized investment vehicle that combines many of the features of an investment fund not
registered under the 1940 Act, often referred to as a private investment fund, with those of a registered closed-end investment company. Private investment funds, such as hedge funds, are commingled asset pools that may engage in a wide
variety of investment strategies including, among others, leverage, short selling and derivative transactions. Investment Funds typically offer their securities privately without registration under the 1933 Act in large minimum denominations (often
at least $1 million) to a limited number of high net worth individual and institutional investors. Investment Funds are excluded from the definition of investment company, and hence are not registered as investment companies, under the
1940 Act. The managers or investment advisers of these funds are usually compensated through both asset-based fees and incentive-based fees/allocations. Registered closed-end investment companies are typically organized as corporations, business
trusts, limited partnerships or limited liability companies that generally are managed more conservatively than most private investment funds due to certain requirements imposed by the 1940 Act and, with respect to those registered closed-end
investment companies that qualify as RICs under the Code, Subchapter M of the Code. These registered companies often impose relatively modest minimum investment requirements (such as $2,000 or less) and publicly offer their shares to a broad range
of investors, in contrast to the higher minimum investment amounts and limited range of investors which, as set forth above, characterize the offerings of private investment funds securities. The advisers to registered closed-end investment
companies are typically compensated through asset-based fees.  The Fund is similar to a private investment fund in that it is
actively managed and Shares are sold in relatively large minimum denominations to high net worth individual and institutional investors. In addition, the Investment Managers are typically entitled to receive incentive-based compensation. Unlike many
private investment funds, however, the Fund, as a registered closed-end investment company, can offer Shares without limiting the number of Eligible Investors that can participate in its investment program. The structure of the Fund was designed to
permit sophisticated investors that have a higher tolerance for investment risk to participate in an alternative investment program without making the more substantial minimum capital commitment that is required by many private investment funds and
without subjecting the Fund to the limitations on the number of Eligible Investors faced by many of those funds.

INVESTMENT PROGRAM 
Investment Objective 
The Fund seeks long-term capital growth by investing substantially all its assets in investment funds (Investment Funds)
managed by a range of unaffiliated third-party investment managers (Investment Managers) specializing in alternative investment strategies. The Investment Managers employ a variety of investment strategies, including, but not limited to,
hedging, distressed securities, event-driven and relative/value arbitrage and special situations.  Alternative investment
strategies allow Investment Managers the flexibility to use leveraged or short-sale positions to take advantage of perceived inefficiencies across the global capital markets. These strategies are in contrast to the investment programs of
traditional registered investment companies, such as mutual funds. Traditional investment companies are generally characterized by long-only investments and limits on the use of leverage. Because Investment Funds pursuing
alternative investment strategies (whether hedged or unhedged) are often described as hedge funds, the Funds investment program can be broadly referred to as a fund of hedge funds. 
In selecting Investment Funds, the Adviser does not follow a rigid asset allocation policy, but instead invests in a wide variety of
Investment Funds managed by Investment Managers specializing in different alternative investment strategies. The Fund is designed not only to utilize expert Investment Managers but also to deploy and redeploy investment capital within a range of
investment strategies which the Adviser regards as likely to provide favorable profit opportunities in changing economic environments. 
Investment Philosophy 
The Adviser applies a disciplined screening process in selecting Investment Funds, which will include a review of a number of different
factors which may incorporate among others, one or more of the following criteria:  Definable Investment Strategy and
Process - Each Investment Manager must have a clearly defined investment strategy, process and methodology. The Adviser verifies that the Investment Manager has in fact maintained discipline to its strategy in varying market conditions.
 Historical Performance - The Fund typically invests with Investment Managers who have historical risk adjusted
performance records of significant duration. Such performance records should demonstrate an ability to achieve superior returns during both favorable and unfavorable market cycles. 
Disciplined Risk Management - Investment Managers are also evaluated on their ability to manage risk to an acceptably low level.
The Adviser reviews overall market risk exposure, hedging and other risk management techniques utilized by prospective Investment Managers to limit market exposure and downside risk. 
Commonality of Financial Interests - The Fund typically selects Investment Managers who have meaningful financial commitments
jointly with their clients, demonstrated by having significant amounts of their personal capital invested in their own Investment Funds. 
  - 20 -



The Fund monitors Investment Managers and their Investment Funds on a regular basis. The
Adviser generally contacts Investment Managers on at least a monthly basis in order to determine their performance and meets with the Investment Managers personally from time to time as appropriate. Performance and risk is monitored and reviewed on
an ongoing basis, with each Investment Manager and Investment Fund being compared to similar funds and the overall market. The Adviser also utilizes its investment acumen and extensive network of contacts in the industry to assist in evaluating
certain events or trends, whether within a market sector or strategy or as to a particular Investment Fund or Investment Manager.  Traditional registered investment companies, such as mutual funds, generally are subject to significant regulatory restrictions in designing their own investment strategies relating to the use of leverage
and the ability to sell securities short. As a registered investment company, the Fund will be subject to such restrictions. By contrast, private, unregistered investment funds, such as the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests, are not subject
to many of these limitations. The Adviser believes that the Funds strategy of investing substantially all of its assets in these types of Investment Funds creates opportunities to participate in alternative methods of investing that may earn
attractive risk-adjusted returns.  The Adviser intends to invest the assets of the Fund in Investment Funds which employ
alternative investment strategies. There can be no assurance that these strategies will be attractive at any particular time. The Adviser believes that a portfolio of Investment Funds pursuing alternative investment strategies may produce capital
growth more consistently and with less volatility than would most individual traditional or alternative investment strategies. 
Because alternative investment strategies may be risky, the Adviser believes it is prudent for the Fund to generally invest in these
strategies through Investment Funds organized as vehicles providing limited liability to their investors. This structure limits the effect that losses incurred by any one Investment Fund will have on the assets of the Fund by limiting the
Funds amount at risk to the amount invested in that Investment Fund. In certain circumstances, however, the Adviser believes that it may be appropriate to gain investment exposure to certain Investment Funds by entering into derivative
transactions, such as total return swaps, options and forwards. For example, to achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an Investment Manager in whose Investment Fund the Fund could not invest directly, perhaps because of its high
investment minimum or its unavailability for direct investment, the Fund may enter into one or more swap agreements under which the Fund may agree, on a net basis, to pay a return based on a floating interest rate, and to receive the total return of
the reference Investment Fund over a stated time period. See Types of Investments and Related Risks Special Investment Instruments and Techniques  Swap Agreements. The Fund may incur leveraged exposure through its investments
in derivatives, which may, in some circumstances, involve significant risks of loss and may increase the volatility of the Funds returns. These risks may increase dramatically during times where general access to credit is severely impaired
(i.e., a credit crunch) and/or during general market turmoil, such as that experienced during late 2008/2009. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Leverage Utilized by the Fund.
 Investment Strategies  The Adviser intends to invest the assets of the Fund in Investment Funds which employ diverse investment strategies and styles including, but not limited to, the following: 
Global Long/Short Equity  Long/Short Equity Investment Managers combine a portfolio of long equity positions with a
portfolio of short equity positions. Long equity positions are expected to appreciate in value and short equity positions are expected to decrease in value. An Investment Manager can look to add value on both the long and short positions, or can
simply use a short position to hedge 
  - 21 -




market exposure by shorting a security or index which has a high degree of correlation to the portfolios long positions. Investment Managers may be anywhere from net long to net short
depending on market conditions, and generally increase net exposure when markets are expected to rise and decrease net exposure when markets are expected to fall. Strategies can be value or growth oriented and may invest in equities across the
market capitalization spectrum and across multiple countries and regions. Investment Managers may take long positions in securities believed to be undervalued and may take short positions in securities believed to be overvalued. In the event that
the perceived mispricings underlying one or more Investment Managers trading positions were to fail to converge toward, or were to diverge further from, relationships expected by such Investment Managers, the Fund may incur significant losses.
 Credit & Special Situations  Credit strategies refer to any strategies that utilize credit related
securities such as various fixed income instruments and derivative instruments such as credit default swaps. Common credit strategies include distressed investing and credit arbitrage. Distressed Securities strategies invest in companies affected by
an adverse financial or operating situation such as bankruptcies, debt restructuring, over levered balance sheets, corporate reorganizations, poor operating results and the distressed sale of assets. An Investment Manager will invest in distressed
securities believed to be selling at a price below the value of such securities after a reorganization or liquidation of the company. At times, the distressed Investment Manager may take an active role in creditor committees during the bankruptcy or
reorganization process to work towards a favorable outcome for the securities being held. Depending on the Investment Managers style, investments may be made in bank debt, corporate debt, trade claims, common stock, preferred stock and/or
warrants. Returns from Distressed Securities strategies are usually dependent on the outcome of the bankruptcy or reorganization process. Credit Arbitrage strategies attempt to exploit pricing inefficiencies between similarly structured credit
sensitive securities of different issuers. For example, although the bonds of two different companies may have comparable duration, coupon rates and credit ratings, one bond may trade at a premium to the other. Generally, credit instruments used may
include loans, bonds and credit default swaps. A variety of hedging techniques are employed to reduce certain risks, including interest rate and credit risk. An Investment Manager would look to exploit the pricing discrepancy by buying the
undervalued security and shorting the overvalued security, expecting to make a profit as the prices of the two securities begin to converge. Investment Managers employing a Special Situations strategy generally utilize distressed-type analysis in
order to analyze companies that are not in bankruptcy but are undergoing other event driven transactions such as restructurings, turnarounds and spin-offs. In addition, the securities used in Special Situations strategies tend to be more liquid than
those used by pure Distressed Securities Investment Managers.  Event Driven, Multi-Strategy & Arbitrage 
Event Driven investing is also referred to as corporate life cycle investing and focuses on opportunities created by transactional events such as spin-offs, consolidations, mergers and acquisitions, liquidations, recapitalization, bankruptcies and
other significant corporate transactions. Event Driven strategies analyze these transactions in order to predict the outcome and commit capital in a way that benefits from that outcome. Event Driven strategies are broad in scope and employ a diverse
set of securities including common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stubs and derivatives. More focused event driven type strategies include Merger Arbitrage, Distressed Securities and Special Situations. The success of the strategy
primarily relies on the accurate assessment of the outcome and timing of the transactions and the proper deployment of capital. Multi-strategy Investment Managers may engage in a variety of these investment strategies. 
Inter-Market Arbitrage  Different markets may react differently to price changes in the same asset class. For example, the
price of the common stock of a company that produces a commodity may change in a manner significantly divergent from, but related to, the price changes of the commodity. These inter-market discrepancies create an opportunity for investors willing to
exploit the market volatility and arbitrage the differences in valuations. Arbitrage strategies may also involve the use of options, financial futures and other financial instruments or derivatives. 
  - 22 -



Convertible Securities Arbitrage  In convertible securities arbitrage,
offsetting positions are taken in convertible securities and the equity or debt security into which the convertible securities can be converted, in an attempt to profit from price differentials between the two. Convertible securities include bonds,
preferred stocks, options, warrants and other securities that may be converted, generally into common stock. Profit opportunities exist in such arbitrage strategies because the market periodically misprices certain convertible securities in relation
to the underlying stock. Evaluating convertible securities involves a complex analysis of factors such as prevailing interest rates, dividend pay-out levels, the remaining length of the conversion period and the credit standing of the issuer.
 Merger or Risk Arbitrage  Merger arbitrage involves acquiring securities of companies, which are
potentially subject to a merger, acquisition, exchange offer, tender offer or reorganization, with the expectation that profits will result from the spread between the price at which a position can be purchased  generally discounted primarily
to reflect the possibility that the transaction may not occur  and the amount that will be realized when the transaction is consummated.  Distressed Securities Arbitrage  Distressed securities arbitrage involves acquiring the securities or obligations of financially troubled companies at a discount, including those of companies
involved in bankruptcy proceedings, reorganizations or liquidation, for the purpose of realizing a spread or gain upon the conclusion, success or perceived success of the bankruptcy proceedings, reorganizations or liquidations. 
Capital Structure Arbitrage  Investment Managers employing capital structure arbitrage strategy invest both long and short
in the securities within a given companys capital structure. Investment Managers implementing this strategy often establish long positions in senior or secured debt instruments that trade at a discount to intrinsic value or close to fair value
and establish simultaneous short positions in subordinated debt or equity securities deemed to be overvalued relative to the senior debt.  Fixed Income Arbitrage  Investment Managers employing a fixed income arbitrage strategy trade government bonds, interest rate swaps, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements,
futures and related derivative securities to take advantage of mispricings that occur in various fixed income markets. A fixed income arbitrage strategy generally requires a substantial amount of leverage in order to produce attractive rates of
return.  Yield Curve Arbitrage  Investment Managers who employ a yield curve arbitrage strategy take offsetting
positions at various points of the yield curve, typically those of a Treasury bill, in response to perceived disequilibrium price relationships. This strategy also can involve looking for pricing imperfections between the futures and cash treasury
markets. Investment Managers who employ a yield curve arbitrage strategy often take positions in the futures and swaps markets as an alternative to directly buying or selling bonds. 
[Mortgage Arbitrage  A mortgage arbitrage investment strategy focuses on mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and
their related derivatives. Investment Managers typically take a long position on a MBS and short a government bond of similar maturity.]  Activist  Activist Investment Managers focus on long-term undervalued strategic investments and work to proactively create a catalyst to unlock value. Activist Investment Managers attempt to
unlock value in companies by developing relationships with management and seek to implement strategic changes that are expected to lead to higher share prices such as changes in corporate direction and management, corporate restructuring,
recapitalization and share buybacks, improvement of operations or a sale of the company. Profits are made when successful value enhancing activities lead to an increase in the price of the companys securities. 
  - 23 -



Traditional Buy and Hold  Purchasing equity and/or debt securities of U.S.
companies or worldwide for long term investment and capital appreciation based upon value, growth, technical and/or fundamental criteria.  Opportunistic Trading  Purchasing and selling securities (including but not limited to common and preferred stocks, debt securities and short-term money-market instruments) and options,
financial futures and other financial instruments or derivatives based largely on expectations of specific short-term price movements and overall market trends. This may also include increasing or decreasing the net exposure of a portfolio, a basket
of securities or a securities index, based on judgments concerning the level and direction of a market sector or the market as a whole.  Short-Selling  A short sale involves the sale of a security that the Investment Fund does not own (which security is borrowed) in anticipation of being able subsequently to purchase the
security at a lower price to cover the borrowed position. Short sales are made in securities that are identified as being overvalued, frequently in companies with questionable accounting or management or serious threats to their viability as a going
concern.  Emerging Markets  Emerging market investments include equity and debt instruments of companies located
in developing countries worldwide, whose securities are traded on established securities markets, either offshore, or within the United States.  Flexible Long/Short Hedged Strategies  Hedged strategies maintain both long and short equity or debt positions in order to moderate risk exposure and simultaneously benefit from trends in an
individual security, a market sector or the market as a whole. Hedged strategies may also involve the use of options, financial futures and other financial instruments or derivatives in implementing trading methodologies. 
Investment Selection 
The Adviser is responsible for the allocation of assets to various Investment Funds, subject to policies adopted by the Board of Trustees.
 The Adviser employs a multi-manager approach and invests in a wide variety of Investment Funds managed by
Investment Managers specializing in different alternative investment strategies. The Adviser attempts to select individual Investment Managers that offer a variety of different skills in an effort to further balance the Funds investment
portfolio and to maximize opportunities for capital growth. The Adviser considers a number of factors in selecting Investment Managers, including the Investment Managers basic investment strategy and policies; reputation; prior performance;
use of fundamental analysis and other analytical methods; use of leverage and other techniques; and trading acumen. On an ongoing basis, the Adviser conducts similar, periodic reviews with respect to Investment Funds in which the Fund has invested.
 To narrow the set of Investment Funds and investment strategies initially identified for consideration, the Adviser conducts
ongoing analysis of Investment Managers and investment strategies. The Adviser expects that only a few Investment Funds will be deemed sufficiently interesting to warrant further review after the initial analysis. Following this analysis, the
Adviser conducts extensive due diligence on the Investment Funds that it considers likely to generate superior, risk-adjusted returns consistent with the Advisers views at that time as to both the most attractive strategy types and the needs
of the Funds existing portfolio. The due diligence process typically includes meetings with the Investment Manager to seek to understand the Investment Managers investment strategy, investment philosophy and portfolio construction
procedures. The due diligence process seeks to identify the types of securities and other instruments held or techniques utilized and to confirm the presence of, and adherence to, an investment and risk control process. The due diligence process
also typically includes quantitative analysis of the investment strategy, including an analysis of past performance history and risk factors. 
  - 24 -



If the Advisers assessment of the abilities of the Investment Manager and the
attractiveness of the investment strategy employed by the Investment Manager are sufficiently positive, then further due diligence typically will be performed. The additional diligence generally involves an analysis of the operational and legal
structure of the Investment Fund and background investigations of the Investment Manager. The Investment Managers fee structure, the depth and quality of the Investment Managers organization, the legal terms and conditions of the
Investment Funds governing documents, the potential for developing and maintaining a long-term relationship with the Investment Manager and the likely alignment of interests between the Investment Fund, its Investment Manager and the Fund are
examples of factors that the Adviser typically investigates.  The Advisers personnel have extensive experience and
expertise with alternative investment strategies and Investment Managers and have evaluated numerous Investment Funds representing many categories of alternative investments and utilizing various investment strategies. For a more complete
description of the experience of the personnel of the Adviser who are principally responsible for the management of the Fund, see The Adviser.  Portfolio Construction  The Adviser allocates Fund assets among the
Investment Funds that, in its view, represent attractive investment opportunities, consistent with the objectives of the Fund. Allocation depends on the Advisers assessment of the likely risks and returns of various investment strategies that
the Investment Funds utilize and the likely correlation among the Investment Funds under consideration. The Adviser generally seeks to invest substantially all of the Funds assets in Investment Funds whose expected risk-adjusted returns are
deemed attractive. The Adviser periodically reallocates the Funds investments among Investment Funds in order to increase the Funds expected risk-adjusted return. There is no guarantee that the Fund will be able to avoid substantial
losses due to poor returns by an Investment Fund.  While the Fund is a non-diversified fund under the 1940 Act,
the Adviser believes it is important to maintain a broad-based portfolio in order to reduce the effect on the Fund of losses or poor returns by any one Investment Fund. There is no guarantee, however, that the Fund will be able to avoid substantial
losses due to poor returns by an Investment Fund. In addition, while the Fund is a non-diversified fund for purposes of the 1940 Act, the Fund has elected, and intends to qualify, to be treated as a RIC under the Code. To qualify as a
RIC under the Code, the Fund must, among other things, (i) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other disposition of
stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships (as defined in
the Code); and (ii) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year, (A) at least 50% of the market value of the Funds assets is represented by cash, cash items, U.S. government securities, securities
of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with such other securities of any one issuer limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Funds total assets and 10% of the
outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (B) not more than 25% of the market value of the Funds total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities and the securities of other regulated investment
companies) of (1) any one issuer, (2) any two or more issuers that the Fund controls and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or (3) any one or more qualified
publicly traded partnerships. In addition, the Adviser typically endeavors to limit investments in any one Investment Fund to no more than 10% of the Funds gross assets (measured at the time of purchase), and to limit

  - 25 -




investments in any one Investment Manager to no more than 15% of the Funds gross assets (measured at the time of purchase). The Adviser limits Fund investments in any one Investment Fund to
less than 5% of such Investment Funds outstanding voting securities. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  Investments in Non-Voting Stock; Inability to Vote. 
Investment Funds in which the Fund invests are not subject to the Funds investment restrictions and are generally not subject to
any investment limitations under the 1940 Act or the Code. Therefore, the Fund is not entitled to the protections of the 1940 Act with respect to the Investment Funds.  For example, the Investment Funds are not required to, and may not, hold custody of their assets in accordance with the requirements of the 1940 Act. As a result, bankruptcy or fraud at institutions, such
as brokerage firms, banks, or administrators, into whose custody those Investment Funds have placed their assets could impair the operational capabilities or the capital position of the Investment Funds and may, in turn, have an adverse impact on
the Fund. See Other RisksLegal and Regulatory Risks.  In response to adverse market, economic or political
conditions, the Fund may invest temporarily in high quality fixed income securities, money market instruments and money market funds or may hold cash or cash equivalents for temporary defensive purposes. In addition, the Fund may also make these
types of investments pending the investment of assets in Investment Funds or to maintain the liquidity necessary to effect repurchases of Shares and pay Fund expenses.  Leverage  The Fund may borrow money in connection with its investment
activities  i.e., the Fund may utilize leverage. Specifically, the Fund may borrow money through a credit facility or other arrangements in limited circumstances, to manage timing issues in connection with the acquisition of its investments
(i.e., to provide the Fund with temporary liquidity to acquire investments in Investment Funds in advance of the Funds receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more Investment Funds or the receipt of proceeds from the sale of additional
Shares). The Fund also may borrow money to fund repurchase payments to Shareholders pending the receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more Investment Funds.  The 1940 Act requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of 300% of its indebtedness, including amounts borrowed, measured at the time the investment company incurs
the indebtedness. This requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness may not exceed one third the value of its total assets (including the indebtedness). The Funds borrowings will at all times be subject
to the Asset Coverage Requirement. In addition to borrowing money, the Fund may also incur leveraged exposure via the use of derivatives.  Investment Funds may also utilize leverage in their investment activities. Borrowings by Investment Funds are not subject to the Asset Coverage Requirement. Accordingly, the Funds portfolio may be
exposed to the risk of highly leveraged investment programs of certain Investment Funds and the volatility of the value of Shares may be great, especially during times of a credit crunch and/or general market turmoil, such as that
experienced during late 2008/2009. In general, the use of leverage by Investment Funds or the Fund may increase the volatility of the Investment Funds or the Fund. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks
 Leverage Utilized by the Fund and Types of Investments and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Leverage Utilized by Investment Funds.

Risk Management and Monitoring of Investments 
As noted above, unregistered investment funds typically have greater flexibility than traditional registered investment companies as to
the types of securities the unregistered funds hold, the types of trading strategies used, and, in some cases, the extent to which leverage is used. The Investment Managers selected by the Fund have full discretion, without the Funds input, to
purchase and sell securities and other investments for their respective Investment Funds consistent with the relevant investment advisory agreements or governing documents of the Investment Funds. The Investment Funds are generally not limited in
the markets in which they invest, either by location or type, such as U.S. or non-U.S., large capitalization or small capitalization, or the investment discipline that they may employ, such as value or growth strategies or bottom-up or top-down
analysis. These Investment Funds may invest and trade in a wide range of securities and other financial instruments and will pursue a wide variety of investment strategies and techniques for both hedging and non-hedging purposes. In selecting
Investment Funds, the Adviser does not follow a rigid asset allocation policy, but instead invests in a wide variety of Investment Managers trading a range of strategies, including, but not limited to, hedging, distressed securities, arbitrage and
special situations. The Fund is designed not only to utilize expert Investment Managers but also to deploy and redeploy investment capital within a range of investment strategies which the Adviser regards as likely to provide favorable profit
opportunities in changing economic environments. See Investment ProgramInvestment Strategies. Although the Investment Funds will primarily invest and trade in equity and debt securities, they may also invest and trade in
equity-related instruments, currencies, financial futures, debt-related instruments and any other instruments that are deemed appropriate by the relevant Investment Manager and permitted under the relevant Investment Funds governing documents.
The Investment Funds may also sell securities short, purchase and sell option and futures contracts and engage in other derivative transactions, subject to certain limitations described elsewhere in this Prospectus. The use of one or more of these
techniques may be an integral part of the investment program of an Investment Fund and involves certain risks. The Investment Funds may use leverage, which also entails risk. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Investment Related
Risks  Leverage Utilized by Investment Funds.  The Adviser monitors the risks of individual Investment Funds and
of the portfolio in the aggregate. The primary goal of this process with respect to individual Investment Funds is to determine the degree to which the Investment Funds are performing as expected and to gain early insight into factors that might
call for an increase or decrease in the allocation of the Funds assets among those Investment Funds. With respect to aggregate portfolio monitoring, the Adviser endeavors to monitor, to the best of its ability, the Funds aggregate
exposures to various risks. The Adviser may also use futures, options, swaps or other instruments in order to balance the overall mix and/or manage risk in the Funds portfolio, subject to certain limitations contained in the 1940 Act. Such
derivatives may be based on various underlying instruments, including Investment Funds, individual securities, securities indices or interest rates. Such derivatives entail certain risks. The Adviser may also invest in underlying Investment Funds
that pursue tail risk hedging strategies. A tail risk hedging strategy is one that outperforms during periods of market stress, and is designed to provide a hedge against rare events that can significantly and negatively
affect the global markets. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Special Investment Instruments and Techniques.  The Adviser monitors the operation and performance of an Investment Fund as frequently as the Adviser believes is appropriate in light of the strategy followed by the Investment Manager and prevailing
market conditions. The Adviser solicits such information from the Investment Manager and other sources, such as prime brokers, that the Adviser deems necessary to properly assess the relative success or failure of an Investment Fund. Prime brokers
typically are large full-service brokerages that provide clients with research-related goods and services and support infrastructure to engage in various trading strategies. The Adviser conducts reviews with Investment Managers and the
Advisers network and analyzes a variety of data. Changes in leverage, personnel, market behavior, expenses, litigation, capital resources, economic conditions and other factors may be monitored, as appropriate and to the extent the information
is available to the Adviser. 
  - 27 -



Based on the Advisers assessment of factors such as (i) the degree to which the
Investment Manager is pursuing an investment strategy consistent with its stated policy; (ii) whether and to what degree the focus, incentives and investment strategy of the Investment Manager have changed; and (iii) whether the investment
strategy employed remains consistent with the objectives of the Fund, the Adviser may periodically adjust the Funds allocations among Investment Funds.  The Funds investment program entails substantial risks. There can be no assurances that the investment objectives of the Fund (including its risk monitoring goals) will be achieved, and results may
vary substantially over time. The Fund may consider it appropriate, subject to applicable laws and regulations, to utilize forward and futures contracts, options, swaps, other derivative instruments, short sales, margin, or leverage in the
Funds investment program. Such investment techniques can substantially increase the adverse impact to which the Funds investment portfolio may be subject. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Special Investment
Instruments and Techniques.  TYPES OF INVESTMENTS AND RELATED RISKS 
General  The value of
the Funds total net assets may be expected to fluctuate in response to fluctuations in the value of the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests. Discussed below are the investments generally made by Investment Funds, and the principal risks
that the Adviser and the Fund believe are associated with those investments. These risks will, in turn, have an effect on the Fund. The Fund invests substantially all its assets in Investment Funds. The Funds direct investments generally are
limited to derivative investments to gain exposure to certain Investment Funds, such as total return swaps, options or futures. Additionally, in response to adverse market, economic or political conditions, the Fund may invest temporarily in high
quality fixed income securities, money market instruments and unaffiliated money market funds or may hold cash or cash equivalents for temporary defensive purposes. In addition, the Fund may also make these types of investments pending the
investment of assets in Investment Funds or to maintain the liquidity necessary to effect repurchases of Shares and pay Fund expenses. When the Fund takes a defensive position or otherwise makes these types of investments, it may not achieve its
investment objective.  Investment Related Risks  Market Risks. The success of any investment activity is affected by general economic conditions, which may affect the level and volatility of interest rates and the extent and timing of investor
participation in the markets for both equities and interest-sensitive securities. Unexpected volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which the Fund (directly or indirectly) holds positions could impair the Funds ability to carry on its
business or cause it to incur losses. The profitability of a significant portion of the Funds investment program may depend to a great extent upon correctly assessing the future course of price movements of stocks and bonds. There can be no
assurance that the Investment Managers will be able to predict those price movements accurately,  Volatility of Financial
Markets; Risks of Certain Investment Strategies. Recently, the financial markets have evidenced an exceptional level of volatility. While the trading strategy of certain Investment Managers seeks to exploit such volatility, continued volatility
could disrupt the investment strategy of such Investment Manager, decrease the value of the Funds portfolio and adversely impact its profitability. If an Investment Managers evaluation of an investment opportunity should prove incorrect,
the Fund could experience losses as a result of a decline in the market value of securities in 
  - 28 -




which an Investment Fund holds a long position, or an increase in the value of securities in which an Investment Fund holds a short position. The risk management techniques that may be utilized
by the Investment Managers will not provide any assurance that the Fund will not be exposed to a risk of significant investment losses. The Investment Managers investment programs may utilize such investment techniques as margin transactions,
short sales, leverage, and options on securities, forwards and futures (subject to applicable regulatory requirements) which practices can, in certain circumstances, increase the adverse impact to which the Fund may be subject. The timing of such
adverse impacts cannot be predicted and may result in substantial volatility in the performance of the Fund.  Investment Funds
are subject to the risk that trading activity in securities in which the Investment Funds invest may be dramatically reduced or cease at any time, whether due to general market turmoil, problems experienced by a single issuer or a market sector or
other factors. If trading in particular securities or classes of securities is impaired, it may be difficult for an Investment Fund to properly value any of its assets represented by such securities. In particular, since late 2007, the trading
market for certain classes of securities (such as collateralized debt obligations backed by mortgages (especially subprime mortgages), asset-backed commercial paper issued by structured investment vehicles and auction rate preferred shares) has been
dramatically impaired, resulting in greater difficulties valuing such securities for which a robust market previously had existed. For additional valuation risks to which Investment Funds may be subject, see Types of Investments and Related
Risks  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  Valuation.  The deterioration of the credit markets since
late 2007 generally has caused an adverse impact in a broad range of markets, including U.S. and international credit and interbank money markets generally, thereby affecting a wide range of financial institutions and markets. In particular, events
in the financial sector during late 2008/2009 have resulted, and may continue to result, in an unusually high degree of volatility in the financial markets, both domestic and foreign. More recently, continued weakness in the U.S. housing market,
questions about the strength and sustainability of the U.S. economic recovery, concerns about the growing federal debt and the European sovereign debt and banking crisis, are factors which continue to concern the financial markets and create
volatility.  The Fund may invest in Investment Funds that have exposure to the securities of financial services companies.
Numerous financial services companies have experienced substantial declines in the valuations of their assets, taken action to raise capital (such as the issuance of debt or equity securities), or even ceased operations. These actions have caused
the securities of many financial services companies to experience a dramatic decline in value. Certain financial companies have avoided collapse due to intervention by the U.S. regulatory authorities, but such interventions have often not averted a
substantial decline in the value of such companies common stock. Issuers that have exposure to the real estate, mortgage and credit markets have been particularly affected by the foregoing events and the general market turmoil, and it is
uncertain whether or for how long these conditions will continue. Moreover, legal or regulatory changes applicable to financial services companies may adversely affect such companies ability to return to previous levels of profitability. See
Other Risks  Legal and Regulatory Risks.  In addition, the recent market turmoil and weakened position of
many financial services companies have forced many such companies to reduce or terminate the credit they have extended to hedge funds, which has in turn forced many hedge funds to deleverage by selling large portions of their investments
in a fairly short period of time. If an Investment Fund is required to deleverage in such fashion, its returns will likely be substantially reduced, and it may be forced to liquidate entirely if it cannot cover its outstanding indebtedness. See
Types of Investment and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Leverage Utilized by the Fund and Types of Investment and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Leverage Utilized by Investment
Funds. 
  - 29 -



General Risks of Securities Activities. All securities investing and trading
activities risk the loss of capital. Although the Adviser will attempt to moderate these risks, no assurance can be given that the Funds investment activities will be successful or that Shareholders will not suffer losses. To the extent that
the portfolio of an Investment Fund is concentrated in securities of a single issuer or issuers in a single industry, the risk of any investment decision made by the Investment Manager of such Investment Fund is increased. Following below are some
of the more significant specific risks that the Adviser and the Fund believe are associated with the Investment Funds styles of investing:  Equity Securities. Investment Funds may hold long and short positions in common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible securities of U.S. and non-U.S. issuers. Investment Funds also may invest in
depositary receipts or shares relating to non-U.S. securities. See Non-U.S. Securities. Equity securities fluctuate in value, often based on factors unrelated to the fundamental economic condition of the issuer of the securities,
including general economic and market conditions, and these fluctuations can be pronounced. Investment Funds may purchase securities in all available securities trading markets and may invest in equity securities without restriction as to market
capitalization, such as those issued by smaller capitalization companies, including micro cap companies. See Smaller Capitalization Issuers.  Growth Investing. Certain Investment Funds invest in growth stocks. Securities of growth companies may be more volatile since such companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in
their business, and they may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market. In addition, earnings disappointments often lead to sharply falling prices because investors buy growth stocks in anticipation of
superior earnings growth.  Value Investing. Certain Investment Funds invest in value stocks. An Investment
Manager to an Investment Fund may be wrong in its assessment of a companys value and the stocks the Investment Fund holds may not reach what the Investment Manager believes are their full values. A particular risk of an Investment Funds
value approach is that some holdings may not recover and provide the capital growth anticipated or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced. Further, because the prices of value-oriented securities tend to correlate more
closely with economic cycles than growth-oriented securities, they generally are more sensitive to changing economic conditions, such as changes in interest rates, corporate earnings, and industrial production. The market may not favor
value-oriented stocks and may not favor equities at all. During those periods, the Investment Funds relative performance may suffer.  Event Driven Investing. Event Driven strategies analyze various transactions in order to predict a likely outcome and commit capital in a way that benefits from that outcome. Event Driven
strategies are broad in scope and employ a diverse set of securities including common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stubs and derivatives. Appreciation in the value of such securities may be contingent upon the occurrence of
certain events, such as a successful reorganization or merger. If the expected event does not occur, the Investment Fund may incur a loss on the investments. There can be no assurance that any expected transaction will take place. Certain
transactions are dependent on one or more factors to become effective, such as market conditions which may lead to unexpected positive or negative changes in a company profile, shareholder approval, regulatory and various other third party
constraints, changes in earnings or business lines or shareholder activism as well as many other factors. No assurance can be given that the transactions entered into will result in a profitable investment for the Investment Funds or that the
Investment Funds will not incur substantial losses.  Bonds and Other Fixed Income Securities. Investment Funds may
invest in bonds and other fixed income securities, both U.S. and non-U.S., and may take short positions in these securities. Investment Funds will invest in these securities when they offer opportunities for capital appreciation (or capital
depreciation in the case of short positions) and may also invest in these securities for temporary defensive purposes and to maintain liquidity. Fixed income securities include, among other securities: bonds, notes

  - 30 -




and debentures issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations; debt securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or one of its agencies or instrumentalities (U.S. Government
securities) or by a non-U.S. government; municipal securities; and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. These securities may pay fixed, variable or floating rates of interest, and may include zero coupon obligations. Fixed income
securities are subject to the risk of the issuers inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations (i.e., credit risk) and are subject to price volatility resulting from, among other things, interest rate sensitivity,
market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and general market liquidity (i.e., market risk).  Distressed
Securities. The Investment Funds in which the Fund may invest may purchase equity and debt securities and other obligations of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business distress, including companies involved in bankruptcy
or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. These issuers may be in weak financial condition, experiencing poor operating results, having substantial capital needs or a negative net worth, or facing special competitive or product
obsolescence problems. Investments of this type may involve substantial financial and business risks that can result in substantial, or at times even total, losses. Under such circumstances, the returns generated from the Funds investments may
not compensate the Shareholders adequately for the risks assumed.  Acquired investments may include senior or subordinated
debt securities, bank loans, promissory notes and other evidences of indebtedness, as well as payables to trade creditors. Although such purchases may result in significant returns to the Fund, they involve a substantial degree of risk and may not
show any return for a considerable period of time. In fact, many of these securities and investments ordinarily remain unpaid while the company is in bankruptcy and may not ultimately be paid unless and until the company reorganizes and/or emerges
from bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, such securities may have to be held for an extended period of time.  In the event
that Investment Funds acquire loans and other assets that are distressed or non-performing, it may be necessary for the Investment Manager to restructure the obligation, or foreclose on a mortgage or security interest and sell the collateral in
order to realize value. There are a variety of risks associated with such strategy including (i) an inability to successfully restructure the loan or other obligation, (ii) even if restructured, the obligors financial condition may
continue to worsen, leading to a new default on the restructured obligation, (iii) litigation risks, and (iv) bankruptcy risks, including unpredictability, delays and costs associated with a bankruptcy. 
The level of analytical sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing
significant business and financial distress is high. There is no assurance that the Investment Managers will correctly evaluate the nature and magnitude of the various factors that could affect the prospects for a successful reorganization or
similar action. Among the risks inherent in investments in troubled entities is the fact that it frequently may be difficult to obtain information as to the true condition of such issuers. Such investments also may be adversely affected by laws
relating to, among other things, fraudulent transfers and other voidable transfers or payments, lender liability and the bankruptcy courts power to disallow, reduce, subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims. 
If, in a lawsuit brought by an unpaid creditor or representative of creditors of an issuer of indebtedness, a court were to find that the
issuer did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for incurring the indebtedness and that, after giving effect to such indebtedness, the issuer (i) was insolvent, (ii) was engaged in a business for which the
remaining assets of such issuer constituted unreasonably small capital or (iii) intended to incur, or believed it would incur, debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature, such court could determine to invalidate, in whole or in
part, such indebtedness as a fraudulent conveyance, to subordinate such indebtedness to existing or future creditors of such issuer, or to recover amounts previously paid by such issuer in satisfaction of such

  - 31 -




indebtedness. The measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing will vary. Generally, an issuer would be considered insolvent at a particular time if the sum of its debts was then greater
than all of its property at fair valuation, or if the present fair saleable value of its assets was then less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liabilities on its existing debts as they became absolute and matured. There can
be no assurance as to what standard a court would apply in order to determine whether the issuer was insolvent after giving effect to the incurrence of the indebtedness in which an Investment Fund invested or that, regardless of the
method of valuation, a court would not determine that the issuer was insolvent upon giving effect to such incurrence. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of an issuer of indebtedness in which an Investment Fund invests, payments
made on such indebtedness could be subject to avoidance as a preference if made within a certain period of time (which may be as long as one year) before insolvency. In general, if payments on indebtedness are avoidable, whether as
fraudulent conveyances or preferences, such payments can be recaptured from the Investment Fund to which such payments were made.  The Fund does not anticipate that Investment Funds will engage in conduct that would form the basis for a successful cause of action based upon fraudulent conveyance, preference or equitable
subordination. There can be no assurance, however, as to whether any lending institution or other party from which the Investment Fund may acquire such indebtedness engaged in any such conduct (or any other conduct that would subject such
indebtedness and the Investment Fund to insolvency laws) and, if it did, as to whether such creditor claims could be asserted in a U.S. court (or in the courts of any other country) against the Investment Fund. 
The administrative costs incurred in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding are frequently high and will be paid out of the
debtors estate prior to any return to creditors (other than out of assets or proceeds thereof, which are subject to valid and enforceable liens and other security interests) and equity holders. In addition, certain claims that have priority by
law over the claims of certain creditors (for example, claims for taxes) may be quite high.  The market prices of such
securities are also subject to abrupt and erratic market movements and above-average price volatility, and the spread between the bid and asked prices of such securities may be greater than those prevailing in other securities markets. It may be
necessary for some of the assets acquired by the Investment Funds to be held for a significant period of time in order to realize a profit. The investment thesis for acquiring such assets is that they are trading at distressed levels that do not
accurately reflect the risk or intrinsic value of the asset and that they will recover a significant portion of their value as conditions in the credit markets normalize. There can be no assurances that this will be the case or how long it will take
for conditions in the credit markets to materially improve. In fact, conditions may continue to worsen before they improve. 
Securities issued by distressed companies may have a limited trading market, resulting in limited liquidity. As a result, Investment
Managers may have difficulties in valuing or liquidating positions.  High Yield Securities. Investment Funds may
invest in fixed income securities rated investment grade or non-investment grade (commonly referred to as junk bonds) and may invest in unrated fixed income securities. Non-investment grade debt securities in the lowest rating categories or unrated
debt securities determined to be of comparable quality may involve a substantial risk of default or may be in default. Adverse changes in economic conditions or developments regarding the individual issuer are more likely to cause price volatility
and weaken the capacity of the issuers of non-investment grade debt securities to make principal and interest payments than issuers of higher grade debt securities. An economic downturn affecting an issuer of non-investment grade debt securities may
result in an increased incidence of default. In addition, the market for lower grade debt securities may be thinner and less active than for higher grade debt securities.

Convertible Securities. Convertible securities are bonds, debentures, notes, or other
securities that may be converted or exchanged (by the holder or by the issuer) into shares of the underlying common stock (or cash or securities of equivalent value) at a stated exchange ratio. Convertible securities, until converted, have the same
general characteristics as debt securities insofar as they generally provide a stable stream of income with generally higher yields than those of equity securities of the same or similar issuers. By permitting the holder to exchange an investment
for common stock or the cash value of a security or a basket or index of securities, convertible securities may also enable the investor to benefit from increases in the market price of the underlying securities. Therefore, convertible securities
generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than non-convertible securities of similar quality.  Convertible securities
may be subordinate to other securities. In part, the total return for a convertible security depends upon performance of the underlying stock into which it can be converted. Also, issuers of convertible securities are often not as strong financially
as those issuing securities with higher credit ratings, are more likely to encounter financial difficulties and typically are more vulnerable to changes in the economy, such as a recession or a sustained period of rising interest rates, which could
affect their ability to make interest and principal payments. If an issuer stops making interest and/or principal payments, the Investment Funds could lose their entire investment. The values of a synthetic convertible and a true convertible
security may respond differently to market fluctuations. In addition, in purchasing a synthetic convertible security, Investment Funds may have counterparty (including counterparty credit) risk with respect to the financial institution or
investment bank that offers the instrument. Purchasing a synthetic convertible security may provide greater flexibility than purchasing a traditional convertible security.  Preferred Securities. Preferred stock represents an equity or ownership interest in an issuer. Preferred stock normally pays dividends at a specified rate and has precedence over common stock in
the event the issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy. However, in the event an issuer is liquidated or declares bankruptcy, the claims of owners of bonds take precedence over the claims of those who own preferred and common stock. Preferred
stock, unlike common stock, often has a stated dividend rate payable from the corporations earnings. Preferred stock dividends may be cumulative or noncumulative, participating or auction rate. Cumulative dividend provisions
require all or a portion of prior unpaid dividends to be paid before dividends can be paid to the issuers common stock. Participating preferred stock may be entitled to a dividend exceeding the stated dividend in certain cases. If
interest rates rise, the fixed dividend on preferred stocks may be less attractive, causing the price of such stocks to decline. Preferred stock may have mandatory sinking fund provisions, as well as provisions allowing the stock to be called or
redeemed, which can limit the benefit of a decline in interest rates. Preferred stock is subject to many of the risks to which common stock and debt securities are subject.  Short Sales. Short selling involves selling securities which may or may not be owned and borrowing the same securities for delivery to the purchaser, with an obligation to replace the borrowed
securities at a later date. Short selling allows the investor to profit from declines in market prices to the extent such decline exceeds the transaction costs and the costs of borrowing the securities. However, since the borrowed securities must be
replaced by purchases at market prices in order to close out the short position, any appreciation in the price of the borrowed securities would result in a loss. Purchasing securities to close out the short position can itself cause the price of the
securities to rise further, thereby exacerbating the loss.  An Investment Fund may make short sales
against-the-box, in which it will sell short securities it owns or has the right to obtain without payment of additional consideration. If an Investment Fund makes a short sale against-the-box, it will be required to set aside securities
equivalent in kind and amount to the securities sold short (or securities convertible or exchangeable into those securities) and will be required to hold those securities while the short sale is outstanding. An Investment Fund will incur transaction
costs, including interest expenses, in connection with initiating, maintaining and closing-out short sales against-the-box.

On September 19, 2008, in response to spreading turmoil in the financial markets, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) temporarily banned short selling in the stocks of numerous financial services companies, and also promulgated new disclosure requirements with respect to short positions held by investment
managers. Various international regulatory bodies, including the United Kingdoms Financial Services Authority, also promulgated restrictions on short selling at that time. The SECs temporary ban on short selling of such stocks has since
expired, but similar restrictions and/or additional disclosure requirements may be promulgated at any time, especially if market turmoil persists. Restrictions on the short sale of the securities of financial services companies based in a particular
country continue to be imposed by regulators in a variety of European jurisdictions. If Investment Funds are subjected to such new restrictions, they may be forced to cover short positions more quickly than otherwise intended and may suffer losses
as a result. Such restrictions may also adversely affect the ability of Investment Funds to execute their investment strategies generally, especially if short selling is a fundamental element of their strategies. The SEC has subsequently adopted
amendments to Regulation SHO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 that restrict the ability to engage in a short sale at a price that is less than or equal to the current best bid if the price of the covered security has decreased by 10% or
more from the covered securitys closing price as of the end of the prior day (a short sale-related circuit breaker). See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Other Risks  Legal and Regulatory Risks.
 Mortgage-Backed Securities. Investment Funds may invest in mortgage-backed securities. The investment characteristics
of mortgage-backed securities differ from those of traditional debt securities. Among the major differences are that interest and principal payments on mortgage-backed securities are made more frequently, usually monthly, and that principal may be
prepaid at any time because the underlying loans or other assets generally may be prepaid at any time. The adverse effects of prepayments may indirectly affect the Fund in two ways. First, particular investments may experience outright losses, as in
the case of an interest-only security in an environment of faster than expected actual or anticipated prepayments. Second, particular investments may underperform relative to hedges that the Investment Funds may have entered into for these
investments, resulting in a loss to the Investment Fund. In particular, prepayments (at par) may limit the potential upside of many mortgage-backed securities to their principal or par amounts, whereas their corresponding hedges often have the
potential for large losses.  The Investment Funds may also invest in structured notes, variable rate mortgage-backed
securities, including adjustable-rate mortgage securities (ARMs), which are backed by mortgages with variable rates, and certain classes of collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) derivatives, the rate of interest payable
under which varies with a designated rate or index. The value of these investments is closely tied to the absolute levels of such rates or indices, or the markets perception of anticipated changes in those rates or indices. This introduces
additional risk factors related to the movements in specific indices or interest rates that may be difficult or impossible to hedge, and which also interact in a complex fashion with prepayment risks. 
Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to the risk of delinquencies on mortgage loans underlying such securities. An unexpectedly
high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may adversely affect the value of a mortgage-backed security and could result in losses to an Investment Fund. So-called subprime mortgages (mortgage loans made to borrowers
with weakened credit histories or with a lower capacity to make timely payments on their mortgages) have experienced higher rates of delinquency, and such delinquencies have increased dramatically since 2007. These increased mortgage delinquencies
have adversely impacted the market for mortgage-backed securities generally (including derivatives or other instruments linked to the value of such securities) and led to 
  - 34 -




turmoil in the credit markets generally. In particular, holders of mortgage-backed securities have experienced great difficulty in valuing such securities in light of the dramatically reduced
market for mortgage-backed securities. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  Valuation.  Commodities. Commodities are assets that have tangible properties. Major categories include agricultural products (e.g., wheat, cattle), energy products (e.g., oil, gasoline),
metals (e.g., gold, aluminum), and soft products (e.g., sugar, coffee, cocoa, cotton). Commodities can be traded on a spot basis (i.e., price for immediate delivery) or on a futures basis
(i.e., price for delivery at a specified future date). Most commodity investments involve buying or selling futures rather than transacting in the spot market. A rise in price of a particular commodity will generally cause the price
of the futures to rise, benefiting a futures buyer. Similarly, a decline in price will benefit a futures seller. The Fund may seek to invest with Investment Managers who engage in commodity futures trading. In addition, Investment
Funds may seek to invest directly in commodities through strategies that purchase or sell commodity futures as permitted by applicable law.  Commodity and financial markets are highly volatile because of the low margin deposits normally required in futures trading, and because a high degree of leverage is typical of a futures trading
account. As a result, a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in substantial losses to the investor. In addition, commodity exchanges may limit fluctuations in commodity futures contract prices during a single
day and thus during a single trading day no trades may be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. Once the price of a futures contract for a particular commodity has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit,
positions in the commodity can be neither taken nor liquidated unless the Investment Funds are willing to effect trades at or within the limit, which may hinder the ability of the Investment Funds to trade. 
Energy/Natural Resources Investing. The production and marketing of commodities, energy and natural resources may be affected by
actions and changes in governments. Securities of such companies may be subject to broad price fluctuations, reflecting volatility of energy and basic materials prices and possible instability of supply of various hard assets, as well as changes in
demand due to international economic conditions. In addition, some such companies also may be subject to the risks of mining and oil drilling, and the risks of other hazards, such as fire, drought, and increased regulatory and environmental costs.
 Real Estate. Investing in real estate, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) may subject an
Investment Fund to risks associated with the ownership of real estate, including terrorist attacks, war or other acts that destroy real property (in addition to securities market risks). Some REITs may invest in a limited number of properties, in a
narrow geographic area, or in a single property type, which increases the risk that an Investment Fund could be unfavorably affected by the poor performance of a single investment or investment type. These companies are also sensitive to factors
such as changes in real estate values and property taxes, interest rates, cash flow of underlying real estate assets, supply and demand, and the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer. Borrowers could default on or sell investments the
REIT holds, which could reduce the cash flow needed to make distributions to investors. In addition, REITs also may be affected by tax and regulatory requirements in that a REIT may not qualify for preferential tax treatments or exemptions. REITs
require specialized management and pay management expenses. Securities issued by private partnerships in real estate may be more illiquid than securities issued by other Investment Funds generally, because the partnerships underlying real
estate investments may tend to be less liquid than other types of investments.  Non-U.S. Securities. An Investment Fund
may invest in non-U.S. securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies and/or traded outside of the United States. Such investments require consideration of certain risks typically not associated with investing in U.S. securities or property. Such
risks include, 
  - 35 -




among other things, trade balances and imbalances and related economic policies, unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations, impositions of exchange control regulation by the United States
or foreign governments, United States and foreign withholding taxes, limitations on the removal of funds or other assets, policies of governments with respect to possible nationalization of their industries, political difficulties, including
expropriation of assets, confiscatory taxation, and economic or political instability in foreign nations.  There may be less
publicly available information about certain foreign companies than there would be in the case of comparable companies in the United States. Certain foreign companies may not be subject to accounting, auditing, and financial reporting standards and
requirements comparable to or as uniform as those of United States companies. Securities markets outside the United States, while growing in volume, have for the most part substantially less volume than U.S. markets, and many securities traded on
these foreign markets are less liquid and their prices are more volatile than securities of comparable United States companies. In addition, settlement of trades in some non-U.S. markets is much slower and more susceptible to failure than in U.S.
markets.  The risks associated with investing in non-U.S. securities may be greater with respect to those issued by companies
located in emerging industrialized or less developed countries. Risks particularly relevant to emerging markets may include higher dependence on exports and the corresponding importance of international trade, greater risk of inflation, greater
controls on foreign investment and limitations on repatriation of invested capital, increased likelihood of governmental involvement in and control over the economies, governmental decisions to cease support of economic reform programs or to impose
centrally planned economies, and less developed corporate laws regarding fiduciary duties of officers and directors and protection of investors.  Other risks of investing in non-U.S. securities include the following: 
Non-U.S. Exchanges. An Investment Fund may trade, directly or indirectly, futures and securities on exchanges located outside of
the United States. Some non-U.S. exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges, are principals markets in which performance is solely the individual members responsibility with whom the Investment Fund has entered into a commodity
contract and not that of an exchange or clearinghouse, if any. In the case of trading on non-U.S. exchanges, an Investment Fund will be subject to the risk of the inability of, or refusal by, the counterparty to perform with respect to contracts.
Moreover, since there is generally less government supervision and regulation of non-U.S. exchanges, clearinghouses and clearing firms than in the United States, an Investment Fund is also subject to the risk of the failure of the exchanges on which
its positions trade or of their clearinghouses or clearing firms, and there may be a high risk of financial irregularities and/or lack of appropriate risk monitoring and controls. 
Non-U.S. Government Securities. An Investment Funds non-U.S. investments may include debt securities issued or guaranteed by
non-U.S. governments, their agencies or instrumentalities and supranational entities. An Investment Fund may invest in debt securities issued by certain supranational entities, which include entities designated or supported by
governments to promote economic reconstruction or development, international banking organizations and related government agencies. An example of a supranational entity is the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (commonly referred
to as the World Bank).  Investment in sovereign debt of non-U.S. governments can involve a high degree of risk,
including additional risks not present in debt obligations of corporate issues and the U.S. government. The issuer of the debt or the government authority that controls the repayment of sovereign debt may be unable or unwilling to repay the
principal and/or interest when due in accordance with the terms of the debt, and an Investment Fund may have limited recourse to compel payment in the event of a default. A 
  - 36 -




sovereign debtors or governmental entitys willingness or ability to repay principal and/or interest due in a timely manner may be affected by, among other factors, its cash flow
situation, the extent of its foreign currency reserves, the availability of sufficient foreign exchange on the date a payment is due, the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole, the sovereign debtors or governmental
entitys policy toward international lenders, such as the International Monetary Fund, the political constraints to which a governmental entity may be subject, and changes in governments and political systems. At certain times, certain
countries (particularly emerging market countries) have declared moratoria on the payment of principal and interest on external debt. Governmental entities may also depend on expected disbursements from non-U.S. governments, multilateral agencies
and others to reduce principal and interest arrearages on their debt. The commitment on the part of these governments, agencies and others to make such disbursements may be conditioned on a governmental entitys implementation of economic
reforms and/or economic performance and the timely service of such debtors obligations. Failure to implement such reforms, achieve such levels of economic performance or repay principal or interest when due may result in the cancellation of
such third parties commitments to lend funds to the governmental entity, which may further impair such debtors ability or willingness to service its debts in a timely manner. Consequently, governmental entities may default on their
sovereign debt. Holders of sovereign debt (including the Investment Funds) may be requested to participate in the rescheduling of such debt and to extend further loans to governmental entities. There is no bankruptcy proceeding by which sovereign
debt on which governmental entities have defaulted may be collected in whole or in part. Periods of economic uncertainty may result in the volatility of market prices of sovereign debt to a greater extent than the volatility inherent in debt
obligations of other types of issues.  Currencies. One or more Investment Funds may invest a portion of its assets in
non-U.S. currencies, or in instruments denominated in non-U.S. currencies, the prices of which are determined with reference to currencies other than the U.S. dollar. To the extent unhedged, the value of such Investment Funds assets will
fluctuate with U.S. dollar exchange rates, as well as the price changes of its investments in the various local markets and currencies. Thus, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to the other currencies in which the Investment Fund
makes its investments will reduce the effect of increases, and magnify the effect of decreases, in the prices of securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar and held by the Investment Fund in such securities respective
local markets. Conversely, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar will have the opposite effect on the non-U.S. dollar securities of the Fund or such Investment Fund. In addition, some governments from time to time impose restrictions intended
to prevent capital flight, which may for example involve punitive taxation (including high withholding taxes) on certain securities transfers or the imposition of exchange controls making it difficult or impossible to exchange or repatriate the
local currency.  An Investment Fund may also incur costs in connection with conversion between various currencies. In
addition, certain Investment Funds may be denominated in non U.S. currencies. Subscription amounts contributed by the Fund for investment in such an Investment Fund will be converted immediately by the relevant Investment Manager from U.S. Dollars
into the applicable foreign currency at the then applicable exchange rate determined by and available to the Investment Manager. In certain cases, depending on the applicable circumstances, the exchange rate obtained by the Investment Manager may be
less advantageous to the Fund than other rates available to the Fund directly.  An Investment Fund may utilize currency
forward contracts and options to hedge against currency fluctuations. Forward contracts and options thereon, unlike futures contracts, are not traded on exchanges and are not standardized; rather banks and dealers act as principals in these markets,
negotiating each transaction on a individual basis. Forward and cash trading is substantially unregulated; there is no limitation on daily price movements and speculative position limits are not applicable. The principals that deal in
the forward markets are not required to continue to make markets in the currencies or commodities they trade, and these markets can experience periods of illiquidity, sometimes of significant duration. There have been periods during which certain
participants in these 
  - 37 -




markets have refused to quote prices for certain currencies or commodities or have quoted prices with an unusually wide spread between the price at which they were prepared to buy and that at
which they were prepared to sell. In respect of such trading, an Investment Fund is subject to the risk of counterparty failure or the inability or refusal by a counterparty to perform with respect to such contracts. Market illiquidity or disruption
could result in major losses to an Investment Fund.  European Economic Risk. European financial markets have recently
experienced volatility and have been adversely affected by concerns about rising government debt levels, credit rating downgrades, and possible default on or restructuring of government debt. These events have affected the value and exchange rate of
the euro. Investing in euro-denominated (or other European currency-denominated) securities also entails the risk of being exposed to a currency that may not fully reflect the strengths and weaknesses of the disparate European economies. The
governments of several member countries of the European Union (EU) have experienced large public budget deficits, which have adversely affected the sovereign debt issued by those countries and may ultimately lead to declines in the value
of the euro. It is possible that EU member countries that have already adopted the euro could abandon the euro and return to a national currency and/or that the euro will cease to exist as a single currency in its current form. The effects of such
an abandonment or a countrys forced expulsion from the euro on that country, the rest of the EU, and global markets are impossible to predict, but are likely to be negative. The exit of any country out of the euro would likely have an
extremely destabilizing effect on all eurozone countries and their economies and a negative effect the global economy as a whole. In addition, under these circumstances, it may be difficult to value investments denominated in euros or in a
replacement currency.  Fund Borrowings. The Fund may borrow money in connection with its investment activities 
i.e., the Fund may utilize leverage. Specifically, the Fund may borrow money through a credit facility or other arrangements to manage timing issues in connection with the acquisition of its investments (i.e., to provide the Fund with temporary
liquidity to acquire investments in Investment Funds in advance of the Funds receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more Investment Funds or the receipt of proceeds from the sale of additional Shares). The Fund also may borrow money to
fund repurchase payments to Shareholders pending the receipt of redemption proceeds from one or more Investment Funds. See Investment ProgramLeverage.  The use of leverage is speculative and involves certain risks. Although leverage will increase the Funds investment return if the Funds interest in an Investment Fund purchased with borrowed
funds earns a greater return than the interest expense the Fund pays for the use of those funds, the use of leverage will decrease the return on the Fund if the Fund fails to earn as much on its investment purchased with borrowed funds as it pays
for the use of those funds. The use of leverage will in this way magnify the volatility of changes in the value of an investment in the Fund, especially in times of a credit crunch or during general market turmoil, such as that
experienced during late 2008/2009. The Fund may be required to maintain minimum average balances in connection with its borrowings or to pay a commitment or other fee to maintain a line of credit; either of these requirements would increase the cost
of borrowing over the stated interest rate. In addition, a lender to the Fund may terminate or refuse to renew any credit facility into which the Fund has entered. If the Fund is unable to access additional credit, it may be forced to redeem
investments in Investment Funds at inopportune times (or may be unable to make investments in Investment Funds at opportune times), which may further depress the returns of the Fund. 
The 1940 Acts Asset Coverage Requirement requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of 300%
of its indebtedness, including amounts borrowed, measured at the time the investment company incurs the indebtedness. This requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness may not exceed one-third of the value of
its total assets (including the indebtedness). The Funds borrowings will at all times be subject to the Asset Coverage Requirement. 
  - 38 -



In addition to borrowing money, the Fund may also incur leveraged exposure via the use of
derivatives. These instruments may nevertheless, in some cases, involve significant risks of loss.  Leverage Utilized by
Investment Funds. The Investment Funds may also utilize leverage in their investment activities. Specifically, some or all of the Investment Funds may make margin purchases of securities and, in connection with these purchases, borrow money from
brokers and banks for investment purposes. Investment Funds that utilize leverage are subject to the same risks as the Fund with respect to its use of leverage as set forth above, and may also be subject to the following additional risks: Trading
equity securities on margin involves an initial cash requirement representing at least a percentage of the underlying securitys value. Borrowings to purchase equity securities typically will be secured by the pledge of those securities. The
financing of securities purchases may also be effected through reverse repurchase agreements with banks, brokers and other financial institutions. In the event that an Investment Funds equity or debt instruments decline in value, the
Investment Fund could be subject to a margin call or collateral call, under which the Investment Fund must either deposit additional collateral with the lender or suffer mandatory liquidation of the pledged securities to
compensate for the decline in value. In the event of a sudden, precipitous drop in value of an Investment Funds assets, the Investment Fund might not be able to liquidate assets quickly enough to pay off its borrowing. In the recent market
turmoil during late 2008, numerous hedge funds faced margin calls and were required to sell large portions of their investments in rapid fashion so as to meet these calls. In addition, the ongoing market turmoil and weakened position of many
financial services companies have forced many such companies to reduce or terminate the credit they have extended to hedge funds, which has in turn forced many hedge funds to deleverage in similar fashion. A substantial number of hedge funds have
been forced to liquidate as a result. If an Investment Fund is required to deleverage in such fashion, its returns will likely be substantially reduced, and it may be forced to liquidate entirely if it cannot meet its margin calls or otherwise cover
its outstanding indebtedness. In addition, legal and regulatory changes applicable to hedge funds and/or financial services companies generally may either force Investment Funds to deleverage or otherwise limit their ability to utilize leverage. See
Other Risks  Legal and Regulatory Risks.  The Asset Coverage Requirement does not apply to Investment Funds.
Accordingly, the Funds portfolio may be exposed to the risk of leveraged investment programs of certain Investment Funds and the volatility of the value of Shares may be greater. 
In seeking leveraged market exposure in certain investments and in attempting to increase overall returns, an Investment Fund
may purchase options and other synthetic instruments that may involve leveraged exposure and may, in some cases, involve significant risks of loss, especially in highly volatile market conditions such as those currently being experienced.
 Small and Medium Capitalization Issuers. Certain Investment Funds may invest in the securities of companies with
small- to medium-sized capitalizations. While the securities of such companies often provide significant potential for appreciation, smaller-capitalization securities involve higher risks in some respects than do investments in the securities of
larger companies. For example, prices of small-capitalization and even medium-capitalization securities are often more volatile than prices of large-capitalization securities, and the risk of bankruptcy or insolvency of many smaller companies (with
the attendant losses to investors) is higher than that for larger, blue-chip companies. In addition, due to thin trading in some small-capitalization securities, an investment in such securities may be relatively illiquid. 
Non-Diversified Status. The Fund is a non-diversified investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act, which means
that it is not subject to percentage limitations under the 1940 Act on the 
  - 39 -




percentage of its assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer. The Funds net asset value may therefore be subject to greater volatility than that of an investment
company that is subject to such a limitation on diversification. In addition, while the Fund is a non-diversified fund for purposes of the 1940 Act, the Fund has elected, and intends to qualify, to be treated as a RIC under the Code. To
qualify as a RIC under the Code, the Fund must, among other things, (i) derive in each taxable year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, and gains from the sale or other
disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net income from interests in qualified publicly traded partnerships
(as defined in the Code); and (ii) diversify its holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year, (A) at least 50% of the market value of the Funds assets is represented by cash, cash items, U.S. government
securities, securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities, with such other securities of any one issuer limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of the Funds total
assets and 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and (B) not more than 25% of the market value of the Funds total assets is invested in the securities (other than U.S. government securities and the securities of other
regulated investment companies) of (1) any one issuer, (2) any two or more issuers that the Fund controls and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or (3) any one or more
qualified publicly traded partnerships. In addition, the Adviser typically endeavors to limit investments in any one Investment Fund to no more than 10% of the Funds gross assets (measured at the time of purchase), and to limit
investments in any one Investment Manager to no more than 15% of the Funds gross assets (measured at the time of purchase). The Fund intends to distribute at least annually all or substantially all of its net investment income as dividends to
Shareholders; however, this policy may be changed at any time by the Fund.  Reverse Repurchase Agreements. Reverse
repurchase agreements involve a sale of a security by an Investment Fund to a bank or securities dealer and the Investment Funds simultaneous agreement to repurchase the security for a fixed price (reflecting a market rate of interest) on a
specific date. These transactions involve a risk that the other party to a reverse repurchase agreement will be unable or unwilling to complete the transaction as scheduled, which may result in losses to the Investment Fund. Reverse repurchase
transactions are a form of leverage that may also increase the volatility of an Investment Funds investment portfolio. 
Purchasing Initial Public Offerings. The Investment Funds may purchase securities of companies in initial public offerings of any
equity security (new issues) or shortly thereafter. Special risks associated with these securities may include a limited number of shares available for trading, unseasoned trading, lack of investor knowledge of the company, and limited
operating history. These factors may contribute to substantial price volatility for the shares of these companies and, thus, the Fund. The limited number of shares available for trading in some initial public offerings may make it more difficult for
an Investment Fund to buy or sell significant amounts of shares without an unfavorable impact on prevailing market prices. In addition, some companies in initial public offerings are involved in relatively new industries or lines of business, which
may not be widely understood by investors. Some of these companies may be undercapitalized or regarded as developmental stage companies, without revenues or operating income, or the near-term prospects of achieving them. 
Special Investment Instruments and Techniques  Investment Funds may utilize a variety of special investment instruments and techniques described below to hedge the portfolios of the Investment Funds against various risks, such as changes in interest
rates or other factors that affect security values, or for non-hedging purposes in seeking to achieve an Investment Funds investment objective. The Adviser, on behalf of the Fund, may also use certain of these special investment instruments
and techniques for either hedging or non-hedging purposes as described below. These strategies may be executed through derivative transactions. Instruments used and 
  - 40 -




the particular manner in which they may be used may change over time as new instruments and techniques are developed or regulatory changes occur. Certain of these special investment instruments
and techniques are speculative and involve a high degree of risk, particularly in the context of non-hedging transactions. 
Derivatives. The Fund and some or all of the Investment Funds may invest in, or enter into, derivatives or derivatives
transactions (Derivatives). Derivatives are financial instruments that derive their performance, at least in part, from the performance of an underlying asset, index or interest rate. Derivatives entered into by an Investment Fund or the
Fund can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk, depending upon the characteristics of a particular Derivative and the portfolio of the Investment Fund or the Fund as a whole. Derivatives permit an Investment Manager or the
Adviser to increase or decrease the level of risk of an investment portfolio, or change the character of the risk, to which an investment portfolio is exposed in much the same way as the manager can increase or decrease the level of risk, or change
the character of the risk, of an investment portfolio by making investments in specific securities. Derivatives may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would suggest, meaning that a small investment in Derivatives could have
a large potential effect on the performance of an Investment Fund or the Fund. The Advisers use of Derivatives may include total return swaps, options and futures designed to replicate the performance of a particular Investment Fund or an
Investment Funds underlying investments (for example, where an Investment Fund is concentrated in a given sector). The Adviser may enter into these types of Derivatives where, for example, an Investment Fund in which the Fund would like to
invest does not have sufficient capacity for a direct investment on the part of the Fund. The Adviser may also enter into Derivatives to adjust market or risk exposure generally. 
If an Investment Fund or the Fund invests in Derivatives at inopportune times or incorrectly judges market conditions, the investments
may lower the return of the Investment Fund or the Fund or result in a loss. An Investment Fund or the Fund also could experience losses if Derivatives are poorly correlated with its other investments, or if the Investment Fund or the Fund is unable
to liquidate the position because of an illiquid secondary market and an inability to terminate the derivatives contract. The market for many Derivatives is, or suddenly can become, illiquid. Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and
unpredictable changes in the prices for Derivatives.  With respect to Derivatives involving high yield and other debt
securities, an Investment Fund or the Fund will usually have a contractual relationship only with the counterparty of the derivative, and not with the issuer of the indebtedness. An Investment Fund generally will have no right to directly enforce
compliance by the issuer with the terms of a derivative, nor any rights of set-off against the issuer, nor have any voting rights with respect to the indebtedness. An Investment Fund will not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the
underlying indebtedness and will not have the benefit of the remedies that would normally be available to a holder of the indebtedness. In addition, in the event of the insolvency of the counterparty to the derivative, the Investment Fund will be
treated as a general creditor of such counterparty, and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying indebtedness. Consequently, the Investment Fund will be subject to the credit risk of the counterparty as well as that of the issuer of
the indebtedness. As a result, concentrations of such Derivatives in any one counterparty subject the Investment Fund and/or the Fund to an additional degree of risk with respect to defaults by such counterparty as well as by the issuer of the
underlying indebtedness.  Futures. An Investment Fund may purchase and sell single stock futures or stock index futures
to hedge the equity portion of its investment portfolio with regard to market (systemic) risk or to gain market exposure to that portion of the market represented by the futures contracts. An Investment Fund may also purchase and sell other futures
when deemed appropriate, in order to hedge the equity or non-equity portions of its portfolio. In addition, to the extent that an Investment Fund invests in foreign securities and foreign currencies, an Investment Fund may enter into contracts for
the future delivery of foreign currencies to hedge against changes in currency exchange rates. Subject to compliance with applicable rules and restrictions, Investment Funds also may enter into futures contracts traded on foreign futures exchanges.

  - 41 -



An Investment Fund may purchase and sell futures contracts on debt securities and on indices
of debt securities in order to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates that might otherwise have an adverse effect upon the value of an Investment Funds securities. An Investment Fund may also enter into such futures contracts for
other appropriate risk management, income enhancement and investment purposes. There are several risks associated with the use of futures contracts and options on futures contracts as hedging techniques. There can be no assurance that a liquid
market will exist at the time when an Investment Fund seeks to close out a futures contract. If no liquid market exists, an Investment Fund would remain obligated to meet margin requirements until the position is closed. Futures may involve a small
initial investment relative to the risk assumed, which could result in losses greater than if they had not been used. There can be no guarantee that there will be a correlation between price movements in the hedging vehicle and in an Investment
Funds securities being hedged, even if the hedging vehicle closely correlates with the Investment Funds investments, such as with single stock futures contracts. If the price of a futures contract changes more than the price of the
securities or currencies, an Investment Fund will experience either a loss or a gain on the futures contracts that will not be completely offset by changes in the price of the securities or currencies that are the subject of the hedge. In addition,
there are significant differences between the securities and futures markets that could result in an imperfect correlation between the markets, causing a given hedge not to achieve its objectives. 
Options Trading. Certain of the Investment Managers may engage in options trading as a part of their investment program. Options
trading increases the possibilities of gain and the risk of loss. The use of option transactions may increase the adverse impact to which an Investment Funds portfolio may be subject if the Investment Managers evaluation of the various
factors involved in particular securities transactions is incorrect.  Warrants and Rights. Warrants are Derivatives
that permit, but do not obligate, their holder to subscribe for other securities or commodities. Rights are similar to warrants, but normally have a shorter duration and are offered or distributed to shareholders of a company. Warrants and rights do
not carry with them the right to dividends or voting rights with respect to the securities that they entitle the holder to purchase, and they do not represent any interest in the assets of the issuer. As a result, warrants and rights may be
considered more speculative than certain other types of equity-like securities. In addition, the values of warrants and rights do not necessarily change with the values of the underlying securities or commodities and these instruments cease to have
value if they are not exercised prior to their expiration dates.  Swap Agreements. The Fund or an Investment Fund may
enter into equity, interest rate, and index and currency rate swap agreements. These transactions will be undertaken in attempting to obtain a particular return when it is considered desirable to do so, possibly at a lower cost than if the Fund or
an Investment Fund had invested directly in the asset that yielded the desired return. Swap agreements are two-party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year. In a standard
swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments, which may be adjusted for an interest factor. 
The gross returns to be exchanged or swapped between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a notional
amount, that is, the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate, in a particular non-U.S. currency, or in a basket of securities representing a particular index. 
  - 42 -



Most swap agreements entered into by the Fund or an Investment Fund would require the
calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements on a net basis. Consequently, current obligations (or rights) under a swap agreement generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the
agreement based on the relative values of the positions held by each party to the agreement (the net amount). The risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net amount of interest payments that the Fund or the Investment Fund
is contractually obligated to make. If the other party to a swap defaults, the Funds or the Investment Funds risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that the Fund or the Investment Fund contractually is entitled to receive.
 To achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an Investment Manager in whose Investment Fund the Fund could
not invest directly, perhaps because of its investment minimum or its unavailability for direct investment, the Fund may enter into one or more swap agreements under which the Fund may agree, on a net basis, to pay a return based on a floating
interest rate, and to receive the total return of the reference Investment Fund over a stated time period. The Fund may seek to achieve the same investment result through the use of other Derivatives in similar circumstances. The U.S. federal income
tax treatment of swap agreements and other Derivatives as described above is unclear. Swap agreements and other Derivatives used in this manner may be treated as a constructive ownership of the reference property, which may result in a
portion of any long-term capital gain being treated as ordinary income.  The Funds obligations under a swap agreement
will be accrued daily (offset against any amounts owed to the Fund) and any accrued but unpaid net amounts owed to a swap counterparty will be covered by the maintenance of a segregated account consisting of cash or liquid securities to avoid any
potential leveraging of the Fund. To the extent that the Funds Derivatives are entered into for hedging purposes, the Adviser believes that such obligations do not constitute senior securities under the 1940 Act and, accordingly,
will not treat them as being subject to the Funds borrowing restrictions.  In a credit default swap, the credit default
protection buyer makes periodic payments, known as premiums, to the credit default protection seller. In return the credit default protection seller will make a payment to the credit default protection buyer upon the occurrence of a specified credit
event. A credit default swap can refer to a single issuer or asset, a basket of issuers or assets or index of assets, each known as the reference entity or underlying asset. An Investment Fund may act as either the buyer or the seller of a credit
default swap.  Credit default swaps allow an Investment Fund to acquire or reduce credit exposure to a particular issuer,
asset or basket of assets. If a swap agreement calls for payments by the Investment Fund, the Investment Fund must be prepared to make such payments when due. If the Investment Fund is the credit default protection seller, the Investment Fund will
experience a loss if a credit event occurs and the credit of the reference entity or underlying asset has deteriorated. If the Investment Fund is the credit default protection buyer, the Investment Fund will be required to pay premiums to the credit
default protection seller.  Lending Portfolio Securities. Investment Funds may lend their securities to brokers,
dealers and other financial institutions needing to borrow securities to complete certain transactions. The lending Investment Fund continues to be entitled to payments in amounts equal to the interest, dividends or other distributions payable in
respect of the loaned securities, which affords the Investment Fund an opportunity to earn interest on the amount of the loan and on the loaned securities collateral. In connection with any such transaction, the Investment Fund will receive
collateral consisting of cash, U.S. Government securities or irrevocable letters of credit that will be maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least 100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. An Investment Fund might
experience loss if the institution with which the Investment Fund has engaged in a portfolio loan transaction breaches its agreement with the Investment Fund. 
  - 43 -



When-Issued and Forward Commitment Securities. Investment Funds may purchase
securities on a when-issued basis and may purchase or sell securities on a forward commitment basis in order to hedge against anticipated changes in interest rates and prices. These transactions involve a commitment by an
Investment Fund to purchase or sell securities at a future date (ordinarily one or two months later). The price of the underlying securities, which is generally expressed in terms of yield, is fixed at the time the commitment is made, but delivery
and payment for the securities takes place at a later date. No income accrues on securities that have been purchased pursuant to a forward commitment or on a when-issued basis prior to delivery to the Investment Fund. When-issued securities and
forward commitments may be sold prior to the settlement date. If an Investment Fund disposes of the right to acquire a when-issued security prior to its acquisition or disposes of its right to deliver or receive against a forward commitment, it may
incur a gain or loss. The risk exists that securities purchased on a when-issued basis may not be delivered and that the purchaser of securities sold by an Investment Fund on a forward basis will not honor its purchase obligation. In such cases, an
Investment Fund may incur a loss.  Restricted and Illiquid Investments. The Adviser anticipates that most Investment
Funds will invest primarily in publicly traded securities; however, some Investment Funds may invest a portion of the value of their total assets in restricted securities and other investments that are illiquid. To the extent that an Investment Fund
invests in restricted or other illiquid securities, the valuation of such securities will be determined by the applicable Investment Manager, whose determination will be final and conclusive as to all parties. The value established may not reflect
accurately the amount that could be realized if the securities were sold.  Restricted securities are securities that may not
be sold to the public without an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act or that may be sold only in a privately negotiated transaction or pursuant to an exemption from registration. When registration is required to sell a security, an
Investment Fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses, and a considerable period may elapse between the decision to sell and the time the Investment Fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration
statement. If adverse market conditions developed during this period, an Investment Fund might obtain a less favorable price than the price that prevailed when the Investment Fund decided to sell. 
Investment Funds may be unable to sell restricted and other illiquid securities at the most opportune times or at prices approximating
the value at which they purchased the securities.  The Funds interests in Investment Funds are themselves illiquid and
subject to substantial restrictions on transfer. The Funds ability to liquidate an interest in an Investment Fund will likely be limited. The Fund is subject to certain Investment Funds initial lock-up periods beginning at the time of
the Funds initial investment in an Investment Fund, during which the Fund may not withdraw its investment. In addition, certain Investment Funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of
time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions (such as those experienced by many hedge funds in late 2008/2009). Investment Funds may impose gates and also assess fees for redemptions or other withdrawals. The limited liquidity of
these Investment Funds interests may adversely affect the Fund were it to have to sell or redeem such interests at an inopportune time. The Fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in
Investment Funds in a timely manner.  Some of the Investment Funds may hold a portion of their assets in side
pockets which are sub-accounts within the Investment Funds in which certain assets (which generally are illiquid and/or hard to value) are held and segregated from the Investment Funds other assets until some type of realization event
occurs. Side pockets thus have restricted liquidity, potentially extending over a much longer period than the typical liquidity an investment in the Investment Funds may provide. Should the Fund seek to liquidate its investment in an Investment Fund
that maintains these side pockets, the Fund 
  - 44 -




might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay, which could be considerable. In such cases, until the Fund is permitted to fully liquidate its interest in the Investment Fund,
the value of its investment in such Investment Fund could fluctuate based on adjustments to the fair value of the side pocket as determined by the Investment Manager. In addition, if an Investment Fund establishes a side pocket prior to the
Funds investing in the Investment Fund, the Fund may not be exposed to the performance of the Investment Funds assets held in the side pocket.  Counterparty Credit Risk. Many of the markets in which the Fund and the Investment Funds effect their transactions are over-the-counter or interdealer markets. The
participants in these markets are typically not subject to credit evaluation and regulatory oversight as are members of exchange based markets. To the extent the Fund or an Investment Fund invests in swaps, derivatives or synthetic
instruments, or other over-the-counter transactions in these markets, the Fund or Investment Fund may take a credit risk with regard to parties with which it trades and also may bear the risk of settlement default. These risks may differ materially
from those involved in exchange-traded transactions, which generally are characterized by clearing organization guarantees, daily marking-to-market and settlement, and segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries.
Transactions entered into directly between two counterparties generally do not benefit from these protections, which in turn may subject the Fund or an Investment Fund to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with
its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract or because of a credit or liquidity problem. Such counterparty risk is increased for contracts with longer maturities when events may intervene to prevent
settlement. The ability of the Fund and the Investment Funds to transact business with any one or any number of counterparties, the lack of any independent evaluation of the counterparties or their financial capabilities, and the absence of a
regulated market to facilitate settlement, may increase the potential for losses by the Fund. In addition, the Fund and the Investment Funds are subject to the risk that a counterparty may be unable to settle a transaction due to such
counterpartys insolvency, inability to access sufficient credit, or other business factors.  An Investment Fund may be
subject to risk of loss of its assets on deposit with a broker in the event of the brokers bankruptcy, the bankruptcy of any clearing broker through which the broker executes and clears transactions on behalf of the Investment Fund, or the
bankruptcy of an exchange clearing house. Although the Commodity Exchange Act requires a commodity broker to segregate the funds of its customers, if a commodity broker fails to properly segregate customer funds, the Investment Fund may be subject
to a risk of loss of its funds on deposit with such broker in the event of such brokers bankruptcy or insolvency, The Investment Fund may be subject to risk of loss of its funds on deposit with foreign brokers because foreign regulatory bodies
may not require such brokers to segregate customer funds. The Investment Fund may be required to post margin for its foreign exchange transactions either with its broker or other foreign exchange dealers who are not required to segregate funds
(although such funds are generally maintained in separate accounts on the foreign exchange dealers books and records in the name of the Investment Fund). Under certain circumstances, such as the inability of another customer of the commodity
broker or foreign exchange dealer or the commodity broker or foreign exchange dealer itself to satisfy substantial deficiencies in such other customers account, the Investment Fund may be subject to a risk of loss of its funds on deposit with
such broker or dealer, even if such funds are properly segregated. In the case of any such bankruptcy or customer loss, the Investment Fund might recover, even if respect of property specifically traceable to the Investment Fund, only a pro rata
share of all property available for distribution to all of such brokers or dealers customers.  Prime Brokers
and Custodians. Under arrangements between the Investment Funds and their prime brokers or custodians, the prime brokers and custodians generally will have the right to (i) identify as collateral, (ii) rehypothecate, or
(iii) otherwise use for their own purposes assets held by them for the Investment Funds. Legal and beneficial title to such assets may therefore be transferred to the relevant prime broker and custodian. Similarly, any cash of the
Investment Funds held or received by or on behalf 
  - 45 -




of a prime broker or custodian may not be treated as client money and may not be subject to the client money protections conferred by the client rules of FINRA or equivalent rules of other
regulators to which such prime broker or custodian may be subject. Accordingly, the cash of the Investment Funds may also constitute collateral and may not be segregated from the cash of the prime brokers and custodians. Consequently,
Investment Funds may rank as an unsecured creditor in respect of such assets and cash on the insolvency of a prime broker and custodian and might not be able to recover such assets and cash in full. The inability of Investment Funds to recover
such cash could have a material adverse effect on the Funds performance and returns to Shareholders.  Commodity
Futures Contracts. Trading in commodity interests may involve substantial risks. The low margin or premiums normally required in such trading may provide a large amount of leverage, and a relatively small change in the price of a security or
contract can produce a disproportionately larger profit or loss. There is no assurance that a liquid secondary market will exist for commodity futures contracts or options purchased or sold, and an Investment Fund may be required to maintain a
position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses. Futures positions may be illiquid because, for example, most U.S. commodity exchanges limit fluctuations in certain futures contract prices during a single day by regulations
referred to as daily price fluctuation limits or daily limits. Once the price of a contract for a particular future has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in the future can neither be
taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures contract prices on various commodities or financial instruments occasionally have moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no
trading. Similar occurrences could prevent an Investment Fund from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions and could subject such Investment Fund, and therefore the Fund to substantial losses. In addition, Investment Funds may not be able to
execute futures contract trades at favorable prices if trading volume in such contracts is low. It is also possible that an exchange or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) may suspend trading in a particular contract,
order immediate liquidation and settlement of a particular contract, or order that trading in a particular contract be conducted for liquidation only.  Trading in commodity futures contracts and options is a highly specialized activity which may entail greater than ordinary investment or trading risks. The price of stock index futures contracts may not
correlate perfectly with the movement in the underlying stock index because of certain market distortions. First, all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements. Rather than meeting additional
margin deposit requirements, investors may close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which would distort the normal relationship between the index and futures markets. Secondly, from the point of view of speculators, the deposit
requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities market. Therefore, increased participation by speculators in the futures market also may cause temporary price distortions. Successful use of stock index
futures contracts by an Investment Fund also is subject to its Investment Managers ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the market.  Under CFTC regulations, futures commission merchants (FCMs) are required to maintain a clients assets in a segregated account. If a FCM used by an Investment Fund fails to properly
segregate, the Investment Fund may be subject to a risk of loss of the margin on deposit with the FCM in the event of the FCMs bankruptcy. In addition, under certain circumstances, such as the inability of another client of the FCM or the FCM
itself to satisfy substantial deficiencies in such other clients account, the Investment Fund may be subject to a risk of loss of its margin on deposit with its FCM, even if such margin funds are properly segregated. In the case of any such
bankruptcy or other client loss, the Investment Fund might recover, even in respect of property specifically traceable to the Investment Fund, only a pro rata share of all property available for distribution to all of the FCMs clients, and the
Fund may suffer a loss as a result. 
  - 46 -



Non-U.S. Futures Transactions. Investment Funds may invest in non-U.S. commodity
futures contracts and in options thereon. Non-U.S. futures transactions involve executing and clearing trades on a non-U.S. exchange. This is the case even if the non-U.S. exchange is formally linked to a U.S. exchange, whereby a trade
executed on one exchange liquidates or establishes a position on the other exchange. No U.S. organization regulates the activities of a non-U.S. exchange, including the execution, delivery, and clearing of transactions on such an exchange, and no
U.S. regulator has the power to compel enforcement of the rules of the non-U.S. exchange or the laws of non-U.S. countries. Moreover, such laws or regulations will vary depending on the country in which the transaction occurs. For these reasons,
Investment Funds which trade on non-U.S. exchanges may not be afforded certain of the protections which apply to U.S. commodity futures transactions, including the right to use U.S. alternative dispute resolution procedures. In particular, funds
received from Investment Funds to margin non-U.S. futures transactions may not be provided the same protections as funds received to margin futures transaction on U.S. exchanges. In addition, the price of any non-U.S. futures or option contract, and
therefore, the potential profit and loss resulting therefrom, may be affected by any fluctuation in the non-U.S. exchange rate between the time the order is placed and the non-U.S. futures contract is liquidated or the non-U.S. option contract is
liquidated or exercised.  Possible Effects of Speculative Position Limits. The CFTC and the U.S. commodities exchanges
have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or short speculative futures positions that any person may hold or control in derivatives traded on U.S. commodities exchanges. All accounts owned
or managed by a commodity trading adviser, its principals and their affiliates generally will be combined for position limit purposes. Because futures position limits allow a commodity trading advisor, its principals and their affiliates to control
only a limited number of contracts in any one commodity, each Investment Manager and its principals and affiliates are potentially subject to a conflict among the interests of all accounts the Investment Manager and its principals and their
affiliates control which are competing for shares of that limited number of contracts. Although each Investment Manager may be able to achieve the same or similar performance results with OTC substitutes for futures contracts, the OTC market may be
subject to differing prices, lesser liquidity and greater counterparty credit risks than on U.S. commodities exchanges. Each Investment Manager may be required to reduce the size or number of positions that would otherwise be held for an Investment
Fund or not trade in certain markets on behalf of the Investment Fund in order to avoid exceeding such limits. Modification of trades that would otherwise be made by an Investment Fund, if required, could adversely affect the Investment Funds
operations and profitability. A violation of speculative position limits by an Investment Manager could lead to regulatory action materially adverse to an Investment Funds prospects for profitability. 
The speculative position limits of the CFTC and U.S. commodities exchanges are subject to change. Any new or additional position limits
imposed on an Investment Manager and its principal and affiliates may impact the Investment Funds ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective. 
Other Instruments and Future Developments. An Investment Fund may take advantage of opportunities in the area of swaps, options on
various underlying instruments, and certain other customized synthetic or derivative instruments, which will be subject to varying degrees of risk. In addition, an Investment Fund may take advantage of opportunities with respect to
certain other synthetic or derivative instruments which are not presently contemplated, or which are not presently available, but which may be developed and which may be subject to significant degrees of risk. 
Hedging Limitations. Although the Adviser may seek one or more Investment Managers who employ various hedging techniques, the
extent and effectiveness of such hedging strategies may vary substantially. Moreover, it will not be a goal of the Adviser to retain Investment Managers who necessarily employ fully hedged or market-neutral strategies. Most hedging
techniques of Investment 
  - 47 -




Managers will be directed primarily toward general market risks or certain issuer risks. Typically there are numerous investment risks which will not be hedged or necessarily capable of being
hedged as a practical matter. To the extent unhedged, investment positions of Investment Managers will, in general, be fully exposed to market and investment risks. Hedging techniques have a variety of limitations. Hedging against a decline in the
value of a portfolio position by selling short, for example, does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of portfolio positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline, but establishes other positions designed to gain from those
same developments, thus moderating the decline in the overall portfolio positions value. Hedging through market index options may only protect against an overall market downturn, as compared with price declines in specific securities.
 Hedge transactions generally also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the portfolio position should increase, due
to the hedging cost or price decline in the hedging position. For a variety of reasons, an Investment Manager may not seek or be able to establish a sufficiently accurate correlation between hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being
hedged. Such imperfect correlation may prevent an Investment Fund from achieving the intended hedge or may expose the Fund to risk of loss. Such losses can include losses on the hedged position, the attempted hedge position, or both, and could be
substantial. There can be no assurance, therefore, that investment positions of Investment Funds will be significantly hedged against investment risks or that such hedging strategies, if any, will in fact prove successful. 
Tail Risk Hedging. Investment Funds that pursue a tail risk hedging strategy invest in instruments designed to
outperform during periods of market stress. Such periods may be characterized by, among other factors: (i) a significant decline in the equity markets; (ii) a significant widening in credit spreads; and/or (iii) a significant increase
in market volatility. Instruments designed to mitigate tail event risk involve a high degree of risk. The type, frequency and severity of tail events are difficult to predict or model, and thus the expected return on an instrument designed to
appreciate on the occurrence of any such tail event is difficult to calculate. With respect to tail event instruments, it is necessary for Investment Managers to rely on information provided by a counterparty or independent source (such as an index)
that may not be accurate, and the Investment Manager may not be able to verify or challenge the information. Securities that are linked to tail events may, in the future, have novel features or non-standardized terms. An Investment Fund risks the
loss of all or a portion of principal and/or interest due on the tail event-linked securities it may purchase, if a period of severe market stress fails to occur during the term of such securities. Model-driven strategies such as a tail risk hedging
strategy may not achieve their intended results, whether due to unusual or changing market conditions or relationships, and may also involve frequent trading and transaction expenses.  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  The Investment Funds are not
registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act. The Fund, as an investor in these Investment Funds, does not have the benefit of the protections afforded by the 1940 Act to investors in registered investment companies. See Other
RisksLegal and Regulatory Risks. Although the Adviser periodically receives information from each Investment Fund regarding its investment performance and investment strategy, the Adviser may have little or no means of independently
verifying this information. An Investment Fund may use proprietary investment strategies that are not fully disclosed to the Adviser, which may involve risks under some market conditions that are not anticipated by the Adviser. Investment Managers
may change their investment strategies (i.e., may experience style drift) at any time.  In addition, the Investment Funds are
organized and managed by persons having no affiliation with the Adviser. Accordingly, the Fund will be subject to the judgment, success and ability of the Investment Managers of those Investment Funds. The Adviser may not have complete information
concerning the specific investments made by, and will have no management authority or control over, the 
  - 48 -




Investment Managers. The Fund will be subject to restrictions on its ability to withdraw or reduce capital that has been invested in any Investment Fund. Therefore, the Adviser may be unable to
react rapidly to market changes should an Investment Manager fail to effect portfolio changes consistent with such market changes and/or the intentions of the Adviser.  Investment Funds will generally be required by contract, applicable law or otherwise to make limited disclosures only to their investors, including the Fund, regarding their operations and performance
and, as a result, transparency of such information to the Adviser will be limited. Accordingly, the Adviser will not be in a position to analyze or respond to developments within any particular Investment Fund unless and until information relating
thereto is disseminated by the Investment Manager to its investors, including the Fund. Such information may not necessarily be timely or complete.  The Fund will conduct due diligence which the Adviser believes is adequate to select Investment Funds and Investment Managers with which to invest Fund assets. However, due diligence is not foolproof and
may not uncover problems associated with a particular Investment Fund or Investment Manager. The Fund may rely upon representations made by hedge fund managers, accountants, attorneys, prime brokers, and/or other investment professionals. If any
such representations are misleading, incomplete, or false, this may result in the selection of Investment Funds and Investment Managers which might otherwise have been eliminated from consideration had fully accurate and complete information been
made available to the Fund. Similarly, the Adviser conducts ongoing due diligence in an effort to detect material changes in an Investment Fund or Investment Managers personnel or operations which could be material to the Fund. However, such
diligence may not be effective in identifying all material problems before they occur. The Fund will only invest in Investment Funds whose portfolios are valued by independent third parties. In addition, the policies and procedures approved by the
Funds Board of Trustees provide that the Adviser will review the valuations provided by the Investment Managers to the Investment Funds. However, neither the Adviser nor the Board of Trustees will be able to confirm independently the accuracy
of valuations provided by the Investment Managers (which are unaudited). In addition, although the Adviser intends to employ reasonable diligence in evaluating and monitoring Investment Funds and Investment Managers, no amount of diligence can
eliminate the possibility that one or more Investment Funds or Investment Managers may engage in improper or fraudulent conduct, including unauthorized changes in investment strategy, misappropriation of assets and unsupportable valuations of
portfolio securities.  The Investment Funds typically do not maintain their securities and other assets in the custody of a
bank or a member of a securities exchange, as generally required of registered investment companies. It is anticipated that the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests generally will maintain custody of their assets with brokerage firms which do
not separately segregate such customer assets as required in the case of registered investment companies. Under the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970, as amended, the bankruptcy of any such brokerage firm could have a
greater adverse effect on the Fund than would be the case if custody of assets were maintained in accordance with the requirements applicable to registered investment companies. There is also a risk that an Investment Manager could convert assets
committed to it by the Fund for its own use or that a custodian could convert assets committed to it by an Investment Manager to its own use.  An investor in the Fund meeting the eligibility conditions imposed by the Investment Funds, including minimum initial investment requirements that may be substantially higher than those imposed by the
Fund, could invest directly in the Investment Funds. By investing in the Investment Funds via the Fund, an investor in the Fund bears a portion of the Advisers Management Fee and other expenses of the Fund, and also indirectly bears a portion
of the asset-based fees, incentive fees/allocations and other expenses borne by the Fund as an investor in the Investment Funds. Each Investment Manager receives any incentive-based fees/allocations to which it is entitled irrespective of the
performance of the other Investment Funds and the Fund generally. As a result, an Investment Manager with positive performance 
  - 49 -




may receive compensation from the Fund, in the form of the asset-based fees, incentive-based fees and other expenses payable by the Fund as an investor in the relevant Investment Fund, even if
the Funds overall returns are negative. Investment decisions of the Investment Funds are made by the Investment Managers independently of each other so that, at any particular time, one Investment Fund may be purchasing shares in an issuer
that at the same time are being sold by another Investment Fund. Transactions of this sort could result in the Fund directly or indirectly incurring certain transaction costs without accomplishing any net investment result, which may result in the
pursuit of opposing investment strategies or result in performance that correlates more closely with broader market performances. Hidden correlations between Investment Funds may occur if two or more Investment Funds are purchasing the same
securities. Because the Fund may make additional investments in or redemptions from Investment Funds only at certain times according to limitations set out in the governing documents of the Investment Funds, the Fund from time to time may have to
invest some of its assets temporarily in money market securities or money market funds, among other similar types of investments.  Investment Funds may permit or require that redemptions of interests be made in kind. Upon its redemption of all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Fund, the Fund may receive securities that
are illiquid or difficult to value. In such a case, the Adviser would seek to cause the Fund to dispose of these securities in a manner that is in the best interest of the Fund. The Fund may not be able to withdraw from an Investment Fund except at
certain designated times, limiting the ability of the Adviser to redeem assets from an Investment Fund that may have poor performance or for other reasons.  Other risks that the Adviser believes are associated with the Funds fund of hedge funds investment approach include:  Technological Failures. The successful deployment of an Investment Funds trading systems, the implementation and operation of these trading systems and any future trading systems, and various
other critical activities of the Investment Managers could be severely compromised by unforeseeable software or hardware malfunction and other technological failures, power loss, software bugs and errors, malicious code such as worms,
viruses, or system crashes, fire or water damage, or various other events or circumstances either within or beyond the Investment Managers control. Software bugs and errors, in particular, and their ensuing risks are an inherent
part of technology-based analytics, systems and models. Any event that interrupts an Investment Managers computer and/or telecommunications operations could result in, among other things, the inability to establish, modify, liquidate, or
monitor the Investment Funds investments and, for those and other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on the operating results, financial condition, activities and prospects of the Investment Fund and thus the Fund. 
Valuation. The fund of hedge funds approach places certain constraints on the Advisers ability to value the assets of the
Fund. While the Fund will receive annual audited financial statements for each Investment Fund and will review the valuations provided by the Investment Managers to the Investment Funds, and while the Fund will only invest in Investment Funds whose
portfolios are valued by independent third parties, neither the Adviser nor the Board of Trustees will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by the Investment Managers (which are unaudited). Certain securities and
other financial instruments in which the Investment Funds invest may not have a readily ascertainable market price and will be valued pursuant to policies and procedures established by the Investment Managers. In most cases, the Adviser will have no
ability to assess the accuracy of the valuations received from an Investment Fund. In addition, the net asset values or other valuation information received by the Adviser from the Investment Funds will typically be estimates only, subject to
revision through the end of each Investment Funds annual audit. Revisions to the gain and loss calculations will be an ongoing process, and no net capital appreciation or depreciation figure can be considered final until the annual audit of
each Investment Fund is completed. 
  - 50 -



Securities Believed to Be Undervalued or Incorrectly Valued. An Investment Manager
may invest in securities that an Investment Manager believes are fundamentally undervalued or incorrectly valued, but such securities may not ultimately be valued in the capital markets at prices and/or within the timeframe the Investment Manager
anticipates. As a result, the Fund may lose all or substantially all of its investment in an Investment Fund in any particular instance.  Investment Funds Turnover Rates. The Investment Funds may invest on the basis of short-term market considerations. The turnover rate within the Investment Funds may be significant,
potentially involving substantial brokerage commissions and fees. The Fund has no control over this turnover. As a result, it is anticipated that a significant portion of the Funds income and gains, if any, may be derived from ordinary income
and short-term capital gains. In addition, the redemption by the Fund of its interest in an Investment Fund could involve expenses to the Fund under the terms of the Funds investment with that Investment Fund. 
Investment Managers May Have Limited Capacity to Manage Additional Fund Investments. Certain Investment Managers trading
approaches presently can accommodate only a certain amount of capital. Each Investment Manager will normally endeavor not to undertake to manage more capital than such Investment Managers approach can accommodate without risking a potential
deterioration in returns. As a result, an Investment Manager may refuse to manage some or all of the Funds assets that the Adviser seeks to allocate to such Investment Manager. Further, in the case of Investment Managers that limit the amount
of additional capital that they will accept from the Fund, continued sales of Shares would dilute the indirect participation of existing Shareholders with such Investment Manager. Conversely, an Investment Manager may accept more capital than the
Investment Manager can prudently manage.  Investments in Non-Voting Stock; Limitations on Voting. Investment Funds may,
consistent with applicable law, not disclose the contents of their portfolios. This lack of transparency may make it difficult for the Adviser to monitor whether holdings of the Investment Funds cause the Fund to be above specified levels of
ownership in certain asset classes. To avoid adverse regulatory consequences in such a case, the Fund may need to hold its interest in an Investment Fund in non-voting form. Additionally, in order to avoid becoming subject to certain 1940 Act
prohibitions with respect to affiliated transactions, the Fund intends to own less than 5% of the voting securities of each Investment Fund. This limitation on owning voting securities is intended to ensure that an Investment Fund is not deemed an
affiliated person of the Fund for purposes of the 1940 Act, which may, among other things, potentially impose limits on transactions with the Investment Funds, both by the Fund and other clients of the Adviser. To limit its voting
interest in certain Investment Funds, the Fund may enter into contractual arrangements under which the Fund irrevocably waives its rights (if any) to vote all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Fund. The Fund will not receive any
consideration in return for entering into a voting waiver arrangement. Other investment funds or accounts managed by the Adviser may also waive their voting rights in a particular Investment Fund. Subject to the oversight of the Funds Board of
Trustees, the Adviser will decide whether to waive such voting rights and, in making these decisions, will consider the amounts (if any) invested by the Adviser in the particular Investment Fund. These voting waiver arrangements may increase the
ability of the Fund to invest in certain Investment Funds. However, to the extent the Fund contractually foregoes the right to vote all or a portion of its interest in an Investment Fund, the Fund will not be able to vote (at all or to the fullest
possible extent) on matters that require the approval of the interestholders of the Investment Fund, including matters adverse to the Funds interests. This restriction could diminish the influence of the Fund in an Investment Fund, as compared
to other investors in the Investment Fund (which could include other investment funds or accounts managed by the Adviser, if they do not waive their voting rights in the Investment Fund), and adversely affect the Funds investment in the
Investment Fund, which could result in unpredictable and potentially adverse effects on Shareholders. There are, however, other statutory tests of affiliation (such as on the basis of control), and, therefore, the prohibitions of the 1940 Act with
respect to affiliated transactions could apply 
  - 51 -




in some situations where the Fund owns less than 5% of the voting securities of an Investment Fund. In these circumstances, transactions between the Fund and an Investment Fund may, among other
things, potentially be subject to the prohibitions of Section 17 of the 1940 Act notwithstanding that the Fund has entered into a voting waiver arrangement.  Risk Management. The sophistication of the risk management techniques employed by Investment Managers varies. However, even the most sophisticated risk management techniques cannot protect an
Investment Fund against loss in all circumstances. All risk management models are premised upon assumptions with respect to economic and political conditions, market sentiment and other factors. The occurrence of an aberrational event not
anticipated by a model can cause a portfolio to sustain a significant loss. Such events may include volatility in energy prices, sharp swings in interest rates or other factors. 
OTHER RISKS  Investing in the Fund involves risks other than those associated with investments made by Investment Funds, including those described below: 
Limited Operating History. The Fund is a newly-organized non-diversified, closed-end management investment company with no
operating history that investors can use to evaluate its investment performance. In addition, Investment Funds and/or Investment Managers with whom the Fund may invest may, in some cases, be newly organized with limited operating histories upon
which to evaluate their performance.  Performance Incentive Arrangements. Each Investment Manager may receive a
performance or incentive fee/allocation of generally 20% of net profits of the Investment Fund that it manages. These performance incentives may create an incentive for the Investment Managers to make investments that are riskier or more speculative
than those that might have been made in the absence of the performance or incentive fee /allocation. In addition, these performance incentives will be calculated on a basis that includes realized and unrealized appreciation of assets, and may be
greater than if it were based solely on realized gains.  Availability of Investment Opportunities. The business of
identifying and structuring investments of the types contemplated by the Fund is competitive, and involves a high degree of uncertainty. The availability of investment opportunities generally is subject to market conditions as well as, in some
cases, the prevailing regulatory or political climate. No assurance can be given that the Fund will be able to identify and complete attractive investments in the future or that it will be able to invest fully its subscriptions. Similarly,
identification of attractive investment opportunities by Investment Funds is difficult and involves a high degree of uncertainty. Even if an attractive investment opportunity is identified by an Investment Manager, an Investment Fund may not be
permitted to take advantage of the opportunity to the fullest extent desired. Other investment vehicles sponsored, managed or advised by the Adviser and its affiliates may seek investment opportunities similar to those the Fund may be seeking. The
Adviser will allocate fairly between the Fund and such other investment vehicles any investment opportunities that may be appropriate for the Fund and such other investment vehicles. 
Control Positions. Investment Funds may take control positions in companies. The exercise of control over a company imposes
additional risks of liability for environmental damage, product defects, failure to supervise and other types of liability related to business operations. In addition, the act of taking a control position, or seeking to take such a position, may
itself subject an Investment Fund to litigation by parties interested in blocking it from taking that position. If those liabilities were to arise, or such litigation were to be resolved adversely to the Investment Funds, the investing Investment
Funds likely would suffer losses on their investments. 
  - 52 -



Inadequate Return. No assurance can be given that the returns on the Funds
investments will be commensurate with the risk of investment in the Fund. Investors should not commit money to the Fund unless they have the resources to sustain the loss of their entire investment in the Fund. 
Inside Information. From time to time, the Fund or its affiliates may come into possession of material, non-public information
concerning an entity in which the Fund has invested, or proposes to invest. Possession of that information may limit the ability of the Fund to buy or sell securities of the entity. 
Recourse to the Funds Assets. The Funds assets, including any investments made by the Fund and any interest in the
Investment Funds held by the Fund, are available to satisfy all liabilities and other obligations of the Fund. If the Fund becomes subject to a liability, parties seeking to have the liability satisfied may have recourse to the Funds assets
generally and not be limited to any particular asset, such as the asset representing the investment giving rise to the liability.  Possible Exclusion of a Shareholder Based on Certain Detrimental Effects. The Fund may repurchase Shares held by a Shareholder or other person acquiring Shares from or through a Shareholder, if:
  


 

 
 the Shares have been transferred or have vested in any person other than by operation of law as the result of the death, dissolution, bankruptcy,
insolvency or adjudicated incompetence of the Shareholder;   


 

 
 ownership of the Shares by the Shareholder or other person likely will cause the Fund to be in violation of, require registration of any Shares under,
or subject the Fund to additional registration or regulation under, the securities, commodities or other laws of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction; 
 


 

 
 continued ownership of the Shares by the Shareholder or other person may be harmful or injurious to the business or reputation of the Fund, the Board
of Trustees, the Adviser or any of their affiliates, or may subject the Fund or any Shareholder to an undue risk of adverse tax or other fiscal or regulatory consequences; 
 


 

 
 any of the representations and warranties made by the Shareholder or other person in connection with the acquisition of the Shares was not true when
made or has ceased to be true;   


 

 
 the Shareholder is subject to special regulatory or compliance requirements, such as those imposed by the Bank Holding Company Act, certain Federal
Communications Commission regulations, or ERISA (as hereinafter defined) (collectively, Special Laws or Regulations), and the Fund determines that the Shareholder is likely to be subject to additional regulatory or compliance
requirements under these Special Laws or Regulations by virtue of continuing to hold the Shares; or   


 

 
 the Fund or the Board of Trustees determine that the repurchase of the Shares would be in the best interest of the Fund. 
The effect of these provisions may be to deprive an investor in the Fund of an opportunity for a return even though other investors in
the Fund might enjoy such a return. 
  - 53 -



Limitations on Transfer; Shares Not Listed; No Market for Shareholder Shares. No
Shareholder is permitted to transfer his, her or its Shares without the consent of the Fund. The transferability of Shares is subject to certain restrictions contained in the Funds Agreement and Declaration of Trust and is affected by
restrictions imposed under applicable securities laws. Shares are not traded on any securities exchange or other market. No market currently exists for Shares, and the Fund contemplates that one will not develop. The Shares are, therefore, not
readily marketable. Although the Adviser and the Fund expect to recommend to the Board of Trustees that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares quarterly, no assurances can be given that the Fund will do so. Consequently, Shares should only be acquired
by investors able to commit their funds for an indefinite period of time.  Closed-end Fund; Liquidity Risks. The Fund
is a non-diversified closed-end management investment company designed primarily for long-term investors and is not intended to be a trading vehicle. An investor should not invest in the Fund if the investor needs a liquid investment. Closed-end
funds differ from open-end management investment companies (commonly known as mutual funds) in that investors in a closed-end fund do not have the right to redeem their shares on a daily basis at a price based on net asset value. 
Repurchase Risks. With respect to any future repurchase offer, Shareholders tendering any Shares for repurchase must do so by a
date specified in the notice describing the terms of the repurchase offer (the Notice Date). The Notice Date generally will be 95 days prior to the date as of which the Shares to be repurchased are valued by the Fund (the Valuation
Date). Tenders will be revocable upon written notice to the Fund up to 85 days prior to the Valuation Date. Shareholders that elect to tender any Shares for repurchase will not know the price at which such Shares will be repurchased until the
Funds net asset value as of the Valuation Date is able to be determined, which determination is expected to be able to be made only late in the month following that of the Valuation Date. It is possible that during the time period between the
Expiration Date and the Valuation Date, general economic and market conditions, or specific events affecting one or more underlying Investment Funds, could cause a decline in the value of Shares in the Fund. In addition, the Fund is subject to
certain Investment Funds initial lock-up periods beginning at the time of the Funds initial investment in an Investment Fund, during which the Fund may not withdraw its investment. In addition, certain Investment Funds may at times elect
to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions (such as those experienced by many hedge funds in late 2008/2009). During such periods, the Fund thus may not
be able to liquidate its holdings in such Investment Funds in order to meet repurchase requests. In addition, should the Fund seek to liquidate its investment in an Investment Fund that maintains a side pocket, the Fund might not be able to fully
liquidate its investment without delay, which could be considerable. The Fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in Investment Funds in a timely manner. See Redemptions, Repurchases
and Transfers of Shares.  Substantial Repurchases. Substantial requests for the Fund to repurchase Shares could
require the Fund to liquidate certain of its investments more rapidly than otherwise desirable in order to raise cash to fund the repurchases and achieve a market position appropriately reflecting a smaller asset base. This could have a material
adverse effect on the value of the Shares.  To the extent the Fund obtains repurchase proceeds by disposing of its interest in
certain Investment Funds, the Fund will thereafter hold a larger proportion of its assets in the remaining Investment Funds, some of whose interests at times may be less liquid or illiquid. This could adversely affect the ability of the Fund to fund
subsequent repurchase requests of Shareholders or to conduct future repurchases at all. In addition, after giving effect to such dispositions, the remaining Investment Funds may not reflect the Advisers ideal judgments as to the desired
portfolio composition of the Funds Investment Funds, in that the Funds performance may be tied to the performance of fewer Investment Funds and/or may not reflect the Advisers judgment as to the Funds optimal exposure to
particular asset classes or investment strategies. These consequences may be particularly applicable if the Fund receives requests to repurchase substantial amounts of Shares, and may have a material adverse effect on the

  - 54 -




Funds ability to achieve its investment objective and the value of the Shares. In addition, substantial repurchases of Shares could result in a sizeable decrease in the Funds net
assets, resulting in an increase in the Funds total annual operating expense ratio.  Potential Significant Effect of
the Performance of a Limited Number of Investments or Strategies. The Adviser expects that the Fund will participate in multiple investments. The Fund may, however, make investments in a limited number of Investment Funds and Investment Funds
may make investments in a limited number of portfolio companies. In either instance, these limited numbers of investments may have a significant effect on the performance of the Fund. 
Special Tax Risks. Special tax risks are associated with an investment in the Fund. The Fund has elected to, and intends to meet
the requirements necessary to, qualify as a regulated investment company or RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As such, the Fund must satisfy, among other requirements, certain ongoing asset diversification, source-of-income
and annual distribution requirements. Each of these ongoing requirements for qualification for the favorable tax treatment available to RICs requires that the Fund obtain information from the Investment Funds in which the Fund is invested.
 If before the end of any quarter of its taxable year, the Fund believes that it may fail the asset diversification
requirement, the Fund may seek to take certain actions to avert such a failure. The Fund may try to acquire additional interests in Investment Funds to bring itself into compliance with the asset diversification test. However, the action frequently
taken by RICs to avert such a failure, the disposition of non-diversified assets, may be difficult for the Fund to pursue because the Fund may redeem its interest in an Investment Fund only at certain times specified by the governing documents of
each respective Investment Fund. While relevant provisions also afford the Fund a 30-day period after the end of the relevant quarter in which to cure a diversification failure by disposing of non-diversified assets, the constraints on the
Funds ability to effect a redemption from an Investment Fund referred to above may limit utilization of this cure period. 
If the Fund fails to satisfy the asset diversification or other RIC requirements, it may lose its status as a RIC under the Code. In that
case, all of its taxable income would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates without any deduction for distributions to Shareholders. In addition, all distributions (including distributions of net capital gain) would be
taxed to their recipients as dividend income to the extent of the Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits. Accordingly, disqualification as a RIC would have a material adverse effect on the value of the Funds Shares and the
amount of the Funds distributions.  Additional Tax Considerations; Distributions to Shareholders and Payment of Tax
Liability. The Fund will distribute substantially all of its net investment income and gains to Shareholders. These distributions are taxable as ordinary income or capital gains to the Shareholder. Shareholders may be proportionately liable for
taxes on income and gains of the Fund, but Shareholders not subject to tax on their income will not be required to pay tax on amounts distributed to them. The Fund will inform Shareholders of the amount and character of its distributions to
Shareholders. See Tax Considerations below for more information. If the Fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gain net income, plus any such amounts that were not
distributed in previous tax years, then the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax with respect to the Funds nondistributed amounts.  In addition, the Fund invests in Investment Funds located outside the U.S. Such Investment Funds may be subject to withholding tax on their investments in such jurisdictions. Any such withholding tax
would reduce the return on the Funds investment in such Investment Funds and thus on the Shareholders investment in the Fund. See Tax Considerations. 
  - 55 -



Legal and Regulatory Risks. Legal, tax, and regulatory changes, as well as judicial
decisions, could adversely affect the Fund, the Adviser, the Investment Funds, the Investment Managers and/or the investment strategies used to implement the Investment Funds trading programs. The regulatory environment for private
investment funds continues to evolve, and changes in the regulation of private investment funds may adversely affect the value of the Funds investments and the ability of the Fund to implement its investment strategy (including the use of
leverage). The financial services industry generally and the activities of private investment funds (such as the Investment Funds) and their Investment Managers, in particular, have been the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory
scrutiny. Such scrutiny may increase an Investment Funds and/or an Investment Managers legal, compliance, administrative and other related burdens and costs as well as regulatory oversight or involvement in an Investment Fund
and/or an Investment Manager or result in ambiguity or conflict among legal or regulatory schemes applicable to an Investment Fund and/or an Investment Manager.  The regulation of the U.S. and non-U.S. securities and futures markets and investment funds such as the Fund has undergone substantial change in recent years and such change may continue. In particular,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) was signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act contains changes to the existing regulatory structure in the United States and is intended to
establish rigorous oversight standards to protect the U.S. economy and American consumers, investors and businesses. The Dodd-Frank Act requires additional regulation of hedge fund managers, including requirements for such managers to register as
investment advisers under the Advisers Act, and to disclose various information to regulators about the positions, counterparties and other exposures of the hedge funds managed by such managers. 
The Dodd-Frank Act significantly alters the regulation of commodity interests and comprehensively regulates the over-the-counter
derivatives markets for the first time in the U.S. Provisions in the new law include: new registration requirements with the SEC and/or the CFTC, recordkeeping, capital, and margin requirements for swap dealers and major swap
participants as determined by the new law and applicable regulations, and the requirement that certain standardized over-the-counter derivatives be executed in regulated markets and submitted for clearing through regulated clearinghouses.
Over-the-counter derivatives transactions traded through clearinghouses will be subject to margin requirements set by clearinghouses and possibly to additional requirements set by the SEC and/or the CFTC. Regulators also have discretion to set
margin requirements for over-the-counter derivative transactions that do not take place through clearinghouses. Over-the-counter derivatives dealers will be required to post margin to the clearinghouses through which they clear their customer trades
instead of using such margin in their operations as they are currently permitted to do. This will increase the dealers costs and may be passed through to other market participants, such as an Investment Fund, in the form of higher fees or
spreads and less favorable dealer valuations.  The Adviser, on behalf of the Fund, has claimed a temporary exemption from the
definition of the term commodity pool operator (CPO) under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Therefore, neither the Fund nor the Adviser (with respect to the Fund) is currently subject to registration or
regulation as a commodity pool or CPO under the CEA. When the temporary exemption expires, to the extent the Fund is not otherwise eligible to claim an exclusion from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),
the Fund will operate subject to CFTC regulation. If the Adviser and Fund become subject to CFTC regulation, as well as related National Futures Association rules, the Fund may incur additional compliance and other expenses. 
The implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act will occur based on the adoption of various regulations and reports to be prepared by various
agencies over a period of time. It is unknown in what form, when and in what order significant regulatory initiatives may be implemented or the impact any such implemented regulations will have on Investment Funds and/or Investment Managers and, in
turn, the Fund, the markets or instruments in which Investment Funds invest or the counterparties with whom 
  - 56 -




Investment Funds conduct business. The effect of the Dodd-Frank Act or other regulatory change on the Fund and/or Investment Funds, while impossible to predict, could be substantial and adverse.
In addition, the practice of short selling has been the subject of numerous temporary restrictions, and similar restrictions may be promulgated at any time. Such restrictions may adversely affect the returns of Investment Funds that utilize short
selling. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Investment Related Risks  Short Sales. Certain tax risks associated with an investment in the Fund are discussed in Tax Considerations. 
LIMITS OF RISK DISCLOSURES  The above discussions of the various risks associated with the Fund and the Shares are not, and are not intended to be, a complete enumeration or explanation of the risks involved in an investment in the
Fund. Prospective investors should read this entire Prospectus and consult with their own advisors before deciding whether to invest in the Fund. In addition, as the Funds investment program changes or develops over time, an investment in the
Fund may be subject to risk factors not described in this Prospectus. The Fund will update this Prospectus to account for any material changes in the risks involved with an investment in the Fund. 
MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND  General  The Funds Board of Trustees provides broad oversight over
the operations and affairs of the Fund. A majority of the Funds Trustees is comprised of persons who are independent trustees.  EnTrust Partners LLC serves as the Funds investment adviser, subject to the ultimate supervision of, and any policies established by, the Funds Board of Trustees, pursuant to the terms of an
investment advisory agreement with the Fund (the Investment Advisory Agreement).  Under the terms of an Investment
Advisory Agreement, the Adviser allocates the Funds assets and monitors regularly each Investment Fund to determine whether its investment program is consistent with the Funds investment objective and whether its investment performance
and other criteria are satisfactory. The Adviser may reallocate the Funds assets among Investment Funds, terminate its relationship with Investment Funds and select additional Investment Funds, subject in each case to the ultimate supervision
of, and any policies established by, the Board of Trustees.  The Adviser was formed as a limited
liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 21, 1998 and is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser currently serves as an investment adviser of other unregistered private investment
companies, and may in the future serve as an investment adviser of other registered private investment companies. The offices of the Adviser are located at 375 Park Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10152, and its telephone number is (212) 888-1040. The Adviser, together with investment
advisory affiliates EnTrust Capital Inc. and EnTrust Partners Offshore LP and its affiliated broker dealer EnTrust Securities LLC (EnTrust Securities), are referred to collectively in this Registration Statement as EnTrust.
 An affiliate of the Adviser also performs certain administrative and investor services for the Fund pursuant to a Fund
Services Agreement.

administrative services to be provided to the Fund. Among those services are: providing office space and other support services, maintaining and preserving certain records, preparing and filing various materials with state and U.S. federal
regulators, providing legal and regulatory advice in connection with administrative functions and reviewing and arranging for payment of the Funds expenses.  Expenses borne by the Fund (and thus indirectly by Shareholders) include:   


 

 
 all expenses related to its investment program, including, but not limited to, expenses borne indirectly through the Funds investments in the
underlying Investment Funds, including any fees and expenses charged by the Investment Managers of the Investment Funds (including management fees, performance or incentive fees/allocations and redemption or withdrawal fees, however titled or
structured), all costs and expenses directly related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Funds account such as direct and indirect expenses associated with the Funds investments, including its investments in Investment Funds
(whether or not consummated), and enforcing the Funds rights in respect of such investments, transfer taxes and premiums, taxes withheld on non-U.S. dividends, fees for data and software providers, research expenses, professional fees
(including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of consultants, attorneys and experts) and, if applicable, brokerage commissions, interest and commitment fees on loans and debit balances, borrowing charges on securities sold short, dividends
on securities sold but not yet purchased and margin fees;   


 

 
 any non-investment related interest expense;   


 

 
 attorneys fees and disbursements associated with preparing and updating the Funds registration statement and with reviewing potential
investments to be made in Investment Funds;   


 

 
 fees and disbursements of any accountants engaged by the Fund, expenses related to the annual audit of the Fund, and the preparation of the Funds
tax information;   


 

 
 fees paid and out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed to the Administrator; 
 


 

 
 recordkeeping, custody and transfer agency fees and expenses; 
 


 

 
 the costs of errors and omissions/Trustees and officers liability insurance and a fidelity bond; 
 


 

 
 the Management Fee;   


 

 
 the costs of preparing and mailing reports and other communications, including proxy, tender offer correspondence or similar materials, to
Shareholders;   


 

 
 fees of Trustees who are not interested persons and travel expenses of Trustees relating to meetings of the Board of Trustees and
committees thereof;   


 

 
 all costs and charges for equipment or services used in communicating information regarding the Funds transactions among the Adviser and any
custodian or other agent engaged by the Fund; and 
  - 60 -





 

 
 any extraordinary expenses (as defined below), including indemnification expenses as provided for in the Funds organizational documents.
 The Adviser will be reimbursed by the Fund for any of the above expenses that it pays on behalf of the
Fund, except as otherwise provided above.  The Fund expects to incur organizational expenses and initial offering costs of
approximately $[        ]. The Funds offering costs are being capitalized and amortized over the 12 month period beginning on the Initial Closing Date. The Fund will also bear certain ongoing costs
associated with the Funds continuous offering of Shares (mostly printing expenses). Organizational expenses must be expensed as incurred. To achieve a more equitable distribution of the impact of those expenses among the Shareholders, an
amount equal to the organizational expenses incurred by the Fund will be allocated among and credited to or debited against the Shares of all Shareholders based on the percentage that a Shareholders investment in the Fund bears to the total
investments in the Fund by all Shareholders as of the relevant allocation date. An initial allocation of organizational costs will be made as of the first date on which investments in the Fund are made. These allocations will thereafter be adjusted
as of each date during the first 12 months of the Funds operations on which additional investments are made in the Fund by Shareholders. Offering costs cannot be deducted by the Fund or the Shareholders. 
Extraordinary expenses are expenses incurred by the Fund outside of the ordinary course of its business, including, without
limitation, costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or similar proceeding, indemnification expenses, and expenses in connection with holding and/or soliciting proxies for a meeting of
Shareholders.  Investment Funds bear various expenses in connection with their operations similar to those incurred by the
Fund. Investment Managers generally assess asset-based fees to, and receive incentive-based fees from, the Investment Funds (or their investors), which effectively will reduce the investment returns of the Investment Funds. These expenses and fees
will be in addition to those incurred by the Fund itself. As an investor in the Investment Funds, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses and fees of the Investment Funds and will also be subject to incentive fees/allocations to
the Investment Managers.  MANAGEMENT FEE 
In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by the Adviser to the Fund, the Fund pays the Adviser the Management Fee,
monthly, at the rate of 0.125% (1.50% on an annualized basis) of the value of the Funds month end net assets. The Management Fee is an expense paid out of the Funds assets. The Management Fee is computed based on the value of the net
assets of the Fund as of the close of business on the last business day of each month (including any assets in respect of Shares that will be repurchased by the Fund as of the end of the month) and is due and payable in arrears within ten business
days after the end of the month.  ADVISER PAYMENTS 
[The Adviser may pay additional compensation, out of its own funds and not as an additional charge to the Fund, to selected brokers,
dealers or other financial intermediaries (Intermediaries) for the purpose of introducing a RIA to the Fund and/or promoting the recommendation of Shares of the Fund by a RIA. Such payments are made quarterly by the Adviser. The payments
made by the Adviser may be based on the net asset value of the Fund as determined by the Adviser. The amount of these payments is determined from time to time by the Adviser and may be substantial. Such additional compensation to the Intermediary
will not exceed [    ]% of the average net asset value of the outstanding Shares beneficially owned over the applicable quarter ([    ]% on an annualized basis) by clients of the RIA by virtue of the efforts
of such Intermediary.] 
  - 61 -



CALCULATION OF NET ASSET VALUE 
The value of the Funds net assets is determined as of the close of the Funds business at the end of each month in accordance
with the procedures described below or as may be determined from time to time in accordance with the valuation policies and procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees has approved procedures pursuant to which the Fund values
its investments in Investment Funds at fair value, which ordinarily will be the value provided to the Fund by the Investment Funds Investment Managers from time to time, usually monthly. In accordance with these procedures, fair value as of
each month-end ordinarily will be the value determined as of such month-end for each Investment Fund in accordance with the Investment Funds valuation policies and reported at the time of the Funds valuation. Because most Investment
Managers will provide the Fund with their determinations of the month-end net asset value of their Investment Funds after the relevant month-end, the Fund expects to calculate its month-end net asset value and net asset value per Share within 15
business days following the relevant month-end. This information will be available to Shareholders upon request. As a general matter, the fair value of the Funds interest in an Investment Fund will represent the amount that the Fund could
reasonably expect to receive from an Investment Fund if the Funds interest were redeemed at the time of valuation, based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Fund believes to be reliable. In the
event that an Investment Fund does not report a month-end value to the Fund on a timely basis, the Fund would determine the fair value of such Investment Fund based on the most recent final or estimated value reported by the Investment Fund, as well
as any other relevant information available at the time the Fund values its portfolio. Using the nomenclature of the hedge fund industry, any values reported as estimated or final values will reasonably reflect market values
of securities for which market quotations are available or fair value as of the Funds valuation date.  Prior to
investing in any Investment Fund, the Adviser will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the Investment Fund, which as a general matter will utilize market values when available, and otherwise utilize principles of
fair value that the Adviser reasonably believes to be consistent with those used by the Fund for valuing its own investments. In addition, the Fund will only invest in Investment Funds whose portfolios are valued by independent third parties. In
addition, the procedures approved by the Board of Trustees provide that the Adviser will review the valuations provided by the Investment Managers to the Investment Funds. However, neither the Adviser nor the Board of Trustees will be able to
confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by such Investment Managers (which are unaudited). Accordingly, the valuations of the Investment Manager generally will be relied upon by the Fund. 
The Funds valuation procedures require the Adviser to consider all relevant information available at the time the Fund values its
portfolio. The Adviser and/or the Board of Trustees will consider such information, and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by the Investment Manager of an Investment Fund does not represent the fair value of the
Funds interest in the Investment Fund. Although redemptions of investments in Investment Funds are subject to advance notice requirements, Investment Funds will typically make available net asset value information to holders which will
represent the price at which, even in the absence of redemption activity, the Investment Fund would have effected a redemption if any such requests had been timely made or if, in accordance with the terms of the Investment Funds governing
documents, it would be necessary to effect a mandatory redemption. Following procedures adopted by the Board of Trustees, in the absence of specific transaction activity in the investment in a particular Investment Fund, the Fund would consider
whether it was appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances, to value such a position at its net asset value as reported at the time of valuation, or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount

  - 62 -




to net asset value. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and industry practice, the Fund may not always apply a discount in cases where there was no contemporaneous
redemption activity in a particular Investment Fund. In other cases, as when an Investment Fund imposes extraordinary restrictions on redemption, or when there have been no recent transactions in Investment Fund interests, the Fund may determine
that it was appropriate to apply a discount to the net asset value of the Investment Fund. Any such decision would be made in good faith, and subject to the review and supervision of the Board of Trustees. 
The valuations reported by the Investment Managers of the Investment Funds, upon which the Fund calculates its month-end net asset value,
may be subject to later adjustment, based on information reasonably available at that time. For example, fiscal year-end net asset value calculations of the Investment Funds are audited by their independent auditors and may be revised as a result of
such audits. Other adjustments may occur from time to time. Because such adjustments or revisions, whether increasing or decreasing the net asset value of the Fund at the time they occur, relate to information available only at the time of the
adjustment or revision, the adjustments or revisions will not affect the amount of the repurchase proceeds of the Fund received by Shareholders who had their Shares repurchased prior to such adjustments and received their repurchase proceeds. As a
result, to the extent that such subsequently adjusted valuations from the Investment Managers or revisions to net asset value of an Investment Fund adversely affect the Funds net asset value, the outstanding Shares will be adversely affected
by prior repurchases to the benefit of Shareholders who had their Shares repurchased at a net asset value higher than the adjusted amount. Conversely, any increases in the net asset value resulting from such subsequently adjusted valuations will be
entirely for the benefit of the outstanding Shares and to the detriment of Shareholders who previously had their Shares repurchased at a net asset value lower than the adjusted amount. The same principles apply to the purchase of Shares. New
Shareholders may be affected in a similar way.  To the extent the Adviser invests the assets of the Fund in securities or
other instruments that are not investments in Investment Funds, the Fund will generally value such assets as described below.   


 

 
 U.S. exchange listed and NASDAQ traded equity securities (other than options) will be valued at their closing sale prices as reported on the exchange
on which those securities are primarily traded. If no sales of those securities are reported on a particular day, the securities will be valued based upon their composite bid prices for securities held long, or their composite ask prices for
securities held short, as reported by those exchanges. Securities traded on a non-U.S. securities exchange will be valued at their closing sale prices on the exchange on which the securities are primarily traded, or in the absence of a reported sale
on a particular day, at their bid prices (in the case of securities held long) or ask prices (in the case of securities held short) as reported by that exchange. Listed options will be valued at their bid prices (or ask prices in the case of listed
options held short) as reported by the exchange with the highest volume on the last day a trade was reported. Other securities for which market quotations are readily available will be valued at their bid prices (or ask prices in the case of
securities held short) as obtained from one or more dealers making markets for those securities. If market quotations are not readily available, securities and other assets will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by, or under the
supervision of, the Board of Trustees.   


 

 
 Debt securities (other than convertible debt securities) will be valued in accordance with the procedures described above, which with respect to these
securities may include the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service that employs a matrix to determine valuations for normal institutional size trading units. The Board of Trustees will regularly monitor the methodology and procedures used
in connection with valuations provided by the pricing service. Debt securities with remaining maturities of 60 days or less will, absent unusual circumstances, be valued at amortized cost, so long as this method of valuation is determined by the
Board of Trustees to represent fair value. 
  - 63 -





 

 
 If, in the view of the Adviser, the bid price of a listed option or debt security (or ask price in the case of any such security held short) does not
fairly reflect the market value of the security, the Adviser may request a valuation committee to instead adopt procedures to be used by the Adviser, if so delegated by the Board of Trustees and in accordance with procedures adopted by the Board of
Trustees, to value the security at fair value, subject to the oversight of the valuation committee.   


 

 
 All assets and liabilities initially expressed in non-U.S. currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars using non-U.S. exchange rates provided by a
pricing service compiled as of 12:00 noon, New York time. Trading in non-U.S. securities generally is completed, and the values of non-U.S. securities are determined, prior to the close of securities markets in the United States. Non-U.S. exchange
rates are also determined prior to such close. On occasion, the values of non-U.S. securities and exchange rates may be affected by significant events occurring between the time as of which determination of values or exchange rates are made and the
time as of which the net asset value of the Fund is determined. When an event materially affects the values of securities held by the Fund or its liabilities, the securities and liabilities will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith
by, or under the supervision of, the Board of Trustees.  In general, fair value represents a good faith
determination of the current value of an asset (or, with regard to a short sale, a liability) and will be used when there is no public market or possibly no market at all for the asset (or, with regard to a short sale, the liability). The fair
values of one or more assets (or, with regard to short sales, liabilities) may not be the prices at which those assets (or, with regard to short sales, liabilities) are ultimately sold. In such circumstances, the Adviser and/or the Board of Trustees
will reevaluate its fair value methodology to determine, what, if any, adjustments should be made to the methodology. 
Expenses of the Fund, including the Management Fee and the costs of any borrowings, are accrued on a monthly basis on the day net asset
value is calculated and taken into account for the purpose of determining net asset value.  Prospective investors should be
aware that situations involving uncertainties as to the value of portfolio positions could have an adverse effect on the Funds net assets if the judgments of the Board of Trustees, the Adviser, or Investment Managers to the Investment Funds
should prove incorrect. Also, Investment Managers to the Investment Funds will only provide determinations of the net asset value of Investment Funds on a weekly or monthly basis, in which event it will not be possible to determine the net asset
value of the Fund more frequently.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
The Adviser and its affiliates, as well as many of the Investment Managers and their respective affiliates, manage other accounts
(including other funds and accounts in which the Investment Managers may have an interest) other than the Fund and the Investment Funds (collectively, Other Accounts). Other Accounts, together with the Investment Funds, could increase
the level of competition for the same trades, including the priorities of order entry. This could make it difficult or impossible for an Investment Fund to take or liquidate a position in a particular security at a price indicated by an Investment
Managers strategy. 
  - 64 -



In addition, investment professionals associated with Investment Managers may employ
different trading methods, policies and strategies for different funds or accounts. Therefore, the results of an Investment Funds trading may differ from those of the other accounts traded by the same Investment Manager. As the funds under
management by a particular Investment Manager increase, the Investment Manager may have increasing difficulty implementing an investment strategy which may have been successful in the past, or difficulty finding sufficient investment opportunities
which are attractive. Alternatively, an Investment Manager who has been successful may limit the amount of capital it is willing to manage and may decline to accept an additional investment from the Fund. 
There can be no assurances that an Investment Managers future results will be as successful as his or her past performance.
Moreover, even where an Investment Manager has achieved excellent results over an extended period, because of cyclical movements and volatility, period to period results may differ materially. Accordingly, the Adviser believes that an investment in
the Fund is suitable only for those investors who intend to make a long-term investment in the Fund.  The results of the
Funds investment activities may differ significantly from the results achieved by the Adviser and its affiliates or an Investment Manager for their Other Accounts. It is possible that the Adviser or an Investment Manager will achieve
investment results with respect to one or more Other Accounts that are substantially more or less favorable than the results achieved by the Fund. Moreover, it is possible that the Fund will sustain losses during periods in which the Adviser or an
Investment Manager achieves significant profits on their trading with respect to one or more Other Accounts. The opposite result is also possible.  The investment activities of the Adviser or an Investment Manager for Other Accounts may also limit the investment opportunities for the Fund in certain emerging and other markets in which limitations are
imposed upon the amount of investment, in the aggregate or in individual issuers, by related foreign investors.  There may be
circumstances under which the Adviser or an Investment Manager will cause one or more Other Accounts to commit a larger percentage of their assets to an investment opportunity than the percentage of the Funds or an Investment Funds
assets they commit to such investment. There also may be circumstances under which the Adviser or an Investment Manager purchases or sells an investment for their Other Accounts and does not purchase or sell the same investment for the Fund or an
Investment Fund, or purchases or sells an investment for the Fund and does not purchase or sell the same investment for one or more Other Accounts. However, it is the policy of the Adviser, and generally also the policy of the Investment Managers,
that investment decisions for the Fund and Other Accounts be made based on a consideration of their respective investment objectives and policies, and other needs and requirements affecting each account that they manage, and investment transactions
and opportunities be fairly allocated among their clients, including the Fund.  The Adviser, Investment Managers and their
respective affiliates may have interests in Other Accounts they manage which differ from their interests in the Fund and Investment Funds and may manage such accounts on terms that are more favorable to them than the terms on which they manage the
Fund or Investment Funds. In addition, the Adviser and Investment Managers may charge fees to Other Accounts and be entitled to receive performance-based incentive allocations from Other Accounts that are lower than the fees to which the Fund and
its Shareholders are subject.

PURCHASES OF SHARES 
Purchase Terms 
Subsequent to the Initial Closing Date, the Fund will accept initial and additional purchases of Shares as of the first business day of
each calendar month. The investor must submit a completed application form eight business days before the applicable purchase date. All purchases are subject to the receipt of immediately available funds four business days prior to the applicable
purchase date in the full amount of the purchase (to enable the Fund to invest the proceeds in Investment Funds as of the applicable purchase date). An investor who misses one or both of these deadlines will have the effectiveness of its investment
in the Fund delayed until the following month.  Despite having to meet the earlier application and funding deadlines described
above, the Fund does not issue the Shares purchased (and an investor does not become a Shareholder with respect to such Shares) until the applicable purchase date, i.e., the first business day of the relevant calendar month. Consequently, purchase
proceeds do not represent capital of the Fund, and do not become assets of the Fund, until such date.  Any amounts received in
advance of the initial or subsequent purchases of Shares are placed in a non-interest-bearing account with the Transfer Agent (as defined herein) prior to their investment in the Fund, in accordance with Rule 15c2-4 under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended. The Fund reserves the right to reject any purchase of Shares in certain limited circumstances (including, without limitation, when it has reason to believe that a purchase of Shares would be unlawful). Unless otherwise required
by applicable law, any amount received in advance of a purchase ultimately rejected by the Fund will be returned to the prospective investor.  The minimum initial investment in the Fund from each investor is $25,000, and the minimum additional investment in the Fund is $10,000. The minimum initial and additional investments may be reduced by the
Fund with respect to certain individual investors or classes of investors (specifically, with respect to employees, officers or Trustees of the Fund, the Adviser or their affiliates). Additionally, the Fund may waive or reduce such minimum initial
and additional investment amounts (as well as the application and funding deadlines described above) with respect to any investor funding its purchase of Shares with redemption proceeds from another fund sponsored, managed, or advised by the
Adviser. The Fund will notify Shareholders of any changes in the investors that are eligible for such reductions. The Fund may repurchase all of the Shares held by a Shareholder if the Shareholders account balance in the Fund, as a result of
repurchase or transfer requests by the Shareholder, is less than $[        ].  Initial
and any additional purchases of Shares of the Fund by any Shareholder must be made via wire transfer of funds. Payment for each initial or subsequent additional purchases of Shares must be made in one installment. 
To help the U.S. Government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal law requires all financial
institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means to you: When you open an account, we will ask your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to
identify you. If we are unable to verify your identity, we reserve the right to restrict additional transactions and/or liquidate your account at the next calculated net asset value after your account is closed (less any applicable sales/account
charges and/or tax penalties) or take any other action required by law. The Fund has implemented an anti-money laundering compliance program, which includes designation of an anti-money laundering compliance officer. 
  - 66 -



Eligible Investors  Each investor in the Fund will be required to certify to the Fund that the Shares are being acquired for the account of both (i) an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of
Regulation D promulgated under the 1933 Act and (ii) a qualified client as defined in Rule 205-3(d)(1) under the Advisers Act. Investors who are both accredited investors and qualified clients are referred to
in this Prospectus as Eligible Investors. Existing Shareholders who subscribe for additional Shares will be required to qualify as Eligible Investors at the time of each additional purchase. Qualifications that must be met in becoming a
Shareholder are set out in the application form that must be completed by each prospective investor. Any other registered investment adviser (a RIA) who offers Shares may impose additional eligibility requirements on investors who
purchase Shares through such RIA. See Plan of Distribution.  REPURCHASES AND
TRANSFERS OF SHARES  No Right of Redemption  No Shareholder or other person holding Shares acquired from a Shareholder has the right to require the Fund to redeem any Shares. No public market for Shares exists, and none is expected to develop in the
future. Consequently, Shareholders may not be able to liquidate their investment other than as a result of repurchases of Shares by the Fund, as described below.  Repurchases of Shares  The Fund may from time to time repurchase Shares
from Shareholders in accordance with written tenders by Shareholders at those times, in those amounts, and on those terms and conditions as the Board of Trustees may determine in its sole discretion. Each such repurchase offer will generally be
limited to up to 15% of the net assets of the Fund. In determining whether the Fund should offer to repurchase Shares from Shareholders, the Board of Trustees will consider the recommendation of the Adviser. The Adviser expects that, generally, it
will recommend to the Board of Trustees that the Fund offer to repurchase Shares from Shareholders quarterly, with such repurchases to occur as of each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (or, if any such date is not
a business day, as of the immediately preceding business day). Each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately 125 days prior to the applicable repurchase date.  A 3.0% early repurchase fee (Repurchase Fee) will be charged to any Shareholder that tenders its Shares to the Fund prior to the business day immediately preceding the one-year anniversary of
the Shareholders purchase of the respective Shares. The Repurchase Fee would apply separately to each purchase of Shares made by a Shareholder. For example, if a Shareholder purchases Shares in January of year 1 and then purchases
additional interests in December of year 1, such Shareholder would be subject to an early repurchase fee on the additional Shares purchased in December of year 1 until December of year 2. The purpose of the Repurchase Fee is to reimburse the
Fund for the costs incurred in liquidating securities in the Funds portfolio in order to honor the Shareholders repurchase request and to discourage short-term investments which are generally disruptive to the Funds investment
program.  In determining whether to accept a recommendation to conduct a repurchase offer at any such time, the Board of
Trustees will consider the following factors, among others:   


 

 
 whether any Shareholders have requested to tender Shares to the Fund; 
 


 

 
 the liquidity of the Funds assets (including fees and costs associated with redeeming or otherwise withdrawing from Investment Funds);

  - 67 -





 

 
 the investment plans and working capital and reserve requirements of the Fund; 
 


 

 
 the relative economies of scale of the tenders with respect to the size of the Fund; 
 


 

 
 the history of the Fund in repurchasing Shares;   


 

 
 the availability of information as to the value of the Funds Shares in underlying Investment Funds; 
 


 

 
 the existing conditions of the securities markets and the economy generally, as well as political, national or international developments or current
affairs;   


 

 
 any anticipated tax consequences to the Fund of any proposed repurchases of Shares; and 
 


 

 
 the recommendations of the Adviser.  The first offer to repurchase Shares from Shareholders is expected to occur on or about [            ], 201[4]. 
The Fund will repurchase Shares from Shareholders pursuant to written tenders on terms and conditions that the Board of Trustees
determines to be fair to the Fund and to all Shareholders. When the Board of Trustees determines that the Fund will repurchase Shares, notice will be provided to Shareholders describing the terms of the offer, containing information Shareholders
should consider in deciding whether to participate in the repurchase opportunity and containing information on how to participate. Shareholders deciding whether to tender their Shares during the period that a repurchase offer is open may obtain the
Funds net asset value per share by contacting the Adviser during the period. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by Shareholders who tender Shares, the Fund may repurchase a pro rata portion of the Shares tendered by each Shareholder,
extend the repurchase offer, or take any other action with respect to the repurchase offer permitted by applicable law. 
Repurchases of Shares from Shareholders by the Fund will be paid in cash. Repurchases will be effective after receipt and acceptance by
the Fund of eligible written tenders of Shares from Shareholders by the applicable repurchase offer deadline. The Fund does not impose any charges in connection with repurchases of Shares (except for the Repurchase Fee described above). 
Shares will be repurchased by the Fund after the Management Fee has been deducted from the Funds assets as of the end of the month
in which the repurchase occurs  i.e., the accrued Management Fee for the month in which Fund shares are to be repurchased is deducted prior to effecting the relevant repurchase of Fund shares. 
In light of liquidity constraints associated with the Funds investments in Investment Funds and the fact that the Fund may have to
effect redemptions from Investment Funds in order to pay for Shares being repurchased, the Fund expects to employ the following repurchase procedures:   


 

 
 Each repurchase offer will generally commence approximately 125 days prior to the applicable repurchase date. A Shareholder choosing to tender Shares
for repurchase must do so by the applicable deadline, which generally will be 95 days before the date as of which Shares are to be repurchased (the Notice Date). Shares will be valued as of the Valuation Date, which is generally expected
to be March 31, June 30, September 30 or December 31 (or, if such day is not a business day, as of the immediately preceding business day). Tenders will be revocable upon written notice to the Fund up to 85 days prior to the
Valuation Date (such deadline for revocation being the Expiration Date). If a repurchase offer is extended, the Expiration Date will be extended accordingly. 
  - 68 -





 

 
 Promptly after the Expiration Date, the Fund will give to each Shareholder whose Shares have been accepted for repurchase a promissory note (the
Promissory Note) entitling the Shareholder to be paid an amount equal to the value, determined as of the Valuation Date, of the repurchased Shares. The determination of the value of Shares as of the Valuation Date is subject to
adjustment based upon the results of the next annual audit of the Funds financial statements.   


 

 
 The Promissory Note, which will be non-interest bearing and non-transferable, is expected to contain terms providing for payment at two separate times,
as is customary regarding such payments.   


 

 
 The initial payment in respect of the Promissory Note (the Initial Payment) will be in an amount equal to at least 90% of the estimated
value of the repurchased Shares, determined as of the Valuation Date. The Initial Payment will be made as of the later of (1) a period of within 30 days after the Valuation Date, or (2) if the Fund has requested redemptions of its capital
from any Investment Funds in order to fund the repurchase of Shares, within ten business days after the Fund has received at least 90% of the aggregate amount redeemed by the Fund from the Investment Funds. 
 


 

 
 The second and final payment in respect of the Promissory Note (the Post-Audit Payment) is expected to be in an amount equal to the excess,
if any, of (1) the value of the repurchased Shares, determined as of the Valuation Date and based upon the results of the annual audit of the Funds financial statements for the year in which the Valuation Date occurs, over (2) the
Initial Payment. It is anticipated that the annual audit of the Funds financial statements will be completed within 60 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Fund and that the Post-Audit Payment will be made promptly after the
completion of the audit.  If modification of the Funds repurchase procedures as described above is
deemed necessary to comply with regulatory requirements, the Board of Trustees will adopt revised procedures reasonably designed to provide Shareholders substantially the same liquidity for Shares as would be available under the procedures described
above. The Fund is subject to certain Investment Funds initial lock-up periods beginning at the time of the Funds initial investment in an Investment Fund, during which the Fund may not withdraw its investment. In addition, certain
Investment Funds may at times elect to suspend completely or limit withdrawal rights for an indefinite period of time in response to market turmoil or other adverse conditions (such as those experienced by many hedge funds since in 2008/2009).
During such periods, the Fund thus may not be able to liquidate its holdings in such Investment Funds in order to meet repurchase requests. In addition, should the Fund seek to liquidate its investment in an Investment Fund that maintains a side
pocket, the Fund might not be able to fully liquidate its investment without delay, which could be considerable. The Fund may need to suspend or postpone repurchase offers if it is not able to dispose of its interests in Investment Funds in a timely
manner.  Upon its acceptance of tendered Shares for repurchase, the Fund will maintain daily on its books a segregated account
consisting of (1) cash, (2) liquid securities or (3) interests in Investment Funds that the Fund has requested be redeemed (or any combination of them), in an amount equal to the aggregate estimated unpaid dollar amount of the
Promissory Notes issued to Shareholders tendering Shares.  Payment for repurchased Shares may require the Fund to liquidate
portfolio holdings earlier than the Adviser would otherwise have caused these holdings to be liquidated, potentially resulting in losses, 
  - 69 -




and may increase the Funds investment related expenses as a result of higher portfolio turnover rates. The Adviser intends to take measures, subject to policies as may be established by the
Board of Trustees, to attempt to avoid or minimize potential losses and expenses resulting from the repurchase of Shares.  A
Shareholder tendering for repurchase only a portion of the Shareholders Shares will be required to maintain an account balance of at least $25,000 after giving effect to the repurchase. If a Shareholder tenders an amount that would cause the
Shareholders account balance to fall below the required minimum, the Fund reserves the right to repurchase all of a Shareholders Shares at any time if the aggregate value of such Shareholders Shares is, at the time of such
compulsory repurchase, less than the minimum initial investment applicable for the Fund. This right of the Fund to repurchase Shares compulsorily may be a factor which Shareholders may wish to consider when determining the extent of any tender for
purchase by a Fund.  The Fund may also repurchase Shares of a Shareholder without consent or other action by the Shareholder
or other person if the Fund determines that:   


 

 
 the Shares have been transferred or have vested in any person other than by operation of law as the result of the death, bankruptcy, insolvency,
adjudicated incompetence or dissolution of the Shareholder;   


 

 
 ownership of Shares by a Shareholder or other person is likely to cause the Fund to be in violation of, require registration of any Shares under, or
subject the Fund to additional registration or regulation under, the securities, commodities or other laws of the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction; 
 


 

 
 continued ownership of Shares by a Shareholder may be harmful or injurious to the business or reputation of the Fund, the Board of Trustees, the
Adviser or any of their affiliates, or may subject the Fund or any Shareholder to an undue risk of adverse tax or other fiscal or regulatory consequences; 
 


 

 
 any of the representations and warranties made by a Shareholder or other person in connection with the acquisition of Shares was not true when made or
has ceased to be true;   


 

 
 with respect to a Shareholder subject to Special Laws or Regulations, the Shareholder is likely to be subject to additional regulatory or compliance
requirements under these Special Laws or Regulations by virtue of continuing to hold any Shares; or   


 

 
 it would be in the best interests of the Fund for the Fund to repurchase the Shares. 
In the event that the Adviser or any of its affiliates holds Shares in the capacity of a Shareholder, the Shares may be tendered for
repurchase in connection with any repurchase offer made by the Fund.  Transfers of Shares 
Shares may be transferred only:   


 

 
 by operation of law as a result of the death, bankruptcy, insolvency, adjudicated incompetence or dissolution of the Shareholder; or

  - 70 -





 

 
 under certain limited circumstances, with the written consent of the Fund, which may be withheld in its sole discretion and is expected to be granted,
if at all, only under extenuating circumstances.  The Fund generally will not consent to a transfer of
Shares by a Shareholder unless the transfer is to a transferee that represents that it is an Eligible Investor and after the transfer, the value of the Shares held in the account of each of the transferee and transferor is at least $25,000. A
Shareholder transferring Shares may be charged reasonable expenses, including attorneys and accountants fees, incurred by the Fund in connection with the transfer. In connection with any request to transfer Shares, the Fund may require
the Shareholder requesting the transfer to obtain, at the Shareholders expense, an opinion of counsel selected by the Fund as to such matters as the Fund may reasonably request. 
In subscribing for Shares, a Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Fund, the Board of Trustees, the Adviser, each other
Shareholder and any of their affiliates against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and
expenses or any judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement), joint or several, to which those persons may become subject by reason of, or arising from, any transfer made by that Shareholder in violation of these provisions or any
misrepresentation made by that Shareholder or a substituted Shareholder in connection with any such transfer.  
VOTING  Each Shareholder has the right to cast a number of votes equal to the number of Shares held by such
Shareholder at a meeting of Shareholders called by the Funds Board of Trustees. Shareholders will be entitled to vote on any matter on which shareholders of a registered investment company organized as a corporation would be entitled to vote,
including certain elections of a Trustee and approval of the Advisory Agreement, in each case to the extent that voting by shareholders is required by the 1940 Act. Notwithstanding their ability to exercise their voting privileges, Shareholders in
their capacity as such are not entitled to participate in the management or control of the Funds business, and may not act for or bind the Fund.  TAX CONSIDERATIONS  The following is a summary
of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition, holding and disposition of Shares by U.S. Shareholders. This summary is based upon existing U.S. federal income tax law, which is subject to change, possibly with
retroactive effect. This summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation which may be important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstances, including investors subject to special tax rules,
such as U.S. financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations, partnerships, Shareholders who are not United States persons (as defined in the Code), Shareholders liable for the alternative minimum tax, persons
holding Shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities, or investors that have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. This summary
assumes that investors have acquired Shares pursuant to this offering and will hold their Shares as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective Shareholders are urged to
consult their own tax advisors regarding the non-U.S. and U.S. federal, state, and local income and other tax considerations that may be relevant to an investment in the Fund.  In addition to the particular matters set forth in this section, tax-exempt entities should review carefully those sections of this Prospectus and the SAI regarding liquidity and other financial matters
to ascertain whether the investment objectives of the Fund are consistent with their overall investment plans. 
  - 71 -



Taxation of the Fund  The Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company (a RIC) under federal income tax law. If the Fund so qualifies and distributes each year to its shareholders at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income, the Fund will not be required to pay federal income taxes on any income it distributes to shareholders. If the Fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its
capital gain net income, plus any amounts that were not distributed in previous taxable years, then the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the undistributed amounts. 
The Fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax
purposes.  As described below under Investments in Passive Foreign Investment Companies, the Fund expects to be
taxed at ordinary income rates on gains from the Investment Funds.  Distributions to Shareholders 
Shareholders normally will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, and any state and/or local income taxes, on the dividends and other
distributions that they receive from the Fund. As described below under Investments in Passive Foreign Investment Companies, the Fund expects that distributions of both income derived from the Investment Funds as well as gains from the
disposition of the Investment Funds will be taxable to Shareholders at ordinary income rates to the extent of the Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions will generally be taxable to Shareholders as ordinary
income regardless of whether Shareholders receive such payments in cash or reinvest the distributions in the Fund. Distributions by the Fund in excess of the Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a tax-free
return of capital to the extent of (and in reduction of) the Shareholders tax bases in their Shares and any such amount in excess of their bases will be treated as gain from the sale of Shares, as discussed below. 
If the Fund receives distributions of qualified dividend income from the Investment Funds, it could potentially make
distributions to Shareholders that are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains. The Fund does not expect that it will make distributions to Shareholders that are eligible for this reduced rate of taxation. 
Shareholders are generally taxed on any ordinary income dividend or capital gain distributions from the Fund in the year they are
actually distributed. However, if any such dividends or distributions are declared in October, November or December and paid to Shareholders of record of such month in January of the following year, then such amounts will be treated for tax purposes
as having been distributed by the Fund and received by the Shareholders on December 31 of the year prior to the date of payment.  If the Fund receives qualifying dividends from its investments, it could potentially make distributions that are eligible for the 70% dividends received deduction for corporate Shareholders.
The Fund does not expect that it will make distributions to Shareholders that are eligible for this deduction.  The Fund
intends to distribute its ordinary income and capital gains at least once annually.  The Fund will inform Shareholders of the
source and status of each distribution made in a given calendar year promptly after the close of such calendar year. See Distribution Policy. 
  - 72 -



Shareholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States generally will be
subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, or U.S federal withholding tax at such lower rate as prescribed by applicable treaty, on distributions of the Funds income derived from the Investment Funds. Each non-U.S. Shareholder must provide
documentation to the Fund certifying its non-United States status.  Income from Repurchases and Transfers of Shares 
The repurchase or transfer of the Funds Shares may result in a taxable gain or loss to the tendering Shareholder. Different tax
consequences may apply for tendering and non-tendering Shareholders in connection with a repurchase offer. For example, if a Shareholder does not tender all of his or her Shares, such repurchase may not be treated as an exchange for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and may result in deemed distributions to non-tendering Shareholders. On the other hand, Shareholders who tender all of their Shares (including Shares deemed owned by Shareholders under constructive ownership rules) will be
treated as having sold their Shares and generally will realize a capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss is measured by the difference between the Shareholders amount received and his or her adjusted tax basis of the Shares. For non-corporate
Shareholders, gain or loss from the transfer or repurchase of shares generally will be taxable at a U.S. federal income tax rate dependent upon the length of time the Shares were held. Shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such
repurchase or transfer will, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally result in short-term capital gains or losses, and those held for more than one year will generally result in long-term capital gains or losses. 
Investments in Passive Foreign Investment Companies  The Fund intends to purchase interests in Investment Funds organized outside the United States that are treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes and that will generally be treated as passive foreign
investment companies (PFICs). The Fund intends to elect to mark-to-market all shares that it holds in PFICs at the end of each taxable year. By making this election, the Fund will recognize as ordinary income any increase in
the value of such shares as of the close of the taxable year over their adjusted basis and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value unless the loss is required to be deferred. Gains realized with respect to PFICs that the Fund has elected to
mark-to-market will be ordinary income. If the Fund realizes a loss with respect to such a PFIC, whether by virtue of selling the PFIC or because of the mark-to-market adjustment described above, such loss will be ordinary to the extent
of the excess of the sum of the mark-to-market gains over the mark-to-market losses recognized with respect to the PFIC. To the extent that the Funds loss with respect to the PFIC exceeds such limitation, the loss will generally be deferred
until sold, at which point the loss will be treated as a capital loss. Although the Fund may only deduct capital losses in a given taxable year to the extent of capital gains, the Fund may carry forward remaining capital losses for up to 8 years
following the taxable year in which the loss was recognized. However, the Fund does not expect to generate significant capital gains from its investments. By making the mark-to-market election, the Fund may be required to recognize income (which
generally must be distributed to Shareholders) in excess of the distributions that it received from PFICs. Accordingly, the Fund may need to borrow money or dispose of its interests in the Investment Funds in order to make the required
distributions. If the Fund does not make the mark-to-market election or treat the PFIC as a qualified electing fund (QEF), it would be subject to an interest charge (at the rate applicable to tax underpayments) on tax
liability treated as having been deferred with respect to certain distributions and on gain from the disposition of the shares of a PFIC (collectively referred to as excess distributions), even if such excess distributions are paid by
the Fund as a dividend to its Shareholders.  Fund Tax Returns and Tax Information 
The Fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax purposes.

  - 73 -



After the end of each calendar year, Shareholders will be sent information regarding the
amount and character of distributions received from the Fund during the year.  State and Local Taxes 
In addition to the U.S. federal income tax consequences summarized above, prospective investors should consider the potential state and
local tax consequences of an investment in the Fund. The Fund may become subject to income and other taxes in states and localities based on the Funds investments in entities that conduct business in those jurisdictions. Shareholders are
generally taxable in their state of residence on their share of the Funds income. Shareholders may be subject to tax in other jurisdictions depending on the activities of the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests and the laws of those
jurisdictions. Additionally, Shareholders may be entitled to a credit in their state of residence for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding  Information returns generally will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with distributions with respect to the Shares unless Shareholders establish that they are exempt from the
information reporting rules, for example by properly establishing that they are corporations. If Shareholders do not establish that they are exempt from these rules, they generally will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if they fail
to provide their taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to Shareholders will be allowed as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability
and may entitle Shareholders to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.  Other Taxes
 The foregoing is a summary of some of the tax rules and considerations affecting Shareholders and the Funds
operations, and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all relevant tax rules and considerations, nor does it purport to be a complete listing of all potential tax risks inherent in making an investment in the Fund. Non-U.S. investors are
urged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding any proposed investment in the Fund. A Shareholder may be subject to other taxes, including but not limited to, state and local taxes, estate and inheritance taxes, and intangible property taxes
that may be imposed by various jurisdictions. The Fund also may be subject to state, local, and foreign taxes that could reduce cash distributions to Shareholders. It is the responsibility of each Shareholder to file all appropriate tax returns that
may be required. Each prospective Shareholder is urged to consult with his or her tax adviser with respect to any investment in the Fund.  In addition to the particular matters set forth in this section, tax-exempt entities should review carefully those sections of this Prospectus and the SAI regarding liquidity and other financial matters
to ascertain whether the investment objectives of the Fund are consistent with their overall investment plans.  
ERISA CONSIDERATIONS  Persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan, individual retirement
account (IRA), Keogh plan, or other arrangement subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), or the Code (an ERISA Plan) should consider, among other things, the matters
described below before determining whether to invest in the Fund. ERISA imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an ERISA Plan, including prudence, diversification, prohibited transactions,
and other standards. In determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an ERISA Plan, Department of Labor (DOL) regulations 
  - 74 -




provide that a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan must give appropriate consideration to, among other things, the role that the investment plays in the ERISA Plans portfolio, taking into
consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plans purposes, an examination of the risk and return factors, the portfolios composition with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current total
return of the portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the ERISA Plan and the proposed investment in the Fund, the income taxes of the investment, and the projected return of the Fund relative to the ERISA Plans funding
objectives. Before investing the assets of an ERISA Plan in the Fund, an ERISA Plan fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations. If a fiduciary with respect to
any such ERISA Plan breaches his or her responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such ERISA Plan, the fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the ERISA Plan as a result of
such breach. Because the Fund will be registered as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the underlying assets of the Fund will not be considered to be plan assets of the ERISA Plans investing in the Fund for purposes of
ERISAs fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules. Thus, the Adviser will not be a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan that becomes a Shareholder of the Fund, solely as a result of
the ERISA Plans investment in the Fund.  The Board of Trustees will require an ERISA Plan proposing to invest in the
Fund to represent that it, and any fiduciaries responsible for the ERISA Plans investments, are aware of and understand the Funds investment objective, policies, and strategies; that the decision to invest plan assets in the Fund was
made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the ERISA Plan; and that the decision to invest plan assets in the Fund is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to
their investment decisions under ERISA.  Certain prospective ERISA Plan investors may currently maintain relationships with
the Adviser or one or more Investment Managers in which the Fund invests, or with other entities that are affiliated with the Adviser or such investment advisers. Each of such persons may be deemed to be a party in interest to and/or a fiduciary of
any ERISA Plan to which it provides investment management, investment advisory, or other services. ERISA prohibits ERISA Plan assets to be used for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits an ERISA Plan fiduciary from using its position
to cause the ERISA Plan to make an investment from which it or certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration. ERISA Plan investors should consult with legal counsel to determine if
participation in the Fund is a transaction that is prohibited by ERISA or the Code. ERISA Plan fiduciaries will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the Fund was made by them as fiduciaries that are independent of such affiliated
persons, that are duly authorized to make such investment decisions, and that have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons, as a primary basis for the decision to invest in the Fund. 
The provisions of ERISA are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. The discussion of
ERISA contained herein is, of necessity, general and may be affected by future publication of regulations and rulings. Potential investors should consult with their legal advisers regarding the consequences under ERISA of the acquisition and
ownership of Shares.  PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION 
The Fund is offering on a continuous basis through the Distributor $[1,000,000,000] in Shares. Shares will be offered during an initial
public offering period (until the Initial Closing Date) at an initial offering price of $1,000 per share and in a continuous offering at the Funds then current net asset value per Share. Investors purchasing Shares in the Fund will not be
charged a sales load. The Distributor is not obligated to buy any Shares from the Fund. There is no minimum aggregate amount of Shares required to be purchased in the offering. No arrangements have been made to place funds received in connection
with the Shares offering in an escrow, trust or similar arrangement other than the account with the Transfer Agent as set forth below. [The Distributor is an affiliate of the Adviser.] 
  - 75 -



Shares may be purchased only from the Distributor or through a RIA that has entered into an
arrangement with the Distributor for such RIA to offer Shares in conjunction with a wrap fee, asset allocation or other managed asset program sponsored by such RIA. To make an investment in the Fund through the Distributor, a prospective
investor must open a brokerage account (an Account) with the Distributor. Shares are not available in certificated form.  Generally, the minimum required initial purchase by each investor is $25,000. Once a prospective investors order is received, a confirmation will be sent to the investor. The investors Account
will be debited for the purchase amount, which will be deposited into an account with [                    ], as the Funds transfer agent (the
Transfer Agent). See Purchases of Shares  Purchase Terms.  The Initial Closing Date for
subscriptions for Shares is currently anticipated to be on or about [            ], 2013. Subsequent to the Initial Closing Date, Shares may be purchased as of the first business day of
each month from the Distributor at the Funds then current net asset value per Share. See Purchases of Shares. 
DISTRIBUTION POLICY  Dividends will generally be paid at least annually on the Shares in amounts representing substantially all of the net investment income, if any, earned each year. Payments will vary in amount, depending
on investment income received and expenses of operation. It is likely that many of the Investment Funds in whose securities the Fund invests will not pay any dividends, and this, together with the Funds relatively high expenses, means that
there can be no assurance the Fund will have substantial income or pay dividends. The Fund is not a suitable investment for any investor who requires regular dividend income.  It is anticipated that any gains or appreciation in the Funds investments will be treated as ordinary income. Such amounts will generally be distributed at least annually and such distributions
would be taxed as ordinary income dividends to Shareholders that are subject to tax.  It is anticipated that substantially all
of any taxable net capital gain realized on investments will be paid to Shareholders at least annually. The net asset value of each Share that you own will be reduced by the amount of the distributions or dividends that you receive from that Share.
 Automatic Dividend Reinvestment Plan  Pursuant to the dividend reinvestment plan established by the Fund (the DRIP), each Shareholder whose Shares are registered in its own name will automatically be a participant under the DRIP
and have all income dividends and/or capital gains distributions automatically reinvested in additional Shares unless such Shareholder specifically elects to receive all income dividends and/or capital gain distributions in cash. A Shareholder is
free to change this election at any time. If, however, a Shareholder requests to change its election within 45 days prior to a distribution, the request will be effective only with respect to distributions after the 45 day period. A Shareholder
whose Shares are registered in the name of a nominee must contact the nominee regarding its status under the DRIP, including whether such nominee will participate on such Shareholders behalf. 
A Shareholder may elect to:   


 

 
 reinvest both dividends and capital gain distributions; 
  - 76 -





 

 
 receive dividends in cash and reinvest capital gain distributions; or 
 


 

 
 receive both dividends and capital gain distributions in cash. 
Generally, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Shareholders receiving Shares under the DRIP will be treated as having received a
distribution equal to the amount payable to them in cash as a distribution had the Shareholder not participated in the DRIP. 
Shares will be issued pursuant to the DRIP at their net asset value determined on the next valuation date following the ex-dividend date
(the last date of a dividend period on which an investor can purchase Shares and still be entitled to receive the dividend). There is no sales load or other charge for reinvestment. A request must be received by the Fund before the record date to be
effective for that dividend or capital gain distribution. The Fund may terminate the DRIP at any time. Any expenses of the DRIP will be borne by the Fund.  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE FUND  Each
Fund Share represents a proportional interest in the assets of the Fund. Each Fund Share has one vote at Shareholder meetings, with fractional Shares voting proportionally, on matters submitted to the vote of Shareholders. There are no cumulative
voting rights. Fund Shares do not have pre-emptive or conversion or redemption provisions. In the event of a liquidation of the Fund, Shareholders are entitled to share pro rata in the net assets of the Fund available for distribution to
Shareholders after all expenses and debts have been paid.  INQUIRIES

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES 
The Fund is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company. The Fund was organized as a Delaware statutory trust on
April 12, 2013 and commenced operations on [            ], 2013. The Fund is managed by EnTrust Partners LLC (the Adviser). The investment objective and principal
investment strategies of the Fund, as well as the principal risks associated with the Funds investment strategies, are set forth in the prospectus. Certain additional investment information is set forth below. 
Fundamental Policies  The Funds stated fundamental policies, which may only be changed by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund (Shares), are listed below. As
defined by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the 1940 Act), the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund means the vote, at an annual or special meeting of the Funds shareholders duly
called, (a) of 66- 2/3% or more of the voting securities present at such meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund are present or represented by proxy; or (b) of more than
50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund, whichever is less. The Fund may not:   


(1)
invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets in the securities, other than U.S. Government securities, of issuers engaged in any single industry (for purposes of
this restriction, the Funds investments in Investment Funds (as hereinafter defined) are not deemed to be investments in a single industry).   


(2)
borrow money, except to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act (which currently limits borrowing to no more than 33-1/3% of the value of the Funds total
assets).   


(3)
issue senior securities, except to the extent permitted by Section 18 of the 1940 Act (which currently limits the issuance of a class of senior securities
that is indebtedness to no more than 33-1/3% of the value of the Funds total assets or, if the class of senior security is stock, to no more than 50% of the value of the Funds total assets). 
 


(4)
underwrite securities of other issuers, except insofar as the Fund may be deemed an underwriter under the 1933 Act in connection with the disposition of its
portfolio securities.   


(5)
make loans of money or securities to other persons, except through purchasing fixed income securities, lending portfolio securities or entering into repurchase
agreements.   


(6)
purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts, except that it may purchase and sell non-U.S. currency, options, futures and forward contracts, including those
related to indices, and options on indices, and may invest in commodity pools and other entities that purchase and sell commodities and commodity contracts. 
 


(7)
purchase, hold or deal in real estate, except that it may invest in securities that are secured by real estate or that are issued by companies or Investment Funds that
invest or deal in real estate.  With respect to these investment restrictions and other policies described in
this SAI or the prospectus (except the Funds policy on borrowings set forth above), if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of an investment or transaction, a later change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of
investments or the value of the Funds total assets, unless otherwise stated, will not constitute a violation of such restriction or policy. The Funds investment policies and restrictions do not apply to the activities and transactions of
Investment Funds (as defined below) in which assets of the Fund are invested. 
  1 


The Funds investment objective is fundamental and may not be changed without the vote
of a majority of the Funds outstanding voting securities (as defined by the 1940 Act).  Certain Portfolio Securities and Other
Operating Policies  As discussed in the prospectus, the Fund invests substantially all of its assets in private investment
funds (Investment Funds) managed by a range of alternative asset managers (Investment Managers) that employ a variety of investment strategies, including, but not limited to, hedging, distressed securities, event-driven and
relative value/arbitrage and special situations. Additional information regarding the types of securities and financial instruments in which Investment Managers may invest the assets of the Investment Funds, and certain of the investment techniques
that may be used by Investment Managers, are set forth below.  Equity Securities 
The investment portfolios of Investment Funds may include long and short positions in common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible
securities of U.S. and foreign issuers. The value of equity securities depends on business, economic and other factors affecting those issuers. Equity securities fluctuate in value, often based on factors unrelated to the value of the issuer of the
securities, and such fluctuations can be pronounced.  Investment Managers may generally invest the assets of Investment Funds
in equity securities without restriction. These investments may include securities issued by companies having relatively small market capitalization, including micro cap companies. The prices of the securities of smaller companies may be
subject to more abrupt or erratic market movements than larger, more established companies, because these securities typically are traded in lower volume and the issuers typically are more subject to changes in earnings and prospects. These
securities are also subject to other risks that are less prominent in the case of the securities of larger companies.  Growth Investing
 Certain Investment Funds invest in growth stocks. Securities of growth companies may be more volatile since
such companies usually invest a high portion of earnings in their business, and they may lack the dividends of value stocks that can cushion stock prices in a falling market. In addition, earnings disappointments often lead to sharply falling prices
because investors buy growth stocks in anticipation of superior earnings growth.  Value Investing 
Certain Investment Funds invest in value stocks. An Investment Manager to an Investment Fund may be wrong in its assessment of
a companys value and the stocks the Investment Fund holds may not reach what the Investment Manager believes are their full values. A particular risk of an Investment Funds value approach is that some holdings may not recover and provide
the capital growth anticipated or a stock judged to be undervalued may actually be appropriately priced. Further, because the prices of value-oriented securities tend to correlate more closely with economic cycles than growth-oriented securities,
they generally are more sensitive to changing economic conditions, such as changes in interest rates, corporate earnings, and industrial production. The market may not favor value-oriented stocks and may not favor equities at all. During those
periods, the Investment Funds relative performance may suffer.

Event-Driven Investing  Event-driven strategies analyze various transactions in order to predict a likely outcome and commit capital in a way that benefits from that outcome. Event-driven strategies are broad in scope and employ
a diverse set of securities including common and preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, stubs and derivatives. Appreciation in the value of such securities may be contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, such as a successful
reorganization or merger. If the expected event does not occur, the Investment Fund may incur a loss on the investments. There can be no assurance that any expected transaction will take place. Certain transactions are dependent on one or more
factors to become effective, such as market conditions which may lead to unexpected positive or negative changes in a company profile, shareholder approval, regulatory and various other third party constraints, changes in earnings or business lines
or shareholder activism as well as many other factors. No assurance can be given that the transactions entered into will result in a profitable investment for the Investment Funds or that the Investment Funds will not incur substantial losses.
 Fixed Income Securities  Investment Funds may invest in fixed income securities. Fixed income securities include bonds, notes and debentures issued by U.S. and foreign corporations and governments. These securities may pay fixed,
variable or floating rates of interest, and may include zero coupon obligations. Fixed income securities are subject to the risk of the issuers inability to meet principal and interest payments on its obligations (i.e., credit risk) and are
subject to the risk of price volatility due to such factors as interest rate sensitivity, market perception of the creditworthiness or financial condition of the issuer and general market liquidity (i.e., market risk). Certain portfolio securities,
such as those with interest rates that fluctuate directly or indirectly based on multiples of a stated index, are designed to be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and can subject the holders thereof to significant reductions of yield and
possible loss of principal.  Investment Funds may invest in both investment grade and non-investment grade debt securities.
Investment grade debt securities are securities that have received a rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization (a Rating Agency) of one of the four highest rating categories or, if not rated by any
Rating Agency, have been determined by an Investment Manager to be of comparable quality.  An Investment Funds
investments in non-investment grade debt securities, including convertible debt securities, are considered by the Rating Agencies to be predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.
Non-investment grade securities in the lowest rating categories may involve a substantial risk of default or may be in default. Adverse changes in economic conditions or developments regarding the individual issuer are more likely to cause price
volatility and weaken the capacity of the issuers of non-investment grade securities to make principal and interest payments than is the case for higher grade securities. In addition, the market for lower grade securities may be thinner and less
liquid than the market for higher grade securities. For a description of the ratings of the Rating Agencies, see Annex B to this SAI. 
Securities and Other Obligations of Financially Distressed Companies  An Investment Fund may purchase securities and other obligations of foreign and domestic companies that are experiencing significant financial or business distress, including companies involved

  3 



in bankruptcy, or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings. These issuers may be in weak financial condition, experiencing poor operating results, having substantial capital needs or a
negative net worth, or facing special competitive or product obsolescence problems. Investments of this type may involve substantial financial and business risks that can result in substantial, or at times even total, losses. Under such
circumstances, the returns generated from the Investment Funds investments may not compensate the Investment Fund adequately for the risks assumed.  Acquired investments may include senior or subordinated debt securities, bank loans, promissory notes and other evidences of indebtedness, as well as payables to trade creditors. Although such purchases
may result in significant returns to the Investment Fund, they involve a substantial degree of risk and may not show any return for a considerable period of time. In fact, many of these securities and investments ordinarily remain unpaid while the
company is in bankruptcy and may not ultimately be paid unless and until the company reorganizes and/or emerges from bankruptcy proceedings. As a result, such securities may have to be held for an extended period of time. The level of analytical
sophistication, both financial and legal, necessary for successful investment in companies experiencing significant business and financial distress is high. There is no assurance that the Investment Managers will correctly evaluate the nature and
magnitude of the various factors that could affect the prospects for a successful reorganization or similar action. In any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a company in which an Investment Fund invests, the Investment Fund may
lose its entire investment or may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than the Investment Funds original investment. Under such circumstances, the returns generated from the Investment Funds investments may not
compensate the Investment Fund adequately for the risks assumed.  Mortgage-Backed Securities. 
Investment Funds may invest in mortgage-backed securities. The investment characteristics of mortgage-backed securities differ from those
of traditional debt securities. Among the major differences are that interest and principal payments on mortgage-backed securities are made more frequently, usually monthly, and that principal may be prepaid at any time because the underlying loans
or other assets generally may be prepaid at any time. The adverse effects of prepayments may indirectly affect the Fund in two ways. First, particular investments may experience outright losses, as in the case of an interest-only security in an
environment of faster than expected actual or anticipated prepayments. Second, particular investments may underperform relative to hedges that the Investment Funds may have entered into for these investments, resulting in a loss to the Investment
Fund. In particular, prepayments (at par) may limit the potential upside of many mortgage-backed securities to their principal or par amounts, whereas their corresponding hedges often have the potential for large losses. 
The Investment Funds may also invest in structured notes, variable rate mortgage-backed securities, including adjustable-rate mortgage
securities (ARMs), which are backed by mortgages with variable rates, and certain classes of collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) derivatives, the rate of interest payable under which varies with a designated rate or
index. The value of these investments is closely tied to the absolute levels of such rates or indices, or the markets perception of anticipated changes in those rates or indices. This introduces additional risk factors related to the movements
in specific indices or interest rates that may be difficult or impossible to hedge, and which also interact in a complex fashion with prepayment risks.  Mortgage-backed securities are also subject to the risk of delinquencies on mortgage loans underlying such securities. An unexpectedly high rate of defaults on the mortgages held by a mortgage pool may
adversely affect the value of a mortgage-backed security and could result in losses to an Investment Fund. So-called subprime mortgages (mortgage loans made to borrowers with weakened credit histories or with a lower capacity to make
timely payments on their mortgages) have experienced 
  4 



higher rates of delinquency, and such delinquencies have increased dramatically since 2007. These increased mortgage delinquencies have adversely impacted the market for mortgage-backed
securities generally (including derivatives or other instruments linked to the value of such securities) and led to turmoil in the credit markets generally. In particular, holders of mortgage-backed securities have experienced great difficulty in
valuing such securities in light of the dramatically reduced market for mortgage-backed securities. See Types of Investments and Related Risks  Risks of Fund of Hedge Funds Structure  Valuation in the prospectus. 
Asset Backed Securities. 
The Investment Funds in which the Fund invests may invest in asset-backed securities (ABS), such as residential
mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations, or synthetic securities with respect to which the reference obligations are ABS (including credit default swap transactions (CDS
Transactions)). ABS are securities that entitle the holders thereof to receive payments that depend primarily on the cash flow from, among others, (a) a specified pool of financial assets, either a fixed pool or a revolving pool, that by
their terms convert into cash within a finite time period, together with rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the holders of such securities or (b) real estate mortgage loans, either a
fixed pool or a revolving pool, together with rights or other assets designed to assure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to holders of such securities. ABS backed by real estate mortgage loans do not entitle the holders thereof to
share in the appreciation in value of or in the profits generated by the related real estate assets.  ABS include but are not
limited to securities for which the underlying collateral consists of assets such as home equity loans, leases, residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, auto finance receivables, credit card receivables and other debt obligations.
Sponsors of issuers of ABS are primarily banks and finance companies, captive finance subsidiaries of non-financial corporations or specialized originators such as credit card lenders. 
ABS carry coupons that can be fixed or floating. The spread will vary depending on the credit quality of the underlying collateral, the
degree and nature of credit enhancement and the degree of variability in the cash flows emanating from the securitized assets. In the event that spreads on ABS widen after acquisition by an underlying hedge fund or portfolio manager, the market
value of such ABS is likely to decline and, in the case of a substantial spread widening, could decline by a substantial amount.  Holders of ABS bear various risks, including credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, market risk, operations risk, structural risk and legal risk. The structure of an ABS and the terms of the
investors interest in the collateral can vary widely depending on the type of collateral, the desires of investors and the use of credit enhancements. Although the basic elements of all ABS are similar, individual transactions can differ
markedly in both structure and execution. Important determinants of the risk associated with issuing or holding the securities include the process by which principal and interest payments are allocated and distributed to investors, how credit losses
affect the issuing vehicle and the return to investors in such ABS, whether collateral represents a fixed set of specific assets or accounts, whether the underlying collateral assets are revolving or closed-end, under what terms (including maturity
of the asset-backed instrument) any remaining balance in the accounts may revert to the issuing entity and the extent to which the entity that is the actual source of the collateral assets is obligated to provide support to the issuing vehicle or to
the investors in such ABS.  All or most of the ABS that an Investment Fund may invest in are subordinate in right of payment
and rank junior to other securities that are secured by or represent an ownership interest in the same pool 
  5 



of assets. In addition, many of the transactions have structural features that divert payments of interest and/or principal to more senior classes when the delinquency or loss experience of the
pool exceeds certain levels. As a result, such securities have a higher risk of loss as a result of delinquencies or losses on the underlying assets. In certain circumstances, payments of interest may be reduced or eliminated for one or more payment
dates. Additionally, as a result of cash flow being diverted to payments of principal on more senior classes, the average life of such securities may lengthen. Subordinate ABS generally do not have the right to call a default or vote on remedies
following a default unless more senior securities have been paid in full. As a result, a shortfall in payments to subordinate investors in ABS will generally not result in a default being declared on the transaction, and the transaction will not be
restructured or unwound. Furthermore, because subordinate ABS may represent a relatively small percentage of the size of the asset pool being securitized, the impact of a relatively small loss on the overall pool may be substantially on the holders
of such subordinate security.  Often ABS are structured to reallocate the risks entailed in the underlying collateral
(particularly credit risk) into security tranches that match the desires of investors. For example, senior subordinated security structures give holders of senior tranches greater credit risk protection (albeit at lower yields) than holders of
subordinated tranches. Under this structure, at least two classes of ABS are issued, with the senior class having a priority claim on the cash flows from the underlying pool of assets. The subordinated class must absorb credit losses on the
collateral before losses can be allocated to the senior portion. Because the senior class has this priority claim, cash flows from the underlying pool of assets must first satisfy the requirements of the senior class. Only after these requirements
have been satisfied will the cash flows be directed to service the subordinated class.  Investment Funds may also enter into
CDS Transactions with respect to which the reference obligations are ABS that are subordinate in right of payment and rank junior to other securities that are secured by or represent an ownership interest in the same pool of assets. In addition,
many of the ABS that an underlying hedge fund or portfolio manager may invest in may have been issued in transactions that have structural features that divert payments of interest and/or principal to more senior classes when the delinquency or loss
experience of the pool exceeds certain levels. As a result, such securities have a higher risk of loss as a result of delinquencies or losses on the underlying assets. In certain circumstances, payments of interest may be reduced or eliminated for
one or more payment dates. Additionally, as a result of cash flow being diverted to payments of principal on more senior classes, the average life of such securities may lengthen. For example, in the case of certain ABS type residential securities,
no distributions of principal will generally be made with respect to any class until the aggregate principal balances of the more senior classes of securities have been reduced to zero. Subordinate ABS generally do not have the right to call a
default or vote on remedies following a default unless more senior securities have been paid in full. As a result, a shortfall in payments to subordinate investors in ABS will generally not result in a default being declared on the transaction and
the transaction will not be restructured or unwound. Furthermore, because subordinate ABS may represent a relatively small percentage of the size of the asset pool being securitized, the impact of a relatively small loss on the overall pool may
disproportionately affect the holders of such subordinate security.  Commodities 
Certain Investment Funds may invest directly in commodities, rather than gaining exposure to commodities markets by investing in futures
contracts. Unlike financial instruments, there are costs of physical storage associated with purchasing a commodity, which would not be associated with a futures contract for the same commodity. These storage costs include the time value of money
invested in the physical commodity plus the actual costs of storing the commodity less any benefits from ownership of the physical commodity that are not obtained by the holder of a futures contract (this is sometimes referred to as the
convenience yield). To the extent that these storage costs change for a commodity while the Investment Fund has invested directly in that commodity, the value of the Investment Funds investment in that commodity may change
accordingly. 
  6 


In addition, the values of commodities are subject to additional variables which may be less
significant to the values of traditional securities such as stocks and bonds. Variables such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes and tariffs may have a larger impact on commodity prices. These additional variables may create
additional investment risks which subject the Investment Fund investments to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. 
Energy/Natural Resources Investing  The production and marketing of commodities, energy and natural resources may be affected by actions and changes in governments. Securities of such companies may be subject to broad price fluctuations,
reflecting volatility of energy and basic materials prices and possible instability of supply of various hard assets, as well as changes in demand due to international economic conditions. In addition, some such companies also may be subject to the
risks of mining and oil drilling, and the risks of other hazards, such as fire, drought, and increased regulatory and environmental costs. 
Real Estate  Investing
in real estate, including real estate investment trusts (REITs) may subject an Investment Fund to risks associated with the ownership of real estate, including terrorist attacks, war or other acts that destroy real property (in addition
to securities market risks). Some REITs may invest in a limited number of properties, in a narrow geographic area, or in a single property type, which increases the risk that an Investment Fund could be unfavorably affected by the poor performance
of a single investment or investment type. These companies are also sensitive to factors such as changes in real estate values and property taxes, interest rates, cash flow of underlying real estate assets, supply and demand, and the management
skill and creditworthiness of the issuer. Borrowers could default on or sell investments the REIT holds, which could reduce the cash flow needed to make distributions to investors. In addition, REITs also may be affected by tax and regulatory
requirements in that a REIT may not qualify for preferential tax treatments or exemptions. REITs require specialized management and pay management expenses. Securities issued by private partnerships in real estate may be more illiquid than
securities issued by other Investment Funds generally, because the partnerships underlying real estate investments may tend to be less liquid than other types of investments.  Non-U.S. Securities  Investment Funds may invest in equity securities of
non-U.S. issuers and in depositary receipts, such as American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), that represent an indirect interest in securities of non-U.S. issuers. Non-U.S. securities in which Investment Funds invest may be listed on
non-U.S. securities exchanges or traded in non-U.S. over-the-counter markets or may be purchased in private placements and not be publicly traded. Investments in non-U.S. securities are affected by risk factors generally not thought to be present in
the U.S. These factors are listed in the prospectus under Types of Investments and Related RisksInvestment Related RisksNon-U.S. Investments.  As a general matter, Investment Funds are not required to hedge against non-U.S. currency risks, including the risk of changing currency exchange rates, which could reduce the value of non-U.S. currency
denominated portfolio securities irrespective of the underlying investment. However, from time to time, an Investment Fund may enter into forward currency exchange contracts (forward contracts) for hedging purposes or non-hedging
purposes to pursue its investment objective. Forward contracts are transactions involving the Investment Funds obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future 
  7 



date at a specified price. Forward contracts may be used by the Investment Fund for hedging purposes to protect against uncertainty in the level of future non-U.S. currency exchange rates, such
as when the Investment Fund anticipates purchasing or selling a non-U.S. security. This technique would allow the Investment Fund to lock in the U.S. dollar price of the security. Forward contracts also may be used to attempt to protect
the value of the Investment Funds existing holdings of non-U.S. securities. There may be, however, imperfect correlation between the Investment Funds non-U.S. securities holdings and the forward contracts entered into with respect to
such holdings. Forward contracts also may be used for non-hedging purposes to pursue the Investment Funds investment objective, such as when an Investment Manager anticipates that particular non-U.S. currencies will appreciate or depreciate in
value, even though securities denominated in such currencies are not then held in the Investment Funds investment portfolio.  Money
Market Instruments  The Fund and Investment Funds may invest, for defensive purposes or otherwise, some or all of their
assets in high quality fixed income securities, money market instruments and money market mutual funds, or may hold cash or cash equivalents in such amounts as the Adviser or Investment Managers deem appropriate under the circumstances. The Fund or
Investment Funds also may invest in these instruments pending allocation of their respective offering proceeds. Money market instruments are high quality, short-term fixed income obligations, which generally have remaining maturities of one year or
less, and may include U.S. Government Securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances issued by domestic branches of United States banks that are members of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and
repurchase agreements.  Repurchase Agreements  The Fund and the Investment Funds may enter into repurchase agreements to a limited extent. Repurchase agreements are agreements under which the Fund or an Investment Fund purchases securities from a bank
that is a member of the Federal Reserve System, a foreign bank or a securities dealer that agrees to repurchase the securities from the Fund or Investment Fund at a higher price on a designated future date. If the seller under a repurchase agreement
becomes insolvent or otherwise fails to repurchase the securities, the Fund or Investment Fund would have the right to sell the securities. This right, however, may be restricted, or the value of the securities may decline before the securities can
be liquidated. In the event of the commencement of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings with respect to the seller of the securities before the repurchase of the securities under a repurchase agreement is accomplished, the Fund or Investment Fund
might encounter a delay and incur costs, including a decline in the value of the securities, before being able to sell the securities. Repurchase agreements that are subject to foreign law may not enjoy protections comparable to those provided to
certain repurchase agreements under U.S. bankruptcy law, and they therefore may involve greater risks. The Fund has adopted specific policies designed to minimize certain of the risks of loss from its use of repurchase agreements. 
Reverse Repurchase Agreements  The Fund and the Investment Funds may enter into reverse repurchase agreements to a limited extent. Reverse repurchase agreements involve the sale of a security to a bank or securities dealer and the
simultaneous agreement to repurchase the security for a fixed price, reflecting a market rate of interest, on a specific date. These transactions involve a risk that the other party to a reverse repurchase agreement will be unable or unwilling to
complete the transaction as scheduled, which may result in losses to the Fund or an Investment Fund. Reverse repurchase agreements are a form of leverage which also may increase the volatility of the Funds or an Investment Funds
investment portfolio. The Fund will segregate permissible liquid assets at least equal to the aggregate amount of its reverse repurchase obligations, plus accrued interest. 
  8 


Special Investment Techniques 
Investment Funds may use a variety of special investment techniques to hedge a portion of their investment portfolios against various
risks or other factors that generally affect the values of securities. They may also use these techniques for non-hedging purposes in pursuing their investment objectives. These techniques may involve the use of derivative transactions. The
techniques Investment Funds may employ may change over time as new instruments and techniques are introduced or as a result of regulatory developments. Certain of the special investment techniques that Investment Funds may use are speculative and
involve a high degree of risk, particularly when used for non-hedging purposes. It is possible that any hedging transaction may not perform as anticipated and that an Investment Fund may suffer losses as a result of its hedging activities.
 Derivatives. Investment Funds may engage in transactions involving options, futures, forwards and other
derivative financial instruments. Derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risk, depending upon the characteristics of the particular derivative and the portfolio as a whole. Derivatives permit Investment Funds to
increase or decrease the level of risk, or change the character of the risk, to which their portfolios are exposed in much the same way as they can increase or decrease the level of risk, or change the character of the risk, of their portfolios by
making investments in specific securities.  Derivatives may entail investment exposures that are greater than their cost would
suggest, meaning that a small investment in derivatives could have a large potential impact on an Investment Funds performance.  If an Investment Fund invests in derivatives at inopportune times or judges market conditions incorrectly, such investments may lower the Investment Funds return or result in a loss. An Investment
Fund also could experience losses if its derivatives were poorly correlated with its other investments, or if the Investment Fund were unable to liquidate its position because of an illiquid secondary market. The market for many derivatives is, or
suddenly can become, illiquid. Changes in liquidity may result in significant, rapid and unpredictable changes in the prices for derivatives.  With respect to derivatives involving high yield and other debt securities, an Investment Fund or the Fund will usually have a contractual relationship only with the counterparty of the derivative, and
not with the issuer of the indebtedness. An Investment Fund generally will have no right to directly enforce compliance by the issuer with the terms of a derivative, nor any rights of set-off against the issuer, nor have any voting rights with
respect to the indebtedness. An Investment Fund will not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the underlying indebtedness and will not have the benefit of the remedies that would normally be available to a holder of the indebtedness. In
addition, in the event of the insolvency of the counterparty to the derivative, the Investment Fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty, and will not have any claim with respect to the underlying indebtedness. Consequently,
the Investment Fund will be subject to the credit risk of the counterparty as well as that of the issuer of the indebtedness. As a result, concentrations of such derivatives in any one counterparty subject the Investment Fund and/or the Fund to an
additional degree of risk with respect to defaults by such counterparty as well as by the issuer of the underlying indebtedness.  Options and Futures. The Investment Funds may utilize options and futures contracts. They also may use so-called synthetic options (notional principal contracts with
characteristics of an OTC option) or other derivative instruments written by broker-dealers or other permissible financial 
  9 



intermediaries. Such transactions may be effected on securities exchanges, in the over-the-counter market or negotiated directly with counterparties. When such transactions are purchased
over-the-counter or negotiated directly with counterparties, an Investment Fund bears the risk that the counterparty will be unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under the option contract. Such transactions may also be illiquid and, in
such cases, an Investment Fund may have difficulty closing out its position. Over-the-counter options and synthetic transactions purchased and sold by Investment Funds may include options on baskets of specific securities. 
The Investment Funds may purchase call and put options on specific securities, and may write and sell covered or uncovered call and put
options for hedging purposes and non-hedging purposes to pursue their investment objectives. A put option gives the purchaser of the option the right to sell, and obligates the writer to buy, the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any
time prior to the expiration of the option. Similarly, a call option gives the purchaser of the option the right to buy, and obligates the writer to sell, the underlying security at a stated exercise price at any time prior to the expiration of the
option. A covered call option is a call option with respect to which an Investment Fund owns the underlying security. The sale of such an option exposes an Investment Fund during the term of the option to possible loss of opportunity to realize
appreciation in the market price of the underlying security or to possible continued holding of a security that might otherwise have been sold to protect against depreciation in the market price of the security. A covered put option is a put option
with respect to which cash or liquid securities have been placed in a segregated account on an Investment Funds books. The sale of such an option exposes the seller during the term of the option to a decline in price of the underlying security
while also depriving the seller of the opportunity to invest the segregated assets. Options sold by the Investment Funds need not be covered.  An Investment Fund may close out a position when writing options by purchasing an option on the same security with the same exercise price and expiration date as the option that it has previously written
on the security. The Investment Fund will realize a profit or loss if the amount paid to purchase an option is less or more, as the case may be, than the amount received from the sale thereof. To close out a position as a purchaser of an option, an
Investment Manager would ordinarily effect a similar closing sale transaction, which involves liquidating the position by selling the option previously purchased, although the Investment Fund could exercise the option should it deem it
advantageous to do so.  The Adviser, on behalf of the Fund, has claimed a temporary exemption from the definition of the term
commodity pool operator (CPO) under the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Therefore, neither the Fund nor the Adviser (with respect to the Fund) is currently subject to registration or regulation as a commodity
pool or CPO under the CEA. When the temporary exemption expires, to the extent the Fund is not otherwise eligible to claim an exclusion from regulation by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Fund will operate
subject to CFTC regulation. If the Adviser and Fund become subject to CFTC regulation, as well as related National Futures Association rules, the Fund may incur additional compliance and other expenses. 
Investment Funds may enter into futures contracts in U.S. domestic markets or on exchanges located outside the United States. Foreign
markets may offer advantages such as trading opportunities or arbitrage possibilities not available in the United States. Foreign markets, however, may have greater risk potential than domestic markets. For example, some foreign exchanges are
principal markets so that no common clearing facility exists and an investor may look only to the broker for performance of the contract. In addition, any profits that might be realized in trading could be eliminated by adverse changes in the
exchange rate, or a loss could be incurred as a result of those changes. Transactions on foreign exchanges may include both commodities which are traded on domestic exchanges and those which are not. Unlike trading on domestic commodity exchanges,
trading on foreign commodity exchanges is not regulated by the CFTC. 
  10 


Engaging in these transactions involves risk of loss, which could adversely affect the value
of the Funds net assets. No assurance can be given that a liquid market will exist for any particular futures contract at any particular time. Many futures exchanges and boards of trade limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures
contract prices during a single trading day. Once the daily limit has been reached in a particular contract, no trades may be made that day at a price beyond that limit or trading may be suspended for specified periods during the trading day.
Futures contract prices could move to the limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading, thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and potentially subjecting an Investment Fund to substantial losses.
 Successful use of futures also is subject to an Investment Managers ability to correctly predict movements in the
direction of the relevant market, and, to the extent the transaction is entered into for hedging purposes, to ascertain the appropriate correlation between the transaction being hedged and the price movements of the futures contract. 
Some or all of the Investment Managers may purchase and sell stock index futures contracts for an Investment Fund. A stock index future
obligates an Investment Fund to pay or receive an amount of cash equal to a fixed dollar amount specified in the futures contract multiplied by the difference between the settlement price of the contract on the contracts last trading day and
the value of the index based on the stock prices of the securities that comprise it at the opening of trading in those securities on the next business day.  Some or all of the Investment Managers may purchase and sell interest rate futures contracts for an Investment Fund. An interest rate future represents an obligation to purchase or sell an amount of a
specific debt security at a future date at a specific price.  Some or all of the Investment Managers may purchase and sell
currency futures or commodity futures. A currency future creates an obligation to purchase or sell an amount of a specific currency at a future date at a specific price. A commodity future creates an obligation to purchase or sell an amount of a
specific commodity at a future date at a specific price.  Options on Securities Indexes. Some or all of the
Investment Managers may purchase and sell for the Investment Funds call and put options on stock indexes listed on national securities exchanges or traded in the over-the-counter market for hedging purposes or non-hedging purposes to pursue their
investment objectives. A stock index fluctuates with changes in the market values of the stocks included in the index. Accordingly, successful use by an Investment Manager of options on stock indexes will be subject to the Investment Managers
ability to predict correctly movements in the direction of the stock market generally or of a particular industry or market segment. This requires different skills and techniques than predicting changes in the price of individual stocks. 
Warrants and Rights. Warrants are derivative instruments that permit, but do not obligate, the holder to subscribe for
other securities or commodities. Rights are similar to warrants, but normally have a shorter duration and are offered or distributed to shareholders of a company. Warrants and rights do not carry with them the right to dividends or voting rights
with respect to the securities that they entitle the holder to purchase, and they do not represent any rights in the assets of the issuer. As a result, warrants and rights may be considered more speculative than certain other types of equity-like
securities. In addition, the values of warrants and rights do not necessarily change with the values of the underlying securities or commodities and these instruments cease to have value if they are not exercised prior to their expiration dates.

  11 


Swap Agreements. The Investment Managers may enter into equity, interest rate,
and index and currency rate swap agreements on behalf of Investment Funds. These transactions are entered into in an attempt to obtain a particular return when it is considered desirable to do so, possibly at a lower cost than if an investment was
made directly in the asset that yielded the desired return. Swap agreements are two-party contracts entered into primarily by institutional investors for periods ranging from a few weeks to more than a year. In a standard swap transaction, two
parties agree to exchange the returns (or differentials in rates of return) earned or realized on particular predetermined investments or instruments, which may be adjusted for an interest factor. The gross returns to be exchanged or
swapped between the parties are generally calculated with respect to a notional amount, i.e., the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate, in a particular foreign
currency, or in a basket of securities representing a particular index. Forms of swap agreements include interest rate caps, under which, in return for a premium, one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest
rates exceed a specified rate or cap; interest rate floors, under which, in return for a premium, one party agrees to make payments to the other to the extent interest rates fall below a specified level or floor; and interest
rate collars, under which a party sells a cap and purchases a floor or vice versa in an attempt to protect itself against interest rate movements exceeding given minimum or maximum levels. 
Most swap agreements entered into by an Investment Fund would require the calculation of the obligations of the parties to the agreements
on a net basis. Consequently, an Investment Funds current obligations (or rights) under a swap agreement generally will be equal only to the net amount to be paid or received under the agreement based on the relative values of the
positions held by each party to the agreement (the net amount). The risk of loss with respect to swaps is limited to the net amount of interest payments that a party is contractually obligated to make. If the other party to a swap
defaults, an Investment Funds risk of loss consists of the net amount of payments that it contractually is entitled to receive.  To achieve investment returns equivalent to those achieved by an Investment Manager in whose investment vehicles the Fund could not invest directly, perhaps because of their investment minimums or their
unavailability for direct investment, the Fund may enter into swap agreements under which the Fund may agree, on a net basis, to pay a return based on a floating interest rate, such as LIBOR, and to receive the total return of the reference
investment vehicle over a stated time period. The Fund may seek to achieve the same investment result through the use of other derivatives in similar circumstances. The Federal income tax treatment of swap agreements and other derivatives used in
the above manner is unclear.  Possible Effects of Speculative Position Limits. The CFTC and the U.S. commodities
exchanges have established limits referred to as speculative position limits on the maximum net long or short speculative futures positions that any person may hold or control in derivatives traded on U.S. commodities exchanges. All
accounts owned or managed by a commodity trading adviser, its principals and their affiliates generally will be combined for position limit purposes. Because futures position limits allow a commodity trading advisor, its principals and their
affiliates to control only a limited number of contracts in any one commodity, each Investment Manager and its principals and affiliates are potentially subject to a conflict among the interests of all accounts the Investment Manager and its
principals and their affiliates control which are competing for shares of that limited number of contracts. Although each Investment Manager may be able to achieve the same or similar performance results with OTC substitutes for futures contracts,
the OTC market may be subject to differing prices, lesser liquidity and greater counterparty credit risks than on U.S. commodities exchanges. Each Investment Manager may be required to reduce the size or number of positions that would otherwise be
held for an Investment Fund or not trade in certain markets on behalf of the Investment Fund in order to avoid exceeding such limits. Modification of trades that would otherwise be made by an Investment Fund, if required, could adversely affect the
Investment Funds operations and profitability. A violation of speculative position limits by an Investment Manager could lead to regulatory action materially adverse to an Investment Funds prospects for profitability. 
  12 


The speculative position limits of the CFTC and U.S. commodities exchanges are subject to
change. Any new or additional position limits imposed on an Investment Manager and its principal and affiliates may impact the Investment Funds ability to invest in a manner that most efficiently meets its investment objective. 
Other Instruments and Future Developments. An Investment Fund may take advantage of opportunities in the area of swaps,
options on various underlying instruments, and certain other customized synthetic or derivative instruments, which will be subject to varying degrees of risk. In addition, an Investment Fund may take advantage of opportunities with
respect to certain other synthetic or derivative instruments which are not presently contemplated, or which are not presently available, but which may be developed and which may be subject to significant degrees of risk. 
Hedging Limitations. Although the Adviser may seek one or more Investment Managers who employ various hedging techniques,
the extent and effectiveness of such hedging strategies may vary substantially. Moreover, it will not be a goal of the Adviser to retain Investment Managers who necessarily employ fully hedged or market-neutral strategies. Most hedging
techniques of Investment Managers will be directed primarily toward general market risks or certain issuer risks. Typically there are numerous investment risks which will not be hedged or necessarily capable of being hedged as a practical matter. To
the extent unhedged, investment positions of Investment Managers will, in general, be fully exposed to market and investment risks. Hedging techniques have a variety of limitations. Hedging against a decline in the value of a portfolio position by
selling short, for example, does not eliminate fluctuations in the values of portfolio positions or prevent losses if the values of such positions decline, but establishes other positions designed to gain from those same developments, thus
moderating the decline in the overall portfolio positions value. Hedging through market index options may only protect against an overall market downturn, as compared with price declines in specific securities. 
Hedge transactions generally also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of the portfolio position should increase, due to the
hedging cost or price decline in the hedging position. For a variety of reasons, an Investment Manager may not seek or be able to establish a sufficiently accurate correlation between hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Such
imperfect correlation may prevent an Investment Fund from achieving the intended hedge or may expose the Fund to risk of loss. Such losses can include losses on the hedged position, the attempted hedge position, or both, and could be substantial.
There can be no assurance, therefore, that investment positions of Investment Funds will be significantly hedged against investment risks or that such hedging strategies, if any, will in fact prove successful. 
Tail Risk Hedging. Investment Funds that pursue a tail risk hedging strategy invest in instruments designed to
outperform during periods of market stress. Such periods may be characterized by, among other factors: (i) a significant decline in the equity markets; (ii) a significant widening in credit spreads; and/or (iii) a significant increase
in market volatility. Instruments designed to mitigate tail event risk involve a high degree of risk. The type, frequency and severity of tail events are difficult to predict or model, and thus the expected return on an instrument designed to
appreciate on the occurrence of any such tail event is difficult to calculate. With respect to tail event instruments, it is necessary for Investment Managers to rely on information provided by a counterparty or independent source (such as an index)
that may not be accurate, and the Investment Manager may not be able to verify or challenge the information. Securities that are linked to tail events may, in the future, have novel features or non-standardized terms. An Investment Fund risks the
loss of all or a portion of principal and/or interest due on the tail event-linked securities it may purchase, if a period of severe market stress fails to occur during 
  13 



the term of such securities. Model-driven strategies such as a tail risk hedging strategy may not achieve their intended results, whether due to unusual or changing market conditions or
relationships, and may also involve frequent trading and transaction expenses.  Lending Portfolio Securities 
An Investment Fund may lend securities from its portfolio to brokers, dealers and other financial institutions needing to borrow
securities to complete certain transactions. The Investment Fund continues to be entitled to payments in amounts equal to the interest, dividends or other distributions payable on the loaned securities which affords the Investment Fund an
opportunity to earn interest on the amount of the loan and on the loaned securities collateral. An Investment Fund generally will receive collateral consisting of cash, U.S. Government Securities or irrevocable letters of credit which will be
maintained at all times in an amount equal to at least 100% of the current market value of the loaned securities. The Investment Fund might experience risk of loss if the institution with which it has engaged in a portfolio loan transaction breaches
its agreement with the Investment Fund.  When-Issued, Delayed Delivery and Forward Commitment Securities 
To reduce the risk of changes in securities prices and interest rates, an Investment Fund may purchase securities on a forward commitment,
when-issued or delayed delivery basis, which means delivery and payment take place a number of days after the date of the commitment to purchase. The payment obligation and the interest rate receivable with respect to such purchases are fixed when
the Investment Fund enters into the commitment, but the Investment Fund does not make payment until it receives delivery from the counterparty. After an Investment Fund commits to purchase such securities, but before delivery and settlement, it may
sell the securities if it is deemed advisable.  Securities purchased on a forward commitment, when-issued or delayed delivery
basis are subject to changes in value, generally changing in the same way (i.e., appreciating when interest rates decline and depreciating when interest rates rise), based upon the publics perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and
changes, real or anticipated, in the level of interest rates. Securities so purchased may expose an Investment Fund to risks because they may experience such fluctuations prior to their actual delivery. Purchasing securities on a when-issued or
delayed delivery basis can involve the additional risk that the yield available in the market when the delivery takes place actually may be higher than that obtained in the transaction itself. Purchasing securities on a forward commitment,
when-issued or delayed delivery basis when an Investment Fund is fully or almost fully invested results in a form of leverage and may result in greater potential fluctuation in the value of the net assets of an Investment Fund. In addition, there is
a risk that securities purchased on a when-issued or delayed delivery basis may not be delivered and that the purchaser of securities sold by an Investment Fund on a forward basis will not honor its purchase obligation. In such cases, the Investment
Fund may incur a loss.  Risk Management  The sophistication of the risk management techniques employed by Investment Managers varies. However, even the most sophisticated risk management techniques cannot protect an Investment Fund against loss
in all circumstances. All risk management models are premised upon assumptions with respect to economic and political conditions, market sentiment and other factors. The occurrence of an aberrational event not anticipated by a model can cause a
portfolio to sustain a significant loss. Such events may include volatility in energy prices, sharp swings in interest rates or other factors.

REPURCHASES AND TRANSFERS OF SHARES 
Repurchase Offers  As
discussed in the prospectus, offers to repurchase Shares will be made by the Fund at such times and on such terms as may be determined by the Funds Board of Trustees (the Board), in its sole discretion in accordance with the
provisions of applicable law. In determining whether the Fund should repurchase Shares from shareholders of the Fund (Shareholders) pursuant to written tenders, the Funds Board will consider the recommendation of the Adviser. The
Board also will consider various factors, including but not limited to those listed in the prospectus, in making its determinations.  The Funds Board will cause the Fund to make offers to repurchase Shares from Shareholders pursuant to written tenders only on terms it determines to be fair to the Fund and to all Shareholders of
the Fund. When the Funds Board determines that the Fund will repurchase Shares, notice will be provided to each Shareholder of the Fund describing the terms thereof, and containing information Shareholders should consider in deciding whether
and how to participate in such repurchase opportunity. Shareholders who are deciding whether to tender their Shares during the period that a repurchase offer is open may ascertain an estimated net asset value of their Shares [(which is calculated
once a month at month-end)] from [            ], the administrator for the Fund, during such period. If a repurchase offer is oversubscribed by Shareholders, the Fund may repurchase only a
pro rata portion of the Shares tendered by each Shareholder, extend the repurchase offer, or take any other action with respect to the repurchase offer permitted by applicable law. 
Upon its acceptance of tendered Shares for repurchase, the Fund will maintain daily on its books a segregated account consisting of
(i) cash, (ii) liquid securities or (iii) interests in Investment Funds that the Fund has requested be withdrawn (or any combination of the foregoing), in an amount equal to the aggregate estimated unpaid dollar amount of any
outstanding repurchase offer.  Payment for repurchased Shares may require the Fund to liquidate portfolio holdings earlier
than the Adviser would otherwise liquidate these holdings, potentially resulting in losses, and may increase the Funds portfolio turnover. The Adviser intends to take measures (subject to such policies as may be established by the Funds
Board) to attempt to avoid or minimize potential losses and turnover resulting from the repurchase of Shares.  Mandatory Redemptions
 As noted in the prospectus, the Fund has the right to redeem Shares of a Shareholder or any person acquiring Shares from
or through a Shareholder under certain circumstances. Such mandatory redemptions may be made if:   


 

 
 Shares have been transferred or vested in any person by operation of law as the result of the death, dissolution, bankruptcy or incompetency of a
Shareholder;   


 

 
 ownership of Shares by a Shareholder or other person will cause the Fund to be in violation of, or subject the Fund to additional registration or
regulation under, the securities, commodities or other laws of the U.S. or any other relevant jurisdiction;   


 

 
 continued ownership of such Shares may be harmful or injurious to the business or reputation of the Fund or the Adviser, or may subject the Fund or any
Shareholder to an undue risk of adverse tax or other fiscal consequences; 
  15 




 

 
 any of the representations and warranties made by a Shareholder in connection with the acquisition of Shares was not true when made or has ceased to be
true; or   


 

 
 it would be in the best interests of the Fund to redeem Shares.  Transfers of Shares  With very limited exceptions, Shares are not
transferable and liquidity will be provided only through the repurchase offers that will be made from time to time by the Fund. No transfer of Shares will be permitted by the Fund unless the transferee is an Eligible Investor (as defined
in the prospectus), and, after the transfer, the value of the Shares beneficially owned by each of the transferor and the transferee is at least equal to the Funds minimum investment requirement. 
The Funds organizational documents provide that each Shareholder has agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Fund, the Board, the
Adviser, each other Shareholder and any affiliate of the foregoing against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, including legal or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against any such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses or any judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement, joint or several, to which such persons may become subject by reason of or arising from any transfer made by such Shareholder in violation of these
provisions or any misrepresentation made by such Shareholder in connection with any such transfer. 
MANAGEMENT OF THE FUND  The Trustees supervise the Funds affairs under the laws governing statutory trusts in the State of Delaware. The Trustees have approved contracts under which certain companies provide essential
management, administrative and shareholder services to the Fund.  Trustees and Officers 
The Board of the Fund consists of
[                    ] Trustees. These same individuals also serve as trustees for the Funds feeder fund, EnTrust Multi-Strategy Fund,
which is managed by the Adviser. [                    ] Trustees have no affiliation or business connection with the Adviser or any of its affiliated
persons and do not own any stock or other securities issued by the Adviser. These are the non-interested or Independent Trustees. The other
[                    ] Trustee[s] (the Interested Trustee[s]) [is] affiliated with the Adviser. 
Board Structure and Oversight Function. The Boards leadership structure features an Independent Trustee serving as
Chairperson and the Board Committees described below. The Chairperson participates in the preparation of the agenda for meetings of the Board and the preparation of information to be presented to the Board with respect to matters to be acted upon by
the Board. The Chairperson also presides at all meetings of the Board and is involved in discussions regarding matters pertaining to the oversight of the management of the Fund between meetings. 
The Board of Trustees operates using a system of committees to facilitate the timely and efficient consideration of all matters of
importance to the Trustees, the Fund and Fund shareholders, and to facilitate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and oversight of the Funds activities and associated risks. The Board of Trustees has established three standing
committees: (1) Audit Committee, (2) Nominating Committee and (3) Valuation Committee. The Audit Committee and the Nominating Committee are comprised exclusively of Independent Trustees. Each committee charter governs the scope of the
committees responsibilities with respect to the oversight of the Fund. The responsibilities of each committee, including their oversight responsibilities, are described further under the caption Independent Trustees and the
Committees. 
  16 


The Fund is subject to a number of risks, including investment, compliance, operational and
valuation risk, among others. The Board of Trustees oversees these risks as part of its broader oversight of the Funds affairs through various Board and committee activities. The Board has adopted, and periodically reviews, policies and
procedures designed to address various risks to the Fund. In addition, appropriate personnel, including but not limited to the Funds Chief Compliance Officer, members of the Funds administration and accounting teams, representatives from
the Funds independent registered public accounting firm, the Funds Treasurer and portfolio management personnel and independent valuation and brokerage evaluation services, make regular reports regarding the Funds activities and
related risks to the Board of Trustees and the committees, as appropriate. The Boards committee structure allows separate committees to focus on different aspects of risk and potential impact on the Fund and then report back to the full Board.
In between regular meetings, Fund officers also communicate with the Trustees regarding material exceptions and items germane to the Boards oversight risk function. The Board recognizes that it is not possible to identify all of the risks that
may affect the Fund, and that it is not possible to develop processes and controls to eliminate all of the risks that may affect the Fund. Moreover, the Board recognizes that it may be necessary for the Fund to bear certain risks (such as investment
risk) to achieve its investment objective.  As needed between meetings of the Board, the Board or a specific committee
receives and reviews reports relating to the Fund and engages in discussions with appropriate parties relating to the Funds operations and related risks.  Independent Trustees  The Fund seeks as Trustees individuals of distinction
and experience in business and finance, government service or academia. In determining that a particular Trustee was and continues to be qualified to serve as Trustee, the Board has considered a variety of criteria, none of which, in isolation, was
controlling. Based on a review of the experience, qualifications, attributes or skills of each Trustee, including those enumerated in the table below, the Board has determined that each of the Trustees is qualified to serve as a Trustee of the Fund.
In addition, the Board believes that, collectively, the Trustees have balanced and diverse experience, qualifications, attributes and skills that allow the Board to operate effectively in governing the Fund and protecting the interests of
shareholders. Information about the Funds Nominating Committee and Board of Trustees nomination process is provided below under the caption Independent Trustees and the Committees. 
The Independent Trustees of the Fund, their age, address, term of office and length of time served, their principal business occupations
during the past five years, the number of portfolios in the Fund Complex (defined below) overseen by each Independent Trustee (as of
[                    ]) and other directorships, if any, held by the Trustees, are shown below. The Fund Complex includes all open-end and closed-end
funds (including all of their portfolios) advised by the Adviser and any funds that have an investment adviser that is an affiliated person of the Adviser.

Each Officer serves an indefinite term, until his or her successor is elected.  The Family of Investment Companies (Family of Investment Companies includes all of the registered investment companies advised by the Adviser, or its affiliates) did not commence operations until
[            ], 2013. Accordingly, for the calendar year ended December 31, 2012, no Trustee owned any shares of equity securities in the Family of Investment Companies. 
  18 


[As to each Independent Trustee and his or her immediate family members, no person owned
beneficially or of record securities in an investment adviser or principal underwriter of the Fund, or a person (other than a registered investment company) directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with an investment
adviser or principal underwriter of the Fund.]  As of
[            ], 2013, the Trustees and Officers of the Fund, as a group, owned less than 1% of the outstanding Shares of the Fund.  Independent Trustees and the Committees  Law and regulation establish both
general guidelines and specific duties for the Independent Trustees. The Board has three committees: (1) Audit Committee, (2) Nominating Committee and (3) Valuation Committee.
[                    ] of the Independent Trustees serve as members of the Audit Committee,
[                    ] Independent Trustees serve as members of the Nominating Committee,
[                    ] Trustees, including
[                    ] Independent Trustees, serve as members of the Valuation Committee. 
The Independent Trustees are charged with recommending to the full Board approval of management, advisory and administration contracts,
and distribution and underwriting agreements; continually reviewing fund performance; checking on the pricing of portfolio securities, brokerage commissions, transfer agent costs and performance and trading among funds in the same complex; and
approving fidelity bond and related insurance coverage and allocations, as well as other matters that arise from time to time. 
The Board of Trustees has a separately-designated standing Audit Committee established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Audit Committee is charged with recommending to the full Board the engagement or discharge of the Funds independent registered public accounting firm; directing investigations into matters
within the scope of the independent registered public accounting firms duties, including the power to retain outside specialists; reviewing with the independent registered public accounting firm the audit plan and results of the auditing
engagement; approving professional services provided by the independent registered public accounting firm and other accounting firms prior to the performance of the services; reviewing the independence of the independent registered public accounting
firm; considering the range of audit and non-audit fees; reviewing the adequacy of the Funds system of internal controls; and reviewing the valuation process. The Fund has adopted a formal, written Audit Committee Charter. 
The members of the Audit Committee of the Fund are
[                    ]. None of the members of the Funds Audit Committee is an interested person, as defined under the Investment
Company Act, of the Fund (with such disinterested Trustees being Independent Trustees or individually, Independent Trustee). The Chairperson of the Audit Committee of the Fund is
[                    ]. 
The Board of Trustees of the Fund also has a Nominating Committee. The Nominating Committee identifies individuals qualified to serve as
Independent Trustees on the Funds Board and on committees of such Board and recommends such qualified individuals for nomination by the Funds Independent Trustees as candidates for election as Independent Trustees, advises the
Funds Board with respect to Board composition, procedures and committees, develops and recommends to the Funds Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to the Fund, monitors and makes recommendations on corporate
governance matters and policies and procedures of the Funds Board of Trustees and any Board committees and oversees periodic evaluations of the Funds Board and its committees. The members of the Nominating Committee of the Fund are
[                    ], each of whom is an Independent Trustee. The Chairperson of the Nominating Committee is
[                    ]. 
  19 


Persons recommended by the Funds Nominating Committee as candidates for nomination as
Independent Trustees shall possess such experience, qualifications, attributes, skills and diversity so as to enhance the Boards ability to manage and direct the affairs and business of the Fund, including, when applicable, to enhance the
ability of committees of the Board to fulfill their duties and/or to satisfy any independence requirements imposed by law or regulation. While the Independent Trustees of the Fund expect to be able to continue to identify from their own resources an
ample number of qualified candidates for the Funds Board as they deem appropriate, they will consider nominations from shareholders to the Board. Nominations from shareholders should be in writing and sent to the Independent Trustees as
described below under the caption Shareholder Communications.  The Board of Trustees of the Fund also has a
Valuation Committee. The Valuation Committee generally is responsible for determining the fair value of the following types of portfolio investments that may be held by the Fund: (i) portfolio investments for which the Adviser has received
revised prices from the sources of the prices originally provided to the Adviser for such portfolio investments, where the revisions to such prices are of sufficient magnitude to alter the Funds net asset value by 5% or more;
(ii) portfolio investments for which no price or value is available at the time the Funds net asset value is calculated on a particular day, including new portfolio investments for which a usual source of pricing information has not yet
been established and portfolio investments for which there is a short and temporary lapse in price provision by the usual pricing source; and (iii) portfolio investments for which the prices or values provided by the usual pricing source do
not, in the judgment of the Adviser, represent the fair value of the instrument. The members of the Valuation Committee of the Fund are
[                    ]. The Chairperson of the Valuation Committee is
[                    ]. 
During the Funds fiscal year ended
[                    ], the Fund was inactive and no Board of Trustees or Committee meetings were held. 
Experience, Qualifications and Attributes  The Board has concluded, based on each Trustees experience, qualifications and attributes that each Board member should serve as a Trustee. Following is a brief summary of the information that led
to and/or supports this conclusion.  [To be provided] 
The Trustees principal occupations during the past five years or more are shown in the above tables. 
Shareholder Communications  Shareholders may send communications to the Funds Board of Trustees. Shareholders should send communications intended for the Funds Board by addressing the communications directly to that
Board (or individual Board members) and/or otherwise clearly indicating in the salutation that the communication is for the Board (or individual Board members) and by sending the communication to either the Funds office or directly to such
Board member(s) at the address specified for each Trustee previously noted. Other shareholder communications received by the Fund not directly addressed and sent to the Board will be reviewed and generally responded to by management, and will be
forwarded to the Board only at managements discretion based on the matters contained therein.

Compensation of Trustees and Officers 
Each Independent Trustee (except for the Chairperson of the Boards) receives an annual retainer fee of
$[            ] for serving the Fund and the Funds feeder fund, EnTrust Multi-Strategy Fund, (the EnTrust Funds).] 
The Chairperson of the Audit Committee receives an additional annual retainer fee of
$[            ]. Other Committee Chairpersons receive an additional annual retainer fee of $[            ]. The aggregate
compensation paid to each Trustee is paid by the EnTrust Funds, and is allocated on a pro rata basis among each of the operational funds/portfolios of the EnTrust Funds based on the relative net assets of each of the funds/portfolios. [Chairman]
receives a total annual retainer fee of $[            ] for his services as Chairperson of the Boards of the EnTrust Funds and for administrative services provided to each Board.
 The Fund also reimburses such Independent Trustees for travel and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection
with attending such meetings. Interested Trustees receive no compensation or expense reimbursement from the Fund for their services as Trustee.  The following table shows the estimated aggregate compensation to be payable to each of the Funds Trustees from the Fund for the fiscal year ending
[                    ] and the estimated aggregate compensation to be payable to each of the Funds Trustees by the Fund Complex (which includes
all EnTrust Funds) for the fiscal year ending [                    ].

 Code of Ethics  Pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the 1940 Act, the Board of Trustees has adopted a Code of Ethics for the Fund and approved Codes of Ethics adopted by the Adviser and EnTrust Securities LLC (the
Distributor) (collectively, the Codes). The Codes are intended to ensure that the interests of Shareholders and other clients are placed ahead of any personal interest, that no undue personal benefit is obtained from the
persons employment activities and that actual and potential conflicts of interest are avoided.  The Codes apply to the
personal investing activities of Trustees and officers of the Fund, the Adviser, and the Distributor (Access Persons). Rule 17j-1 and the Codes are designed to prevent unlawful practices in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities by Access Persons, including with respect to securities that may be purchased or held by the Fund (which may only be purchased by Access Persons so long as the requirements set forth in the Codes are complied with). Under the Codes,
Access Persons are permitted to engage in personal securities transactions, but are required to report their personal securities transactions for monitoring purposes. In addition, certain Access Persons are required to obtain approval before
investing in initial public offerings or private placements. The Codes are on file with the SEC, and are available to the public.

Investment Advisory Agreement 
The Adviser was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the state of Delaware on August 21, 1998
and is a registered investment adviser under the Advisers Act. The Adviser currently serves as an investment adviser of other unregistered private investment companies, and may in the future serve as an investment adviser of other registered private
investment companies. The principal offices of the Adviser are located at 375 Park Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10152.  Pursuant to an Investment Advisory Agreement with
the Fund (the Advisory Agreement), the Adviser receives compensation for providing investment advisory services in the amounts described below. An affiliate of the Adviser also performs certain administrative and investor services for
the Fund pursuant to a services agreement with the Fund.  Advisory Fees 
The Adviser is entitled to receive a monthly advisory fee of 0.125% (1.50% on an annualized basis) of the Funds month end net asset
value (the Management Fee).  Approval of the Advisory Agreement 
The Advisory Agreement was approved by the Funds Board (including a majority of the Independent Trustees) at a meeting held in
person on [            ], 2013 and was also approved by the then sole Shareholder of the Fund. The Advisory Agreement of the Fund has an initial term of two years from the date of its
execution. The Advisory Agreement will continue in effect from year to year thereafter so long as such continuance is approved annually by the Board or by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund; provided that in either
event the continuance is also approved by a majority of the Independent Trustees by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Advisory Agreement is terminable without penalty, on 60 days prior
written notice: by the Board; by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Fund; or by the Adviser. The Advisory Agreement also provides that it will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment, as defined
by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder.  A discussion of the factors considered by the Funds Board of Trustees in
approving the Advisory Agreement will be set forth in the Funds [semi-annual] report to Shareholders for the period ending [June 30, 2013].  Distributor  EnTrust Securities LLC acts as the distributor of the
Funds Shares.  Other Accounts Managed by the Portfolio Managers 
Because the portfolio managers manage assets for other [investment companies, pooled investment vehicles, and/or other accounts (including
institutional clients, pension plans and certain high net worth individuals)], there may be an incentive to favor one client over another resulting in conflicts of interest. For instance, the Adviser may receive fees from certain accounts that are
higher than the fee it receives from the Fund, or it may receive a performance-based fee on certain accounts. In those instances, the portfolio managers may have an incentive to favor the higher and/or performance-based fee accounts over the Fund.
In addition, a conflict of interest could exist to the extent the Adviser has proprietary investments in certain accounts, where portfolio managers have personal investments in certain accounts or when certain accounts are investment options in the
Advisers employee benefits

and/or deferred compensation plans. The portfolio manager may have an incentive to favor these accounts over others. If the Adviser manages accounts that engage in short sales of securities of
the type in which the Fund invests, the Adviser could be seen as harming the performance of the Fund for the benefit of the accounts engaging in short sales if the short sales cause the market value of the securities to fall. The Adviser has adopted
trade allocation and other policies and procedures that it believes are reasonably designed to address these and other conflicts of interest.  The following tables show information regarding accounts (other than the Fund) managed by each named portfolio manager:

 Portfolio Manager Compensation Structure  [Portfolio managers receive a combination of base compensation and discretionary compensation, comprising a cash bonus and several deferred compensation programs described below. The methodology used to
determine portfolio manager compensation is applied across all accounts managed by the portfolio managers.  Base salary
compensation. Generally, portfolio managers receive base salary compensation based on the level of their position with the Adviser.  Discretionary compensation. In addition to base compensation, portfolio managers may receive discretionary compensation. Components of discretionary compensation may include:]

Fund Expenses  The Fund bears all expenses incurred in its business and operations other than those specifically required to be borne by the Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Expenses borne by the Fund (and
thus indirectly by its investors) include, but are not limited to, the following:   


 

 
 all expenses related to its investment program, including, but not limited to, expenses borne indirectly through the Funds investments in the
underlying Investment Funds including any fees and expenses charged by the Investment Managers of the Investment Funds (including management fees, performance or incentive fees and redemption or withdrawal fees, however titled or structured), all
costs and expenses directly related to portfolio transactions and positions for the Funds account such as direct and indirect expenses associated with the Funds investments, including its investments in Investment Funds (whether or not
consummated), and enforcing the Funds rights in respect of such investments, transfer taxes and premiums, taxes withheld on non-U.S. dividends, fees for data and software providers, research expenses, professional fees (including, without
limitation, the fees and expenses of consultants, attorneys and experts) and, if applicable, brokerage commissions, interest and commitment fees on loans and debit balances, borrowing charges on securities sold short, dividends on securities sold
but not yet purchased and margin fees;   


 

 
 any non-investment related interest expense;   


 

 
 attorneys fees and disbursements associated with preparing and updating the Funds registration statement and with reviewing potential
investments to be made in Investment Funds;   


 

 
 fees and disbursements of any accountants engaged by the Fund, expenses related to the annual audit of the Fund and the preparation of the Funds
tax information;   


 

 
 fees paid and out-of-pocket expenses reimbursed to the Administrator; 
 


 

 
 recordkeeping, custody and transfer fees and expenses; 
 


 

 
 the costs of errors and omissions/Trustees and officers liability insurance and a fidelity bond; 
 


 

 
 the Management Fee;   


 

 
 the costs of preparing and mailing reports and other communications, including proxy, tender offer correspondence or similar materials, to shareholders
of the Fund;   


 

 
 fees of Trustees who are not interested persons and travel expenses of Trustees relating to meetings of the Board of Trustees of the Fund
and committees thereof;   


 

 
 all costs and charges for equipment or services used in communicating information regarding the Funds transactions among the Adviser and any
custodian or other agent engaged by the Fund; and   


 

 
 any extraordinary expenses (as defined below), including indemnification expenses as provided for in the Funds organizational documents.
 The Adviser will be reimbursed by the Fund for any of the above expenses that it pays on behalf of the
Fund, except as otherwise provided above. 
  24 


The Fund expects to incur organizational expenses of approximately
$[            ]. The Fund expects to incur initial offering costs of approximately $[            ]. The Funds offering
costs are being capitalized and amortized over the 12 month period beginning on the initial closing date for subscriptions for Shares. The Fund also will bear certain ongoing offering costs associated with the Funds continuous offering of
Shares (mostly printing expenses). Organizational expenses must be expensed as incurred. To achieve a more equitable distribution of the impact of those expenses among the Shareholders, an amount equal to the organizational expenses incurred by the
Fund will be allocated among and credited to or debited against the Shares of all Shareholders based on the percentage that a Shareholders investment in the Fund bears to the total investments in the Fund by all Shareholders as of the relevant
allocation date. An initial allocation of organizational costs will be made as of the first date on which investments in the Fund are made. These allocations will thereafter be adjusted as of each date during the first 12 months of the Funds
operations on which additional investments are made in the Fund by Shareholders. Offering costs cannot be deducted by the Fund or the Shareholders.  Extraordinary expenses are expenses incurred by the Fund outside of the ordinary course of its business, including, without limitation, costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation,
arbitration, mediation, government investigation or similar proceedings; indemnification expenses and expenses in connection with holding and/or soliciting proxies for a meeting of Shareholders. 
The Investment Funds bear all expenses incurred in connection with their operations similar to those incurred by the Fund. The Investment
Managers generally will charge asset-based fees to, and receive performance-based fees from, the Investment Funds, which effectively will reduce the investment returns of the Investment Funds and the amount of any distributions from the Investment
Funds to the Fund. These expenses and fees will be in addition to those incurred by the Fund itself. As an investor in the Investment Funds, the Fund will bear its proportionate share of the expenses and fees of the Investment Funds and will also be
subject to incentive allocations to the Investment Managers.  Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures and Proxy Voting Record 
While it is unlikely that the Fund will hold voting securities on a regular basis pursuant to its stated investment policies, the Fund
may, from time to time, hold voting securities in an Investment Fund and may at some point vote a proxy. The Board of Trustees of the Fund believes that the voting of proxies on securities held by the Fund is an important element of the overall
investment process. As such, the Board has delegated the responsibility to vote such proxies to the Adviser. The following is a summary of the Advisers Proxy Voting Policy (Proxy Policy). 
[The Adviser uses its best efforts to vote proxies on securities held in the Fund as part of its authority to manage, acquire and dispose
of Fund assets. In this regard, the Adviser has formed a Proxy Review Committee (Committee) comprised of senior investment professionals that is responsible for creating and implementing the Proxy Policy. The Committee meets monthly but
may meet more frequently as conditions warrant. The Proxy Policy provides that the Adviser will vote proxies in the best interests of clients consistent with the objective of maximizing long term investment returns. The Proxy Policy provides that
the Adviser will generally vote proxies in accordance with pre-determined guidelines contained in the Proxy Policy. The Adviser may vote in a manner that is not consistent with the pre-determined guidelines, provided that the vote is approved by the
Committee. The Adviser will generally not vote a proxy if it has sold the affected security between the record date and the meeting date.  The Proxy Policy provides that, unless otherwise determined by the Committee, votes will be cast in the manner described below: 
 


 

 
 Generally, routine proposals will be voted in support of management. 
  25 




 

 
 With regard to the election of directors, where no conflict exists and where no specific governance deficiency has been noted, votes will be cast in
support of managements nominees.   


 

 
 The Adviser will vote in accordance with managements recommendation with respect to certain non-routine proposals (i.e., reasonable
capitalization changes, stock repurchase programs, stock splits, certain compensation-related matters, certain anti-takeover measures, etc.).   


 

 
 The Adviser will vote against certain non-routine proposals (i.e., unreasonable capitalization changes, establishment of cumulative voting rights for
the election of directors, requiring supermajority shareholder votes to amend by-laws, indemnification of auditors, etc.).   


 

 
 The Adviser will vote in its discretion with respect to certain non-routine proposals (i.e., mergers, acquisitions, take-overs, spin-offs, etc.), which
may have a substantive financial or best interest impact on an issuer.   


 

 
 The Adviser will vote for certain proposals it believes call for reasonable charter provisions or corporate governance practices (i.e., requiring
auditors to attend annual shareholder meetings, requiring that members of compensation, nominating and audit committees be independent, reducing or eliminating supermajority voting requirements, etc.). 
 


 

 
 The Adviser will vote against certain proposals it believes call for unreasonable charter provisions or corporate governance practices (i.e., proposals
to declassify boards, proposals to require a company to prepare reports that are costly to provide or that would require duplicative efforts or expenditure that are of a non-business nature or would provide no pertinent information from the
perspective of institutional shareholders, etc.).   


 

 
 Certain other proposals (i.e., proposals requiring directors to own large amounts of company stock to be eligible for election; requiring diversity of
board membership relating to broad based social, religious or ethnic groups; limiting retirement benefits or executive compensation; etc.) generally are evaluated by the Committee based on the nature of the proposal and the likely impact on
shareholders.  Conflicts of Interest 
If the Committee determines that an issue raises a material conflict of interest, or gives rise to a potential material conflict of
interest, the Committee will request a special committee to review, and recommend a course of action with respect to, the conflict in question, and the Committee will have sole discretion to cast a vote. 
Third Parties  To assist in its responsibility for voting proxies, the Adviser may from time to time retain experts in the proxy voting and corporate governance area as proxy research providers (Research
Providers). The services provided to the Adviser by the Research Providers would include in depth research, global issuer analysis, and voting recommendations. While the Adviser may review and utilize recommendations made by the Research
Providers in making proxy voting decisions, it is in no way obligated to follow any such recommendations. In addition to research, the Research Providers could provide vote execution, reporting and recordkeeping. The Committee would carefully
monitor and supervise the services provided by any Research Providers.]

Further Information 
A copy of the Proxy Policy is available on our web site at
[                    ] and on the SECs web site at www.sec.gov.  CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  The Adviser and the Investment Managers
 The Adviser and its affiliates manage other accounts (including other funds and accounts in which the Investment Managers
may have an interest) other than the Fund (Adviser Accounts). Set out below are practices that the Adviser may follow. Many of the Investment Managers and their respective affiliates also manage other accounts other than the Investment
Funds. Although the Adviser anticipates that Investment Managers will follow practices similar to those described below, no guarantee or assurances can be made that similar practices will be followed or that an Investment Manager will adhere to, and
comply with, its stated practices.  Participation in Investment Opportunities 
The Adviser expects to employ an investment program for the Fund that is substantially similar to the investment program (or, in some
cases, to portions of the investment program) employed by it for certain Adviser Accounts. As a general matter, the Adviser will consider participation by the Fund in all appropriate investment opportunities that are under consideration for those
Adviser Accounts. There may be circumstances, however, under which the Adviser will cause one or more Adviser Accounts to commit a larger percentage of their respective assets to an investment opportunity than that to which the Adviser will commit
the Funds assets. There also may be circumstances under which the Adviser will consider participation by Adviser Accounts in investment opportunities in which the Adviser does not intend to invest on behalf of the Fund, or vice versa.
 The Adviser evaluates for the Fund and for the Adviser Accounts a variety of factors that may be relevant in determining
whether a particular investment opportunity or strategy is appropriate and feasible for the Fund or an Adviser Account at a particular time, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the nature of the investment opportunity taken in the
context of the other investments at the time; (2) the liquidity of the investment relative to the needs of the particular entity or account; (3) the availability of the opportunity (i.e., size of obtainable position); (4) the
transaction costs involved; and (5) the investment or regulatory limitations applicable to the particular entity or account. Because these considerations may differ for the Fund and the Adviser Accounts in the context of any particular
investment opportunity, the investment activities of the Fund and the Adviser Accounts may differ from time to time. In addition, the fees and expenses of the Fund differ from those of the Adviser Accounts. Accordingly, the future performance of the
Fund and the Adviser Accounts will vary.  When the Adviser determines that it would be appropriate for the Fund and one or
more Adviser Accounts to participate in an investment transaction in the same Investment Fund or other investment at the same time, it will attempt to aggregate, place and allocate orders on a basis that the Adviser believes to be fair and
equitable, consistent with its responsibilities under applicable law. Decisions in this regard are necessarily subjective and there is no requirement that the Fund participate, or participate to the same extent as the Adviser Accounts, in all
investments or trades. However, no participating entity or account will receive preferential treatment over any other and the Adviser will take steps to ensure that no participating entity or account will be systematically disadvantaged by the
aggregation, placement and allocation of orders and investments. 
  27 


Situations may occur, however, where the Fund could be disadvantaged because of the
investment activities conducted by the Adviser for the Adviser Accounts. Such situations may be based on, among other things, the following: (1) legal restrictions or other limitations (including limitations imposed by Investment Managers with
respect to Investment Funds) on the combined size of positions that may be taken for the Fund and/or the Adviser Accounts, thereby limiting the size of the Funds position or the availability of the investment opportunity; (2) the
difficulty of liquidating an investment for the Fund and the Adviser Accounts where the market cannot absorb the sale of the combined positions; and (3) the determination that a particular investment is warranted only if hedged with an option
or other instrument and there is a limited availability of such options or other instruments. In particular, the Fund may be legally restricted from entering into a joint transaction (as defined in the 1940 Act) with the Adviser Accounts
with respect to the securities of an issuer without first obtaining exemptive relief from the SEC. See Other Matters below.  Directors, principals, officers, employees and affiliates of the Adviser and each Investment Manager may buy and sell securities or other investments for their own accounts and may have actual or
potential conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of the Fund or an Investment Fund in which the Fund invests. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by directors,
principals, officers, employees and affiliates of the Adviser or an Investment Manager, or by the Adviser for the Adviser Accounts, or by an Investment Manager on behalf of its own other accounts (Investment Manager Accounts) that are
the same as, different from, or made at a different time than, positions taken for the Fund or an Investment Fund.  Investment
Managers or their affiliates may from time to time provide investment advisory or other services to private investment funds and other entities or accounts managed by the Adviser or its affiliates. 
Other Matters  An
Investment Manager may from time to time cause an Investment Fund to effect certain principal transactions in securities with one or more Investment Manager Accounts, subject to certain conditions. For example, these transactions may be made in
circumstances in which the Investment Manager determined it was appropriate for the Investment Fund to purchase and an Investment Manager Account to sell, or the Investment Fund to sell and an Investment Manager Account to purchase, the same
security or instrument on the same day. Future investment activities of the Investment Managers, or their affiliates, and the principals, partners, directors, officers or employees of the foregoing, may give rise to additional conflicts of interest.
 The Adviser and its affiliates will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to,
the Fund, except that the Fund may in accordance with rules under the 1940 Act engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated with the Fund as a result of common officers, directors, advisers or managing general partners. These
transactions would be effected in circumstances in which the Adviser determined that it would be appropriate for the Fund to purchase and another client to sell, or the Fund to sell and another client to purchase, the same security or instrument on
the same day.  Future investment activities of the Adviser and its affiliates and their principals, partners, directors,
officers or employees may give rise to conflicts of interest other than those described above.

TAX CONSIDERATIONS 
The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition, holding and disposition of
Shares by U.S. Shareholders. This summary is based upon existing U.S. federal income tax law, which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary does not discuss all aspects of U.S. federal income taxation which may be
important to particular investors in light of their individual investment circumstance, including investors subject to special tax rules, such as U.S. financial institutions, insurance companies, broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations,
partnerships, Shareholders who are not United States persons (as defined in the Code), Shareholders liable for the alternative minimum tax, persons holding Shares through partnerships or other pass-through entities, or investors that have a
functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, all of whom may be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below. This summary assumes that investors have acquired Shares pursuant to this offering and will hold their
Shares as capital assets (generally, property held for investment) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Prospective Shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the non-U.S. and U.S. federal, state, and local
income and other tax considerations that may be relevant to an investment in the Fund.  In addition to the particular matters
set forth in this section, tax-exempt entities should review carefully those sections of this SAI regarding liquidity and other financial matters to ascertain whether the investment objectives of the Fund are consistent with their overall investment
plans.  Taxation of the Fund  The Fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company (a RIC) under federal income tax law. If the Fund so qualifies and distributes each year to its shareholders at least 90% of its
investment company taxable income, the Fund will not be required to pay federal income taxes on any income it distributes to shareholders. If the Fund distributes less than an amount equal to the sum of 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its
capital gain net income, plus any amounts that were not distributed in previous taxable years, then the Fund will be subject to a nondeductible 4% excise tax on the undistributed amounts. 
The Fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax
purposes.  As described below under Investments in Passive Foreign Investment Companies, the Fund expects to be
taxed at ordinary income rates on gains from the Investment Funds.  Distributions to Shareholders 
Shareholders normally will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, and any state and/or local income taxes, on the dividends and other
distributions that they receive from the Fund. As described below under Investments in Passive Foreign Investment Companies, the fund expects that distributions of both income derived from the Investment Funds as well as gains from the
disposition of the Investment Funds will be taxable to Shareholders at ordinary income rates to the extent of the Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits. Such distributions will generally be taxable to Shareholders as ordinary
income regardless of whether Shareholders receive such payments in cash or reinvest the distributions in the Fund. Distributions by the Fund in excess of the Funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a tax-free
return of capital to the extent of (and in reduction of) the Shareholders tax bases in their Shares and any such amount in excess of their bases will be treated as gain from the sale of Shares, as discussed below. 
  29 


If the Fund receives distributions of qualified dividend income from the
Investment Funds, it could potentially make distributions to Shareholders that are taxed at the same rates as long-term capital gains. The Fund does not expect that it will make distributions to Shareholders that are eligible for this reduced rate
of taxation.  Shareholders are generally taxed on any ordinary income dividend or capital gain distributions from the Fund in
the year they are actually distributed. However, if any such dividends or distributions are declared in October, November or December and paid to Shareholders of record of such month in January of the following year then such amounts will be treated
for tax purposes as having been distributed by the Fund and received by the Shareholders on December 31 of the year prior to the date of payment.  If the Fund receives qualifying dividends from its investments, it could potentially make distributions that are eligible for the 70% dividends received deduction for corporate Shareholders.
The Fund does not expect that it will make distributions to Shareholders that are eligible for this deduction.  The Fund
intends to distribute its ordinary income and capital gains at least once annually.  The Fund will inform Shareholders of the
source and status of each distribution made in a given calendar year promptly after the close of such calendar year. 
Shareholders who are not citizens or residents of the United States generally will be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax or
U.S. federal withholding tax at such lower rate as prescribed by applicable treaty, on distributions of the Funds income derived from the Investment Funds. Each non-U.S. Shareholder must provide documentation to the Fund certifying its
non-U.S. status.  Income from Repurchases and Transfers of Shares 
The repurchase or transfer of the Funds Shares may result in a taxable gain or loss to the tendering Shareholder. Different tax
consequences may apply for tendering and non-tendering Shareholders in connection with a repurchase offer. For example, if a Shareholder does not tender all of his or her Shares, such repurchase may not be treated as an exchange for U.S. federal
income tax purposes and may result in deemed distributions to non-tendering Shareholders. On the other hand, Shareholders who tender all of their Shares (including Shares deemed owned by Shareholders under constructive ownership rules) will be
treated as having sold their Shares and generally will realize a capital gain or loss. Such gain or loss is measured by the difference between the Shareholders amount received and his or her adjusted tax basis of the Shares. For non-corporate
Shareholders, gain or loss from the transfer or repurchase of shares generally will be taxable at a U.S. federal income tax rate dependent upon the length of time the Shares were held. Shares held for a period of one year or less at the time of such
repurchase or transfer will, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, generally result in short-term capital gains or losses, and those held for more than one year will generally result in long-term capital gains or losses. 
Investments in Passive Foreign Investment Companies  The Fund intends to purchase interests in Investment Funds organized outside the United States that are treated as corporations for U.S. tax purposes and that will generally be treated as passive foreign
investment companies (PFICs). The Fund intends to elect to mark-to-market all shares that it holds in PFICs at the end of each taxable year. By making this election, the Fund will recognize as ordinary income any increase in
the value of such shares as of the close of the taxable year over their adjusted basis and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value unless the loss is required to be deferred. Gains realized with respect to PFICs that the Fund has elected to
mark-to-market will be ordinary income. If the Fund 
  30 



realizes a loss with respect to such a PFIC, whether by virtue of selling the PFIC or because of the mark-to-market adjustment described above, such loss will be ordinary to the
extent of the excess of the sum of the mark-to-market gains over the mark-to-market losses recognized with respect to the PFIC. To the extent that the Funds loss with respect to the PFIC exceeds such limitation, the loss will generally be
deferred until sold, at which point the loss will be treated as a capital loss. Although the Fund may only deduct capital losses in a given taxable year to the extent of capital gains, the Fund may carry forward remaining capital losses for up to 8
years following the taxable year in which the loss was recognized. However, the Fund does not expect to generate significant capital gains from its investments. By making the mark-to-market election, the Fund may be required to recognize income
(which generally must be distributed to Shareholders) in excess of the distributions that it received from PFICs. Accordingly, the Fund may need to borrow money or dispose of its interests in the Investment Funds in order to make the required
distributions. If the Fund does not make the mark-to-market election or treat the PFIC as a qualified electing fund (QEF), it would be subject to an interest charge (at the rate applicable to tax underpayments) on tax
liability treated as having been deferred with respect to certain distributions and on gain from the disposition of the shares of a PFIC (collectively referred to as excess distributions), even if such excess distributions are paid by
the Fund as a dividend to its Shareholders.  Fund Tax Returns and Tax Information 
The Fund is required to use the accrual method of accounting and expects to use the calendar year as its tax year for income tax purposes.
 After the end of each calendar year, Shareholders will be sent information regarding the amount and character of
distributions received from the Fund during the year.  State and Local Taxes 
In addition to the U.S. federal income tax consequences summarized above, prospective investors should consider the potential state and
local tax consequences of an investment in the Fund. The Fund may become subject to income and other taxes in states and localities based on the Funds investments in entities that conduct business in those jurisdictions. Shareholders are
generally taxable in their state of residence on their share of the Funds income. Shareholders may be subject to tax in other jurisdictions depending on the activities of the Investment Funds in which the Fund invests and the laws of those
jurisdictions. Additionally, Shareholders may be entitled to a credit in their state of residence for taxes paid to other jurisdictions. 
Information Reporting and Backup Withholding  Information returns generally will be filed with the Internal Revenue Service in connection with distributions with respect to the Shares unless Shareholders establish that they are exempt from the
information reporting rules, for example by properly establishing that they are corporations. If Shareholders do not establish that they are exempt from these rules, they generally will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if they fail
to provide their taxpayer identification number or otherwise comply with the backup withholding rules. The amount of any backup withholding from a payment to Shareholders will be allowed as a credit against their U.S. federal income tax liability
and may entitle Shareholders to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. 
  31 


Other Taxes  The foregoing is a summary of some of the tax rules and considerations affecting Shareholders and the Funds operations, and does not purport to be a complete analysis of all relevant tax rules and
considerations, nor does it purport to be a complete listing of all potential tax risks inherent in making an investment in the Fund. Non-U.S. investors are urged to consult with their own tax advisers regarding any proposed investment in the Fund.
A Shareholder may be subject to other taxes, including but not limited to, state and local taxes, estate and inheritance taxes, and intangible taxes that may be imposed by various jurisdictions. The Fund also may be subject to state, local, and
foreign taxes that could reduce cash distributions to Shareholders. It is the responsibility of each Shareholder to file all appropriate tax returns that may be required. Each prospective Shareholder is urged to consult with his or her tax adviser
with respect to any investment in the Fund.  ERISA AND CERTAIN OTHER CONSIDERATIONS 
Persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan or other arrangement subject to ERISA (an ERISA Plan),
and persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an IRA or Keogh Plan, which is not subject to ERISA but is subject to the prohibited transaction rules of Section 4975 of the Code (together with ERISA Plans, Benefit Plans) should
consider, among other things, the matters described below before determining whether to invest in the Fund.  ERISA imposes
certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an ERISA Plan, including prudence, diversification, an obligation not to engage in a prohibited transaction and other standards. In determining whether a
particular investment is appropriate for an ERISA Plan, regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor (the DOL) provide that a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan must give appropriate consideration to, among other things, the role that the
investment plays in the ERISA Plans portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plans purposes, an examination of the risk and return factors, the portfolios composition
with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the ERISA Plan, the income tax consequences of the investment (see Tax Aspects) and the projected
return of the total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plans funding objectives. Before investing the assets of an ERISA Plan in the Fund, a fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities
and the foregoing regulations. For example, a fiduciary should consider whether an investment in the Fund may be too illiquid or too speculative for a particular ERISA Plan, and whether the assets of the ERISA Plan would be sufficiently diversified.
If a fiduciary with respect to any such ERISA Plan breaches its or his responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such ERISA Plan, the fiduciary itself or himself may be held liable for losses
incurred by the ERISA Plan as a result of such breach.  Because the Fund is registered as an investment company under the 1940
Act, the Fund will be proceeding on the basis that its underlying assets should not be considered to be plan assets of the ERISA Plans investing in the Fund for purposes of ERISAs (or the Codes) fiduciary responsibility and
prohibited transaction rules.  A Benefit Plan which proposes to invest in the Fund will be required to represent that it, and
any fiduciaries responsible for such Plans investments, are aware of and understand the Funds investment objective, policies and strategies, that the decision to invest plan assets in the Fund was made with appropriate consideration of
relevant investment factors with regard to the Benefit Plan and is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under ERISA and the Code, as applicable. 
  32 


Certain prospective Benefit Plan Shareholders may currently maintain relationships with the
Adviser or its affiliates. Each of such persons may be deemed to be a fiduciary of or other party in interest or disqualified person of any Benefit Plan to which it provides investment management, investment advisory or other services. ERISA
prohibits (and the Code penalizes) the use of ERISA Plan and Benefit Plan assets for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits (or penalizes) an ERISA Plan or Benefit Plan fiduciary from using its position to cause such Plan to make an
investment from which it or certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration. Benefit Plan Shareholders should consult with their own counsel and other advisors to determine if participation in
the Fund is a transaction that is prohibited by ERISA or the Code or is otherwise inappropriate. Fiduciaries of ERISA or Benefit Plan Shareholders will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the Fund was made by them as fiduciaries
that are independent of such affiliated persons, that such fiduciaries are duly authorized to make such investment decision and that they have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons, as a primary basis
for the decision to invest in the Fund.  Employee benefit plans which are not subject to ERISA may be subject to other rules
governing such plans. Fiduciaries of non-ERISA Plans, whether or not subject to Section 4975 of the Code should consult with their own counsel and other advisors regarding such matters. 
The provisions of ERISA and the Code are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. The
discussion of ERISA and the Code contained in this SAI and the prospectus is general and may be affected by future publication of regulations and rulings. Potential Benefit Plan Shareholders should consult their legal advisers regarding the
consequences under ERISA and the Code of the acquisition and ownership of Shares.  BROKERAGE
 Each Investment Manager is responsible for placing orders for the execution of portfolio transactions and the allocation
of brokerage for any Investment Fund it manages. Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges and on some non-U.S. stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions. On the great majority of non-U.S. stock exchanges, commissions are
fixed. No stated commission is generally applicable to securities traded in over-the-counter markets, but the prices of those securities include undisclosed commissions or mark-ups. 
The Adviser expects that each Investment Manager will generally select brokers and dealers to effect transactions on behalf of its
Investment Fund substantially as described below, although the Adviser can give no assurance that an Investment Manager will adhere to, and comply with, the described practices. The Adviser generally expects that, in selecting brokers and dealers to
effect transactions on behalf of an Investment Fund, an Investment Manager will seek to obtain the best price and execution for the transactions, taking into account factors such as price, size of order, difficulty of execution and operational
facilities of a brokerage firm and the firms risk in positioning a block of securities. Subject to appropriate disclosure, however, Investment Managers of Investment Funds that are not investment companies registered under the 1940 Act may
select brokers on a basis other than that outlined above and may receive benefits other than research or that benefit the Investment Manager rather than its Investment Fund. The Adviser may consider the broker selection process employed by an
Investment Manager as a factor in determining whether to invest in its Investment Fund. Each Investment Manager generally will seek reasonably competitive commission rates, but will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each
transaction. 
  33 


Consistent with seeking best price and execution, an Investment Manager may place brokerage
orders with brokers that may provide the Investment Manager and its affiliates with supplemental research, market and statistical information, including advice as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling
securities, and the availability of securities or of purchasers or sellers of securities, and furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of
accounts. The expenses of an Investment Manager are not necessarily reduced as a result of the receipt of this supplemental information, which may be useful to the Investment Manager or its affiliates in providing services to clients other than an
Investment Fund. In addition, not all of the supplemental information is used by the Investment Manager in connection with an Investment Fund in which the Fund invests. Conversely, the information provided to the Investment Manager by brokers and
dealers through which other clients of the Investment Manager and its affiliates effect securities transactions may be useful to the Investment Manager in providing services to an Investment Fund. 
ADMINISTRATOR  The Fund has retained the Administrator, [                    ], whose principal business address is
[                    ], to provide certain administrative and fund accounting services to the Fund. Under the terms of an administration agreement
between the Fund and the Administrator (the Administration Agreement), the Administrator is responsible, directly or through its agents, for, among other things: (1) calculating and disseminating the net asset value of the Fund in
accordance with the Funds then-current Declaration of Trust; (2) preparing for review the semi-annual and annual financial statements of the Fund, as well as monthly reports regarding the Funds performance and net asset value; and
(3) performing additional services, as agreed upon, necessary in connection with the administration of the Fund. The Administrator may retain third parties, including its affiliates or those of the Adviser, to perform some or all of these
services.  The Administrator is paid a [monthly] Administrative Fee computed at an annual rate of [    ]%.
The Administrative Fee may be renegotiated from time to time between the parties. The Administration Agreement may be terminated at any time by either of the parties upon not less than 60 days written notice. 
The Administration Agreement provides that the Administrator, subject to certain limitations, will not be liable to the Fund or to
Shareholders for any and all liabilities or expenses except those arising out of the fraud, gross negligence or willful default or misconduct of the Administrator or its agents. In addition, under the Administration Agreement, the Fund has agreed to
indemnify the Administrator from and against any and all liabilities and expenses whatsoever out of the Administrators actions under the Administration Agreement, other than liability and expense arising out of the Administrators fraud,
gross negligence or willful default or misconduct.  CUSTODIAN AND TRANSFER AGENT 
[                    ] serves as the
Custodian of the assets of the Fund and may maintain custody of such assets with U.S. and foreign subcustodians (which may be banks, trust companies, securities depositories and clearing agencies), subject to policies and procedures approved by the
Board of Trustees. Assets of the Fund are not held by the Adviser or commingled with the assets of other accounts, except to the extent that securities may be held in the name of the Custodian or subcustodians in a securities depository, clearing
agency or omnibus customer account. The Custodians principal business address is [                    ]. 
[                    ] serves as
Transfer Agent with respect to maintaining the registry of the Funds Shareholders and processing matters relating to subscriptions for, and repurchases of Shares.
[                    ]s principal business address is
[                    ]. 
  34 


INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
[                    ] serves as the
independent registered public accounting firm of the Fund. Its principal business address is [                    ]. 
LEGAL COUNSEL  Dechert LLP acts as legal counsel to the Fund. Its principal business address is 1095 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036.  CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES  By virtue of its ownership of more than 25% of outstanding Shares, [                    ] may be deemed
to control the Fund and may be in a position to control the outcome of voting on matters as to which Shareholders are entitled to vote. It is anticipated that
[                    ] will no longer control the Fund as of immediately after completion of the initial offering of the Funds Shares.
[                    ] maintains its principal offices at
[                    ]. 
REPORTS TO SHAREHOLDERS  The Fund will furnish to its Shareholders as soon as practicable after the end of each taxable year such information as is necessary for such Shareholders to complete Federal and state income tax or
information returns, along with any other tax information required by law. The Fund will prepare and transmit to its Shareholders an unaudited semi-annual and an audited annual report within 60 days after the close of the period for which it is
being made, or as otherwise required by the 1940 Act. Monthly reports from the Adviser regarding the Funds operations during each month also will be sent to the Funds Shareholders. In addition, the Fund expects to communicate regularly
with Shareholders through periodic investor conference calls and other events.  FISCAL YEAR
 For accounting purposes, the fiscal year of the Fund is the 12-month period ending on
[                    ]. The 12-month period ending
[                    ] of each year will be the taxable year of the Fund unless otherwise determined by the Fund. 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  No financial information is presented for the Fund because it had not commenced operations as of the date of this SAI.

DESCRIPTION OF RATINGS 
Moodys Investors Service, Inc.   


1.
Long-Term Obligation Ratings  Moodys long-term obligation ratings are opinions of the relative credit risk of fixed-income obligations with an original maturity of one year or more. They address the possibility that a financial
obligation will not be honored as promised. Such ratings reflect both the likelihood of default and any financial loss suffered in the event of default.  Aaa: Obligations rated Aaa are judged to be of the highest quality, with minimal credit risk.  Aa: Obligations rated Aa are judged to be of high quality and are subject to very low credit risk.  A: Obligations rated A are considered upper-medium grade and are subject to low credit risk.  Baa: Obligations rated Baa are subject to moderate credit risk. They are considered medium-grade and as such may possess certain speculative characteristics. 
Ba: Obligations rated Ba are judged to have speculative elements and are subject to substantial credit risk. 
B: Obligations rated B are considered speculative and are subject to high credit risk. 
Caa: Obligations rated Caa are judged to be of poor standing and are subject to very high credit risk. 
Ca: Obligations rated Ca are highly speculative and are likely in, or very near, default, with some prospect of recovery of
principal and interest.  C: Obligations rated C are the lowest rated class of bonds and are typically in default, with
little prospect for recovery of principal or interest.  Moodys appends numerical modifiers 1, 2, and 3 to each generic
rating classification from Aa through Caa. The modifier 1 indicates that the obligation ranks in the higher end of its generic rating category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates a ranking in the lower end of
that generic rating category.   


2.
Short-Term Ratings 
Moodys short-term ratings are opinions of the ability of issuers to honor short-term financial obligations. Ratings may be assigned
to issuers, short-term programs or to individual short-term debt instruments. Such obligations generally have an original maturity not exceeding thirteen months, unless explicitly noted. 
Moodys employs the following designations to indicate the relative repayment ability of rated issuers: 
P-1: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-1 have a superior ability to repay short-term debt obligations. 


P-2: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-2 have a strong ability to
repay short-term debt obligations.  P-3: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Prime-3 have an acceptable ability
to repay short-term obligations.  NP: Issuers (or supporting institutions) rated Not Prime do not fall within any of the
Prime rating categories.  Canadian issuers rated P-1 or P-2 have their short-term ratings enhanced by the senior-most long-term
rating of the issuer, its guarantor or support-provider.   


3.
US Municipal Short-Term Debt Ratings  There are three rating categories for short-term municipal obligations that are considered investment grade. These ratings are designated as Municipal Investment Grade (MIG) and are divided into three
levelsMIG 1 through MIG 3. In addition, those short-term obligations that are of speculative quality are designated SG, or speculative grade. MIG ratings expire at the maturity of the obligation. 
MIG 1: This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by established cash flows, highly
reliable liquidity support, or demonstrated broad-based access to the market for refinancing.  MIG 2: This designation
denotes strong credit quality. Margins of protection are ample, although not as large as in the preceding group.  MIG 3:
This designation denotes acceptable credit quality. Liquidity and cash-flow protection may be narrow, and market access for refinancing is likely to be less well-established.  SG: This designation denotes speculative-grade credit quality. Debt instruments in this category may lack sufficient margins of protection. 
 


4.
Demand Obligation Ratings 
In the case of variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs), a two-component rating is assigned; a long or short-term debt rating and a demand
obligation rating. The first element represents Moodys evaluation of the degree of risk associated with scheduled principal and interest payments. The second element represents Moodys evaluation of the degree of risk associated with the
ability to receive purchase price upon demand (demand feature), using a variation of the MIG rating scale, the Variable Municipal Investment Grade or VMIG rating. When either the long- or short-term aspect of a VRDO is not rated, that
piece is designated NR, e.g., Aaa/NR or NR/VMIG 1. VMIG rating expirations are a function of each issues specific structural or credit features.  VMIG 1: This designation denotes superior credit quality. Excellent protection is afforded by the superior short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections
that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand.  VMIG 2: This designation denotes strong credit quality.
Good protection is afforded by the strong short-term credit strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand. 
VMIG 3: This designation denotes acceptable credit quality. Adequate protection is afforded by the satisfactory short-term credit
strength of the liquidity provider and structural and legal protections that ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand. 


SG: This designation denotes speculative-grade credit quality. Demand features rated
in this category may be supported by a liquidity provider that does not have an investment grade short-term rating or may lack the structural and/or legal protections necessary to ensure the timely payment of purchase price upon demand. 
Standard & Poors Ratings Services   


1.
Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings  Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following considerations:  Likelihood of paymentcapacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation; 
Nature of and provisions of the obligation;  Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors
rights.  Issue ratings are an assessment of default risk, but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate
recovery in the event of default. Junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy, as noted above. (Such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated
obligations, secured and unsecured obligations, or operating company and holding company obligations.)  AAA: An
obligation rated AAA has the highest rating assigned by Standard & Poors. The obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong. 
AA: An obligation rated AA differs from the highest-rated obligations only to a small degree. The obligors
capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong.  A: An obligation rated A is
somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher-rated categories. However, the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still
strong.  BBB: An obligation rated BBB exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic
conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  Obligations rated BB, B, CCC, CC, and C are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. BB indicates the least
degree of speculation and C the highest. While such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions. 
BB: An obligation rated BB is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues. However, it faces major
ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 
B: An obligation rated B is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated BB, but the obligor
currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business, financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.



CCC: An obligation rated CCC is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and
is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the obligor is not likely to have the
capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  CC: An obligation rated CC is currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment.  C: A C rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to
nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents, or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default. Among others, the
C rating may be assigned to subordinated debt, preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange
offer, whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par.  D: An obligation rated D is in payment default. The D rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period
has not expired, unless Standard & Poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period. The D rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if
payments on an obligation are jeopardized. An obligations rating is lowered to D upon completion of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other
instruments having a total value that is less than par.  Plus (+) or minus (-): The ratings from AA to
CCC may be modified by the addition of a plus (+) or minus (-) sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories.  NR: This indicates that no rating has been requested, that there is insufficient information on which to base a rating, or that Standard & Poors does not rate a particular obligation
as a matter of policy.   


2.
Short-Term Issue Credit Ratings  A-1: A short-term obligation rated A-1 is rated in the highest category by Standard & Poors. The obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation is strong. Within this category, certain obligations are designated with a plus sign (+). This indicates that the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on these obligations is extremely strong. 
A-2: A short-term obligation rated A-2 is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances
and economic conditions than obligations in higher rating categories. However, the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is satisfactory.  A-3: A short-term obligation rated A-3 exhibits adequate protection parameters. However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened
capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation.  B: A short-term obligation rated B is
regarded as having significant speculative characteristics. Ratings of B-1, B-2, and B-3 may be assigned to indicate finer distinctions within the B category. The obligor currently has the capacity to
meet its financial commitment on the obligation; however, it faces major ongoing uncertainties which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 


B-1: A short-term obligation rated B-1 is regarded as having significant
speculative characteristics, but the obligor has a relatively stronger capacity to meet its financial commitments over the short-term compared to other speculative-grade obligors. 
B-2: A short-term obligation rated B-2 is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics, and the obligor
has an average speculative-grade capacity to meet its financial commitments over the short-term compared to other speculative-grade obligors.  B-3: A short-term obligation rated B-3 is regarded as having significant speculative characteristics, and the obligor has a relatively weaker capacity to meet its financial commitments
over the short-term compared to other speculative-grade obligors.  C: A short-term obligation rated C is
currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. 
D: A short-term obligation rated D is in payment default. The D rating category is used when payments on an
obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard & Poors believes that such payments will be made during such grace period. The D rating also will be used upon
the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized.  Dual
Ratings: Standard & Poors assigns dual ratings to all debt issues that have a put option or demand feature as part of their structure. The first rating addresses the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest as
due, and the second rating addresses only the demand feature. The long-term rating symbols are used for bonds to denote the long-term maturity and the short-term rating symbols for the put option (for example, AAA/A-1+). With U.S.
municipal short-term demand debt, note rating symbols are used with the short-term issue credit rating symbols (for example, SP-1+/A-1+).   


3.
Active Qualifiers (currently applied and/or outstanding)  i: This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, terms, or both, that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of interest are different from the credit factors, terms or
both that determine the likelihood of receipt of principal on the obligation. The i subscript indicates that the rating addresses the interest portion of the obligation only. The i subscript will always be used in conjunction
with the p subscript, which addresses likelihood of receipt of principal. For example, a rated obligation could be assigned ratings of AAAp NRi indicating that the principal portion is rated AAA and the interest
portion of the obligation is not rated.  L: Ratings qualified with L apply only to amounts invested up to
federal deposit insurance limits.  p: This subscript is used for issues in which the credit factors, the terms, or both,
that determine the likelihood of receipt of payment of principal are different from the credit factors, terms or both that determine the likelihood of receipt of interest on the obligation. The p subscript indicates that the rating
addresses the principal portion of the obligation only. The p subscript will always be used in conjunction with the i subscript, which addresses likelihood of receipt of interest. For example, a rated obligation could be
assigned ratings of AAAp NRi indicating that the principal portion is rated AAA and the interest portion of the obligation is not rated.  pi: Ratings with a pi subscript are based on an analysis of an issuers published financial information, as well as additional information in the public domain. They do not,
however, reflect in-depth meetings with an issuers management and therefore may be based on less comprehensive information than ratings without a pi subscript. Ratings with a pi subscript are reviewed annually based on
a new years financial statements, but may be reviewed on an interim basis if a major event occurs that may affect the issuers credit quality. 


Preliminary: Preliminary ratings, with the prelim qualifier, may be assigned to
obligors or obligations, including financial programs, in the circumstances described below. Assignment of a final rating is conditional on the receipt by Standard & Poors of appropriate documentation. Standard & Poors
reserves the right not to issue a final rating. Moreover, if a final rating is issued, it may differ from the preliminary rating.   


 

 
 Preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations, most commonly structured and project finance issues, pending receipt of final documentation and
legal opinions.   


 

 
 Preliminary ratings are assigned to Rule 415 Shelf Registrations. As specific issues, with defined terms, are offered from the master registration, a
final rating may be assigned to them in accordance with Standard & Poors policies.   


 

 
 Preliminary ratings may be assigned to obligations that will likely be issued upon the obligors emergence from bankruptcy or similar
reorganization, based on late-stage reorganization plans, documentation and discussions with the obligor. Preliminary ratings may also be assigned to the obligors. These ratings consider the anticipated general credit quality of the reorganized or
post bankruptcy issuer as well as attributes of the anticipated obligation(s).   


 

 
 Preliminary ratings may be assigned to entities that are being formed or that are in the process of being independently established when, in
Standard & Poors opinion, documentation is close to final. Preliminary ratings may also be assigned to these entities obligations. 
 


 

 
 Preliminary ratings may be assigned when a previously unrated entity is undergoing a well-formulated restructuring, recapitalization, significant
financing or other transformative event, generally at the point that investor or lender commitments are invited. The preliminary rating may be assigned to the entity and to its proposed obligation(s). These preliminary ratings consider the
anticipated general credit quality of the obligor, as well as attributes of the anticipated obligation(s), assuming successful completion of the transformative event. Should the transformative event not occur, Standard & Poors would
likely withdraw these preliminary ratings.   


 

 
 A preliminary recovery rating may be assigned to an obligation that has a preliminary issue credit rating. 
sf: This qualifier is assigned to all issues and issuers to which a regulation, such as the European Union Regulation on Credit
Rating Agencies, requires the assignment of an additional symbol which distinguishes a structured finance instrument or obligor (as defined in the regulation) from any other instrument or obligor. The addition of this subscript to a credit rating
does not change the definition of that rating or our opinion about the issues or issuers creditworthiness. 
t: This symbol indicates termination structures that are designed to honor their contracts to full maturity or, should certain
events occur, to terminate and cash settle all their contracts before their final maturity date.  Unsolicited: Unsolicited
ratings are those credit ratings assigned at the initiative of Standard & Poors and not at the request of the issuer or its agents. 




4.
Inactive Qualifiers (no longer applied or outstanding)  *: This symbol indicated continuance of the ratings is contingent upon Standard & Poors receipt of an executed copy of the escrow agreement or closing documentation confirming
investments and cash flows. Discontinued use in August 1998.  c: This qualifier was used to provide additional
information to investors that the bank may terminate its obligation to purchase tendered bonds if the long-term credit rating of the issuer is below an investment-grade level and/or the issuers bonds are deemed taxable. Discontinued use in
January 2001.  pr: The letters pr indicated that the rating was provisional. A provisional rating assumed
the successful completion of the project financed by the debt being rated and indicated that payment of debt service requirements was largely or entirely dependent upon the successful, timely completion of the project. This rating, however, while
addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project, made no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion.  q: A q subscript indicated that the rating was based solely on quantitative analysis of publicly available information. Discontinued use in April 2001. 
r: The r modifier was assigned to securities containing extraordinary risks, particularly market risks, that are not
covered in the credit rating. The absence of an r modifier should not be taken as an indication that an obligation will not exhibit extraordinary non-credit related risks. Standard & Poors discontinued the use of the
r modifier for most obligations in June 2000 and for the balance of obligations (mainly structured finance transactions) in November 2002.  Local Currency and Foreign Currency Risks: Country risk considerations are a standard part of Standard & Poors analysis for credit ratings on any issuer or issue. Currency of repayment
is a key factor in this analysis. An obligors capacity to repay foreign currency obligations may be lower than its capacity to repay obligations in its local currency due to the sovereign governments own relatively lower capacity to
repay external versus domestic debt. These sovereign risk considerations are incorporated in the debt ratings assigned to specific issues. Foreign currency issuer ratings are also distinguished from local currency issuer ratings to identify those
instances where sovereign risks make them different for the same issuer.  Fitch, Inc. 
 


1.
Long-Term Ratings Scales 
AAA: Highest credit quality. AAA ratings denote the lowest expectation of credit risk. They are assigned only in case
of exceptionally strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is highly unlikely to be adversely affected by foreseeable events.  AA: Very high credit quality. AA ratings denote expectations of very low credit risk. They indicate very strong capacity for timely payment of financial commitments. This capacity is
not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.  A: High credit quality. A ratings denote expectations
of low credit risk. The capacity for payment of financial commitments is considered strong. This capacity may, nevertheless, be more vulnerable to adverse business or economic conditions than is the case for higher ratings. 
BBB: Good credit quality. BBB ratings indicate that expectations of credit risk are currently low. The capacity for
payment of financial commitments is considered adequate, but adverse business or economic conditions are more likely to impair this capacity. 


BB: Speculative. BB ratings indicate an elevated vulnerability to credit
risk, particularly in the event of adverse changes in business or economic conditions over time; however, business or financial alternatives may be available to allow financial commitments to be met. 
B: Highly speculative. B ratings indicate that material credit risk is present. 
CCC: Substantial credit risk. CCC ratings indicate that substantial credit risk is present. 
CC: Very high levels of credit risk. CC ratings indicate very high levels of credit risk. 
C: Exceptionally high levels of credit risk. Default is imminent or inevitable, or the issuer is in standstill. Conditions that are
indicative of a C category rating for an issuer include:   


 

 
 the issuer has entered into a grace or cure period following non-payment of a material financial obligation; 
 


 

 
 the issuer has entered into a temporary negotiated waiver or standstill agreement following a payment default on a material financial obligation; or
  


 

 
 Fitch Ratings otherwise believes a condition of RD or D to be imminent or inevitable, including through the formal announcement
of a distressed debt exchange.  RD: Restricted default. RD ratings indicate an issuer that in
Fitch Ratings opinion has experienced an uncured payment default on a bond, loan or other material financial obligation but which has not entered into bankruptcy filings, administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up
procedure, and which has not otherwise ceased operating. This would include:   


 

 
 the selective payment default on a specific class or currency of debt; 
 


 

 
 the uncured expiry of any applicable grace period, cure period or default forbearance period following a payment default on a bank loan, capital
markets security or other material financial obligation;   


 

 
 the extension of multiple waivers or forbearance periods upon a payment default on one or more material financial obligations, either in series or in
parallel; or   


 

 
 execution of a distressed debt exchange on one or more material financial obligations. 
D: Default. D ratings indicate an issuer that in Fitch Ratings opinion has entered into bankruptcy filings,
administration, receivership, liquidation or other formal winding-up procedure, or which has otherwise ceased business. 
Default ratings are not assigned prospectively to entities or their obligations; within this context, non-payment on an instrument that
contains a deferral feature or grace period will generally not be considered a default until after the expiration of the deferral or grace period, unless a default is otherwise driven by bankruptcy or other similar circumstance, or by a distressed
debt exchange.  Imminent default typically refers to the occasion where a payment default has been intimated by the
issuer, and is all but inevitable. This may, for example, be where an issuer has missed a scheduled 



payment, but (as is typical) has a grace period during which it may cure the payment default. Another alternative would be where an issuer has formally announced a distressed debt exchange, but
the date of the exchange still lies several days or weeks in the immediate future.  In all cases, the assignment of a default
rating reflects the agencys opinion as to the most appropriate rating category consistent with the rest of its universe of ratings, and may differ from the definition of default under the terms of an issuers financial obligations or
local commercial practice.  The modifiers + or - may be appended to a rating to denote relative status
within major rating categories. Such suffixes are not added to the AAA Long-Term category, or to Long-Term categories below B.   


2.
Short-Term Credit Ratings 
A short-term issuer or obligation rating is based in all cases on the short-term vulnerability to default of the rated entity or security
stream, and relates to the capacity to meet financial obligations in accordance with the documentation governing the relevant obligation. Short-Term Ratings are assigned to obligations whose initial maturity is viewed as short term based
on market convention. Typically, this means up to 13 months for corporate, structured and sovereign obligations, and up to 36 months for obligations in US public finance markets. 
F1: Highest short-term credit quality. Indicates the strongest intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments; may
have an added + to denote any exceptionally strong credit feature.  F2: Good short-term credit quality. Good
intrinsic capacity for timely payment of financial commitments.  F3: Fair short-term credit quality. The intrinsic
capacity for timely payment of financial commitments is adequate.  B: Speculative short-term credit quality. Minimal
capacity for timely payment of financial commitments, plus heightened vulnerability to near term adverse changes in financial and economic conditions.  C: High short-term default risk. Default is a real possibility.  RD:
Restricted default. Indicates an entity that has defaulted on one or more of its financial commitments, although it continues to meet other financial obligations. Applicable to entity ratings only. 
D: Default. Indicates a broad-based default event for an entity, or the default of a specific short-term obligation. 
 


3.
Recovery Ratings 
Recovery Ratings are assigned to selected individual securities and obligations. These currently are published for most individual
obligations of corporate issuers with ratings in the B rating category and below.  Among the factors that affect
recovery rates for securities are the collateral, the seniority relative to other obligations in the capital structure (where appropriate), and the expected value of the company or underlying collateral in distress. 


The Recovery Rating scale is based upon the expected relative recovery characteristics of an
obligation upon the curing of a default, emergence from insolvency or following the liquidation or termination of the obligor or its associated collateral. For structured finance, Recovery Ratings are designed to estimate recoveries on a
forward-looking basis while taking into account the time value of money.  Recovery Ratings are an ordinal scale and do not
attempt to precisely predict a given level of recovery. As a guideline in developing the rating assessments, the agency employs broad theoretical recovery bands in its ratings approach based on historical averages, but actual recoveries for a given
security may deviate materially from historical averages.  RR1: Outstanding recovery prospects given default.
RR1 rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering 91%-100% of current principal and related interest.  RR2: Superior recovery prospects given default. RR2 rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering 71%-90% of current principal and
related interest.  RR3: Good recovery prospects given default. RR3 rated securities have
characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering 51%-70% of current principal and related interest.  RR4:
Average recovery prospects given default. RR4 rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering 31%-50% of current principal and related interest. 
RR5: Below average recovery prospects given default. RR5 rated securities have characteristics consistent
with securities historically recovering 11%-30% of current principal and related interest.  RR6: Poor recovery
prospects given default. RR6 rated securities have characteristics consistent with securities historically recovering 0%-10% of current principal and related interest.

 ITEM 28. PERSONS CONTROLLED BY OR UNDER COMMON CONTROL 
No person is directly or indirectly under common control with Registrant, except that the Registrant may be deemed to be controlled by
EnTrust Partners LLC (the Adviser), the investment adviser to the Registrant. The Adviser was formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 21, 1998. Additional information regarding the Adviser is set out in its Form
ADV, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC File No. 801-56043).  ITEM 29 NUMBER OF HOLDERS OF SECURITIES
 Title of Class: Shares of Beneficial Ownership. Number of Record Holders: 0. 
ITEM 30. INDEMNIFICATION  Reference is made to [Article 5.2] of Registrants Agreement and Declaration of Trust [filed as] Exhibit 2(a)(2) to this Registration Statement. Insofar as indemnification for liabilities
arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to the Investment Adviser, officers and controlling persons of Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions or otherwise, Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by
Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by the Investment Adviser, officer or controlling person of Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by the Investment Adviser, officer or controlling person,
Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue. 


Registrant hereby undertakes that it will apply the indemnification provisions of the
Agreement and Declaration of Trust in a manner consistent with Investment Company Act Release No. 11330 (Sept. 4, 1980) issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, so long as the interpretation of Sections 17(h) and 17(i) of the
1940 Act contained in that release remains in effect. Registrant, in conjunction with the Adviser and Registrants Board of Trustees, maintains insurance on behalf of any person who is or was an Independent Trustee, officer, employee, or agent
of Registrant, against certain liability asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her or arising out of his or her position. In no event, however, will Registrant pay that portion of the premium, if any, for insurance to indemnify any such
person or any act for which Registrant itself is not permitted to indemnify.  ITEM 31. BUSINESS AND OTHER CONNECTIONS OF INVESTMENT
ADVISER  A description of any other business, profession, vocation, or employment of a substantial nature in which the
Investment Adviser, and each managing director, executive officer or partner of the Investment Adviser, is or has been, at any time during the past two fiscal years, engaged in for his or her own account or in the capacity of director, officer,
employee, partner or trustee, is set out in Registrants Prospectus in the section entitled Management of the Fund and in the section of the Statement of Additional Information captioned Management of the Fund. The
information required by this Item 31 with respect to each director, officer or partner of the Investment Adviser is incorporated by reference to Form ADV, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, as amended (File No. 801-56043).  ITEM 32. LOCATION OF ACCOUNTS AND RECORDS 
The Administrator maintains certain required accounting related and financial books and records of Registrant at
[                    ]. The other required books and records are maintained by the Adviser at 375 Park Avenue, 24th Floor, New York, NY 10152. 
ITEM 33. MANAGEMENT SERVICES  Not Applicable.  ITEM 34. UNDERTAKINGS 
(1) The Registrant hereby undertakes to suspend the offering of its shares until it amends its prospectus if (a) subsequent to the effective date of
its registration statement, the net asset value declines more than 10 percent from its net asset value as of the effective date of the Registration Statement or (b) the net asset value increases to an amount greater than its net proceeds as
stated in the prospectus.  (2) Not Applicable.  (3) Not Applicable.  (4) The Registrant hereby undertakes: 
(a) to file, during any period in which offers or sales are being made, a post-effective amendment to the registration statement:
 (1) to include any prospectus required by Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933; 


(2) to reflect in the prospectus any facts or events after the effective date of the
registration statement (or the most recent post-effective amendment thereof) which, individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement; and 
(3) to include any material information with respect to the plan of distribution not previously disclosed in the registration statement
or any material change to such information in the registration statement;  (b) that, for the purpose of determining any
liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each such post-effective amendment shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of those securities at that time shall be deemed to be the
initial bona fide offering thereof; and  (c) to remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment any of the
securities being registered which remain unsold at the termination of the offering.  (5)(a) For the purposes of determining any liability
under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted form the form of prospectus filed as part of a registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in the form of prospectus filed by the Registrant under Rule 497 (h) under
the Securities Act of 1933 shall be deemed to be part of the Registration Statement as of the time it was declared effective. 
(b) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of
prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of the securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof. 
(6) The Registrant undertakes to send by first class mail or other means designed to ensure equally prompt delivery within two business days of receipt
of a written or oral request, any Statement of Additional Information. 


SIGNATURES  Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of 1940, EnTrust Multi-Strategy Master Fund has duly caused this Registration Statement to be signed on its behalf
by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of New York and State of New York on the 8th day of May, 2013.
