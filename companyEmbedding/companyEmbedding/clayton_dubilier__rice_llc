Firm History

			We were founded in 1978 by Joe Rice, a former corporate lawyer from Sullivan & Cromwell and former investment banker; Martin Dubilier, a former McKinsey & Company partner and experienced corporate executive; Gene Clayton, a well-known crisis manager; and Bill Welsh, also a proven operating executive from Raytheon.  With 35 years of history, CD&R today is recognized as one of the most experienced and respected private equity firms.  We have institutionalized our distinctive approach to private equity investing – an approach that has become the reference point for blending investment skills with operating capabilities to build great businesses.
			
			Our reputation as a business builder was established by such landmark transactions as the buyout of Harris Graphics in 1983, at the time one of the largest ever corporate divestiture accomplished by means of a private equity buyout structure, and the creation of Lexmark International from IBM’s printer and supplies business in 1991.  The Firm and its investments have been the subject of numerous articles, including several case studies in the Harvard Business Review (“HBR”).  In a 1995 HBR article that focused on the Firm and its culture, the authors concluded that CD&R provides important “insights into what constitutes best practice in the ownership and governance of corporate enterprises.”  David Swenson, Chief Investment Officer of the Yale Investment Management Company, in his book Pioneering Portfolio Management (2009) stated that “by combining operational and financial skills, CD&R exemplifies the potential for unusual value creation.”
			
			Joe Rice assumed the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 1991. Don Gogel became Chief Executive Officer in 1999 and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer in 2012.  Jack Welch, former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of General Electric, became a Senior Advisor in 2001, and Sir Terry Leahy, former Chief Executive of Tesco, became a Senior Advisor in 2011, supplementing the Firm’s renowned group of full-time operating partners from some of the world’s most successful companies as well as operating advisors who are engaged by our funds.

Strategy

      We were founded on a simple premise: good investments result from sound decision-making; and, good businesses are built with a commitment to operational excellence.  Since our founding in 1978, we have never wavered from these principles.
      

            Good investments result
            from sound decision-making;
            and, good businesses are
            built with a commitment to
            operational excellence
          
      We work collaboratively with corporate and family business sellers on transactions to maximize value.  Many corporations, CEOs and entrepreneurs select CD&R as their partner because of our strong reputation for trustworthiness and operational leadership.
      
      We practice investing as a craft, relying on a dedicated and cohesive team with a shared sense of purpose and values.  Our investment approach blends skilled investment judgment with extensive experience driving growth and operating excellence.  
      
      Our Partners come from globally-recognized businesses that have long been known for the quality of their people – ABB, Allstate, Disney, Emerson Electric, The Gap, GE and Unilever as well as Goldman Sachs, McKinsey & Company and Morgan Stanley, among others.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/type.object.type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

Download



The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Overview

			Based in New York and London, CD&R’s professionals reflect two different skill
			sets: our financial partners are experienced private equity investment professionals from 
			the world’s premier financial institutions and management advisory firms, whereas 
			our operating partners have collectively spent more than 300 years in senior management
			positions across a wide range of industry sectors at over 50 companies, notably ABB, BBA, BTR, Emerson Electric, GE, IBM and Unilever. 
			

            Operating Partners have 
            collectively spent more 
            than 300 years in 
            Senior Management positions
          
			Our Operating Partners participate in every phase of the investment process. They work closely with CD&R’s financial investment professionals on sourcing and due diligence, offering insights about the specific opportunities to boost productivity, innovation, product quality, revenue growth and profits. Together with the Financial Partners, they make judgments about strategy, senior leadership, human resource management systems, and practices in a wide variety of business functions. Operating Partners assume a particularly important role driving the post-acquisition business plan, management oversight, organizational effectiveness and value-building initiatives at portfolio companies. An Operating Partner or Operating Advisor serves as chairman, chairman of the executive committee, or lead director for each of the Firm’s portfolio companies.
						
			Financial partners focus on sourcing, financing or exiting investments, which includes developing relationships and a pipeline of investment ideas from intermediaries and corporate management teams and board members, originating new investment opportunities, conducting comprehensive due diligence on potential investments, structuring and financing new acquisitions and managing exit processes. They also work closely with Operating Partners and Operating Advisors on key strategic and operational initiatives at our portfolio companies.
			
			CD&R functions as a true partnership with a clear sense of shared purpose. Each Partner has different strengths and competencies, but all play important roles in sourcing transactions, conducting due diligence, making investment decisions and managing portfolio companies.
			

			From time to time in this website, reference is made to the “partners”, “financial partners” and “operating partners” of CD&R. These terms are used because they reflect the way in which the senior professionals of CD&R refer to themselves internally. Technically, however, such individuals are not “partners” of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, which is a limited liability company. They instead are officers, employees, limited partners or members of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and its affiliates.

Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to Acquire Largest Distributor of Waterworks Products in the U.S.
Carve-Out of HD Supply's Waterworks Division Valued at $2.5 Billion


























NEW YORK, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Clayton, Dubilier & Rice ("CD&R") today announced an agreement with HD Supply Holding, Inc.                 

/quotes/zigman/17064684/composite HDS
+0.71%


 to acquire its Waterworks business unit ("Waterworks"), the nation's largest distributor of water, sewer, storm and fire protection products, for $2.5 billion. Through a carve-out transaction, Waterworks will become an independent company, wholly-owned by CD&R funds.


                                        








Waterworks is a leading U.S. distributor of industrial and construction products used to build and maintain underground water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure networks. The company operates a national network of 244 branches in 46 states with a sales team of more than 1,700 sales representatives serving a diverse customer base of more than 37,000 municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. Waterworks will continue to be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.


                                        








Jim Berges, a CD&R Partner, will serve as Chairman of Waterworks.  Mr. Berges was Chairman of HD Supply from 2007 to 2015. CD&R invested in HD Supply in 2007 and exited the investment in 2014.  Previously, Mr. Berges served as Vice Chairman and President of Emerson Electric Co.


                                        








Steve LeClair, who has served as the President of Waterworks since 2011, will become the chief executive officer.  "This transaction is an important milestone in the strategic growth of Waterworks," said Mr. LeClair. "The Waterworks team is very excited to reunite with CD&R to accelerate our growth and productivity initiatives."


                                        








"Waterworks represents an attractive opportunity to invest in the leading distributor in the U.S. waterworks market, which stands to benefit from tailwinds in construction activity and municipal infrastructure spending," said CD&R Partner J.L. Zrebiec.  "With strong national, regional and local positions and a reputation for customer service and reliability, the company is in a very favorable long-term position."


                                        








"Through our prior investment in HD Supply, we have a great appreciation for the strength and quality of the Waterworks business and the exceptionally talented Waterworks management team," said CD&R Partner Nate Sleeper. "We are very excited to work alongside them once again to continue to build on the company's leading market position and pursue the many significant profitable growth opportunities available to it as a freestanding business."

Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC. Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC acted as financial advisors to CD&R. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as CD&R's legal advisor in the transaction.

Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to Acquire Largest Distributor of Waterworks Products in the U.S.

Carve-Out of HD Supply's Waterworks Division Valued at $2.5 Billion




Jun 6, 2017, 6:05am EDT














NEW YORK, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Clayton, Dubilier & Rice ("CD&R") today announced an agreement with HD Supply Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ: HDS) to acquire its Waterworks business unit ("Waterworks"), the nation's largest distributor of water, sewer, storm and fire protection products, for $2.5 billion. Through a carve-out transaction, Waterworks will become an independent company, wholly-owned by CD&R funds. 
Waterworks is a leading U.S. distributor of industrial and construction products used to build and maintain underground water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure networks. The company operates a national network of 244 branches in 46 states with a sales team of more than 1,700 sales representatives serving a diverse customer base of more than 37,000 municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. Waterworks will continue to be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.
Jim Berges, a CD&R Partner, will serve as Chairman of Waterworks.  Mr. Berges was Chairman of HD Supply from 2007 to 2015. CD&R invested in HD Supply in 2007 and exited the investment in 2014.  Previously, Mr. Berges served as Vice Chairman and President of Emerson Electric Co. 
Steve LeClair, who has served as the President of Waterworks since 2011, will become the chief executive officer.  "This transaction is an important milestone in the strategic growth of Waterworks," said Mr. LeClair. "The Waterworks team is very excited to reunite with CD&R to accelerate our growth and productivity initiatives." 
"Waterworks represents an attractive opportunity to invest in the leading distributor in the U.S. waterworks market, which stands to benefit from tailwinds in construction activity and municipal infrastructure spending," said CD&R Partner J.L. Zrebiec.  "With strong national, regional and local positions and a reputation for customer service and reliability, the company is in a very favorable long-term position." 
"Through our prior investment in HD Supply, we have a great appreciation for the strength and quality of the Waterworks business and the exceptionally talented Waterworks management team," said CD&R Partner Nate Sleeper. "We are very excited to work alongside them once again to continue to build on the company's leading market position and pursue the many significant profitable growth opportunities available to it as a freestanding business."
CD&R has obtained committed financing from Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch; Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC. Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC acted as financial advisors to CD&R. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as CD&R's legal advisor in the transaction.
