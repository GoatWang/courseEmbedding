Book your stay today to Hedonism II Resort Jamaica with Lifestyles Tours and Travel.Hedonism II - Negril, JamaicaBe Wicked for a Week !From the moment Hedonism II's gates opened over 30 years ago, it's been the most widely recognized resorts in the world. Words really can't quite describe the thrill of actually being here. It's the ultimate guilty pleasure, only without the guilt.The resort has 280 rooms located in a tropical beach scene with separate two-story buildings with two twin or king beds in each room. Some rooms face the beach, some are garden view locations. The resort is arguably the "Mother of all inclusive, adults only resorts" and has a world-wide reputation for fun and frolic. Our clients who visit Hedonism II come from every continent in the world and they're there for one reason -- to have fun. If you like to read a book and chill out, you can do that, but this place is so active with lots of interesting people, you may miss some of the greatest opportunities to meet the most fun loving people... from all over the world.If you're wondering what a typical day at Hedonism II is really like, ask anybody who's been here. Chances are they'll all tell you the same thing: "There's no such thing as a typical day at Hedonism II." No two days are ever alike. Sure, the water's always warm and the sun's always bright, but the resort's true character is shaped by the people who visit. One thing's for sure - there's never a dull moment at Hedonism II.Some say it's because of the magical potions served up at the bar. Others attribute it to powerful aphrodisiacs found in the native fruits. And then of course, it could just be the mirrors on the ceilings of every guest room. But whatever it is, it seems that everyone at Hedonism II develops a little more enthusiasm for all things romantic. Best of all, what happens here, stays here. It's the unwritten code of true Hedonists.Sooner or later, it's gonna happen. The primal urge to just let go. Unwind. Unplug. You're not alone. Hedonism II on world-famous Negril Beach was created as a reward for all those times you've had to deny your basic instincts. In these lush gardens of pure pleasure, the word "no&qut; is seldom heard.Everything You've Heard Is True !! It's true. The rumors, the legends, the myths. All true. For more than thirty years, Hedonism Resorts have enjoyed a reputation for shattering inhibitions and provoking the kind of behavior people don't talk about in polite circles. It's what happens when you combine warm water, a white-sand beach, open bars and open minds. This is about as far as you can get from your everyday life. And best of all, just about everything you can eat, drink and do is included.Hedonism is a sandbox for your inner child, nourishment for the mind, body, spirit and soul. Pleasure comes in many forms. Choose one. Or two. Or more. After a week at Hedonism, you'll view the world from a slightly different angle. You'll be tanned and relaxed. And at times you'll find yourself smiling for no reason whatsoever. Hedonism, there's nothing else on earth quite like it. Need Help ?Reservation Agents are standing by to assist you!(888) 970-4588Direct: (702) 359-1174

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
