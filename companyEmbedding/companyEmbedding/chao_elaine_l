Early life and education[edit]
Chao was born in Taipei, Taiwan.[3] The eldest of six daughters, Chao was born to Ruth Mulan Chu Chao (趙朱木蘭), a historian, and James S.C. Chao (趙錫成), who began his career as a merchant mariner and founded a successful shipping company in New York City called Foremost Shipping.[8] Chao's parents had fled to Taiwan from Shanghai in China after the Chinese Communists took over following the Chinese Civil War in 1949. When she was 8 years old, in 1961, she came to the United States on a freight ship along with her mother and two younger sisters, a long journey that took 37 days. Her father had arrived in New York three years earlier after receiving a scholarship.[9][10]
Chao attended Tsai Hsing Elementary School in Taipei for kindergarten and first grade,[3][11] and subsequently attended Syosset High School in Syosset, New York, on Long Island.[12] She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen at the age of 19.[13]
She received a bachelor of arts in Economics from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1975.[14] While at Mount Holyoke, she worked for the Admissions Department, and the Economics Department, edited the yearbook, played field hockey and was a member of the horseback riding club. In the first semester of her junior year Elaine was co-editor in chief of the yearbook. In the second semester of her junior year she did a domestic exchange to Dartmouth College, where she studied money and banking.
She received a MBA degree from Harvard Business School in 1979. While at Harvard Business School she was the first woman at Harvard to be elected class officer and class marshall. She was a member of the finance club, the financial accounting club, the international business club and the transportation club.
Chao has received 36 honorary doctorates,[15] including an honorary DHL degree from Georgetown University in 2015.[16]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before entering politics, Chao was Vice President for syndications at Bank of America Capital Markets Group in San Francisco, California, and an International Banker at Citicorp in New York for four years.[17]
She was granted a White House Fellowship in 1983 during the Reagan Administration.[18]
In 1986, Chao became Deputy Administrator of the Maritime Administration in the U.S. Department of Transportation. From 1988 to 1989, she served as Chairwoman of the Federal Maritime Commission.[19] In 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Chao to be Deputy Secretary of Transportation, serving from 1989 to 1991.[20] From 1991 to 1992, she was the Director of the Peace Corps.[19] She was the first Asian Pacific American to serve in any of these positions. She expanded the Peace Corps's presence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia by establishing the first Peace Corps programs in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.[21][22]
United Way and Heritage Foundation[edit]
Following her service in the government, Chao worked for four years as President and CEO of United Way of America.[23][24] She is credited with returning credibility and public trust in the organization after a financial mismanagement scandal involving former president William Aramony. From 1996 until her appointment as Secretary of Labor, Chao was a Distinguished Fellow with The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.[25] She was also a board member of the Independent Women's Forum.[26] She returned to the Heritage Foundation after leaving the government in January 2009.[27]
U.S. Secretary of Labor (2001–2009)[edit]

Chao was the only cabinet member in the George W. Bush administration to serve for the entirety of his eight years.[29] She was also the longest-serving Secretary of Labor since Frances Perkins, who served from 1933 to 1945, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[30]
According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration statistics, in 2007 – six years into Chao's tenure – "the workplace fatality rate... declined 14 percent since 2001, and since 2002, the workplace injury and illness rate... dropped 21 percent – with both at all time lows."[31] Under her leadership, the U.S. Department of Labor undertook regulatory and legislative reforms in "protecting the health, safety, wages, and retirement security" of U.S. workers by "recovering record levels of back wages and monetary recoveries for pension plans, and obtaining record financial settlements for discrimination by federal contractors." She also restructured departmental programs and modernized regulations.[32] Over the course of her tenure, the Department reduced their discretionary budget from $11.7 billion to $11.6 billion and was the first cabinet-level agency to have been rated "green" by the Office of Management and Budget, having exhibited excellence in budget management practices in every area.[33]
Union disclosure requirements[edit]
In 2002, a major West Coast ports dispute costing the U.S. economy nearly $1 billion daily was resolved when the Bush administration obtained a national emergency injunction against both the employers and the union under the Taft–Hartley Act for the first time since 1971.[34] Led by Chao In 2003, for the first time in more than 40 years, the Department updated the labor union financial disclosure regulations under the Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959, which created more extensive disclosure requirements for union-sponsored pension plans and other trusts to prevent embezzlement or other financial mismanagement.[35]
In 2004, the Department issued revisions of the white-collar overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[36]
Government Accountability Office reports[edit]




Chao's official Secretary of Labor photo


After analyzing 70,000 closed case files from 2005 to 2007, the Government Accountability Office reported that the Department's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) inadequately investigated complaints from low- and minimum-wage workers alleging that employers failed to pay the federal minimum wage, required overtime, and failed to issue a last paycheck.[37][38]
A 2008 Government Accountability Office report noted that the Labor Department gave Congress inaccurate numbers that understated the expense of contracting out its employees' work to private firms during Chao's tenure.[39][40]
Mining regulation[edit]
A 2007 report by the department's inspector general found that mine safety regulators did not conduct federally required inspections at more than 14% of the country's 731 underground coal mines, and that the number of worker deaths in mining accidents more than doubled to 47.[41] Subsequently, on December 10, 2008, Chao announced that the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had, for the first time in the agency's 31-year history, achieved its goal of completing every mandated regular inspection for the year, then consisting of 14,800 active mining operations. This announcement was made within the first year of the agency's "100 Percent Plan," which was launched by the MSHA in October 2007 to improve the completion of quarterly and biannual inspections.[42]
OSHA statistics for 2007 and 2008 revealed that overall workplace fatality rates and workplace injury and illness rates were "both at all-time lows."[31][43] A 2009 internal audit appraising an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initiative focusing on problematic workplaces, however, stated that employees had failed to gather needed data, conducted uneven inspections and enforcement, and failed to discern repeat fatalities because records misspelled the companies' names or failed to notice when two subsidiaries with the same owner were involved.[44]
Post-Bush administration (2009–2017)[edit]

In 2009 Chao resumed her previous role as a Distinguished Fellow at The Heritage Foundation,[27] and she contributed to Fox News and other media outlets.[45]
She also served as a director on a number of corporate and non-profit boards,[17][46] including the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Wells Fargo,[47] NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, News Corp,[48] Dole Food Company,[49] and Protective Life Corporation.[50][51][52] In June 2011, she was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.[53]
In January 2015 she resigned from the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which she had joined in 2012,[54] because of its plans to significantly increase support for the Sierra Club's "Beyond Coal" initiative.[55]
In 2011 and 2013, Chao attended Shanghai signing ceremonies for Capesize bulkers launched by the Foremost Group, her father's company, where she spoke publicly about U.S.–China relations.[56] At the 2013 ceremony, Chao stated, "The U.S.-China relations[hip] is among the most important bilateral relationships in the world. And as such, there is no other alternative but to have a harmonious and a cooperative relationship. As with any relationship, there are bound to be ups, downs, disagreements, but in the overall scheme of things, in the overall direction, for the benefit of the world, [the] U.S. and China must get along, and must find a way to do so."[57]
In 2013, Chao recorded a motivational video to inspire Asian-American children.[58]
In February 2017, it was reported by the Associated Press that Chao had been paid five-figure sums by organizations linked to the People's Mujahedin of Iran (aka Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK), an exile group that was previously described as "cult-like" by the State Department, in exchange for making two speeches in 2015–16.[59][60] The MEK had previously claimed responsibility for the assassination of U.S. Army Lt. Col. Lewis L. Hawkins, the deputy chief of the U.S. military mission to Tehran in 1973.[61] However, the group was delisted as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, with the US government acknowledging that the organization had renounced violence.[62]
Chao is a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute.[63] She also organized the "orientation for the spouses of Republican senators" in Washington, D.C.[7]

Republican President-elect Donald Trump nominated Chao to Secretary of Transportation.[5] The U.S. Senate confirmed Chao on January 31, 2017 by a vote of 93–6.[6]
Personal life[edit]
In 1993, Chao married Mitch McConnell, the senior U.S. Senator from Kentucky and the eventual Senate Majority Leader. They were introduced by Stuart Bloch, an early friend of McConnell's, and his wife Julia Chang Bloch, a Chinese American and a future U.S. Ambassador to Nepal, the first Asian American to serve as US Ambassador, who mentored Chao. Bloch described Chao as a "tiger wife," a reference to Amy Chua's 2011 book about her disciplinarian parenting style. Previously, she had dated C. Boyden Gray, the White House Counsel to President George H. W. Bush.[7]
The University of Louisville's Ekstrom Library opened the "McConnell-Chao Archives" in November 2009. It is a major component of the university's McConnell Center.[64][65]
In an interview with CNN, Chao said she sometimes regrets not having children, and she counseled young women that there are trade-offs in life.[66]
Husband's campaigning[edit]
In the two years leading up to the 2014 U.S. Senate elections, she "headlined fifty of her own events and attended hundreds more with and on behalf of" her husband and was seen as "a driving force of his reelection campaign" and eventual victory over Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who had portrayed McConnell as "anti-woman."[67] After winning the election, McConnell said, "The biggest asset I have by far is the only Kentucky woman who served in a president's cabinet, my wife, Elaine Chao."[68]
She has been described by Jan Karzen, a longtime friend of McConnell's, as adding "a softer touch" to McConnell's style by speaking of him "in a feminine, wifely way."[7] She has also been described as "the campaign hugger"[67] and is also known for bipartisan socializing. For example, in 2014 she hosted a dinner with philanthropist Catherine B. Reynolds to welcome Penny Pritzker as Secretary of Commerce, where she spent the evening socializing with Valerie Jarrett, Obama's top advisor.[7]
The New York Times has described her as "an unapologetically ambitious operator with an expansive network, a short fuse, and a seemingly inexhaustible drive to get to the top and stay there." It reported that as labor secretary, she "had gold-colored coins minted with her name in bas-relief and employed a "Veep"-like staff member who carried around her bag."[7]
The Chao family[edit]
The Chao family emigrated from Taiwan; Elaine Chao is the oldest of six sisters, the others being Jeannette, May, Christine, Grace, and Angela.[69][70] The New York Times reported that "several of her five younger sisters married Wall Street titans, including Bruce Wasserstein, the late owner of New York Magazine."[71]
Her father, James S.C. Chao, is a shipping magnate who founded the Foremost Group.[72] In April 2008, Chao's father gave Chao and McConnell between $5 million and $25 million, which "boosted McConnell's personal worth from a minimum of $3 million in 2007 to more than $7 million"[73] and "helped the McConnells after their stock portfolio dipped in the wake of the financial crisis that year."[74]
In 2012, the Chao family donated $40 million to Harvard Business School for scholarships for students of Chinese heritage and the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, an executive education building named for Chao's late mother.[75][76] It is the first building named after a woman on the Harvard campus and the first building named after an American of Asian ancestry.[77] Ruth Mulan Chu Chao returned to school at age 51 to earn a master's degree in Asian literature and history from St. John's University in the Queens borough of New York City.[69]

Early life and education[edit]
Chao was born in Taipei, Taiwan.[3] The eldest of six daughters, Chao was born to Ruth Mulan Chu Chao (趙朱木蘭), a historian, and James S.C. Chao (趙錫成), who began his career as a merchant mariner and founded a successful shipping company in New York City called Foremost Shipping.[8] Chao's parents had fled to Taiwan from Shanghai in China after the Chinese Communists took over following the Chinese Civil War in 1949. When she was 8 years old, in 1961, she came to the United States on a freight ship along with her mother and two younger sisters, a long journey that took 37 days. Her father had arrived in New York three years earlier after receiving a scholarship.[9][10]
Chao attended Tsai Hsing Elementary School in Taipei for kindergarten and first grade,[3][11] and subsequently attended Syosset High School in Syosset, New York, on Long Island.[12] She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen at the age of 19.[13]
She received a bachelor of arts in Economics from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1975.[14] While at Mount Holyoke, she worked for the Admissions Department, and the Economics Department, edited the yearbook, played field hockey and was a member of the horseback riding club. In the first semester of her junior year Elaine was co-editor in chief of the yearbook. In the second semester of her junior year she did a domestic exchange to Dartmouth College, where she studied money and banking.
She received a MBA degree from Harvard Business School in 1979. While at Harvard Business School she was the first woman at Harvard to be elected class officer and class marshall. She was a member of the finance club, the financial accounting club, the international business club and the transportation club.
Chao has received 36 honorary doctorates,[15] including an honorary DHL degree from Georgetown University in 2015.[16]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before entering politics, Chao was Vice President for syndications at Bank of America Capital Markets Group in San Francisco, California, and an International Banker at Citicorp in New York for four years.[17]
She was granted a White House Fellowship in 1983 during the Reagan Administration.[18]
In 1986, Chao became Deputy Administrator of the Maritime Administration in the U.S. Department of Transportation. From 1988 to 1989, she served as Chairwoman of the Federal Maritime Commission.[19] In 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Chao to be Deputy Secretary of Transportation, serving from 1989 to 1991.[20] From 1991 to 1992, she was the Director of the Peace Corps.[19] She was the first Asian Pacific American to serve in any of these positions. She expanded the Peace Corps's presence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia by establishing the first Peace Corps programs in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.[21][22]
United Way and Heritage Foundation[edit]
Following her service in the government, Chao worked for four years as President and CEO of United Way of America.[23][24] She is credited with returning credibility and public trust in the organization after a financial mismanagement scandal involving former president William Aramony. From 1996 until her appointment as Secretary of Labor, Chao was a Distinguished Fellow with The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.[25] She was also a board member of the Independent Women's Forum.[26] She returned to the Heritage Foundation after leaving the government in January 2009.[27]
U.S. Secretary of Labor (2001–2009)[edit]

Chao was the only cabinet member in the George W. Bush administration to serve for the entirety of his eight years.[29] She was also the longest-serving Secretary of Labor since Frances Perkins, who served from 1933 to 1945, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[30]
According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration statistics, in 2007 – six years into Chao's tenure – "the workplace fatality rate... declined 14 percent since 2001, and since 2002, the workplace injury and illness rate... dropped 21 percent – with both at all time lows."[31] Under her leadership, the U.S. Department of Labor undertook regulatory and legislative reforms in "protecting the health, safety, wages, and retirement security" of U.S. workers by "recovering record levels of back wages and monetary recoveries for pension plans, and obtaining record financial settlements for discrimination by federal contractors." She also restructured departmental programs and modernized regulations.[32] Over the course of her tenure, the Department reduced their discretionary budget from $11.7 billion to $11.6 billion and was the first cabinet-level agency to have been rated "green" by the Office of Management and Budget, having exhibited excellence in budget management practices in every area.[33]
Union disclosure requirements[edit]
In 2002, a major West Coast ports dispute costing the U.S. economy nearly $1 billion daily was resolved when the Bush administration obtained a national emergency injunction against both the employers and the union under the Taft–Hartley Act for the first time since 1971.[34] Led by Chao In 2003, for the first time in more than 40 years, the Department updated the labor union financial disclosure regulations under the Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959, which created more extensive disclosure requirements for union-sponsored pension plans and other trusts to prevent embezzlement or other financial mismanagement.[35]
In 2004, the Department issued revisions of the white-collar overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[36]
Government Accountability Office reports[edit]




Chao's official Secretary of Labor photo


After analyzing 70,000 closed case files from 2005 to 2007, the Government Accountability Office reported that the Department's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) inadequately investigated complaints from low- and minimum-wage workers alleging that employers failed to pay the federal minimum wage, required overtime, and failed to issue a last paycheck.[37][38]
A 2008 Government Accountability Office report noted that the Labor Department gave Congress inaccurate numbers that understated the expense of contracting out its employees' work to private firms during Chao's tenure.[39][40]
Mining regulation[edit]
A 2007 report by the department's inspector general found that mine safety regulators did not conduct federally required inspections at more than 14% of the country's 731 underground coal mines, and that the number of worker deaths in mining accidents more than doubled to 47.[41] Subsequently, on December 10, 2008, Chao announced that the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had, for the first time in the agency's 31-year history, achieved its goal of completing every mandated regular inspection for the year, then consisting of 14,800 active mining operations. This announcement was made within the first year of the agency's "100 Percent Plan," which was launched by the MSHA in October 2007 to improve the completion of quarterly and biannual inspections.[42]
OSHA statistics for 2007 and 2008 revealed that overall workplace fatality rates and workplace injury and illness rates were "both at all-time lows."[31][43] A 2009 internal audit appraising an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initiative focusing on problematic workplaces, however, stated that employees had failed to gather needed data, conducted uneven inspections and enforcement, and failed to discern repeat fatalities because records misspelled the companies' names or failed to notice when two subsidiaries with the same owner were involved.[44]

In 2009 Chao resumed her previous role as a Distinguished Fellow at The Heritage Foundation,[27] and she contributed to Fox News and other media outlets.[45]
She also served as a director on a number of corporate and non-profit boards,[17][46] including the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Wells Fargo,[47] NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, News Corp,[48] Dole Food Company,[49] and Protective Life Corporation.[50][51][52] In June 2011, she was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.[53]
In January 2015 she resigned from the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which she had joined in 2012,[54] because of its plans to significantly increase support for the Sierra Club's "Beyond Coal" initiative.[55]
In 2011 and 2013, Chao attended Shanghai signing ceremonies for Capesize bulkers launched by the Foremost Group, her father's company, where she spoke publicly about U.S.–China relations.[56] At the 2013 ceremony, Chao stated, "The U.S.-China relations[hip] is among the most important bilateral relationships in the world. And as such, there is no other alternative but to have a harmonious and a cooperative relationship. As with any relationship, there are bound to be ups, downs, disagreements, but in the overall scheme of things, in the overall direction, for the benefit of the world, [the] U.S. and China must get along, and must find a way to do so."[57]
In 2013, Chao recorded a motivational video to inspire Asian-American children.[58]
In February 2017, it was reported by the Associated Press that Chao had been paid five-figure sums by organizations linked to the People's Mujahedin of Iran (aka Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK), an exile group that was previously described as "cult-like" by the State Department, in exchange for making two speeches in 2015–16.[59][60] The MEK had previously claimed responsibility for the assassination of U.S. Army Lt. Col. Lewis L. Hawkins, the deputy chief of the U.S. military mission to Tehran in 1973.[61] However, the group was delisted as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, with the US government acknowledging that the organization had renounced violence.[62]
Chao is a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute.[63] She also organized the "orientation for the spouses of Republican senators" in Washington, D.C.[7]

Republican President-elect Donald Trump nominated Chao to Secretary of Transportation.[5] The U.S. Senate confirmed Chao on January 31, 2017 by a vote of 93–6.[6]
Personal life[edit]
In 1993, Chao married Mitch McConnell, the senior U.S. Senator from Kentucky and the eventual Senate Majority Leader. They were introduced by Stuart Bloch, an early friend of McConnell's, and his wife Julia Chang Bloch, a Chinese American and a future U.S. Ambassador to Nepal, the first Asian American to serve as US Ambassador, who mentored Chao. Bloch described Chao as a "tiger wife," a reference to Amy Chua's 2011 book about her disciplinarian parenting style. Previously, she had dated C. Boyden Gray, the White House Counsel to President George H. W. Bush.[7]
The University of Louisville's Ekstrom Library opened the "McConnell-Chao Archives" in November 2009. It is a major component of the university's McConnell Center.[64][65]
In an interview with CNN, Chao said she sometimes regrets not having children, and she counseled young women that there are trade-offs in life.[66]
Husband's campaigning[edit]
In the two years leading up to the 2014 U.S. Senate elections, she "headlined fifty of her own events and attended hundreds more with and on behalf of" her husband and was seen as "a driving force of his reelection campaign" and eventual victory over Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who had portrayed McConnell as "anti-woman."[67] After winning the election, McConnell said, "The biggest asset I have by far is the only Kentucky woman who served in a president's cabinet, my wife, Elaine Chao."[68]
She has been described by Jan Karzen, a longtime friend of McConnell's, as adding "a softer touch" to McConnell's style by speaking of him "in a feminine, wifely way."[7] She has also been described as "the campaign hugger"[67] and is also known for bipartisan socializing. For example, in 2014 she hosted a dinner with philanthropist Catherine B. Reynolds to welcome Penny Pritzker as Secretary of Commerce, where she spent the evening socializing with Valerie Jarrett, Obama's top advisor.[7]
The New York Times has described her as "an unapologetically ambitious operator with an expansive network, a short fuse, and a seemingly inexhaustible drive to get to the top and stay there." It reported that as labor secretary, she "had gold-colored coins minted with her name in bas-relief and employed a "Veep"-like staff member who carried around her bag."[7]
The Chao family[edit]
The Chao family emigrated from Taiwan; Elaine Chao is the oldest of six sisters, the others being Jeannette, May, Christine, Grace, and Angela.[69][70] The New York Times reported that "several of her five younger sisters married Wall Street titans, including Bruce Wasserstein, the late owner of New York Magazine."[71]
Her father, James S.C. Chao, is a shipping magnate who founded the Foremost Group.[72] In April 2008, Chao's father gave Chao and McConnell between $5 million and $25 million, which "boosted McConnell's personal worth from a minimum of $3 million in 2007 to more than $7 million"[73] and "helped the McConnells after their stock portfolio dipped in the wake of the financial crisis that year."[74]
In 2012, the Chao family donated $40 million to Harvard Business School for scholarships for students of Chinese heritage and the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, an executive education building named for Chao's late mother.[75][76] It is the first building named after a woman on the Harvard campus and the first building named after an American of Asian ancestry.[77] Ruth Mulan Chu Chao returned to school at age 51 to earn a master's degree in Asian literature and history from St. John's University in the Queens borough of New York City.[69]

Early life and education[edit]
Chao was born in Taipei, Taiwan.[3] The eldest of six daughters, Chao was born to Ruth Mulan Chu Chao (趙朱木蘭), a historian, and James S.C. Chao (趙錫成), who began his career as a merchant mariner and founded a successful shipping company in New York City called Foremost Shipping.[8] Chao's parents had fled to Taiwan from Shanghai in China after the Chinese Communists took over following the Chinese Civil War in 1949. When she was 8 years old, in 1961, she came to the United States on a freight ship along with her mother and two younger sisters, a long journey that took 37 days. Her father had arrived in New York three years earlier after receiving a scholarship.[9][10]
Chao attended Tsai Hsing Elementary School in Taipei for kindergarten and first grade,[3][11] and subsequently attended Syosset High School in Syosset, New York, on Long Island.[12] She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen at the age of 19.[13]
She received a bachelor of arts in Economics from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1975.[14] While at Mount Holyoke, she worked for the Admissions Department, and the Economics Department, edited the yearbook, played field hockey and was a member of the horseback riding club. In the first semester of her junior year Elaine was co-editor in chief of the yearbook. In the second semester of her junior year she did a domestic exchange to Dartmouth College, where she studied money and banking.
She received a MBA degree from Harvard Business School in 1979. While at Harvard Business School she was the first woman at Harvard to be elected class officer and class marshall. She was a member of the finance club, the financial accounting club, the international business club and the transportation club.
Chao has received 36 honorary doctorates,[15] including an honorary DHL degree from Georgetown University in 2015.[16]

Before entering politics, Chao was Vice President for syndications at Bank of America Capital Markets Group in San Francisco, California, and an International Banker at Citicorp in New York for four years.[17]
She was granted a White House Fellowship in 1983 during the Reagan Administration.[18]
In 1986, Chao became Deputy Administrator of the Maritime Administration in the U.S. Department of Transportation. From 1988 to 1989, she served as Chairwoman of the Federal Maritime Commission.[19] In 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Chao to be Deputy Secretary of Transportation, serving from 1989 to 1991.[20] From 1991 to 1992, she was the Director of the Peace Corps.[19] She was the first Asian Pacific American to serve in any of these positions. She expanded the Peace Corps's presence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia by establishing the first Peace Corps programs in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.[21][22]
United Way and Heritage Foundation[edit]
Following her service in the government, Chao worked for four years as President and CEO of United Way of America.[23][24] She is credited with returning credibility and public trust in the organization after a financial mismanagement scandal involving former president William Aramony. From 1996 until her appointment as Secretary of Labor, Chao was a Distinguished Fellow with The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.[25] She was also a board member of the Independent Women's Forum.[26] She returned to the Heritage Foundation after leaving the government in January 2009.[27]
U.S. Secretary of Labor (2001–2009)[edit]

Chao was the only cabinet member in the George W. Bush administration to serve for the entirety of his eight years.[29] She was also the longest-serving Secretary of Labor since Frances Perkins, who served from 1933 to 1945, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[30]
According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration statistics, in 2007 – six years into Chao's tenure – "the workplace fatality rate... declined 14 percent since 2001, and since 2002, the workplace injury and illness rate... dropped 21 percent – with both at all time lows."[31] Under her leadership, the U.S. Department of Labor undertook regulatory and legislative reforms in "protecting the health, safety, wages, and retirement security" of U.S. workers by "recovering record levels of back wages and monetary recoveries for pension plans, and obtaining record financial settlements for discrimination by federal contractors." She also restructured departmental programs and modernized regulations.[32] Over the course of her tenure, the Department reduced their discretionary budget from $11.7 billion to $11.6 billion and was the first cabinet-level agency to have been rated "green" by the Office of Management and Budget, having exhibited excellence in budget management practices in every area.[33]
Union disclosure requirements[edit]
In 2002, a major West Coast ports dispute costing the U.S. economy nearly $1 billion daily was resolved when the Bush administration obtained a national emergency injunction against both the employers and the union under the Taft–Hartley Act for the first time since 1971.[34] Led by Chao In 2003, for the first time in more than 40 years, the Department updated the labor union financial disclosure regulations under the Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959, which created more extensive disclosure requirements for union-sponsored pension plans and other trusts to prevent embezzlement or other financial mismanagement.[35]
In 2004, the Department issued revisions of the white-collar overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[36]
Government Accountability Office reports[edit]

After analyzing 70,000 closed case files from 2005 to 2007, the Government Accountability Office reported that the Department's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) inadequately investigated complaints from low- and minimum-wage workers alleging that employers failed to pay the federal minimum wage, required overtime, and failed to issue a last paycheck.[37][38]
A 2008 Government Accountability Office report noted that the Labor Department gave Congress inaccurate numbers that understated the expense of contracting out its employees' work to private firms during Chao's tenure.[39][40]
Mining regulation[edit]
A 2007 report by the department's inspector general found that mine safety regulators did not conduct federally required inspections at more than 14% of the country's 731 underground coal mines, and that the number of worker deaths in mining accidents more than doubled to 47.[41] Subsequently, on December 10, 2008, Chao announced that the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had, for the first time in the agency's 31-year history, achieved its goal of completing every mandated regular inspection for the year, then consisting of 14,800 active mining operations. This announcement was made within the first year of the agency's "100 Percent Plan," which was launched by the MSHA in October 2007 to improve the completion of quarterly and biannual inspections.[42]
OSHA statistics for 2007 and 2008 revealed that overall workplace fatality rates and workplace injury and illness rates were "both at all-time lows."[31][43] A 2009 internal audit appraising an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initiative focusing on problematic workplaces, however, stated that employees had failed to gather needed data, conducted uneven inspections and enforcement, and failed to discern repeat fatalities because records misspelled the companies' names or failed to notice when two subsidiaries with the same owner were involved.[44]
Post-Bush administration (2009–2017)[edit]




Elaine Chao and her father James Si-Cheng Chao met Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen at the Presidential Office in Taipei, Taiwan in 2016


In 2009 Chao resumed her previous role as a Distinguished Fellow at The Heritage Foundation,[27] and she contributed to Fox News and other media outlets.[45]
She also served as a director on a number of corporate and non-profit boards,[17][46] including the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Wells Fargo,[47] NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, News Corp,[48] Dole Food Company,[49] and Protective Life Corporation.[50][51][52] In June 2011, she was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.[53]
In January 2015 she resigned from the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which she had joined in 2012,[54] because of its plans to significantly increase support for the Sierra Club's "Beyond Coal" initiative.[55]
In 2011 and 2013, Chao attended Shanghai signing ceremonies for Capesize bulkers launched by the Foremost Group, her father's company, where she spoke publicly about U.S.–China relations.[56] At the 2013 ceremony, Chao stated, "The U.S.-China relations[hip] is among the most important bilateral relationships in the world. And as such, there is no other alternative but to have a harmonious and a cooperative relationship. As with any relationship, there are bound to be ups, downs, disagreements, but in the overall scheme of things, in the overall direction, for the benefit of the world, [the] U.S. and China must get along, and must find a way to do so."[57]
In 2013, Chao recorded a motivational video to inspire Asian-American children.[58]
In February 2017, it was reported by the Associated Press that Chao had been paid five-figure sums by organizations linked to the People's Mujahedin of Iran (aka Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK), an exile group that was previously described as "cult-like" by the State Department, in exchange for making two speeches in 2015–16.[59][60] The MEK had previously claimed responsibility for the assassination of U.S. Army Lt. Col. Lewis L. Hawkins, the deputy chief of the U.S. military mission to Tehran in 1973.[61] However, the group was delisted as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, with the US government acknowledging that the organization had renounced violence.[62]
Chao is a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute.[63] She also organized the "orientation for the spouses of Republican senators" in Washington, D.C.[7]
U.S. Secretary of Transportation (2017–present)[edit]

Republican President-elect Donald Trump nominated Chao to Secretary of Transportation.[5] The U.S. Senate confirmed Chao on January 31, 2017 by a vote of 93–6.[6]
Personal life[edit]
In 1993, Chao married Mitch McConnell, the senior U.S. Senator from Kentucky and the eventual Senate Majority Leader. They were introduced by Stuart Bloch, an early friend of McConnell's, and his wife Julia Chang Bloch, a Chinese American and a future U.S. Ambassador to Nepal, the first Asian American to serve as US Ambassador, who mentored Chao. Bloch described Chao as a "tiger wife," a reference to Amy Chua's 2011 book about her disciplinarian parenting style. Previously, she had dated C. Boyden Gray, the White House Counsel to President George H. W. Bush.[7]
The University of Louisville's Ekstrom Library opened the "McConnell-Chao Archives" in November 2009. It is a major component of the university's McConnell Center.[64][65]
In an interview with CNN, Chao said she sometimes regrets not having children, and she counseled young women that there are trade-offs in life.[66]
Husband's campaigning[edit]
In the two years leading up to the 2014 U.S. Senate elections, she "headlined fifty of her own events and attended hundreds more with and on behalf of" her husband and was seen as "a driving force of his reelection campaign" and eventual victory over Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who had portrayed McConnell as "anti-woman."[67] After winning the election, McConnell said, "The biggest asset I have by far is the only Kentucky woman who served in a president's cabinet, my wife, Elaine Chao."[68]
She has been described by Jan Karzen, a longtime friend of McConnell's, as adding "a softer touch" to McConnell's style by speaking of him "in a feminine, wifely way."[7] She has also been described as "the campaign hugger"[67] and is also known for bipartisan socializing. For example, in 2014 she hosted a dinner with philanthropist Catherine B. Reynolds to welcome Penny Pritzker as Secretary of Commerce, where she spent the evening socializing with Valerie Jarrett, Obama's top advisor.[7]
The New York Times has described her as "an unapologetically ambitious operator with an expansive network, a short fuse, and a seemingly inexhaustible drive to get to the top and stay there." It reported that as labor secretary, she "had gold-colored coins minted with her name in bas-relief and employed a "Veep"-like staff member who carried around her bag."[7]
The Chao family[edit]
The Chao family emigrated from Taiwan; Elaine Chao is the oldest of six sisters, the others being Jeannette, May, Christine, Grace, and Angela.[69][70] The New York Times reported that "several of her five younger sisters married Wall Street titans, including Bruce Wasserstein, the late owner of New York Magazine."[71]
Her father, James S.C. Chao, is a shipping magnate who founded the Foremost Group.[72] In April 2008, Chao's father gave Chao and McConnell between $5 million and $25 million, which "boosted McConnell's personal worth from a minimum of $3 million in 2007 to more than $7 million"[73] and "helped the McConnells after their stock portfolio dipped in the wake of the financial crisis that year."[74]
In 2012, the Chao family donated $40 million to Harvard Business School for scholarships for students of Chinese heritage and the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, an executive education building named for Chao's late mother.[75][76] It is the first building named after a woman on the Harvard campus and the first building named after an American of Asian ancestry.[77] Ruth Mulan Chu Chao returned to school at age 51 to earn a master's degree in Asian literature and history from St. John's University in the Queens borough of New York City.[69]

Early life and education[edit]
Chao was born in Taipei, Taiwan.[3] The eldest of six daughters, Chao was born to Ruth Mulan Chu Chao (趙朱木蘭), a historian, and James S.C. Chao (趙錫成), who began his career as a merchant mariner and founded a successful shipping company in New York City called Foremost Shipping.[8] Chao's parents had fled to Taiwan from Shanghai in China after the Chinese Communists took over following the Chinese Civil War in 1949. When she was 8 years old, in 1961, she came to the United States on a freight ship along with her mother and two younger sisters, a long journey that took 37 days. Her father had arrived in New York three years earlier after receiving a scholarship.[9][10]
Chao attended Tsai Hsing Elementary School in Taipei for kindergarten and first grade,[3][11] and subsequently attended Syosset High School in Syosset, New York, on Long Island.[12] She was naturalized as a U.S. citizen at the age of 19.[13]
She received a bachelor of arts in Economics from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, in 1975.[14] While at Mount Holyoke, she worked for the Admissions Department, and the Economics Department, edited the yearbook, played field hockey and was a member of the horseback riding club. In the first semester of her junior year Elaine was co-editor in chief of the yearbook. In the second semester of her junior year she did a domestic exchange to Dartmouth College, where she studied money and banking.
She received a MBA degree from Harvard Business School in 1979. While at Harvard Business School she was the first woman at Harvard to be elected class officer and class marshall. She was a member of the finance club, the financial accounting club, the international business club and the transportation club.
Chao has received 36 honorary doctorates,[15] including an honorary DHL degree from Georgetown University in 2015.[16]
Career[edit]
Early career[edit]
Before entering politics, Chao was Vice President for syndications at Bank of America Capital Markets Group in San Francisco, California, and an International Banker at Citicorp in New York for four years.[17]
She was granted a White House Fellowship in 1983 during the Reagan Administration.[18]
In 1986, Chao became Deputy Administrator of the Maritime Administration in the U.S. Department of Transportation. From 1988 to 1989, she served as Chairwoman of the Federal Maritime Commission.[19] In 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Chao to be Deputy Secretary of Transportation, serving from 1989 to 1991.[20] From 1991 to 1992, she was the Director of the Peace Corps.[19] She was the first Asian Pacific American to serve in any of these positions. She expanded the Peace Corps's presence in Eastern Europe and Central Asia by establishing the first Peace Corps programs in Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.[21][22]
United Way and Heritage Foundation[edit]
Following her service in the government, Chao worked for four years as President and CEO of United Way of America.[23][24] She is credited with returning credibility and public trust in the organization after a financial mismanagement scandal involving former president William Aramony. From 1996 until her appointment as Secretary of Labor, Chao was a Distinguished Fellow with The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington, D.C.[25] She was also a board member of the Independent Women's Forum.[26] She returned to the Heritage Foundation after leaving the government in January 2009.[27]
U.S. Secretary of Labor (2001–2009)[edit]

Chao was the only cabinet member in the George W. Bush administration to serve for the entirety of his eight years.[29] She was also the longest-serving Secretary of Labor since Frances Perkins, who served from 1933 to 1945, under President Franklin D. Roosevelt.[30]
According to Occupational Safety and Health Administration statistics, in 2007 – six years into Chao's tenure – "the workplace fatality rate... declined 14 percent since 2001, and since 2002, the workplace injury and illness rate... dropped 21 percent – with both at all time lows."[31] Under her leadership, the U.S. Department of Labor undertook regulatory and legislative reforms in "protecting the health, safety, wages, and retirement security" of U.S. workers by "recovering record levels of back wages and monetary recoveries for pension plans, and obtaining record financial settlements for discrimination by federal contractors." She also restructured departmental programs and modernized regulations.[32] Over the course of her tenure, the Department reduced their discretionary budget from $11.7 billion to $11.6 billion and was the first cabinet-level agency to have been rated "green" by the Office of Management and Budget, having exhibited excellence in budget management practices in every area.[33]
Union disclosure requirements[edit]
In 2002, a major West Coast ports dispute costing the U.S. economy nearly $1 billion daily was resolved when the Bush administration obtained a national emergency injunction against both the employers and the union under the Taft–Hartley Act for the first time since 1971.[34] Led by Chao In 2003, for the first time in more than 40 years, the Department updated the labor union financial disclosure regulations under the Landrum–Griffin Act of 1959, which created more extensive disclosure requirements for union-sponsored pension plans and other trusts to prevent embezzlement or other financial mismanagement.[35]
In 2004, the Department issued revisions of the white-collar overtime regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act.[36]
Government Accountability Office reports[edit]




Chao's official Secretary of Labor photo


After analyzing 70,000 closed case files from 2005 to 2007, the Government Accountability Office reported that the Department's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) inadequately investigated complaints from low- and minimum-wage workers alleging that employers failed to pay the federal minimum wage, required overtime, and failed to issue a last paycheck.[37][38]
A 2008 Government Accountability Office report noted that the Labor Department gave Congress inaccurate numbers that understated the expense of contracting out its employees' work to private firms during Chao's tenure.[39][40]
Mining regulation[edit]
A 2007 report by the department's inspector general found that mine safety regulators did not conduct federally required inspections at more than 14% of the country's 731 underground coal mines, and that the number of worker deaths in mining accidents more than doubled to 47.[41] Subsequently, on December 10, 2008, Chao announced that the Department of Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) had, for the first time in the agency's 31-year history, achieved its goal of completing every mandated regular inspection for the year, then consisting of 14,800 active mining operations. This announcement was made within the first year of the agency's "100 Percent Plan," which was launched by the MSHA in October 2007 to improve the completion of quarterly and biannual inspections.[42]
OSHA statistics for 2007 and 2008 revealed that overall workplace fatality rates and workplace injury and illness rates were "both at all-time lows."[31][43] A 2009 internal audit appraising an Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) initiative focusing on problematic workplaces, however, stated that employees had failed to gather needed data, conducted uneven inspections and enforcement, and failed to discern repeat fatalities because records misspelled the companies' names or failed to notice when two subsidiaries with the same owner were involved.[44]
Post-Bush administration (2009–2017)[edit]

In 2009 Chao resumed her previous role as a Distinguished Fellow at The Heritage Foundation,[27] and she contributed to Fox News and other media outlets.[45]
She also served as a director on a number of corporate and non-profit boards,[17][46] including the Institute of Politics at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, Wells Fargo,[47] NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital, News Corp,[48] Dole Food Company,[49] and Protective Life Corporation.[50][51][52] In June 2011, she was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.[53]
In January 2015 she resigned from the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, which she had joined in 2012,[54] because of its plans to significantly increase support for the Sierra Club's "Beyond Coal" initiative.[55]
In 2011 and 2013, Chao attended Shanghai signing ceremonies for Capesize bulkers launched by the Foremost Group, her father's company, where she spoke publicly about U.S.–China relations.[56] At the 2013 ceremony, Chao stated, "The U.S.-China relations[hip] is among the most important bilateral relationships in the world. And as such, there is no other alternative but to have a harmonious and a cooperative relationship. As with any relationship, there are bound to be ups, downs, disagreements, but in the overall scheme of things, in the overall direction, for the benefit of the world, [the] U.S. and China must get along, and must find a way to do so."[57]
In 2013, Chao recorded a motivational video to inspire Asian-American children.[58]
In February 2017, it was reported by the Associated Press that Chao had been paid five-figure sums by organizations linked to the People's Mujahedin of Iran (aka Mojahedin-e Khalq or MEK), an exile group that was previously described as "cult-like" by the State Department, in exchange for making two speeches in 2015–16.[59][60] The MEK had previously claimed responsibility for the assassination of U.S. Army Lt. Col. Lewis L. Hawkins, the deputy chief of the U.S. military mission to Tehran in 1973.[61] However, the group was delisted as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, with the US government acknowledging that the organization had renounced violence.[62]
Chao is a distinguished fellow at the Hudson Institute.[63] She also organized the "orientation for the spouses of Republican senators" in Washington, D.C.[7]

Republican President-elect Donald Trump nominated Chao to Secretary of Transportation.[5] The U.S. Senate confirmed Chao on January 31, 2017 by a vote of 93–6.[6]
Personal life[edit]
In 1993, Chao married Mitch McConnell, the senior U.S. Senator from Kentucky and the eventual Senate Majority Leader. They were introduced by Stuart Bloch, an early friend of McConnell's, and his wife Julia Chang Bloch, a Chinese American and a future U.S. Ambassador to Nepal, the first Asian American to serve as US Ambassador, who mentored Chao. Bloch described Chao as a "tiger wife," a reference to Amy Chua's 2011 book about her disciplinarian parenting style. Previously, she had dated C. Boyden Gray, the White House Counsel to President George H. W. Bush.[7]
The University of Louisville's Ekstrom Library opened the "McConnell-Chao Archives" in November 2009. It is a major component of the university's McConnell Center.[64][65]
In an interview with CNN, Chao said she sometimes regrets not having children, and she counseled young women that there are trade-offs in life.[66]
Husband's campaigning[edit]
In the two years leading up to the 2014 U.S. Senate elections, she "headlined fifty of her own events and attended hundreds more with and on behalf of" her husband and was seen as "a driving force of his reelection campaign" and eventual victory over Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who had portrayed McConnell as "anti-woman."[67] After winning the election, McConnell said, "The biggest asset I have by far is the only Kentucky woman who served in a president's cabinet, my wife, Elaine Chao."[68]
She has been described by Jan Karzen, a longtime friend of McConnell's, as adding "a softer touch" to McConnell's style by speaking of him "in a feminine, wifely way."[7] She has also been described as "the campaign hugger"[67] and is also known for bipartisan socializing. For example, in 2014 she hosted a dinner with philanthropist Catherine B. Reynolds to welcome Penny Pritzker as Secretary of Commerce, where she spent the evening socializing with Valerie Jarrett, Obama's top advisor.[7]
The New York Times has described her as "an unapologetically ambitious operator with an expansive network, a short fuse, and a seemingly inexhaustible drive to get to the top and stay there." It reported that as labor secretary, she "had gold-colored coins minted with her name in bas-relief and employed a "Veep"-like staff member who carried around her bag."[7]
The Chao family[edit]
The Chao family emigrated from Taiwan; Elaine Chao is the oldest of six sisters, the others being Jeannette, May, Christine, Grace, and Angela.[69][70] The New York Times reported that "several of her five younger sisters married Wall Street titans, including Bruce Wasserstein, the late owner of New York Magazine."[71]
Her father, James S.C. Chao, is a shipping magnate who founded the Foremost Group.[72] In April 2008, Chao's father gave Chao and McConnell between $5 million and $25 million, which "boosted McConnell's personal worth from a minimum of $3 million in 2007 to more than $7 million"[73] and "helped the McConnells after their stock portfolio dipped in the wake of the financial crisis that year."[74]
In 2012, the Chao family donated $40 million to Harvard Business School for scholarships for students of Chinese heritage and the Ruth Mulan Chu Chao Center, an executive education building named for Chao's late mother.[75][76] It is the first building named after a woman on the Harvard campus and the first building named after an American of Asian ancestry.[77] Ruth Mulan Chu Chao returned to school at age 51 to earn a master's degree in Asian literature and history from St. John's University in the Queens borough of New York City.[69]

Here's what you should know about her. (Sarah Parnass,Osman Malik,Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post)    By Jerry Markon, Philip Rucker and Amy Goldstein  By Jerry Markon, Philip Rucker and Amy Goldstein   November 29, 2016  Follow @JerryMarkon Follow @PhilipRucker Follow @goldsteinamy     President-elect Donald Trump has chosen former Bush administration official Elaine Chao as his transportation secretary, a position that will take on outsized importance with Trump’s plan to spend billions rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure, a person with knowledge of the decision said Tuesday. Chao, a former labor secretary and the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), would oversee the massive program Trump is planning to rebuild bridges, roads and other infrastructure. Trump’s campaign has said he wants to spend up to $1 trillion, though the specifics are unclear, as is whether congressional Republicans would support the initiative. Chao served as labor secretary during President George W. Bush’s entire eight-year administration and was the first Asian American female Cabinet member in U.S. history. If confirmed by the Senate, she would add diversity to a Trump inner circle initially criticized as consisting of mostly older white men. Transition team officials would not comment on Chao, though senior Trump communications adviser Jason Miller told Fox Business Network on Tuesday that Trump’s transportation secretary nominee would come later in the day. The news of Chao’s nomination was first reported by Politico.  [Trump expected to pick Elaine L. Chao for transportation secretary]      Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a veteran lawmaker and vehement critic of the Affordable Care Act, has been picked as President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post)   It came after Trump’s team announced that he will take a break from transition planning, if briefly, to resume the occasionally raucous campaign-style rallies that marked his outsider bid for the White House. Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence have scheduled a rally in Cincinnati Thursday night, part of what Trump aides are billing as a “thank you” tour. It is unclear where else the duo might hold similar events. Yet Trump was also working to form his government. Earlier Tuesday, he chose Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), a fierce critic of the Affordable Care Act and a proponent of overhauling the nation’s entitlement programs, to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.  [Trump names Rep. Tom Price as next HHS secretary]  In naming Chao, who has also served as deputy transportation secretary and has been married to McConnell since 1993, Trump turned to a consummate Washington insider after campaigning on a vow to bring change to Washington. Since leaving the Bush administration, Chao has served as a fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a contributor to Fox News. She is also a former chief executive of the United Way of America, director of the Peace Corps and banker with Citicorp in New York. The Price nomination came in a news release early Tuesday that lavished praise on him, a third-generation doctor who chairs the House Budget Committee and became a champion of Trump’s candidacy. In naming him to join his Cabinet, the president-elect called Price “exceptionally qualified to shepherd our commitment to repeal and replace Obamacare and bring affordable and accessible health care to every American.” Trump also named Seema Verma, a health-care consultant who was the architect of Medicaid changes in Vice President-elect Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana, to run a crucial section of HHS: the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.     View Graphic    Here are the people Trump has chosen for his Cabinet  As HHS secretary, Price would be the nation’s top health official and the incoming administration’s point person for dismantling the sprawling 2010 health-care law, which Trump promised during his campaign to start dismantling on his first day in the Oval Office. The 62-year-old lawmaker, who represents a wealthy suburban Atlanta district, has played a leading role in Republican opposition to the law and has helped draft several comprehensive bills to replace it. The GOP-led House has voted five dozen times to eliminate all or part of the ACA but has never had a chance to accomplish its goal as long as President Obama has been in the White House. While many Republicans, including House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.), wavered in their attitudes toward Trump during his campaign, Price was a devoted foot soldier. In May, he organized a joint statement by nine GOP House committee chairs, pledging loyalty to Trump and calling on “all Americans to support him.” Ryan said in a tweet Tuesday morning that Price “has made health care his life’s work. He is the absolute perfect choice for HHS Secretary.” A former chairman of the conservative Republican study committee, Price has been affiliated with the House tea party caucus and has lambasted what he termed a “vile liberal agenda that is threatening everything we hold dear as Americans.” His congressional website describes him as “devoted to limited government and lower spending.” His selection drew an immediate rebuke from the Senate’s incoming minority leader, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.). “Congressman Price has proven to be far out of the mainstream of what Americans want when it comes to Medicare, the Affordable Care Act, and Planned Parenthood,” Schumer said in a statement. “Thanks to those three programs, millions of American seniors, families, people with disabilities and women have access to quality, affordable health care. Nominating Congressman Price to be the HHS secretary is akin to asking the fox to guard the hen house.” House Republicans have had a far more detailed plan than Trump for reconfiguring the nation’s health-care system along conservative lines. Earlier this year, Price suggested that a Trump presidency would advance the House GOP health-care agenda. “When I talk to people who work closely with Trump, what they tell me is that behind closed doors he’s one of the best listeners they’ve ever worked for or with in their life,” Price said in an interview in the spring. “Which is kind of counterintuitive, given what some of his public persona is.” During the campaign, Trump railed against the Affordable Care Act and vowed to repeal and replace it. He has even said he would summon Congress to a special session to do so. Since his election, he has been less explicit about his intended timing.

Early Career 1983-89
At Harvard Business School, Elaine was elected by her classmates to be the Class Secretary and the Class Marshal to lead her graduating class during the Commencement Ceremony. 
After graduating from Harvard Business School, Elaine Chao embarked upon a career in commercial banking as a banker with Citicorp in New York City.   While at Citibank, she learned about the prestigious White House Fellowship program.  When it was time for her next assignment, rather than go overseas with the Bank, she applied to the White House Fellowship program because she wanted to learn about the government in her new country.  From among a very competitive nationwide field, she was selected as one of 12 White House Fellows, assigned to work at the White House, and thus was able to observe first-hand how our federal government functioned at the highest levels.

After her White House Fellowship, Chao resumed her banking career and moved to San Francisco to help establish the West Coast Syndications unit at BankAmerica Capital markets Group as Vice President of Syndications.  But within two years, she returned to Washington, D. C. when she was appointed by then U. S. Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Hanford Dole to be the Deputy Administrator of the Maritime Administration, the second in command.  This agency promoted the U.S. merchant fleet and supported America’s water-borne transportation system, including ports, shipbuilding, and repair facilities.   Elaine was the first woman and the first Asian Pacific American to achieve this high a position in the Department’s history.
Grateful for the opportunities her adopted nation offered, Elaine Chao had a prodigious work ethic, often clocking long hours and taking assignments others sometimes dismissed as insignificant.  But she persevered because she remembered the sacrifices of her parents for the family and wanted to blaze new opportunities for her community.  
By 1988, Elaine Chao had proven so effective at the Maritime Administration that President Ronald Reagan appointed her to become Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission, an independent regulatory agency that oversees international ocean-borne commerce and reports directly to Congress.  Again, Elaine was the first Asian Pacific American and youngest chairman in the Agency’s history.  During her tenure, she led the congressionally mandated review of the Shipping Act of 1984 and established a strong record of enforcement against unfair trade practices overseas.  
By 1989, Elaine Chao's abilities and diligence brought her increasing recognition as a rising young star and a position with even greater responsibility in the administration of President George H. W. Bush as Deputy Secretary of the Department of Transportation, the number two executive in a federal department with a budget of $30 billion and 110,000 employees. 





“I think my first interactions were when she first came to be interviewed to serve as a White House fellow and I was very impressed; a very bright individual, great interpersonal skills and dedicated to excellence.
”
Elizabeth Dole
                                 Former U.S. Senator from North Carolina
