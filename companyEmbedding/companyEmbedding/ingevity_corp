Salaried Benefits
Ingevity is committed to our employees’ careers and overall well-being. Because of this, we offer our U.S.-based employees a comprehensive benefits package from day one.
Vacation
Everyone needs time away from work. You’ll become eligible for three weeks of vacation after just three years of service. We also offer 13 paid holidays. The exact days off may vary at different locations to allow for operating needs and local flexibility.
401(k)
Ingevity will make an automatic fixed contribution of 3% of your pay to your 401(k) – even if you don’t contribute anything yourself! With the 6% company match, this means you could receive up to 9% of your annual pay in company contributions each year.
Health Insurance
We offer a choice of medical, dental and vision coverage. If you elect coverage, it's effective Day 1! We also offer a variety of other comprehensive benefits as a full time employee.
Wellness Rewards
You’ll have opportunities to improve your health and earn credit. By using a pedometer to track your activity, you could earn up to $500 in annual rewards. In addition to these great benefits, several Ingevity locations offer an onsite gym that employees can take advantage of.







Our Team
Ready to push the bounds of what’s possible to solve problems? So are we.

Our people are empowered and engaged, free to drive innovation and productivity, explore processes and products, and develop and deliver solutions that make a real difference in the real world.
The things we do – enabling oil to flow better, colors to shine brighter, roads to last longer, and making the air we breathe cleaner – aren’t simple or easy. But we wouldn’t have it any other way. Because at Ingevity, we don’t just love a good challenge, we live for them.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.
