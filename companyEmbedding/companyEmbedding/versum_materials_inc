Air Products’ Spin-Off Company Versum Materials Headquarters to be in Tempe, Arizona
















News ReleaseAir Products’ Spin-Off Company Versum Materials Headquarters to be in Tempe, Arizona



	New Company Will Also Maintain an Allentown Area Workforce
June 28, 2016 Lehigh Valley, Pa.Air Products (NYSE: APD) continues to work toward the previously announced intended spin-off of its Materials Technologies’ Electronic Materials Division (EMD), to what is to become Versum Materials. As part of this continuing process, Versum Materials today announced when it becomes a standalone company, its headquarters offices will be located in Tempe, Arizona.

“Part of our overall strategy as a separate company is to be more market facing and agile by co-locating our business capabilities closer to the companies we serve. Our focus is on serving our semiconductor customers. We have existing Electronic Materials production, research and development, and a workforce in Tempe, and our major U.S. customers are located in the Western U.S.,” said Guillermo Novo, who will be the CEO of Versum Materials. “Additionally, over 70 percent of the market is now in Asia and it continues to grow. Locating in Tempe will allow us to improve our connectivity with both our U.S. and Asia teams and customers. This decision is part of a broader plan to be closer to our customers and position Versum for success.”

Novo added certain administrative functions will remain in Pennsylvania in the Allentown area. “We have great people with experience and knowledge performing jobs that are critical to our company, like Accounting and IT, for example. These people have been integral to the transition as we move toward Versum. Having employees who understand our business will allow us to stay focused on our separation and continue to support our business performance going forward,” Novo said. “Between our manufacturing and administrative infrastructure that will remain, Versum will continue to have a significant footprint in the Lehigh Valley area.”

Today’s headquarters announcement follows several other moves that have been decided as the business separation intended for September 2016 nears. Most recently it was decided Versum’s research and development labs would be relocated over the next year to Tempe; Hometown, Pennsylvania; Taiwan; and Korea. The commercial organization for much of the business is also relocating to Tempe.  

EMD had approximately $1 billion in sales in 2015. It employs approximately 1,900 people and includes major production facilities in the U.S., Korea and Taiwan. Versum Materials’ focus is to be the materials partner of choice for the semiconductor industry, providing high value in-use products for next generation chips used in mobile devices, Internet of Things, and PCs.

These forward-looking statements are based on management’s reasonable expectations and assumptions as of the date of this release.

Versum Materials: A Spinoff That Will Likely Reward Disciplined Investors - Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Versum Materials: A Spinoff That Will Likely Reward Disciplined InvestorsSep.22.16 | About: Air Products (APD) Investor Gator Alternative energy, industrials, long/short equity, special situationsSummaryAir Products and Chemicals, Inc., a leading supplier of specialty chemicals, is spinning off its Electronics Materials segment into a new company called Versum Materials, Inc.Versum Materials has impressive market position and financial performance, but is fraught with risks.Frothy market conditions may allow Versum to debut at close to $25.00 per share, but investors should stay disciplined and wait for a common spinco trading pattern to emerge.Based on trading comps and a margin of safety, $15.00 per share presents an attractive risk reward.Introduction Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD), a leading supplier of specialty chemicals, announced in September of 2015 it would spin off its Electronics Materials business into a new publicly traded company called Versum Materials, Inc. (NYSE:VSM). The spinoff process is expected to be completed at the end of this month and Versum should begin trading Monday, October 3rd under the symbol "VSM." Investment Opportunity Air Products decided to spin off Versum as part of its overall strategy to jettison slower growing business and concentrate on high growth markets. So with growth eliminated as a primary investment consideration for Versum, and taking into account the risks detailed below, what's left to make this a compelling opportunity? Valuation, of course. Because of the specialty nature of the company's products, high switching costs for its customers and low capital intensity, the company generates high margins and a significant amount of free cash flow. Give the bankers credit on this one for bringing to market a high-margin, cash generating business with a built-in return mechanism for post-transaction equity investors: Versum will launch with approximately $1B in debt (actually $1.2B including a $200M revolver undrawn at closing). At just over 3.0x leverage and with an initial debt to capitalization ratio of 123%, the debt load should be manageable while also providing the experienced management team with an attractive use of free cash by paying down debt levels over time. Similar to a private market leveraged buy-out, every dollar of debt paid down should increase the equity value.
 Background Versum will have approximately $1B in revenue on standalone basis and service the electronics industry by providing chemicals, analytical technology, process engineering and surface science services. The company delivers these products and services though two main segments: ((i)) Materials and (ii) Delivery Systems and Services ("DS&S"). The Materials segment, about 75% of total revenue, provides high purity process materials, cleaners, etchants, slurries. The DS&S segment, about 25% of revenue, provides equipment for material handling and logistics, primarily the design, installation and maintenance of equipment for gas delivery and distribution. Customers include semiconductor, semiconductor equipment and display makers, with 80% of sales derived from memory and logic customers. Versum's products and services target six of the seven steps in semiconductor manufacturing. Although the company's immediate addressable market is small at an estimated $5.5B in size, the company's products are generally designed-in to its customers manufacturing processes and are extensively tested and validated. As such, switching costs tend to be high. The rapid pace of innovation in customer end markets (mobile phones, tablets, gaming stations) drives the need for innovation throughout the supply chain, giving Versum the opportunity to develop new value-added products. The company maintains 14 manufacturing facilities and six research and development facilities throughout the U.S. and Asia. The business is generally low in capital intensity. Risks: Size: Company size is one of the primary drivers of defensive investing (a proxy for risk) as outlined by Benjamin Graham in his book "The Intelligent Investor." Graham, writing in 1972, uses $100M in revenue as the safety cutoff for size. To put that into perspective, the smallest ten companies in the Fortune 500 in 2014 had average revenue of $5B as compared to average revenue of $180M for the comparable group in 1972. With only $1B in revenue, Versum's small size alone is a risk factor. This risk is compounded by the small end market size, concentrated customer base and rapidly changing nature of the technology market.
 Customer Concentration: Versum's top three customers accounted for 45% of its revenue in 2015 Cyclicality of Semiconductor Market: Versum is primarily tied to end market demand for semiconductors in the mobile handset market. This market can be very cyclical. In the first nine months of FYE 2015, the company suffered an 8% decline in volumes. While Versum expects volumes to recover over the next several quarters, such a drop is a timely reminder of this very real risk. Trading Strategy: With valuation as the primary investment consideration, it's important to take an early look at where Versum might trade after the spin. More importantly, its advisable to keep in mind the "typical" trading pattern of a lot of spincos. Joel Greenblatt, a very successful investor and former hedge fund manager, wrote a seminal book in 1997 called "You Can Be A Stock Market Genius." In that book, Greenblatt explored why the strategy of investing in stock spinoffs can consistently generate excess returns. Greenblatt points out that shortly after a spinoff is completed, the investors (usually large mutual funds) that originally held the parent stock will often sell the spinoff because it doesn't meet their investment criteria. As a result of this initial bout of selling, the spinoff price declines following the split and then gradually rises as it finds a new investor base. While the markets have changed quite a bit in the twenty years since the book was written, spinoffs still often follow this pattern and can provide a compelling opportunity. With that said, here's a look at my valuation notes. Taking a look at the latest Form 10-12B and making some adjustments, I come up with estimates for key valuation drivers and then back into possible share prices under two scenarios: current market conditions; and (ii) based on a combination of margin of safety investing and specialty chemical company trading comparables. Scenario 1: Current Market Conditions: Versum Materials @ $25.00 Per Share               APD Shares outstanding   216,549,704     Ratio of Versum shares to APD 0.5     Versum Shares O/S, post trx 108,274,852     Share price     $25.00     Market Cap     2,706,871,300     Debt     1,000,000,000     Cash     70,000,000     Enterprise Value   3,636,871,300             Multiple   2016E Revenue   $950,000,000 3.8x   2016E EBITDA   $310,000,000 11.7x   2016E Net Income   $160,000,000 16.9x   2016E FCF(1)   $167,066,667 6.2%                                       Debt           Senior Secured First Lien Term Loan B 575,000,000     Senior Secured First Lien Revolver 200,000,000     Total third-party debt   775,000,000                 Unsecured In-Kind Notes to APD 425,000,000                 Total debt, ex lease and other obligations 1,200,000,000                 Scenario 2: Margin of Safety and Trading Comps Versum Materials at $15.00 Per Share   APD Shares outstanding   216,549,704     Ratio of Versum shares to APD 0.5     Versum Shares O/S, post trx 108,274,852     Share price     $15.00     Market Cap     1,624,122,780     Debt     1,000,000,000     Cash     70,000,000     Enterprise Value   2,554,122,780                 2016E Revenue   $950,000,000 2.7x   2016E EBITDA   $310,000,000 8.2x   2016E Net Income   $160,000,000 10.2x   2016E FCF(1)   $167,066,667 10.3%                                       Debt           Senior Secured First Lien Term Loan B 575,000,000     Senior Secured First Lien Revolver 200,000,000     Total third-party debt   775,000,000                 Unsecured In-Kind Notes to APD 425,000,000                 Total debt, ex lease and other obligations 1,200,000,000                 Note: the $200M revolver is undrawn at closing and therefore excluded from the initial enterprise value calculation and valuation In scenario 1, I use current lofty market conditions and suggest a possible debut price of $25.00 per share. In scenario 2, I use a large universe of three dozen specialty chemical companies with a median TTM EV/EBIDA multiple of 9.5X to anchor the valuation. While Versum's adjusted EBITDA margin of over 30% is certainly much higher than the peer group average, its lack of growth and much smaller size are offsets and will likely put downward pressure on the multiple. Taking into account post transaction capital structure, peer group multiples and a reasonable margin of safety, the above tables show a very attractive risk/reward at $15.00 per share. Transaction Notes: The distribution date of the transaction is expected to be October 1, 2016 and regular way trading should begin on Monday, October 3rd. However Versum shares should begin trading before that on a 'when-issued' basis sometime between the record date of September 21st 2016 and October 1st. Conclusion: Versum presents a very attractive risk/reward at $15.00 per share. Like most spinoffs, it is currently unknown where the stock will initially start trading, although current market conditions suggest a much higher price closer to $25.00 per share is possible. Patient investors could be rewarded if Versum trades down after the spin like many similar transactions. It's a special situation worth keeping an eye on despite the many business risks.

Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in VSM over the next 72 hours.
