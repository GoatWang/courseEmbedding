Business Overview

D Marshall & Sons is one of the longest established Precast Concrete Manufacturers in Scotland.

Established in 1947, D Marshall and Sons produced edgings, copings and coal bunkers for local housing co-operatives. In 1968, the second generation relocated the business to larger premises and extended the product range to include bespoke and customised precast. Considerable investment was made in extending the factory, an automated batching plant and highly skilled pattern makers and craftsmen were introduced. In 2007, the third generation celebrated 60 years of commitment to customer service and the manufacture of the highest quality products, as a Registered Firm of Assessed Capability relating to the BS EN ISO 9001:2000.
We are constantly working on broadening our product ranges with research into the production of our own on site self-compacting concrete taking place in order to provide the best possible standard. Our vision is to continue to broaden our range of bespoke and standard structural and architectural precast concrete products whilst maintaining the highest quality.

A new range of Cambrian Sanstones
This family of sandstones is available in a variety of colours from light beige through to red and even black giving designers a wider range of sandstone options than ever before. Their extreme high strength allows the stone to be used much thinner than other alternative stones and the low water absorption means that maintenance is reduced







New finishes for Yorkstone
Capital finish is a light blasted surface finish which adds extra slip resistance with a subtle alteration to the aesthetics. Westmoor Crest is a heavier textured Yorkstone







Inspired and Delivered
Using your design flair combined with Marshalls exellent technical assistance we can help turn your dream scheme from concept to reality. By aiding the design and engineering in both value and durability Marshalls specialist design team will help bring your ideas to life.

About Marshalls Garden and Patio Paving
For over 120 years Marshalls have been creating and providing natural stone and concrete paving slabs to aid the transformation of your patio and garden paved areas. We manufacture a broad range of traditional and contemporary garden paving products; whether you are looking for concrete, sandstone, granite, limestone or slate you can be confident that we will have something to meet the requirements of your project.
The Marshalls patio paving range includes many different colours, sizes and finishes, giving you the opportunity to coordinate any design scheme. The Fairstone paving range is available in a spectrum of colours ranging from natural sandstone, silver limestone and light granite to bold, dark slate and flamed sandstone in an assortment of finishes. 
Similarly, the concrete garden paving range provides a creative and diverse collection of colours and finishes. For example the Woodstone garden paving has the colour, texture and appearance of timber combined with the durability of concrete. Other examples include Argent patio paving which brings an attractive modern blend of British granite aggregates and Coach House paving slabs which are cast from genuine reclaimed Yorkstone to give a realistic stone look. 


Why Buy Marshalls Garden Paving
There are many reasons to buy Marshalls patio paving, the top three are; quality of products, ease of installation and the relationship we provide. The most impactful is our Fairstone brand of sandstone and limestone from India and China to assure that the stone garden paving is quarried and processed to the strict standards of the Ethical Trading Initiative. To maintain this quality, the unique Marshalls Register of Landscape Contractors enables you to enjoy the guarantee of a quality end product which has been finished to the highest standard. To further this, Marshalls Register Installers can offer the unique Marshalls Hard Landscaping Guarantee to protect your investment.  We endeavour to provide high quality paving in a multitude of ways by innovating patio paving products which present greater value to our customers. This includes hand selecting the ethically sourced quarried stone and implementing innovative characteristics such as a slip/skid resistance to our garden paving. 
Choosing Between Replica and Natural Stone Patio Paving
With a broad range of patio paving products, you are faced with a huge amount of choice. It's helpful to understand the differences between stone and concrete paving slabs. Concrete can, basically, be anything you want – its handmade in the UK using moulds which allows for the uniform look in terms of colour and texture. We also give it an authentic look by using real natural stone face profiles. 
Natural stone, on the other hand, has colours that have developed over years and therefore, give the most natural effect for garden paving. 
As both concrete and stone can be manipulated and processed to create something to your taste, the decision comes down to personal choice and budget. 
Designing Your Garden Patio
Many people will have little expertise in garden paving and designing therefore we provide a free, online Paving Planner and Garden Visualiser to aid your decisions. These apps allow you to be creative with your outdoor space by trialling the many different colours, finishes and laying patterns available over our patio paving range.
Buying Marshalls Patio and Garden Paving in the UK
Once you have a good idea of the garden paving products on offer, it's really easy to find a local Marshalls stockist in your area using the Where to Buy tab. In many of the Marshalls stockists you can view a wide selection of paving slabs close up before you make your final choice.
When buying patio paving there are a number of aspects that must be considered;

Finding a good installer from the Marshalls Register of Landscape Contractors. In order to gain their advice, expertise, ideas and recommendations, this should be planned early.
Getting more than one quotation in writing - the cheapest isn't always the best; choose the Contractor you feel will deliver what you need. 
Taking time to select the best product you can afford – 20% is usually spent on the product itself with 80% being installation costs.
Considering Marshalls Hard Landscape Guarantee to protect your investment.

Natural Stone
Now more than ever the beauty of natural stone is seen everywhere from stone veneer on houses to flooring in kitchens.
With natural stone differing in composition, color and texture, there are so many choices to choose from. Marshall Stone has one of the largest selections of natural stone in the area and with our signature line of natural stone products, we have exactly what you need that will make your project really stand out.




Boulders & River Rock

Thin Stone

Genuine Stone Veneer



Flagstone

Building Stone

Wall Stone



Custom Fabrication

Curbing & Edging

Steps




Natural Stone Accessories







MY PROJECT IS…
• Building a New Home • Fireplaces & Firepits
• Garden & Retaining Walls • Patios & Paths



Stone is a naturally occurring product of the earth. Variations in color & texture are expected. This is a characteristic which gives natural stone its charm and makes it a preferred and unique building material. Please use the photographs as a guide only. We cannot guarantee color & texture match to any photographs. Contact us to discuss the specific stone and application.

About Marshalls Driveways
For over 120 years Marshalls have been creating and providing natural stone, block paving and concrete driveways to transform your driveway. We offer a number of different driveway paving designs to suit any house type. This ranges from a variety of block paving to innovative setts and cobbles to sustainable, permeable paving. Colours vary from silver grey, autumn and terracotta to basalt, graphite and charcoal so you can be sure to find one to suit your needs. Different finishes distinguish the driveway paving between the traditional and contemporary preference to give the option of an aged or modern look. Other innovative concrete driveways allow for a cobbled look in the Drivesys Original Cobble paving range or that of a split natural stone in the Drivesett Natrale block paving range.


Marshalls also offer edgings, walling, circles and octants which can coordinate with your chosen driveway paving, and so it can be hard to visualise a finished result. Use the free, online Driveway Visualiser to upload a photo of your own driveway, try out our products and fuel your inspiration.
Why Buy Marshalls Driveway Block Paving
There are many reasons to buy Marshalls Fairstone, block paving and concrete driveway products. The unique Marshalls Register of Landscape Contractors can assist you in the process of selecting driveway paving products and enable you to enjoy the guarantee of a quality end product and ease of installation. They can also advise you on a variety of solutions in regards to the recent changes in Government regulations - Marshalls have an entire range of permeable concrete driveway options which do not require planning permission and sustainably manage the rainwater that lands on your driveway. To further this, Marshalls Registered Installers can offer the unique Marshalls Hard Landscaping Guarantee to protect your investment. Together, these unique selling points provide you with a high quality standard of driveway paving products, ease of installation and a positive experience.
Why Buy Marshalls Driveway Block Paving
Once you have a good idea of the driveway block paving products on offer, it's really easy to find a local Marshalls stockist in your area using the Where to Buy tab. Many Marshalls' stockists now have a Marshalls' hard landscape display in branch, where you can view a wide selection of driveway paving products close up before you make your final choice. 
When buying driveway paving there are a number of things that must be considered;

Finding a good installer from the Marshalls Register of Landscape Contractors. In order to gain their advice, expertise, ideas and recommendations, this should be planned early. 
Discussing your needs – there are a number of decisions to be made when designing and buying block paving therefore talking through your needs and expectations with several Installers allows you to judge whether they can meet your brief.
Deciding upon how you are going to comply with the current regulations – Marshalls Register Members can advise you on a number of solutions. 
Getting more than one quotation in writing - the cheapest isn't always the best; choose the Contractor you feel will deliver what you need. 
Considering Marshalls Hard Landscape Guarantee to protect your investment. 

Choosing Between Concrete and Natural Stone Driveway Block Paving
With the broad range of all our block paving products you may be faced with a huge amount of choice. It's helpful to understand the differences between stone and concrete driveways. Concrete can, basically, be anything you want – its handmade in the UK using moulds, which allows for the uniform look in terms of colour and texture. We also give it an authentic look by using real natural stone face profiles. Stone, on the other hand, has colours that have developed over years and therefore, give the most natural effect. As both stone and concrete block paving can be manipulated and processed to create something to your taste, the decision comes down to personal choice and budget when purchasing driveway paving.
