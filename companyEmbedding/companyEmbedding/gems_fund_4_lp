GEMS Education may fetch a valuation of about $4 billion or more in a potential initial public offering in London as early as next year, according to people familiar with the matter.The private-school operator -- backed by private equity firms Blackstone Group LP and Fajr Capital Ltd. and wealth fund Bahrain Mumtalakat Holding Co. -- has held meetings with investment banks in Dubai this month and is planning to make appointments in the coming weeks, the people said, asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.Rothschild & Co. is working as the company’s financial adviser and GEMS, one of the biggest private-school companies globally, is seeking to appoint underwriting banks, the people said. No final decisions have been made and GEMS may also decide not to pursue a listing, they said.




A spokesman for Dubai-based GEMS wasn’t immediately available to comment. Rothschild declined to comment.
