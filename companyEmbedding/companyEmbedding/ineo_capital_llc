Olefins







Ethylene





Ethylene is produced by steam cracking feedstocks such as natural gas liquids and refining streams, including ethane, propane and light naphtha. Ethylene is a colorless gas with a slightly sweet smell. It transforms from liquid into a gas at very low temperatures and is normally transported as a supercritical fluid through pipelines.
Ethylene is used to make:

Polyethylene
Ethylbenzene
Ethylene dichloride
Ethylene glycol
Linear alpha olefins
Vinyl acrylate monomer

These chemicals are then used to manufacture a wide variety of products from plastic wrap to milk bottles to PVC piping. Ethylene is of fundamental importance to the plastics industry and is a basic building block of organic chemistry.









Propylene





Propylene is a highly flammable colorless gas. Propylene is easier to transport than ethylene, as it can be liquefied at much lower pressures and conveyed in its liquid form. 
Our propylene is used internally as a chemical feedstock to make products such as:

Polypropylene
Acrylonitrile

Polypropylene and acrylonitrile are used in fiber, fabrics, cars, appliances, packaging and toys. 









1,3-Butadiene





1,3-Butadiene is a colorless gas at room temperature and is liquid at a few degrees below water's freezing point. It is typically extracted from the C4 cut of an olefins cracking process but can be made through dehydrogenation of normal butane. 1,3-Butadiene is used mainly to make synthetic rubber.
Synthetic rubber is used to make car and truck tires and athletic shoe soles.









Mixed Butenes





Also called butenes, or Raff-1, this C4 hydrocarbon stream is comprised mostly of butane components such as isobutylene and 1-butene, and contains some normal- and iso-butane. It can be transported by pipeline, railcar or barge.
Butenes can be:

Used directly as an alkylate feed in a refinery process
Or further refined and used for making consumer products

Raff-1 alkylate feed is used in making gasoline; refined butenes are used in the manufacture of adhesives, plastics and cosmetics.









Crude Benzene





Crude benzene is one of the heavier products produced by a steam cracking process and is comprised mostly of the chemical component benzene, a colorless, highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell.
Crude benzene is further refined to benzene where it is used in the production of other industrial chemicals such as:

Styrene
Cumene

Crude benzene is used as a precursor in the production of pharmaceuticals, plastics, synthetic rubber and dyes.









Fuel Oil





Fuel oil is typically the heaviest cut of the steam cracking process. It is a liquid at room temperature and is typically used as a fuel for the generation of heat or in an engine for the generation of power.

Jim Ratcliffe – A Profile by The Sunday Times
You may not have head of Jim Ratcliffe, but he is in your life from the moment you wake up until you go to sleep. He is responsible for the plastic cap on your toothpaste tube to the chlorine that cleans the water you use to brush your teeth. Many of the things you use during the day that are made using chemicals “we’ve had a hand in,” he says with a smile. This includes our clothes, our car, our furniture, and the packages our food and medicines come in.  Describing Jim as “Britain’s most successful post war industrialist”, John Arlidge asks him about his views on manufacturing, investments, shale gas and his latest project to build an uncompromising 4x4.

Big Boats - A Bold Plan
Whilst European gas production is crumbling, America's is booming. INEOS has a bold, pioneering plan: to ship US ethane gas to Europe bringing competitive advantage from America into Europe.
Five short films document the design and build of highly advanced, sustainable fleet of eight vessels that will be essential in supporting the INEOS plan. They are the largest, most flexible, advanced multigas carriers ever built.
“People said it couldn’t be done. At INEOS we believe everything is possible.” Jim Ratcliffe.
