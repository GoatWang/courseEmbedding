The value lies not in the great capabilities of its CRM, but the capability of the platform to be extended and adapted to any customer need.

One of the secrets to business success is pricing your products properly. Price your products correctly and that can enhance how much you sell, creating the foundation for a business that will prosper. Get your pricing strategy wrong and you may create problems that your business may never be able to overcome."It's probably the toughest thing there is to do," says Charles Toftoy, associate professor of management science at George Washington University. "It's part art and part science."There are a variety of different types of pricing strategies in business. However, there's no one surefire, formula-based approach that suits all types of products, businesses, or markets. Pricing your product usually involves considering certain key factors, including pinpointing your target customer, tracking how much competitors are charging, and understanding the relationship between quality and price. The good news is you have a great deal of flexibility in how you set your prices. That's also the bad news.The following pages will detail how to meet your business goals in pricing products, what factors to consider when pricing, and how to determine whether or raise or lower your prices.
Dig Deeper: How to Profit from Market ResearchHow to Price Your Products: Meeting Business GoalsGet Clear about Making MoneyThe first step is to get real clear about what you want to achieve with your pricing strategy: You want to make money. That's why you own a business. Making money means generating enough revenue from selling your products so that you can not only cover your costs, but take a profit and perhaps expand your business.The biggest mistake many businesses make is to believe that price alone drives sales. Your ability to sell is what drives sales and that means hiring the right sales people and adopting the right sales strategy. "The first thing you have to understand is the selling price is a function of your ability to sell and nothing else," says Lawrence L. Steinmetz, co-author of How to Sell at Margins Higher Than Your Competitors : Winning Every Sale at Full Price, Rate, or Fee (Wiley 2005) and a business consultant in Boulder, Colo. for 40 years. "What's the difference between an $8,000 Rolex and a $40 Seiko watch? The Seiko is a better time piece. It's far more accurate"¦. The difference is your ability to sell."At the same time, be aware of the risks that accompany making poor pricing decisions. There are two main pitfalls you can encounter - under pricing and over pricing.
 

Under pricing. Pricing your products for too low a cost can have a disastrous impact on your bottom line, even though business owners often believe this is what they ought to do in a down economy. "Accurately pricing your product is critical at any point in the economic cycle but no more so than in a recession," says Laura Willett, a small business consultant and faculty member in the finance department at Bentley College in Waltham, Mass. "Many businesses mistakenly under price their products attempting to convince the consumer that their product is the least expensive alternative hoping to drive up volume; but more often than not it is simply perceived as 'cheap." Remember that consumers want to feel that they are getting their "moneys worth" and most are unwilling to purchase from a seller they believe to have less value, Willett says. Businesses also need to be very careful that they are fully covering their costs when pricing products. "Reducing prices to the point where you are giving away the product will not be in the firm's best interest long term," Willett says.
Over pricing. On the flip side, overpricing a product can be just as detrimental since the buyer is always going to be looking at your competitors pricing, Willett says.  Pricing beyond the customer's desire to pay can also decrease sales. Toftoy says one pitfall is that business people will be tempted to price too high right out of the gate. "They think that they have to cover all the expenses of people who work for them, the lease, etc. and this is what price it takes to do all that," he says. "Put yourself in the customer's shoes. What would be a fair price to you?" He advises taking little surveys of customers with two or three questions on an index-card-sized form, asking them whether the pricing was fair.

Understand Your Other Business PrioritiesThere are other reasons to go into business. Understand what you want out of your business when pricing your products. Aside from maximizing profits, it may be important for you to maximize market share with your product -- that may help you decrease your costs or it may result in what economists call "network effects," i.e. the value of your product increases as more people use it. (A great example of a product having network effect is Microsoft's Windows operating system. When more people began to use Windows over rival products, more software developers made applications to run on that platform.)You may also want your product to be known for its quality, rather than just being the cheapest on the market. If so, you may want to price your product higher to reflect the quality. During a downturn, you may have other business priorities, such as sheer survival, so you may want to price your products to recoup enough to keep your company in business.

How to Price Your Products: Factors to Consider
"There are many methods available to determine the 'right' price," Willett says. "But successful firms use a combination of tools and know that the key factor to consider is always your customer first. The more you know about your customer, the better you'll be able to provide what they value and the more you'll be able to charge."Know Your CustomerUndertaking some sort of market research is essential to getting to know your customer, Willett says. This type of research can range from informal surveys of your existing customer base that you send out in e-mail along with promotions to the more extensive and potentially expensive research projects undertaken by third party consulting firms. Market research firms can explore your market and segment your potential customers very granularly -- by demographics, by what they buy, by whether they are price sensitive, etc.. If you don't have a few thousand dollars to spend on market research, you might just look at consumers in terms of a few distinct groups -- the budget sensitive, the convenience centered, and those for whom status makes a difference. Then figure out which segment you're targeting and price accordingly.Know Your CostsA fundamental tenet of pricing is that you need to cover your costs and then factor in a profit. That means you have to know how much your product costs. You also have to understand how much you need to mark up the product and how many you need to sell to turn a profit. Remember that the cost of a product is more than the literal cost of the item; it also includes overhead costs. Overhead costs may include fixed costs like rent and variable costs like shipping or stocking fees. You must include these costs in your estimate of the real cost of your product. "Come up with X first. X is your cost of raw materials, labor, rent, and everything it took to make the product so that if you sold it you would break even," advises Toftoy. "Y becomes what you think you need to make on it. That may depend on your business. Restaurants overall make about 4 percent, which is pretty low. If you want 10 percent then you factor that into your costs and that is what you charge."Many businesses either don't factor in all their costs and under price or literally factor in all their costs and expect to make a profit with one product and therefore overcharge. A good rule of thumb is to make a spread sheet of all the costs you need to cover every month, which might include the following:

Your actual product costs, including labor and the costs of marketing and selling those products.
All of the operating expenses necessary to own and operate the business.
The costs associated with borrowing money (debt service costs).
Your salary as the owner and/or manager of the business.
A return on the capital you and any other owners or shareholders have invested.
Capital for future expansion and replacement of fixed assets as they age.

List the dollar amount for each on your spreadsheet. The total should give you a good idea of the gross revenues you will need to generate to ensure you cover all those costs.Know Your Revenue Target You should also have a revenue target for how much of a profit you want your business to make. Take that revenue target, factor in your costs for producing, marketing, and selling your product and you can come up with a price per product that you want to charge. If you only have one product, this is a simple process. Estimate the number of units of that product you expect to sell over the next year. Then divide your revenue target by the number of units you expect to sell and you have the price at which you need to sell your product in order to achieve your revenue and profit goals.If you have a number of different products, you need to allocate your overall revenue target by each product. Then do the same calculation to arrive at the price at which you need to sell each product in order to achieve your financial goals.Know Your Competition It's also helpful to look at the competition -- after all, your customer most likely will, too. "Are the products offered comparable to yours?  If so, you can use their pricing as an initial gauge," Willett suggests. "Then, look to see whether there is additional value in your product; do you, for example offer additional service with your product or is your good of perceived higher quality?  If so, you may be able to support a higher price.  Be cautious about regional differences and always consider your costs."It may even be worthwhile to prepare a head-to-head comparison of the price of your product(s) to your competitor's product(s). The key here is to compare net prices, not just the list (or published) price. This information could come from phone calls, secret shopping, published data, etc. Make notes during this process about how your company and products -- and the competition -- are perceived by the market. Be brutally honest in your evaluation.Know Where the Market Is HeadedClearly you can't be a soothsayer, but you can keep track of outside factors that will impact the demand for your product in the future. These factors can range from something as simple as long-term weather patterns to laws that may impact future sales of your products. Also take into account your competitors and their actions. Will a competitor respond to your introduction of a new product on the market by engaging your business in a price war?
Dig Deeper: When Customers Grumble about Price Hikes
How to Price Your Products: Deciding to Raise or Lower Prices
One size does not fit all. You can only go so far pricing all your products based on a fixed markup from cost.  Your product price should vary depending on a number of factors including:

What the market is willing to pay.
How your company and product are perceived in the market.
What your competitors charge.
Whether the product is "highly visible" and frequently shopped and compared.
The estimated volume of product you can sell.

That opens the door to raising and/or lowering prices for your products. In order to make this call one way or the other, you should first understand what's already working. Analyze the profitability of your existing products, so you can do more of what works and stop doing what doesn't work. You want to find out which of your existing products are making money and which are losing money. You may be surprised at how many of your products are losing money -- fix those ASAP.You should also constantly re-evaluate your costs. To sell it right, you have to buy it right. If you are having a hard time selling a product at an acceptable profit, the problem may be that you are not buying the product right. It may be that your cost is too high rather than your price is too low.When to Raise Prices -- and HowYou should always be testing new prices, new offers, and new combinations of benefits and premiums to help you sell more of your product at a better price. Test new offers each month. Raise the price and offer a new and unique bonus or special service for the customer. Measure the increase or decrease in the volume of the product you sell and the total gross profit dollars you generate.It is a fact of life in business that you will have to raise prices from time to time as part of managing your business prudently. If you never raise your prices, you won't be in business for long. You have to constantly monitor your price and your cost so that you are both competitive in the market and you make the kind of money you deserve to make."The best way to determine if the product is being priced correctly is to watch sales volumes immediately after making any change," Willett says. "This can be done by watching cash collections (if the business is cash or credit card based) or credit sales (if accounts receivables are used) for the weeks following. If a price increase is too high, customers will react pretty quickly.  Also watching the competition can help - if you've made a positive change in prices; competitors are likely to follow suit."But there is a right way and a wrong way to raise prices. You don't want to alienate your existing customer base by raising prices too steeply, especially during a recession. "Rather than have a sudden increase, have a strategic plan over two to five years during which you gradually increase your price 5 to 10 percent," Toftoy advices. "If the business is in trouble and you say, 'Hey, I'm going to mark everything up"¦ that kind of scares people away. This way you haven't gone from $5 to $15. You've gone to $7.50 first.""In terms of raising the price -- this is more easily accepted in 'good' economic times," Willett says. "As the underlying cost of producing the product rises, the customer is prepared to accept the rise in the price to them.  If the customer perceives that the firm's costs are going down while their price is going up. This will not be received well and is likely to backfire."When to Lower Prices -- and HowYou may realize that you have missed your target audience by pricing your products too high. You can always choose to discount your products or give customers something for free in order to get them to try your product or generate traffic to your storefront or website. "You have to get people in," Toftoy says. "People like getting something for free or some kind of discount. You can make Wednesday senior citizen day when seniors get a 20 percent discount. Then maybe you can offer a student discount day. Then all you're doing is keeping the price the same, but to those people you're giving them a cut but it's not like you've lowered all prices."Generally, lowering prices is not a good practice unless you are using this strategically to garner market share and have a price sensitive product or if all of your competitors are lowering their prices, Willett says. "An alternative to lowering price is to offer less for the same price which will effectively reduce your costs without appearing to reduce the value to the customer," she says. "Restaurants have found this particularly helpful in terms of portion sizes but this same strategy can be applied to service industries as well."Monitor Your PricingAnother key component to pricing your product right is to continuously monitor your prices and your underlying profitability on a monthly basis. It's not enough to look at overall profitability of your company every month. You have to focus on the profitability (or lack of profitability) of every product you sell. You have to make absolutely sure you know the degree to which every product you sell is contributing to your goal of making money each month. Remember: "People respect what you inspect."Here are some other practices to help you price right:

Listen to your customers. Try to do this on a regular basis by getting feedback from customers about your pricing. Let them know you care about what they think.
Keep an eye on your competitors. If you don't have deep pockets and can't afford to hire a market research team, hire some college students to go out on a regular basis and monitor what your competitors are doing.
Have a budget action plan in place. Try to have a plan for your pricing that extends out three to six months in the future.

You owe it to yourself and to your business to be relentless in managing your product pricing. Remember, how you set the price of the products could be the difference between the success -- or failure -- of your business.

How do I determine if a product is RoHS compliant?
Last Updated: Jan 06, 2017 12:14PM EST


        For our customers’ convenience, we list RoHS compliance as a parameter on our product information pages when available. RoHS (Restriction of Hazardous Substances) compliant products meet restricted levels for six hazardous materials that can be found in electrical products. For more information on RoHS compliance, please click here.

Locating the RoHS Listing on a Product Information Page
    1.    In the red navigation bar at the top, click on Product on the right.
    2.    Type in the Item #, SKU or UPC of the Satco product in question.
    3.    Click the GO button.
    4.    Select the product from the Product Search page.
    5.    If applicable, RoHS Compliant will be listed in the product description area.

Still having trouble?: If you are unable to see if a specific Satco product is RoHS compliant, just send an email to professionals@satco.com with the product number of the Satco product in question. We’ll let you know if it’s RoHS compliant or not.

Three Parts:Determining OverheadRaising and Lowering PricesUsing Promotional Pricing StrategiesCommunity Q&A
Using an effective pricing strategy can be the difference between a hopping business and a dud. You've already done the work to come up with a killer product and an unforgettable hook for your business, so now you just need to price it accordingly. Learn to determine your overhead, raise and lower appropriately, and use promotional pricing to your advantage, and you'll be in the black in no time.







Steps


Part 1

Determining Overhead







1

Calculate the cost of running your business. A basic pricing method requires that you determine the full cost of running your business and price your product in such a way as to keep your business in the black. So, the first thing you need to do is calculate how much it costs to run your business. These costs can be further divided into direct and indirect costs. Add up your:[1]


Direct costs are those which are immediately associated with doing business. These costs get directly assigned to your products and services you provide.[2]
Labor costs
Marketing costs
Manufacturing costs (cost of raw materials, equipment, etc.)



Indirect costs are things associated with keeping things running, and the day to day. These are sometimes thought of as the hidden or even “true cost” of running a business.[3]
Operating expenses (including rent on your building, utilities, etc.)
Debt service costs
Return on any investment capital
Cleaning and office supplies
Your own salary











2

Set a "success point." The only reason to start a business is to make money, and specifically to make enough money to keep the venture a successful enterprise. For this reason, you need to set a point at which you would consider the business successful, your success point, and add that figure to your expenses to determine how much revenue you need to generate from sales.


Once you know how much money you need to make for the business to be successful, then you can start getting some sense of what a successful price would be for your product.
It may take some number of years to master your market.








3

Anticipate your customer's desires. Another major figure that you need to determine is how much merchandise you might reliably sell in a given period. This will be determined by your customers' buying tendencies. Identify your customer base and their buying tendencies.[4] How much do they desire your particular product? Is there a demand for it? Be as specific as possible in your discussion of numbers. How much is it possible to sell, given your current resources? How much do you need to sell to maintain the visibility and success of your current model? What might need to be changed?


Divide your success point by the number of units you think might be reliably sold to determine a price guideline, per unit. This isn't necessarily to say that this should be the price, but this is a good number to start experimenting with and seeing how your customers will respond.
Provide genuine customer service, not just lip service.[5]









4

Study your competition. If you sell custom-made iPhone cases, are there other companies that provide similar services? Where? How much do their products cost? How is their company run? You need to learn everything you can about your competition so you can learn to differentiate yourself from their model to get your share of the common market.[6]

Say you're one of two frozen yogurt stands in your town, and you can't figure out why your $7 a cup (cheap for the ingredients!) organic coconut rosemary kefir isn't bringing in the masses, while the "Dairy Queen" across town sells regular chocolate cones like they're going out of style. You need to be familiar with their prices and their customer base so you can stay competitive and stay relevant. Do you share the same customer base? Is there another customer base you might tap into and market to, to make your business more viable? Is anyone ever going to be willing to pay your prices? These are important questions for a successful business to consider when pricing.
Use a search engine to research your competition. Social media and the internet have changed the ways customers find business.[7]











Part 2

Raising and Lowering Prices







1

Understand the effects of over and under pricing. Setting the price inefficiently will have marked and measurable effects on your numbers. You need to learn to recognize the symptoms of having either a low or high price point. This can indicate that you may need to make a change.



Underpricing is often done by companies who want to sell a higher volume, expecting that the customer will assume they're getting a deal, especially in a down economy.[8] Doing this, however, can give the impression that the product is "cheap," not that they're getting their money's worth.

Overpricing may drive your customers elsewhere. Especially when you're trying to get your feet on the ground as your business gets started, it can be tempting to set the price too high. The investment of starting a business can be scary and you'll probably want to start covering costs right away, but consider the customer's point of view. Setting it at a point you'll make money will only work if people are willing to pay for it.[9]









2

Keep a close eye on your pricing and your budget. Monitor your profits and prices at least monthly. Break down the cost/gains of every product so that you know how each contributes to your overall profitability month-to-month. This can give a clear picture of your money flow.


Talk to your customers and listen to their feedback. Take it to heart. If they enjoy your product but complain about the price, you might consider making a change.
Develop a budget plan. Try to focus on a long term strategy that will result in making the business profitable. This might not involve making drastic changes right away, but slowly moving toward an overall goal of profitability.








3

Raise prices slowly and incrementally. Jumping from selling an iPhone case for $5 to selling one for $12 will undoubtedly lose you customers, even if the price change is right for the business and a smart move. Instead, raise it incrementally and spend time advertising the product's benefits and advantages, as opposed to apologizing for the increase. Treat it as a benefit, rather than an inconvenience.


Sudden increases will look like desperate moves made by a struggling business, which may or may not be true. You want to avoid the impression that you're raising the prices because you need to make more money. Rather, you need to make it seem as if you're raising prices because the product is just that good.[10]

Watch your sales volume immediately after making the change. If the move was too sudden, you'll see a negative change, suggesting that you need to do more to sell the new variation on the product and justify its price.








4

Use promotions to lower prices and get people in the store. Unless your competition is lowering their price, or you're just not getting the kind of traffic in your business that you need in order to make it profitable, you generally want to avoid lowering prices. Lowering the price may suggest another kind of desperation--that people are avoiding your store. Using promotions for limited periods of time, or coupons that expire, you can help drive customers toward a particular product or service.


Use discount tactics and promotions rather than lowering the price all at once. You can even alter the amount that someone gets for the same price. For example, November is a month of diabetes awareness.[11] During November, you may charge more for sugary drinks and to recoup the cost of charging less on healthy foods. Make sure to the customers about this, as it can help to drive their choices, as well as make them feel better about paying more for something. They will also know that the price changes are limited.
Avoid seeming desperate. For example, an empty restaurant may give the impression that the food is not delicious. Especially if it suddenly becomes very cheap, people may feel the product is of inferior quality.










Part 3

Using Promotional Pricing Strategies







1

Use creative promotions to get people in the door. Pricing in order to promote a product is a very common application. This gives the consumer the impression that your business is a place to go to get deals, even if you're not always giving them deals. Try letting your pricing strategies advertise for you.


Use a Buy One, Get One Free promotion to get people interested in your product and ensure that they'll be struck by the deals they're getting. If you can keep them coming back, even when you're not holding promotions, they'll be hooked.
Often sellers will bundle several products in the same package, moving old or unwanted stock by creating killer deals. Dated DVDs, CDs, and video games are often sold using the bundle approach.
Quantity discounts (20% off $150 or more!) and rebates ($399.95 after rebate!) can also help to get people to purchase more.[12]









2

Appeal to your customer's emotions and rationality. Promotional pricing strategies can't just be informational campaigns, they have to connect with your target market.[13] In order to do this, take time to appeal to their emotions or pragmatism. A common business strategy involves pricing items in .99 cent increments, rather than dollar increments. At a glance, the difference in savings seems huge (even though it's non-existent, practically). Pricing judiciously will help you keep sales high without changing your strategy considerably.


Consider creating a "Premium" package to up-sell customers on moderately "improved" versions of the basically the same product, but with more sophistication (i.e., more marketing).
Consider establishing a "line" of products, with varying levels at which the customer can engage. Car washes will often use this pricing strategy: A basic wash could be $2, wash and wax $4, and the whole package $6.








3

Try to up-sell promotions to move more merchandise. In Optional Product pricing, companies will attempt to increase the amount customers spend once they start to buy. Optional 'extras' increase the overall price of the product or service. For example, airlines will charge for optional extras such as guaranteeing a window seat or reserving a row of seats next to each other.


Historically, promotions have proven to be a better driver than advertising.[14]

One drawback to promotions is that they tend to be followed by lower levels of purchasing of that same product or service directly following the promotion.[15]









4

Avoid the appearance of price gouging. Gouging involves raising your product to a high price because you have a substantial competitive advantage of some kind, or a corner of the market. This advantage is not sustainable. The high price tends to attract new competitors into the market, and the price inevitably falls due to increased supply.


Captive Product Pricing is used when products have complements. Companies will charge a premium price where the consumer is captured. For example, a razor manufacturer will charge a low price and recoup its margin (and more) from the sale of the only design of blades which fit the razor.
In some places or under certain circumstances, price gouging is unlawful.[16][17]

How to Define Your Target Market


To build a solid foundation for your business, you must first identify your typical customer and tailor your marketing pitch accordingly.

Given the current state of the economy, having a well-defined target market is more important than ever. No one can afford to target everyone. Small businesses can effectively compete with large companies by targeting a niche market.
Many businesses say they target "anyone interested in my services." Some say they target small-business owners, homeowners, or stay-at-home moms. All of these targets are too general.
Targeting a specific market does not mean that you are excluding people who do not fit your criteria. Rather, target marketing allows you to focus your marketing dollars and brand message on a specific market that is more likely to buy from you than other markets. This is a much more affordable, efficient, and effective way to reach potential clients and generate business.
For example, an interior design company could choose to market to homeowners between the ages of 35 and 65 with incomes of $150,000-plus in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. To define the market even further, the company could choose to target only those interested in kitchen and bath remodeling and traditional styles. This market could be broken down into two niches: parents on the go and retiring baby boomers.
With a clearly defined target audience, it is much easier to determine where and how to market your company. Here are some tips to help you define your target market.
Look at your current customer base.
Who are your current customers, and why do they buy from you? Look for common characteristics and interests. Which ones bring in the most business? It is very likely that other people like them could also benefit from your product/service.
Dig deeper: Upselling: dig deeper into your customer base.
Check out your competition.
Who are your competitors targeting? Who are their current customers? Don't go after the same market. You may find a niche market that they are overlooking.
Dig deeper: In praise of niche marketing.
Analyze your product/service.
Write out a list of each feature of your product or service. Next to each feature, list the benefits it provides (and the benefits of those benefits). For example, a graphic designer offers high-quality design services. The benefit is a professional company image. A professional image will attract more customers because they see the company as professional and trustworthy. So ultimately, the benefit of high-quality design is gaining more customers and making more money.
Once you have your benefits listed, make a list of people who have a need that your benefit fulfills. For example, a graphic designer could choose to target businesses interested in increasing their client base. While this is still too general, you now have a base to start from.
Dig deeper: How to conduct market research.
Choose specific demographics to target.
Figure out not only who has a need for your product or service, but also who is most likely to buy it. Think about the following factors:

Age 
Location
Gender
Income level
Education level
Marital or family status
Occupation
Ethnic background

Dig deeper: Why demographics are crucial to your business.
Consider the psychographics of your target.
Psychographics are the more personal characteristics of a person, including:

Personality
Attitudes
Values
Interests/hobbies
Lifestyles
Behavior

Determine how your product or service will fit into your target's lifestyle. How and when will your target use the product? What features are most appealing to your target? What media does your target turn to for information? Does your target read the newspaper, search online, or attend particular events?
Dig deeper: Understanding how your customers think.
Evaluate your decision.
Once you've decided on a target market, be sure to consider these questions:

Are there enough people who fit my criteria?
Will my target really benefit from my product/service? Will they see a need for it?
Do I understand what drives my target to make decisions?
Can they afford my product/service?
Can I reach them with my message? Are they easily accessible?

Don't break down your target too far! Remember, you can have more than one niche market. Consider if your marketing message should be different for each niche. If you can reach both niches effectively with the same message, then maybe you have broken down your market too far. Also, if you find there are only 50 people that fit all of your criteria, maybe you should reevaluate your target. The trick is to find that perfect balance.
You may be asking, "How do I find all this information?" Try searching online for research others have done on your target. Search for magazine articles and blogs that talk about or to your target market. Search for blogs and forums where people in your target market communicate their opinions. Look for survey results, or consider conducting a survey of your own. Ask your current customers for feedback.
Defining your target market is the hard part. Once you know who you are targeting, it is much easier to figure out which media you can use to reach them and what marketing messages will resonate with them. Instead of sending direct mail to everyone in your ZIP code, you can send it only to those who fit your criteria. Save money and get a better return on investment by defining your target audience.

Pew Internet publishes reports regarding internet use among various demographics.
Scarborough issues press releases with useful data and sometimes publishes free studies.
Also look for free studies by Arbitron. You may be surprised what you can find just by doing a search in Google.
