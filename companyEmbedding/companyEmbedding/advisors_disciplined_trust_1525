Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

INVESTMENT SUMMARY                                                              
------------------                                                              

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE

The trust seeks to provide above average total return.                      

 PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY

The trust invests in a portfolio of stocks of foreign companies selected    
using a specialized dividend-oriented strategy that seeks above average total   
return.  We<F1>* selected the portfolio using the following strategy:           

*  We begin with the companies listed in the S&P ADR Index.  The S&P ADR Index  
is based on the non-U.S. stocks comprising the S&P Global 1200 Index.  The
S&P ADR Index is made up of those companies from the S&P Global 1200 Index
that offer either Level II or Level III American Depositary Receipts      
 (ADRs), global shares, or ordinary shares in the case of Canadian equities.
The S&P Global 1200 Index covers 29 countries and consists of seven       
regional components.                                                      

*  From the S&P ADR Index, we identify the three stocks in each of the ten      
industry sector components of the S&P ADR Index with the highest dividend 
yields.                                                                   

*  We select those 30 stocks for the trust's portfolio.                         

The ten industry sectors used in the strategy are the Global Industry       
Classification Standard sectors published by Standard & Poor's and MSCI Barra.  
Please note that we applied the strategy to select the portfolio at a particular
time.  If we create additional units of the trust after the trust's inception   
date, the trust will purchase the securities originally selected by applying the
strategy.  This is true even if a later application of the strategy would have  
resulted in the selection of different securities.  In addition, companies      
which, based on publicly available information as of two business days prior to 
the date of this prospectus, are the target of an announced business combination
which we expect will happen within six months of the date of this prospectus    
have been excluded from the universe of securities from which the trust's       
securities are selected.                                                        

 PRINCIPAL RISKS

As with all investments, you can lose money by investing in this trust.  The
trust also might not perform as well as you expect.  This can happen for reasons
such as these:                                                                  

*  STOCK PRICES WILL FLUCTUATE.  The value of your investment may fall over     
time.                                                                     

*  AN ISSUER MAY BE UNWILLING OR UNABLE TO DECLARE DIVIDENDS IN THE FUTURE, OR  
 MAY REDUCE THE LEVEL OF DIVIDENDS DECLARED.  This may result in a reduction
in the value of your units.                                               

*  THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AN ISSUER MAY WORSEN OR ITS CREDIT RATINGS MAY    
DROP, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN THE VALUE OF YOUR UNITS.  This may occur
at any point in time, including during the initial offering period.       

*  THE TRUST'S PERFORMANCE MIGHT NOT SUFFICIENTLY CORRESPOND TO PUBLISHED       
HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE OF THE TRUST'S INVESTMENT STRATEGY.  This can    
 happen for reasons such as an inability to exactly replicate the weightings
of stocks in the strategy or be fully invested, timing of the trust       
offering or timing of your investment, and trust expenses.                

*  STOCKS OF FOREIGN COMPANIES HELD BY THE TRUST PRESENT RISKS BEYOND THOSE OF  
 U.S. ISSUERS.  These risks may include market and political factors related
to the company's foreign market, international trade conditions, less     
 regulation, smaller or less liquid markets, increased volatility, differing
accounting practices and changes in the value of foreign currencies.      

*  WE DO NOT ACTIVELY MANAGE THE PORTFOLIO.  Except in limited circumstances,   
 the trust will hold, and continue to buy, shares of the same stocks even if
their market value declines.

 *  to pursue a long-term, dividend-oriented investment strategy that includes

The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee (maximum
of 2.95% of the unit offering price) and the sum of the remaining deferred sales
fee and the total creation and development fee.  The deferred sales fee is fixed
at $0.135 per unit and is paid in three monthly installments beginning on June
20, 2009.  The creation and development fee is fixed at $0.06 per unit and is   
paid at the end of the initial offering period (anticipated to be three months).

 EXAMPLE

This example helps you compare the cost of this trust with other unit trusts
and mutual funds.  In the example we assume that the expenses do not change and 
that the trust's annual return is 5%.  Your actual returns and expenses will    
vary.  Based on these assumptions, you would pay these expenses for every       
$10,000 you invest in the trust:                                                

1 year              $372                                    
3 years             $961                                    
5 years           $1,601                                    
10 years          $3,455                                    

This example assumes that you continue to follow the trust strategy and roll
your investment, including all distributions, into a new series of the trust    
each year subject to a reduced rollover sales charge of 1.95%.

HOW TO BUY UNITS

You can buy units of the trust on any business day the New York Stock       
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM.  The public offering  
price of units includes:                                                        

*  the net asset value per unit plus                                        

*  organization costs plus                                                  

*  the sales fee.                                                           

 The "net asset value per unit" is the value of the securities, cash and other
assets in the trust reduced by the liabilities of the trust divided by the total
units outstanding.  We often refer to the public offering price of units as the 
"offer price" or "purchase price."  The offer price will be effective for all   
orders received prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock     
Exchange (normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time).  If we receive your order prior to  
the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or authorized       
financial professionals receive your order prior to that time and properly      
transmit the order to us by the time that we designate, then you will receive   
the price computed on the date of receipt.  If we receive your order after the  
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, if authorized financial
professionals receive your order after that time or if orders are received by   
such persons and are not transmitted to us by the time that we designate, then  
you will receive the price computed on the date of the next determined offer    
price provided that your order is received in a timely manner on that date.  It 
is the responsibility of the authorized financial professional to transmit the  
orders that they receive to us in a timely manner.  Certain broker-dealers may  
charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit purchase orders.          

VALUE OF THE SECURITIES.  We determine the value of the securities as of the
close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day that        
exchange is open.  We generally determine the value of securities using the last
sale price for securities traded on a national securities exchange.  For this   
purpose, the trustee provides us closing prices from a reporting service        
approved by us.  In some cases we will price a security based on its fair value 
after considering appropriate factors relevant to value of the security.  We    
will only do this if a security is not principally traded on a national         
securities exchange or if the market quotes are unavailable or inappropriate.   

 We determined the initial prices of the securities shown under "Portfolio" in
this prospectus as described above at the close of regular trading on the New   
York Stock Exchange on the business day before the date of this prospectus.  On 
the first day we sell units we will compute the unit price as of the close of   
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the time the registration     
statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission becomes effective,  
if later.                                                                       

 ORGANIZATION COSTS.  During the initial offering period, part of the value of
the units represents an amount that will pay the costs of creating your trust.  
These costs include the costs of preparing the registration statement and legal 
documents, federal and state registration fees, the initial fees and expenses of
the trustee and the initial audit.  Your trust will sell securities to reimburse
us for these costs at the end of the initial offering period or after six       
months, if earlier.  The value of your units will decline when the trust pays   
these costs.

P-->4878th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
TRANSACTIONAL SALES FEE.  You pay a fee in connection with purchasing units.
We refer to this fee as the "transactional sales fee."  The transactional sales 
fee has both an initial and a deferred component and equals 2.35% of the public 
offering price per unit based on a $10 public offering price per unit.  This    
percentage amount of the transactional sales fee is based on the unit price on  
the trust's inception date.  The transactional sales fee equals the difference  
between the total sales fee and the creation and development fee.  As a result, 
the percentage and dollar amount of the transactional sales fee will vary as the
public offering price per unit varies.  The transactional sales fee does not    
include the creation and development fee which is described under "Expenses."   

The maximum sales fee equals 2.95% of the public offering price per unit at 
the time of purchase.  You pay the initial sales fee at the time you buy units. 
The initial sales fee is the difference between the total sales fee percentage  
(maximum of 2.95% of the public offering price per unit) and the sum of the     
remaining fixed dollar deferred sales fee and the total fixed dollar creation   
and development fee.  The initial sales fee will be approximately 1.00% of the  
public offering price per unit depending on the public offering price per unit. 
The deferred sales fee is fixed at $0.135 per unit.  Your trust pays the        
deferred sales fee in equal monthly installments as described on page 3.  If you
redeem or sell your units prior to collection of the total deferred sales fee,  
you will pay any remaining deferred sales fee upon redemption or sale of your   
units.                                                                          

REDUCING YOUR SALES FEE.  We offer a variety of ways for you to reduce the  
fee you pay.  It is your financial professional's responsibility to alert us of 
any discount when you order units.  Since the deferred sales fee and the        
creation and development fee are fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must 
charge these fees per unit regardless of any discounts.  However, if you are    
eligible to receive a discount such that your total sales fee is less than the  
fixed dollar amount of the deferred sales fee and the creation and development  
fee, we will credit you the difference between your total sales fee and these   
fixed dollar fees at the time you buy units.                                    

Large Purchases.  You can reduce your sales fee by increasing the size of   
your investment:                                                                

IF YOU PURCHASE:        YOUR FEE WILL BE:                           
------------------------------------------                            

Less than $100,000            2.95%                                   
$100,000 - $249,999           2.70                                    
$250,000 - $499,999           2.45                                    
$500,000 - $999,999           2.20                                    
$1,000,000 or more            1.95                                    

 We apply these fees as a percent of the public offering price per unit at the
time of purchase.  We also apply the different purchase levels on a unit basis  
using a $10 unit equivalent.  For example, if you purchase between 10,000 and   
24,999 units, your fee is 2.70% of your public offering price per unit.         

If you purchase units that qualify for the rollover/exchange option discount
described below and also purchase additional units on the same day from the same
broker-dealer that do not qualify for that discount, you may aggregate the units
that qualify for the rollover/exchange discount with the additional units       
purchased for purposes of qualifying for the purchase levels above on the       
additional units purchased.                                                     

You may AGGREGATE unit orders submitted by the same person for units of any 
of the trusts we sponsor on any single day from any one broker-dealer to qualify
for a purchase level.  You can

household and                                                         

*  orders submitted by your trust estate or fiduciary accounts.             

If you purchase units that qualify for the rollover/exchange option discount
described below and also purchase additional units on the same day from the same
broker-dealer that do not qualify for that discount, you may aggregate the units
that qualify for the rollover/exchange discount with the additional units       
purchased for purposes of qualifying for the purchase levels above on the       
additional units purchased.                                                     

The discounts described above apply during the initial offering period.     

Fee Accounts.  Investors may purchase units through registered investment   
advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each 
case either charge investor accounts ("Fee Accounts") periodic fees for         
brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management 
services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for 
which a comprehensive "wrap fee" charge ("Wrap Fee") is imposed.  You should    
consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these  
accounts.  To purchase units in these Fee Accounts, your financial advisor must 
purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if         
available.  Please contact your financial advisor for more information.  If     
units of the trust are purchased for a Fee Account and the units are subject to 
a Wrap Fee in such Fee Account (i.e., the trust is "Wrap Fee Eligible") then    
investors may be eligible to purchase units of the trust in these Fee Accounts  
that are not subject to the transactional sales fee but will be subject to the  
creation and development fee that is retained by the sponsor.  For example, this
table illustrates the sales fee you will pay as a percentage of the initial $10 
public offering price per unit (the percentage will vary with the unit price).  

Initial sales fee                0.00%                                      
Deferred sales fee               0.00%

This discount applies only during the initial offering period.  Certain Fee 
Account investors may be assessed transaction or other fees on the purchase     
and/or redemption of units by their broker-dealer or other processing           
organizations for providing certain transaction or account activities.  We      
reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of units in Fee Accounts by        
investors or selling firms whose frequent trading activity is determined to be  
detrimental to the trust.                                                       

Employees.  We waive the transactional sales fee for purchases made by      
officers, directors and employees of the sponsor and its affiliates and their   
family members (spouses, children and parents).  These purchases are not subject
to the transactional sales fee but will be subject to the creation and          
development fee.  We also waive a portion of the sales fee for purchases made by
registered representatives of selling firms and their family members (spouses,  
children and parents).  These purchases may be made at the public offering price
per unit less the applicable regular dealer concession.  These discounts apply  
during the initial offering period and in the secondary market.  All employee   
discounts are subject to the policies of the related selling firm.  Only        
officers, directors and employees of companies that allow their

employees to participate in this employee discount program are eligible for the 
discounts.                                                                      

Rollover/Exchange Option.  We waive a portion of the sales fee on units of  
the trust offered in this prospectus if you buy your units with redemption or   
termination proceeds from any of our other unit trusts.  You may also purchase  
units of the trust offered in this prospectus at this reduced fee if you        
purchase your units with (1) termination proceeds from an unaffiliated unit     
trust or (2) redemption proceeds from an unaffiliated unit trust if such trust  
is scheduled to terminate within 30 days of the redemption.  The discounted     
public offering price per unit for these transactions is equal to the regular   
public offering price per unit less 1.00%.  However, if you invest redemption or
termination proceeds of $1,000,000 or more in units of the trust, the maximum   
sales fee on your units will be limited to the maximum sales fee for the        
applicable amount invested in the table under "Large Purchases" above.  To      
qualify for this discount, the termination or redemption proceeds used to       
purchase units of the trust offered in this prospectus must be derived from a   
transaction that occurred within 30 days of your purchase of units of the trust 
offered in this prospectus.  In addition, the discount will only be available   
for investors that utilize the same broker-dealer (or a different broker-dealer 
with appropriate notification) for both the unit purchase and the transaction   
resulting in the receipt of the termination or redemption proceeds used for the 
unit purchase.  You may be required to provide appropriate documentation or     
other information to your broker-dealer to evidence your eligibility for this   
sales fee discount.                                                             

Please note that if you purchase units of the trust in this manner using    
redemption proceeds from trusts which assess the amount of any remaining        
deferred sales fee at redemption, you should be aware that any deferred sales   
fee remaining on these units will be deducted from those redemption proceeds.   
This discount applies only during the initial offering period.                  

 Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  We do not charge any sales fee when you reinvest
distributions from your trust into additional units of the trust.  This sales   
fee discount applies during the initial offering period and in the secondary    
market.  Since the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee are  
fixed dollar amounts per unit, your trust must charge these fees per unit       
regardless of this discount.  If you elect the distribution reinvestment plan,  
we will credit you with additional units with a dollar value sufficient to cover
the amount of any remaining deferred sales fee or creation and development fee  
that will be collected on such units at the time of reinvestment.  The dollar   
value of these units will fluctuate over time.                                  

RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS.  The portfolio may be suitable for purchase in tax-    
advantaged retirement accounts.  You should contact your financial professional 
about the accounts offered and any additional fees imposed.                     

HOW TO SELL YOUR UNITS

You can sell or redeem your units on any business day the New York Stock    
Exchange is open by contacting your financial professional.  Unit prices are    
available daily on the Internet at WWW.AAMPORTFOLIOS.COM or through your        
financial professional.  The sale and redemption price of units is equal to the 
net asset value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation 
and development fee or organization costs if you sell or redeem units during the
initial offering period.  The sale and redemption price is sometimes referred to
as the "liquidation price."  You

pay any remaining deferred sales fee when you sell or redeem your units.        
Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction or other fee for processing unit
redemption or sale requests.                                                    

SELLING UNITS.  We may maintain a secondary market for units.  This means   
that if you want to sell your units, we may buy them at the current net asset   
value, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and development fee
or organization costs if you sell units during the initial offering period.  We 
may then resell the units to other investors at the public offering price or    
redeem them for the redemption price.  Our secondary market repurchase price is 
the same as the redemption price.  Certain broker-dealers might also maintain a 
secondary market in units.  You should contact your financial professional for  
current repurchase prices to determine the best price available.  We may        
discontinue our secondary market at any time without notice.  Even if we do not 
make a market, you will be able to redeem your units with the trustee on any    
business day for the current redemption price.                                  

REDEEMING UNITS.  You may also redeem your units directly with the trustee, 
The Bank of New York Mellon, on any day the New York Stock Exchange is open.    
The redemption price that you will receive for units is equal to the net asset  
value per unit, provided that you will not pay any remaining creation and       
development fee or organization costs if you redeem units during the initial    
offering period.  You will pay any remaining deferred sales fee at the time you 
redeem units.  You will receive the net asset value for a particular day if the 
trustee receives your completed redemption request prior to the close of regular
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  Redemption requests received by        
authorized financial professionals prior to the close of regular trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange that are properly transmitted to the trustee by the time
designated by the trustee, are priced based on the date of receipt.  Redemption 
requests received by the trustee after the close of regular trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange, redemption requests received by authorized financial       
professionals after that time or redemption requests received by such persons   
that are not transmitted to the trustee until after the time designated by the  
trustee, are priced based on the date of the next determined redemption price   
provided they are received in a timely manner by the trustee on such date.  It  
is the responsibility of authorized financial professionals to transmit         
redemption requests received by them to the trustee so they will be received in 
a timely manner.  If your request is not received in a timely manner or is      
incomplete in any way, you will receive the next net asset value computed after 
the trustee receives your completed request.                                    

If you redeem your units, the trustee will generally send you a payment for 
your units no later than seven days after it receives all necessary             
documentation (this will usually only take three business days).  The only time 
the trustee can delay your payment is if the New York Stock Exchange is closed  
(other than weekends or holidays), the Securities and Exchange Commission       
determines that trading on that exchange is restricted or an emergency exists   
making sale or evaluation of the securities not reasonably practicable, and for 
any other period that the Securities and Exchange Commission permits.           

To redeem your units, you must send the trustee any certificates for your   
units.  You must properly endorse your certificates or sign a written transfer  
instrument with a signature guarantee.  The trustee may require additional      
documents such as a certificate of corporate authority, trust documents, a death
certificate, or an appointment as executor, administrator or guardian.  The

trustee cannot complete your redemption or send your payment to you until it    
receives all of these documents in complete form.                               

You can request an in-kind distribution of the securities underlying your   
units if you tender at least 2,500 units for redemption (or such other amount as
required by your financial professional's firm).  This option is generally      
available only for securities traded and held in the United States.  The trustee
will make any in-kind distribution of securities by distributing applicable     
securities in book entry form to the account of your financial professional at  
Depository Trust Company.  You will receive whole shares of the applicable      
securities and cash equal to any fractional shares.  You may not request this   
option in the last 30 days of your trust's life.  We may discontinue this option
upon sixty days notice.                                                         

EXCHANGE OPTION.  You may be able to exchange your units for units of our   
unit trusts at a reduced sales fee.  You can contact your financial professional
for more information about trusts currently available for exchanges.  Before you
exchange units, you should read the prospectus carefully and understand the     
risks and fees.  You should then discuss this option with your financial        
professional to determine whether your investment goals have changed, whether   
current trusts suit you and to discuss tax consequences.  We may discontinue    
this option at any time upon sixty days notice.                                 

ROLLOVER OPTION.  The trust strategy is a long-term investment strategy     
designed to be followed on an annual basis.  You may achieve more consistent    
long-term investment results by following the strategy.  As part of the         
strategy, we currently intend to offer a subsequent series of the trust for a   
rollover when the current trust terminates.  When the trust terminates you will 
have the option to (1) participate in a rollover and have your units reinvested 
into a subsequent trust series through a cash rollover as described in this     
section, (2) receive an in-kind distribution of securities or (3) receive a cash
distribution.                                                                   

 If you elect to participate in a rollover, your units will be redeemed on the
trust's termination date.  As the redemption proceeds become available, the     
proceeds (including dividends) will be invested in a new trust series, if       
available, at the public offering price for the new trust.  The trustee will    
attempt to sell securities to satisfy the redemption as quickly as practicable  
on the termination date.  We do not anticipate that the sale period will be     
longer than one day, however, certain factors could affect the ability to sell  
the securities and could impact the length of the sale period.  The liquidity of
any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security and the amount 
available for redemption and reinvestment on any day.                           

 We intend to make subsequent trust series available for sale at various times
during the year.  Of course, we cannot guarantee that a subsequent trust or     
sufficient units will be available or that any subsequent trusts will offer the 
same investment strategies or objectives as the current trust.  We cannot       
guarantee that a rollover will avoid any negative market price consequences     
resulting from trading large volumes of securities.  Market price trends may    
make it advantageous to sell or buy securities more quickly or more slowly than 
permitted by the trust procedures.  We may, in our sole discretion, modify a    
rollover or stop creating units of a trust at any time regardless of whether all
proceeds of unitholders have been reinvested in a rollover.  We may decide not  
to offer the rollover option upon sixty days notice.  Cash which has not been   
reinvested in a rollover will be distributed to unitholders shortly after the

termination date.  Rollover participants may receive taxable dividends or       
realize taxable capital gains which are reinvested in connection with a rollover
but may not be entitled to a deduction for capital losses due to the "wash sale"
tax rules.  Due to the reinvestment in a subsequent trust, no cash will be      
distributed to pay any taxes.  See "Taxes."
 DISTRIBUTIONS

MONTHLY DISTRIBUTIONS.  Your trust generally pays distributions of its net  
investment income (pro-rated on an annual basis) along with any excess capital  
on each monthly distribution date to unitholders of record on the preceding     
record date.  The record and distribution dates are shown under "Essential
Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this prospectus.  In some   
cases, your trust might pay a special distribution if it holds an excessive     
amount of cash pending distribution.  For example, this could happen as a result
of a merger or similar transaction involving a company whose stock is in your   
portfolio.  The trust will also generally make required distributions or        
distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year because it is  
structured as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax purposes.  The   
amount of your distributions will vary from time to time as companies change    
their dividends or trust expenses change.                                       

When the trust receives dividends from a portfolio security, the trustee    
credits the dividends to the trust's accounts.  In an effort to make relatively 
regular income distributions, the trust's monthly income distribution is equal  
to one-twelfth of the estimated net annual dividends to be received by the trust
after deduction of trust operating expenses.  Because the trust does not receive
dividends from the portfolio securities at a constant rate throughout the year, 
the trust's income distributions to unitholders may be more or less than the    
amount credited to the trust accounts as of the record date.  For the purpose of
minimizing fluctuation in income distributions, the trustee is authorized to    
advance such amounts as may be necessary to provide income distributions of     
approximately equal amounts.  The trustee will be reimbursed, without interest, 
for any such advances from available income received by the trust on the ensuing
record date.                                                                    

ESTIMATED ANNUAL DISTRIBUTIONS.  The estimated net annual distributions are 
shown under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of this 
prospectus.  We generally base the estimate of the income the trust may receive 
on annualizing the most recent ordinary dividend declared by an issuer (or      
adding the most recent interim and final dividends declared for certain foreign 
issuers) or on scheduled income payments.  However, dividend conventions for    
certain companies and/or certain countries differ from those in the United      
States and in certain instances, dividends paid or declared over several years  
or other periods were used to estimate annual distributions.  Due to this and   
various other factors, actual dividends received by the trust will most likely  
differ from the most recent annualized dividends or scheduled income payments.  
The actual net annual distributions you will receive will vary with changes in  
the trust's fees and expenses, in income payments received and with the sale of 
securities.                                                                     

REPORTS.  The trustee or your financial professional will make available to 
you a statement showing income and other receipts of your trust for each        
distribution.  Each year the trustee will also provide an annual report on your 
trust's activity and certain tax information.  You can request copies of        
security evaluations to enable you to complete your tax forms and audited       
financial statements for your trust, if available.

INVESTMENT RISKS

 All investments involve risk.  This section describes the main risks that can
impact the value of the securities in your portfolio.  You should understand    
these risks before you invest.  If the value of the securities falls, the value 
of your units will also fall.  We cannot guarantee that your trust will achieve 
its objective or that your investment return will be positive over any period.  

MARKET RISK is the risk that the value of the securities in your trust will 
fluctuate.  This could cause the value of your units to fall below your original
purchase price.  Market value fluctuates in response to various factors.  These 
can include changes in interest rates, inflation, the financial condition of a  
security's issuer, perceptions of the issuer, or ratings on a security.  Even   
though we supervise your portfolio, you should remember that we do not manage   
your portfolio.  Your trust will not sell a security solely because the market  
value falls as is possible in a managed fund.                                   

DIVIDEND PAYMENT RISK is the risk that an issuer of a security is unwilling 
or unable to pay income on a security.  Stocks represent ownership interests in 
the issuers and are not obligations of the issuers.  Common stockholders have a 
right to receive dividends only after the company has provided for payment of   
its creditors, bondholders and preferred stockholders.  Common stocks do not    
assure dividend payments.  Dividends are paid only when declared by an issuer's 
board of directors and the amount of any dividend may vary over time.           

STRATEGY CORRELATION RISK is the risk that the trust's performance will not 
sufficiently correspond with the hypothetical performance of the trust's        
investment strategy.  This can happen for reasons such as:                      

*  the impracticability of owning each of the strategy stocks with the exact
weightings at a given time,                                           

 *  strategy performance is based on a calendar year strategy while trusts may
 be created at various times during the year and generally have 15 month
terms,                                                                

*  the trust may not be fully invested at all times, and                    

*  trust fees and expenses.                                                 

FOREIGN ISSUER RISK.  Because the trust invests in stocks of foreign        
companies, the trust involves additional risks that differ from an investment   
exclusively in domestic stocks.  These risks include the risk of losses due to  
future political and economic developments, international trade conditions,     
foreign withholding taxes and restrictions on foreign investments and exchange  
of securities.  The trust also involves the risk that fluctuations in exchange  
rates between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the  
value of the stocks.  The trust involves the risk that information about the    
stocks is not publicly available or is inaccurate due to the absence of uniform 
accounting and financial reporting standards.  In addition, some foreign        
securities markets are less liquid than U.S. markets.  This could cause the     
trust to buy stocks at a higher price or sell stocks at a lower price than would
be the case in a highly liquid market.  Foreign securities markets are often    
more volatile and involve higher trading costs than U.S. markets, and foreign   
companies, securities markets and brokers are also generally not subject to the 
same level of supervision and regulation as in the U.S.  Certain stocks may be  
held in the form of ADRs or other similar receipts.  ADRs represent receipts for
foreign common stock deposited with a custodian (which may include the trustee  
of your trust).  The ADRs in the trust, if any, trade in the U.S. in U.S.       
dollars and are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  ADRs   
generally involve the same types of risks as foreign common stock held directly.
Some ADRs may experience less

liquidity than the underlying common stocks traded in their home market.        

LEGISLATION OR LITIGATION RISK is the risk that various legislative         
initiatives will be proposed from time to time in the United States and abroad  
which may have a negative impact on certain of the companies represented in the 
trust.  In addition, litigation regarding any of the issuers of the securities  
or of the industries represented by these issuers may negatively impact the     
share prices of these securities.  No one can predict what impact any pending or
threatened litigation will have on the share prices of the securities.          

LIQUIDITY RISK is the risk that the value of a security will fall if trading
in the security is limited or absent.  No one can guarantee that a liquid       
trading market will exist for any security.                                     

NO FDIC GUARANTEE.  An investment in the trust is not a deposit of any bank 
and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or
any other government agency.                                                    

HYPOTHETICAL PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

The following table compares hypothetical performance information for the   
strategy employed by the trust and the actual performance of the Standard &     
Poor's ADR Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index in each of the years listed
below (and as of the most recent month end).  These hypothetical returns should 
not be used to predict future performance of the trust.  Returns from the trust 
will differ from the hypothetical strategy returns for several reasons, such as:

 *  total return figures shown do not reflect commissions paid by the trust on
the purchase of securities or taxes you will incur;                   

*  strategy returns are for calendar years (and through the most recent     
month), while trusts begin and end on various dates;                  

*  the trust has a scheduled term longer than one year;                     

*  the trust may not be fully invested at all times or equally weighted in  
all stocks comprising its strategy; and                               

 *  the trust often purchases or sells securities at prices different from the
closing prices used in buying and selling units.                      

You should note that the trust is not designed to parallel movements in any 
index, and it is not expected that it will do so.  In fact, the trust's strategy
underperformed its comparative indexes in certain years and we cannot guarantee 
that the trust will outperform any index over the life of the trust or over     
consecutive rollover periods, if available.

illustrative purposes only and is not intended to indicate the future           
performance of any investment, including the trust.  The strategy stocks for a  
given year consist of the common stocks selected by applying the strategy as of 
the beginning of the period (and not the date the trust actually sells units).  
Total return represents the sum of the change in market value of each group of  
stocks between the first and last trading day of a period plus the total        
dividends paid on each group of stocks during such period divided by the opening
market value of each group of stocks as of the first trading day of a period.   
Total return figures assume that all dividends are reinvested semi-annually.    
Strategy figures reflect the deduction of sales charges and expenses but have   
not been reduced by estimated brokerage commissions paid by the trust in        
acquiring securities or any taxes incurred by investors.                        

 The trust strategy is based on the Standard & Poor's ADR Index.  The Standard
& Poor's ADR Index is designed to track the S&P 700 Index.  The S&P ADR Index   
only includes securities that can be traded and settled in the U.S.  The index  
is made up of those companies from the S&P 700 Index that offer either Level II 
or Level III ADRs, global shares, or ordinary shares in the case of Canadian    
equities.  (Level II and III ADRs are listed on U.S. securities exchanges or    
Nasdaq and must comply with certain Securities and Exchange Commission          
disclosure requirements.)  The S&P 700 Index is a subset of the S&P Global 1200 
Index, representing the non-US segment of global equity markets.  It is the S&P 
Global 1200 Index excluding the S&P 500 Index stocks.  The S&P Global 1200 Index
is a composite index, comprised of seven regional and country headline indices, 
many of which are the accepted leaders in their local markets.  The S&P Global  
1200 Index covers 29 countries and consists of seven regional components.       

 The strategy is derived from stocks contained in the S&P ADR Index.  Standard
& Poor's, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., publisher of the S&P   
ADR Index, is not affiliated with us and has not participated in creating the   
trust or selecting the securities for the trust, nor have they reviewed or      
approved of any of the information contained herein.                            

 HOW THE TRUST WORKS

YOUR TRUST.  Your trust is a unit investment trust registered under the     
Investment Company Act of 1940.  We created the trust under a trust agreement   
between Advisors Asset Management, Inc. (as depositor/sponsor, evaluator and    
supervisor) and The Bank of New York Mellon (as trustee).  To create your trust,
we deposited securities with the trustee (or contracts to purchase securities   
along with an irrevocable letter of credit or other consideration to pay for the
securities).  In exchange, the trustee delivered units of your trust to us.     
Each unit represents an undivided interest in the assets of your trust.  These  
units remain outstanding until redeemed or until your trust terminates.  At the 
close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's inception date, the number  
of units may be adjusted so that the public offering price per unit equals $10. 
The number of units and fractional interest of each unit in the trust will      
increase or decrease to the extent of any adjustment.                           

 CHANGING YOUR PORTFOLIO.  Your trust is not a managed fund.  Unlike a managed
fund, we designed your portfolio to remain relatively fixed.  Your trust will   
generally buy and sell securities:                                              

*  to pay expenses,                                                         

*  to issue additional units or redeem units,                               

*  in limited circumstances to protect the trust,                           

                                            Understanding Your Investment     15

P-->48717th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�17th
*  to make required distributions or avoid imposition of taxes on the trust,
or                                                                    

*  as permitted by the trust agreement.                                     

When your trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the      
securities in the portfolio may be altered.  If a public tender offer has been  
made for a security or a merger, acquisition or similar transaction has been    
announced affecting a security, the trustee may either sell the security or     
accept a tender offer if the supervisor determines that the action is in the    
best interest of unitholders.  The trustee will distribute any cash proceeds to 
unitholders.  If your trust receives securities or other property, it will      
either hold the securities or property in the portfolio or sell the securities  
or property and distribute the proceeds.  If any contract for the purchase of   
securities fails, the sponsor will refund the cash and sales fee attributable to
the failed contract to unitholders on or before the next distribution date      
unless substantially all of the moneys held to cover the purchase are reinvested
in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement.  The sponsor   
may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is the direct 
result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of the sponsor,  
would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust.  In such a     
case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment of sale 
proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in the    
trust on the trust's inception date.  The sponsor may also instruct the trustee 
to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to satisfy the  
qualifications of a regulated investment company.                               

We will increase the size of your trust as we sell units.  When we create   
additional units, we will seek to replicate the existing portfolio.  When your  
trust buys securities, it may pay brokerage or other acquisition fees.  You     
could experience a dilution of your investment because of these fees and        
fluctuations in security prices between the time we create units and the time   
your trust buys the securities.  Because the trust pays the brokerage fees      
associated with the creation of new units and with the sale of securities to    
meet redemption and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity
will likely result in higher brokerage expenses.  When your trust buys or sells 
securities, we may direct that it place orders with and pay brokerage           
commissions to brokers that sell units or are affiliated with us, your trust or 
the trustee.                                                                    

 Pursuant to an exemptive order, your trust may be able to purchase securities
from other trusts that we sponsor when we create additional units.  Your trust  
may also be able to sell securities to other trusts that we sponsor to satisfy  
unit redemption, pay deferred sales charges or expenses, in connection with     
periodic tax compliance or in connection with the termination of your trust.    
The exemption may enable each trust to eliminate commission costs on these      
transactions.  The price for those securities will be the closing price on the  
sale date on the exchange where the securities are principally traded as        
certified by us to the trustee.                                                 

AMENDING THE TRUST AGREEMENT.  The sponsor and the trustee can change the   
trust agreement without your consent to correct any provision that may be       
defective or to make other provisions that will not materially adversely affect 
your interest (as determined by the sponsor and the trustee).  We cannot change 
this agreement to reduce your interest in your trust without your consent.      
Investors owning two-thirds of the units in your trust may vote to change this  
agreement.

 TERMINATION OF YOUR TRUST.  Your trust will terminate on the termination date
set forth under "Essential Information" in the "Investment Summary" section of  
this prospectus.  The trustee may terminate your trust early if the value of the
trust is less than 40% of the original value of the securities in the trust at  
the time of deposit.  At this size, the expenses of your trust may create an    
undue burden on your investment.  Investors owning two-thirds of the units in   
your trust may also vote to terminate the trust early.  The trustee will        
liquidate the trust in the event that a sufficient number of units not yet sold 
to the public are tendered for redemption so that the net worth of the trust    
would be reduced to less than 40% of the value of the securities at the time    
they were deposited in the trust.  If this happens, we will refund any sales    
charge that you paid.                                                           

The trustee will notify you of any termination and sell any remaining       
securities.  The trustee will send your final distribution to you within a      
reasonable time following liquidation of all the securities after deducting     
final expenses.  Your termination distribution may be less than the price you   
originally paid for your units.                                                 

 THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.  We
are a broker-dealer specializing in providing trading and support services to   
broker-dealers, registered representatives, investment advisers and other       
financial professionals.  Our headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road, 
Monument, Colorado 80132.  You can contact our unit investment trust division at
8100 East 22nd Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using 
the contacts listed on the back cover of this prospectus.  AAM is a registered  
broker-dealer and investment adviser, a member of the Financial Industry        
Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and Securities Investor Protection           
Corporation (SIPC) and a registrant of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(MSRB).  If we fail to or cannot perform our duties as sponsor or become        
bankrupt, the trustee may replace us, continue to operate your trust without a  
sponsor, or terminate your trust.                                               

We and your trust have adopted a code of ethics requiring our employees who 
have access to information on trust transactions to report personal securities  
transactions.  The purpose of the code is to avoid potential conflicts of       
interest and to prevent fraud, deception or misconduct with respect to your     
trust.                                                                          

The sponsor or an affiliate may use the list of securities in the trust in  
its independent capacity (which may include acting as an investment adviser or  
broker-dealer) and distribute this information to various individuals and       
entities.  The sponsor or an affiliate may recommend or effect transactions in  
the securities.  This may also have an impact on the price your trust pays for  
the securities and the price received upon unit redemption or trust termination.
The sponsor may act as agent or principal in connection with the purchase and   
sale of securities, including those held by the trust, and may act as a         
specialist market maker in the securities.  The sponsor may also issue reports  
and make recommendations on the securities in the trust.  The sponsor or an     
affiliate may have participated in a public offering of one or more of the      
securities in the trust.  The sponsor, an affiliate or their employees may have 
a long or short position in these securities or related securities.  An officer,
director or employee of the sponsor or an affiliate may be an officer or        
director for the issuers of the securities.                                     

THE TRUSTEE.  The Bank of New York Mellon is the trustee of your trust with 
its principal unit investment trust division offices located

at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, Brooklyn, New York 11217.  You can contact the   
trustee by calling the telephone number on the back cover of this prospectus or 
by writing to its unit investment trust office.  We may remove and replace the  
trustee in some cases without your consent.  The trustee may also resign by     
notifying us and investors.                                                     

HOW WE DISTRIBUTE UNITS.  We sell units to the public through broker-dealers
and other firms.  We pay part of the sales fee to these distribution firms when 
they sell units.  During the initial offering period, the distribution fee (the 
broker-dealer concession or agency commission) for broker-dealers and other     
firms is as follows:                                                            

TRANSACTION             CONCESSION OR                             
AMOUNT:             AGENCY COMMISSION:                        
------------------------------------------                            

Less than $100,000            2.25%                                   
$100,000 - $249,999           2.00                                    
$250,000 - $499,999           1.75                                    
$500,000 - $999,999           1.50                                    
$1,000,000 or more            1.25                                    

We apply these concessions or agency commissions as a percent of the public 
offering price per unit at the time of the transaction.  We also apply the      
different levels on a unit basis using a $10 unit equivalent.  The broker-dealer
concession or agency commission is 65% of the sales fee for secondary market    
sales.  For transactions involving unitholders of other unit investment trusts  
who use their redemption or termination proceeds to purchase units of the trust,
the distribution fee is 1.30% of the public offering price per unit.  No        
distribution fee is paid to broker-dealers or other selling firms in connection 
with unit sales in investment accounts that charge a "wrap fee" or periodic fees
for investment advisory, financial planning or asset management services in lieu
of commissions.                                                                 

Broker-dealers and other firms that sell units of all Advisors Disciplined  
Trusts are eligible to receive additional compensation for volume sales.  Such  
payments will be in addition to the regular concessions paid to firms as set    
forth in the applicable trust's prospectus.  The additional concession is based 
on total initial offering period sales of all Advisors Disciplined Trusts during
a calendar quarter as set forth in the following table:                         

INITIAL OFFERING PERIOD SALES                VOLUME               
DURING CALENDAR QUARTER                 CONCESSION          
-------------------------------------------------------               

Less than $5,000,000                           0.000%                 
$5,000,000 but less than $10,000,000           0.050                  
$10,000,000 but less than $25,000,000          0.075                  
$25,000,000 but less than $50,000,000          0.100                  
$50,000,000 but less than $100,000,000         0.125                  
$100,000,000 but less than $1,000,000,000      0.150                  
$1,000,000,000 or more                         0.175                  

This volume concession will be paid on units of all eligible Advisors       
Disciplined Trusts sold in the initial offering period.  For a trust to be      
eligible for this additional compensation for calendar quarter sales, the       
trust's prospectus must include disclosure related to this additional           
compensation; a trust is not eligible for this additional compensation if the   
prospectus for such trust does not include disclosure related to this additional
compensation.  Broker-dealer firms will not receive additional compensation     
unless they sell at least $5.0 million of units during a calendar quarter.  For 
example, if a firm sells $4.5 million of units in the initial offering period   
during a calendar quarter, the firm will not receive any additional             
compensation.  Once a firm reaches a particular breakpoint during a quarter, the
firm will receive the stated volume concession on all initial offering period   
sales during the applicable quarter.  For example, if a firm sells $7.5 million 
of units in the initial offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will
receive additional compensation                                                 

18     Understanding Your Investment

of 0.05% of $7.5 million and if a firm sells $12.5 million of units in the      
initial offering period during a calendar quarter, the firm will receive        
additional compensation of 0.075% of $12.5 million.                             

In addition, dealer firms will not receive volume concessions on the sale of
units which are not subject to a transactional sales charge.  However, such     
sales will be included in determining whether a firm has met the sales level    
breakpoints for volume concessions.  Secondary market sales of all unit trusts  
are excluded for purposes of these volume concessions.  We will pay these       
amounts out of our own assets within a reasonable time following each calendar  
quarter.                                                                        

Any sales fee discount is borne by the broker-dealer or selling firm out of 
the distribution fee.  We reserve the right to change the amount of concessions 
or agency commissions from time to time.                                        

We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional   
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell units of this trust and our
other products.  This compensation is intended to result in additional sales of 
our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial advisors for past   
sales.  We may make these payments for marketing, promotional or related        
expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining retail        
customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or         
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products.  These arrangements will not  
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

 We generally register units for sale in various states in the U.S.  We do not
register units for sale in any foreign country.  This prospectus does not       
constitute an offer of units in any state or country where units cannot be      
offered or sold lawfully.  We may reject any order for units in whole or in     
part.                                                                           

We may gain or lose money when we hold units in the primary or secondary    
market due to fluctuations in unit prices.  The gain or loss is equal to the    
difference between the price we pay for units and the price at which we sell or 
redeem them.  We may also gain or lose money when we deposit securities to      
create units.  The amount of our profit or loss on the initial deposit of       
securities into the trust is shown in the "Notes to Portfolio."

 TAXES

 This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax consequences
of owning units of the trust.  This section is current as of the date of this   
prospectus.  Tax laws and interpretations change frequently, and these summaries
do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers.  For example,     
these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a           
corporation, a non-U.S. person, a broker/dealer, or other investor with special 
circumstances.  In addition, this section does not describe your state, local or
foreign tax consequences.                                                       

This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to
the sponsor.  The Internal Revenue Service could disagree with any conclusions  
set forth in this section.  In addition, our counsel was not asked to review,   
and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax         
treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust.  This may not be          
sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal   
tax law.                                                                        

As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual     
circumstances from your own tax advisor.

TRUST STATUS.  The trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment      
company" under the federal tax laws.  If the trust qualifies as a regulated     
investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law, the   
trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.                              

DISTRIBUTIONS.  Trust distributions are generally taxable.  After the end of
each year, you will receive a tax statement that separates your trust's         
distributions into three categories, ordinary income distributions, capital     
gains dividends and return of capital.  Ordinary income distributions are       
generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate, however, as further discussed below, 
certain ordinary income distributions received from the trust may be taxed at   
the capital gains tax rates.  Generally, you will treat all capital gains       
dividends as long-term capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your 
units.  To determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends,
you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after   
considering all of your other taxable transactions, as described below.  In     
addition, the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital   
for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you.  The tax status 
of your distributions from your trust is not affected by whether you reinvest   
your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash.  The income from
your trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is   
not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee, if any.  The tax laws  
may require you to treat distributions made to you in January as if you had     
received them on December 31 of the previous year.                              

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION.  A corporation that owns units generally will 
not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many        
dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is   
generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies.  
However, certain ordinary income dividends on units that are attributable to    
qualifying dividends received by the trust from certain corporations may be     
designated by the trust as being eligible for the dividends received deduction. 

SALE OR REDEMPTION OF UNITS.  If you sell or redeem your units, you will    
generally recognize a taxable gain or loss.  To determine the amount of this    
gain or loss, you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you
receive in the transaction.  Your tax basis in your units is generally equal to 
the cost of your units, generally including sales charges.  In some cases,      
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units.   

CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES AND CERTAIN ORDINARY INCOME DIVIDENDS.  If you are 
an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is    
generally 15% (generally 5% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax        
brackets).  These new capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable   
years beginning before January 1, 2011.  For later periods, if you are an       
individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is       
generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the 10% and 15% tax brackets).  The 
20% rate is reduced to 18% and the 10% rate is reduced to 8% for long-term      
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a holding
period of more than five years.                                                 

Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term     
capital loss for the taxable year.  Capital gain or loss is long-term if the    
holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term if the     
holding period for the asset is one year or less.  You must exclude the

date you purchase your units to determine your holding period.  However, if you 
receive a capital gain dividend from your trust and sell your unit at a loss    
after holding it for six months or less, the loss will be recharacterized as    
long-term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received.  The
tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are  
generally the same as for ordinary income.  The Internal Revenue Code treats    
certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations.                 

Ordinary income dividends received by an individual unitholder from a       
regulated investment company such as the trust are generally taxed at the same  
rates that apply to net capital gain (as discussed above), provided certain     
holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are        
attributable to qualifying dividends received by the trust itself.  These       
special rules relating to the taxation of ordinary income dividends from        
regulated investment companies generally apply to taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2011.  The trust will provide notice to its unitholders of the amount
of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is      
eligible for the new capital gains tax rates.                                   

IN-KIND DISTRIBUTIONS.  Under certain circumstances, as described in this   
prospectus, you may receive an in-kind distribution of trust securities when you
redeem units or when your trust terminates.  This distribution will be treated  
as a sale for federal income tax purposes and you will generally recognize gain 
or loss, generally based on the value at that time of the securities and the    
amount of cash received.  The Internal Revenue Service could however assert that
a loss could not be currently deducted.                                         

EXCHANGES.  If you elect to have your proceeds from your trust rolled over  
into a future trust, the exchange would generally be considered a sale for      
federal tax purposes.                                                           

DEDUCTIBILITY OF TRUST EXPENSES.  Expenses incurred and deducted by your    
trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you.  In some cases,   
however, you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as   
income.  In these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses. 
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment expenses,
may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions  
exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.                            

 FOREIGN TAX CREDIT.  If your trust invests in any foreign securities, the tax
statement that you receive may include an item showing foreign taxes your trust 
paid to other countries.  In this case, dividends taxed to you will include your
share of the taxes your trust paid to other countries.  You may be able to      
deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes.                   

FOREIGN INVESTORS.  If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other  
than a U.S. citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or   
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax treaties,
distributions from the trust will be characterized as dividends for federal     
income tax purposes (other than dividends which the trust designates as capital 
gain dividends) and will be subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding 
taxes, subject to certain exceptions described below.  However, distributions   
received by a foreign investor from the trust that are properly designated by   
the trust as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income   
taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the trust makes certain       
elections and certain other conditions are met.  In the case of dividends with  
respect to taxable years of the trust beginning                                 

                                            Understanding Your Investment     21

P-->48723rd�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
prior to 2010, distributions from the trust that are properly designated by the 
trust as an interest-related dividend attributable to certain interest income   
received by the trust or as a short-term capital gain dividend attributable to  
certain net short-term capital gain income received by the trust may not be     
subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including withholding taxes when received 
by certain foreign investors, provided that the trust makes certain elections   
and certain other conditions are met.                                           

EXPENSES

Your trust will pay various expenses to conduct its operations.  The "Fees
and Expenses" section of the "Investment Summary" in this prospectus shows the  
estimated amount of these expenses.                                             

The sponsor will receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing  
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions.  This "creation and     
development fee" is a charge of $0.06 per unit.  The trustee will deduct this   
amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial offering period. 
No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of distribution expenses or as 
compensation for sales efforts.  This fee will not be deducted from proceeds    
received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of units before the close of 
the initial public offering period.                                             

Your trust will pay a fee to the trustee for its services.  The trustee also
benefits when it holds cash for your trust in non-interest bearing accounts.    
Your trust will reimburse us as supervisor, evaluator and sponsor for providing 
portfolio supervisory services, for evaluating your portfolio and for providing 
bookkeeping and administrative services.  Our reimbursements may exceed the     
costs of the services we provide to your trust but will not exceed the costs of 
services provided to all of our unit investment trusts in any calendar year.    
All of these fees may adjust for inflation without your approval.               

Your trust will also pay its general operating expenses.  Your trust may pay
expenses such as trustee expenses (including legal and auditing expenses),      
various governmental charges, fees for extraordinary trustee services, costs of 
taking action to protect your trust, costs of indemnifying the trustee and the  
sponsor, legal fees and expenses, expenses incurred in contacting you and costs 
incurred to reimburse the trustee for advancing funds to meet distributions.    
Your trust may pay the costs of updating its registration statement each year.  
The trustee will generally pay trust expenses from distributions received on the
securities but in some cases may sell securities to pay trust expenses.

ADVISORS DISCIPLINED TRUST 334                                                  

We have audited the accompanying statement of financial condition, including the
trust portfolio on pages 4 and 5, of Advisors Disciplined Trust 334, as of      
February 25, 2009, the initial date of deposit.  The statement of financial     
condition is the responsibility of the trust's sponsor.  Our responsibility is  
to express an opinion on this statement of financial condition based on our     
audit.                                                                          

We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards of the Public      
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require    
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether 
the statement of financial condition is free of material misstatement.  The     
trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform an audit of its   
internal control over financial reporting.  Our audit included consideration of 
internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit        
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of
expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the trust's internal control over 
financial reporting.  Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also   
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the statement of financial condition, assessing the accounting   
principles used and significant estimates made by the sponsor, as well as       
evaluating the overall statement of financial condition presentation.  Our      
procedures included confirmation with The Bank of New York Mellon, trustee, of  
cash or an irrevocable letter of credit deposited for the purchase of securities
as shown in the statement of financial condition as of February 25, 2009.  We   
believe that our audit of the statement of financial condition provides a       
reasonable basis for our opinion.                                               

In our opinion, the statement of financial condition referred to above presents 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advisors Disciplined
Trust 334 as of February 25, 2009, in conformity with accounting principles     
generally accepted in the United States of America.

(1)  Aggregate cost of the securities is based on the closing sale price                                       
     evaluations as determined by the evaluator.                                                               
(2)  Cash or an irrevocable letter of credit has been deposited with the trustee                               
     covering the funds (aggregating $200,000) necessary for the purchase of                                   
     securities in the trust represented by purchase contracts.                                                
(3)  A portion of the public offering price represents an amount sufficient to                                 
     pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing the trust.                                 
     These costs have been estimated at $0.05 per unit for the trust.  A                                       
     distribution will be made as of the earlier of the close of the initial                                   
     offering period or six months following the trust's inception date to an                                  
     account maintained by the trustee from which this obligation of the                                       
     investors will be satisfied.  To the extent the actual organization costs                                 
     are greater than the estimated amount, only the estimated organization                                    
     costs added to the public offering price will be reimbursed to the sponsor                                
     and deducted from the assets of the trust.                                                                
(4)  The total sales fee consists of an initial sales fee, a deferred sales fee                                
     and a creation and development fee.  The initial sales fee is equal to the                                
     difference between the maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining                                     
     deferred sales fee and the total creation and development fee.  The maximum                               
     sales fee is  2.95% of the public offering price per unit.  The deferred                                  
     sales fee is equal to $0.135 per unit and the creation and development fee                                
     is equal to $0.06 per unit.                                                                               
(5)  The aggregate cost to investors includes the applicable sales fee assuming                                
     no reduction of sales fees.

GENERAL INFORMATION                                                             

  Each trust is one of a series of separate unit investment trusts created
under the name Advisors Disciplined Trust and registered under the Investment   
Company Act of 1940.  Each trust was created as a common law trust on the       
inception date described in the prospectus under the laws of the state of       
New York.  Each trust was created under a trust agreement among Advisors Asset  
Management, Inc. (as sponsor, evaluator and supervisor) and The Bank of New York
Mellon (as trustee).                                                            

When your trust was created, the sponsor delivered to the trustee     
securities or contracts for the purchase thereof for deposit in the trust and   
the trustee delivered to the sponsor documentation evidencing the ownership of  
units of the trust.  At the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the trust's 
inception date, the number of units may be adjusted so that the public offering 
price per unit equals $10.  The number of units, fractional interest of each    
unit in the trust and estimated income distributions per unit will increase or  
decrease to the extent of any adjustment.  Additional units of each trust may be
issued from time to time by depositing in the trust additional securities (or   
contracts for the purchase thereof together with cash or irrevocable letters of 
credit) or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) with           
instructions to purchase additional securities.  As additional units are issued 
by a trust as a result of the deposit of additional securities by the sponsor,  
the aggregate value of the securities in the trust will be increased and the    
fractional undivided interest in the trust represented by each unit will be     
decreased.  The sponsor may continue to make additional deposits of securities  
into a trust, provided that such additional deposits will be in amounts, which  
will generally maintain the existing relationship among the shares of the       
securities in such trust.  Thus, although additional units will be issued, each 
unit will generally continue to represent the same number of shares of each     
security.  If the sponsor deposits cash to purchase additional securities,      
existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their investments and a 
reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations in the prices of  
the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase of the          
securities and because the trust will pay any associated brokerage fees.        

The trustee has not participated in the selection of the securities   
deposited in the trust and has no responsibility for the composition of the     
trust portfolio.                                                                

     Each unit initially offered represents an undivided interest in the related
trust.  To the extent that any units are redeemed by the trustee or additional  
units are issued as a result of additional securities being deposited by the    
sponsor, the fractional undivided interest in a trust represented by each       
unredeemed unit will increase or decrease accordingly, although the actual      
interest in such trust represented by such fraction will remain unchanged.      
Units will remain outstanding until redeemed upon tender to the trustee by      
unitholders, which may include the sponsor, or until the termination of the     
trust agreement.                                                                

A trust consists of (a) the securities listed under "Portfolio" in the
prospectus as may continue to be held from time to time in the trust, (b) any   
additional securities acquired and held by the trust pursuant to the provisions 
of the trust agreement and (c) any cash held in the accounts of the trust.      
Neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any

failure in any of the securities.  However, should any contract for the purchase
of any of the securities initially deposited in a trust fail, the sponsor will, 
unless substantially all of the moneys held in the trust to cover such purchase 
are reinvested in substitute securities in accordance with the trust agreement, 
refund the cash and sales fee attributable to such failed contract to all       
unitholders on the next distribution date.                                      

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES                                               

The trust seeks to provide dividend income and capital appreciation by
investing in a portfolio of stocks of foreign companies selected using a        
specialized dividend-oriented strategy that seeks to outperform the Standard &  
Poor's ADR Index.  There is, of course, no guarantee that the trust will achieve
its objective.  The prospectus provides additional information regarding the    
trust's objective and investment strategy.                                      

     The trust is a unit investment trust and is not an "actively managed" fund.
Traditional methods of investment management for a managed fund typically       
involve frequent changes in a portfolio of securities on the basis of economic, 
financial and market analysis.  The portfolio of a trust, however, will not be  
actively managed and therefore the adverse financial condition of an issuer will
not necessarily require the sale of its securities from a portfolio.            

     The sponsor may not alter the portfolio of a trust by the purchase, sale or
substitution of securities, except in special circumstances as provided in the  
trust agreement.  Thus, the assets of a trust will generally remain unchanged   
under normal circumstances.  The trust agreement provides that the sponsor may  
(but need not) direct the trustee to dispose of a security in certain events    
such as the issuer having defaulted on the payment on any of its outstanding    
obligations or the price of a security has declined to such an extent or other  
such credit factors exist so that in the opinion of the supervisor the retention
of such securities would be detrimental to the trust.                           

If a public tender offer has been made for a security or a merger,    
acquisition or similar transaction has been announced affecting a security, the 
trustee may either sell the security or accept a tender offer if the supervisor 
determines that the action is in the best interest of unitholders.  The trustee 
will distribute any excess cash proceeds to unitholders.  If your trust receives
securities or other property, it will either hold the securities or property in 
the portfolio or sell the securities or property and distribute the proceeds.   
The sponsor may direct the reinvestment of security sale proceeds if the sale is
the direct result of serious adverse credit factors which, in the opinion of the
sponsor, would make retention of the securities detrimental to the trust.  In   
such a case, the sponsor may, but is not obligated to, direct the reinvestment  
of sale proceeds in any other securities that meet the criteria for inclusion in
the trust on the trust's inception date.  The sponsor may also instruct the     
trustee to take action necessary to ensure that the portfolio continues to      
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company for federal tax    
purposes if the trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment company.

     The trustee may sell securities, designated by the supervisor, from a trust
for the purpose of redeeming units of such trust tendered for redemption and the
payment of expenses.

P-->48730th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
   In addition, if a trust has elected to be taxed as a regulated investment
company, the trustee may dispose of certain securities and take such further    
action as may be needed from time to time to ensure that a trust continues to   
satisfy the qualifications of a regulated investment company, including the     
requirements with respect to diversification under Section 851 of the Internal  
Revenue Code, and as may be needed from time to time to avoid the imposition of 
any tax on a trust or undistributed income of a trust as a regulated investment 
company.                                                                        

   Proceeds from the sale of securities (or any securities or other property
received by a trust in exchange for securities) are credited to the Capital     
Account of a trust for distribution to unitholders or to meet redemptions.      
Except for failed securities and as provided herein, in the prospectus or in the
trust agreement, the acquisition by a trust of any securities other than the    
portfolio securities is prohibited.                                             

     Because certain of the securities in certain of the trusts may from time to
time under certain circumstances be sold or otherwise liquidated and because the
proceeds from such events will be distributed to unitholders and will not be    
reinvested, no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of
time its present size and composition.  Neither the sponsor nor the trustee     
shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.  
In the event of a failure to deliver any security that has been purchased for a 
trust under a contract ("Failed Securities"), the sponsor is authorized under   
the trust agreement to direct the trustee to acquire other securities           
("Replacement Securities") to make up the original corpus of such trust.        

    The Replacement Securities must be purchased within 20 days after delivery
of the notice that a contract to deliver a security will not be honored and the 
purchase price may not exceed the amount of funds reserved for the purchase of  
the Failed Securities.  The Replacement Securities must be equity securities of 
the type selected for the trust and must not adversely affect the federal income
tax status of the trust.  Whenever a Replacement Security is acquired for a     
trust, the trustee shall notify all unitholders of the trust of the acquisition 
of the Replacement Security and shall, on the next monthly distribution date    
which is more than 30 days thereafter, make a pro rata distribution of the      
amount, if any, by which the cost to the trust of the Failed Security exceeded  
the cost of the Replacement Security.  Once all of the securities in a trust are
acquired, the trustee will have no power to vary the investments of the trust,  
i.e., the trustee will have no managerial power to take advantage of market     
variations to improve a unitholder's investment.                                

    If the right of limited substitution described in the preceding paragraphs
is not utilized to acquire Replacement Securities in the event of a failed      
contract, the sponsor will refund the sales fee attributable to such Failed     
Securities to all unitholders of the trust and the trustee will distribute the  
cash attributable to such Failed Securities not more than 30 days after the date
on which the trustee would have been required to purchase a Replacement         
Security.  In addition, unitholders should be aware that, at the time of receipt
of such cash, they may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in other securities
at a return equal to or in excess of the return which such proceeds would have  
earned for unitholders of such trust.                                           

  In the event that a Replacement Security is not acquired by a trust, the
income for such trust may be reduced.

   To the best of the sponsor's knowledge, there is no litigation pending as
of the trust's inception in respect of any security that might reasonably be    
expected to have a material adverse effect on the trust.  At any time after the 
trust's inception, litigation may be instituted on a variety of grounds with    
respect to the securities.  The sponsor is unable to predict whether any such   
litigation may be instituted, or if instituted, whether such litigation might   
have a material adverse effect on the trust.  The sponsor and the trustee shall 
not be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any security.    

RISK FACTORS                                                                    

     MARKET RISK. Because the trust invests in stocks, you should understand the
risks of investing in stocks before purchasing units. These risks include the   
risk that the financial condition of the company or the general condition of the
stock market may worsen and the value of the stocks (and therefore units) will  
fall. Stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements. The  
value of stocks often rises or falls rapidly and unpredictably as market        
confidence and perceptions of companies change. These perceptions are based on  
factors including expectations regarding government economic policies,          
inflation, interest rates, economic expansion or contraction, political climates
and economic or banking crises. The value of units will fluctuate with the value
of the stocks in the trust and may be more or less than the price you originally
paid for your units. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that the       
performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time. Because the  
trust is unmanaged, the Trustee will not sell stocks in response to market      
fluctuations as is common in managed investments. In addition, because some     
trusts hold a relatively small number of stocks, you may encounter greater      
market risk than in a more diversified investment.                              

  DIVIDENDS. Stocks represent ownership interests in a company and are not
obligations of the company. Common stockholders have a right to receive payments
from the company that is subordinate to the rights of creditors, bondholders or 
preferred stockholders of the company. This means that common stockholders have 
a right to receive dividends only if a company's board of directors declares a  
dividend and the company has provided for payment of all of its creditors,      
bondholders and preferred stockholders. If a company issues additional debt     
securities or preferred stock, the owners of these securities will have a claim 
against the company's assets before common stockholders if the company declares 
bankruptcy or liquidates its assets even though the common stock was issued     
first. As a result, the company may be less willing or able to declare or pay   
dividends on its common stock.                                                  

     FOREIGN ISSUERS. Because a trust may invest in foreign stocks, they involve
additional risks that differ from an investment in domestic stocks. Investments 
in foreign securities may involve a greater degree of risk than those in        
domestic securities. There is generally less publicly available information     
about foreign companies in the form of reports and ratings similar to those that
are published about issuers in the United States. Also, foreign issuers are     
generally not subject to uniform accounting, auditing and financial reporting   
requirements comparable to those applicable to United States issuers. With      
respect to certain foreign countries, there is the possibility of adverse       
changes in investment or exchange control regulations, expropriation,           
nationalization or confiscatory taxation, limitations on the removal of funds or
other assets of the trust, political or social instability, or diplomatic       
developments which could affect United States                                   

 -5-

P-->48732nd�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
investments in those countries. Moreover, industrial foreign economies may      
differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States' economy in terms of     
growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, capital reinvestment,      
resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments position. Foreign securities  
markets are generally not as developed or efficient as those in the United      
States. While growing in volume, they usually have substantially less volume    
than the New York Stock Exchange, and securities of some foreign issuers are    
less liquid and more volatile than securities of comparable United States       
issuers. Fixed commissions on foreign exchanges are generally higher than       
negotiated commissions on United States exchanges. There is generally less      
government supervision and regulation of securities exchanges, brokers and      
listed issuers than in the United States.                                       

A trust may also involve the risk that fluctuations in exchange rates 
between the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies may negatively affect the value  
of the stocks. For example, if a foreign stock rose 10% in price but the U.S.   
dollar gained 5% against the related foreign currency, a U.S. investor's return 
would be reduced to about 5%. This is because the foreign currency would "buy"  
fewer dollars or, conversely, a dollar would buy more of the foreign currency.  
Many foreign currencies have fluctuated widely against the U.S. dollar for a    
variety of reasons such as supply and demand of the currency, investor          
perceptions of world or country economies, political instability, currency      
speculation by institutional investors, changes in government policies, buying  
and selling of currencies by central banks of countries, trade balances and     
changes in interest rates. A trust's foreign currency transactions will be      
conducted with foreign exchange dealers acting as principals on a spot (i.e.,   
cash) buying basis. These dealers realize a profit based on the difference      
between the price at which they buy the currency (bid price) and the price at   
which they sell the currency (offer price). The evaluator will estimate the     
currency exchange rates based on current activity in the related currency       
exchange markets, however, due to the volatility of the markets and other       
factors, the estimated rates may not be indicative of the rate a trust might    
obtain had the trustee sold the currency in the market at that time.            

    SMALL-CAP AND MID-CAP COMPANIES. While historically smaller company stocks
have outperformed the stocks of large companies, the former have customarily    
involved more investment risk as well. Small-cap and mid-cap companies may have 
limited product lines, markets or financial resources; may lack management depth
or experience; and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic 
developments than large companies. Some of these companies may distribute, sell 
or produce products which have recently been brought to market and may be       
dependent on key personnel.                                                     

    The prices of small or mid-size company securities are often more volatile
than prices associated with large company issues, and can display abrupt or     
erratic movements at times, due to limited trading volumes and less publicly    
available information. Also, because small-cap and mid-cap companies normally   
have fewer shares outstanding and these shares trade less frequently than large 
companies, it may be more difficult for a trust which contains these securities 
to buy and sell significant amounts of such shares without an unfavorable impact
on prevailing market prices.

P-->48733rd�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
BASIC MATERIALS. An investment in units should be made with an        
understanding of the problems and risks an investment in securities of companies
involved in the basic materials industry may entail. Companies in the basic     
materials sector are engaged in the manufacture, mining, processing, or         
distribution of raw materials and intermediate goods used in the industrial     
sector. These may include materials and products such as chemicals, commodities,
forestry products, paper products, copper, iron ore, nickel, steel, aluminum,   
precious metals, textiles, cement, and gypsum. Basic materials companies may be 
affected by the volatility of commodity prices, exchange rates, import controls,
worldwide competition, depletion of resources, and mandated expenditures for    
safety and pollution control devices. In addition, they may be adversely        
affected by technical progress, labor relations, and governmental regulation.   
These companies are also at risk for environmental damage and product liability 
claims. Production of industrial materials often exceeds demand as a result of  
over-building or economic downturns, which may lead to poor investment returns. 

    CONSUMER PRODUCT AND RETAIL ISSUERS. The trust may invest significantly in
issuers that manufacture or sell consumer products. The profitability of these  
companies will be affected by various factors including the general state of the
economy and consumer spending trends. In the past, there have been major changes
in the retail environment due to the declaration of bankruptcy by some of the   
major corporations involved in the retail industry, particularly the department 
store segment. The continued viability of the retail industry will depend on the
industry's ability to adapt and to compete in changing economic and social      
conditions, to attract and retain capable management, and to finance expansion. 
Weakness in the banking or real estate industry, a recessionary economic climate
with the consequent slowdown in employment growth, less favorable trends in     
unemployment or a marked deceleration in real disposable personal income growth 
could result in significant pressure on both consumer wealth and consumer       
confidence, adversely affecting consumer spending habits. In addition,          
competitiveness of the retail industry will require large capital outlays for   
investment in the installation of automated checkout equipment to control       
inventory, to track the sale of individual items and to gauge the success of    
sales campaigns. Increasing employee and retiree benefit costs may also have an 
adverse effect on the industry. In many sectors of the retail industry,         
competition may be fierce due to market saturation, converging consumer tastes  
and other factors. Because of these factors and the recent increase in trade    
opportunities with other countries, various retailers are now entering global   
markets which entail added risks such as sudden weakening of foreign economies, 
difficulty in adapting to local conditions and constraints and added research   
costs.                                                                          

  FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY. Your trust may concentrate in securities of
issuers in the financial services industry.                                     

 Banks and their holding companies are especially subject to the adverse
effects of economic recession; volatile interest rates; portfolio concentrations
in geographic markets and in commercial and residential real estate loans; and  
competition from new entrants in their fields of business.  In addition, banks  
and their holding companies are extensively regulated at both the federal and   
state level and may be adversely affected by increased regulations.  Banks will 
face increased competition from nontraditional lending sources as regulatory    
changes, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley financial services overhaul legislation,
permit new entrants to offer various                                            

 -7-

P-->48734th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
financial products.  Technological advances such as the Internet allow these    
nontraditional lending sources to cut overhead and permit the more efficient use
of customer data.  Banks are already facing tremendous pressure from mutual     
funds, brokerage firms and other financial service providers in the competition 
to furnish services that were traditionally offered by banks.                   

     Companies engaged in investment management and broker-dealer activities are
subject to volatility in their earnings and share prices that often exceeds the 
volatility of the equity market in general.  Adverse changes in the direction of
the stock market, investor confidence, equity transaction volume, the level and 
direction of interest rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely 
affect the financial stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies.
Additionally, competitive pressures, including increased competition with new   
and existing competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses 
and the need for increased capital expenditures on new technology could         
adversely impact the profit margins of companies in the investment management   
and brokerage industries.  Companies involved in investment management and      
broker-dealer activities are also subject to extensive regulation by government 
agencies and self-regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or 
rules, or in the interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could       
adversely affect the stock prices of such companies.                            

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management  
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance.  Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management      
company profits, including interest rate movements, the imposition of premium   
rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in given underwritings,      
competition and pressure to compete globally, weather catastrophes or other     
disasters and the effects of client mergers.  Already extensively regulated,    
insurance companies' profits may be adversely affected by increased government  
regulations or tax law changes.                                                 

 Financial services companies have faced significant difficulty recently
related to the recent downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets,     
corresponding declines in the value of mortgage-backed securities and the       
resulting impact on all areas of the financial services industry and the broader
economy.  These difficulties have given rise to considerable uncertainty        
regarding the global economy and financial services companies, in particular.   
The downturn has also led to considerable write-downs in the values of many     
assets held by financial services companies and a tightening of credit markets  
that has been marked by a general unwillingness of many entities to extend      
credit.  These factors have caused a significant need for many financial        
services companies to raise capital to meet obligations and to satisfy          
regulatory and contractual capital requirements.  Many well-established         
financial services companies have been forced to seek additional capital through
issuances of new preferred or common equity and certain companies have been     
forced to agree to be acquired by other companies (or sell some or all of their 
assets to other companies).  In some cases government assistance, guarantees or 
direct participation in investments or acquisitions have been necessary to      
facilitate these transactions.    In addition, concerns regarding these issues  
and their potential negative impact to the U.S. and global economies have       
resulted in extreme volatility in securities prices and uncertain market        
conditions.

P-->48735th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
   In response to these issues, government authorities in the U.S. and other
countries have initiated and may continue to engage in administrative and       
legislative action intended to address both short- and long-term difficulties   
facing the housing and mortgage lending markets, mortgage backed securities, the
financial services industry and the broader economy.  These government actions  
may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on investment activities;     
increased oversight, regulation and involvement in financial services company   
practices; adjustments to capital requirements; the acquisition of interests in 
and the extension of credit to private entities; and increased investigation    
efforts into the actions of companies and individuals in the financial service  
industry.  No one can predict any action that might be taken or the effect any  
action or inaction will have.  It is possible that any actions taken by         
government authorities will not address or help improve the state of these      
difficulties as intended.  No one can predict the impact that the recent        
difficulties will have on the economy, generally or financial services          
companies.  The recent difficulties and corresponding government action or      
inaction may have far reaching consequences and your investment may be adversely
affected by such developments.                                                  

Banks and their holding companies are subject to extensive federal    
regulation and, when such institutions are state-chartered, to state regulation 
as well. Such regulations impose strict capital requirements and limitations on 
the nature and extent of business activities that banks may pursue. Furthermore,
bank regulators have a wide range of discretion in connection with their        
supervisory and enforcement authority and may substantially restrict the        
permissible activities of a particular institution if deemed to pose significant
risks to the soundness of such institution or the safety of the federal deposit 
insurance fund. Regulatory actions, such as increases in the minimum capital    
requirements applicable to banks and increases in deposit insurance premiums    
required to be paid by banks and thrifts to the Federal Deposit Insurance       
Corporation ("FDIC"), can negatively impact earnings and the ability of a       
company to pay dividends. Neither federal insurance of deposits nor governmental
regulations, however, insures the solvency or profitability of banks or their   
holding companies, or insures against any risk of investment in the securities  
issued by such institutions.                                                    

  The statutory requirements applicable to, and regulatory supervision of,
banks and their holding companies have increased significantly and have         
undergone substantial change in the past. To a great extent, these changes are  
embodied in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act,    
enacted in August 1989; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement   
Act of 1991, and the regulations promulgated under these laws. The impact of    
these laws on the business, financial condition and prospects of the Securities 
in the Trust's portfolio cannot be predicted with certainty. The Gramm-Leach-   
Bliley financial services overhaul legislation allows banks, securities firms   
and insurance companies to form one-stop financial conglomerates marketing a    
wide range of financial service products to investors. This legislation will    
likely result in increased merger activity and heightened competition among     
existing and new participants in the field. Legislation to liberalize interstate
banking has also been enacted. Under the legislation, banks are able to purchase
or establish subsidiary banks in any state. Since mid-1997, banks have been     
allowed to turn existing banks into branches. Consolidation may continue. The   
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Financial Accounting Standards Board 
require the expanded use of market value accounting by banks and have imposed   
rules requiring market accounting for investment securities held in trading     

 -9-

P-->48736th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
accounts or available for sale. Adoption of additional such rules may result in 
increased volatility in the reported health of the industry, and mandated       
regulatory intervention to correct such problems. Additional legislative and    
regulatory changes may be forthcoming. For example, the bank regulatory         
authorities have proposed substantial changes to the Community Reinvestment Act 
and fair lending laws, rules and regulations, and there can be no certainty as  
to the effect, if any, that such changes would have on the Securities in the    
Trust's portfolio. In addition, from time to time the deposit insurance system  
is reviewed by Congress and federal regulators, and proposed reforms of that    
system could, among other things, further restrict the ways in which deposited  
moneys can be used by banks or reduce the dollar amount or number of deposits   
insured for any depositor. Such reforms could reduce profitability, as          
investment opportunities available to bank institutions become more limited and 
as consumers look for savings vehicles other than bank deposits. Banks face     
significant competition from other financial institutions such as mutual funds, 
credit unions, mortgage banking companies and insurance companies, and increased
competition may result from legislative broadening of regional and national     
interstate banking powers. Among other benefits, such legislation allows banks  
and bank holding companies to acquire across previously prohibited state lines  
and to consolidate their various bank subsidiaries into one unit. Neither the   
Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to what, if any, manner of  
bank regulatory actions might ultimately be adopted or what ultimate effect such
actions might have on the Trust's portfolio.                                    

 The Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 generally prohibits a bank
holding company from (1) acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of the 
outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding  
company, (2) acquiring control of a bank or another bank holding company, (3)   
acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, or (4) merging or      
consolidating with another bank holding company, without first obtaining Federal
Reserve Board ("FRB") approval. In considering an application with respect to   
any such transaction, the FRB is required to consider a variety of factors,     
including the potential anti-competitive effects of the transaction, the        
financial condition and future prospects of the combining and resulting         
institutions, the managerial resources of the resulting institution, the        
convenience and needs of the communities the combined organization would serve, 
the record of performance of each combining organization under the Community    
Reinvestment Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the prospective      
availability to the FRB of information appropriate to determine ongoing         
regulatory compliance with applicable banking laws. In addition, the federal    
Change In Bank Control Act and various state laws impose limitations on the     
ability of one or more individuals or other entities to acquire control of banks
or bank holding companies.                                                      

   The FRB has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by
bank holding companies. In the policy statement, the FRB expressed its view that
a bank holding company experiencing earnings weaknesses should not pay cash     
dividends which exceed its net income or which could only be funded in ways that
would weaken its financial health, such as by borrowing. The FRB also may impose
limitations on the payment of dividends as a condition to its approval of       
certain applications, including applications for approval of mergers and        
acquisitions. Neither the Sponsor nor the Underwriter makes any prediction as to
the effect, if any, such laws will have on the Securities or whether such       
approvals, if necessary, will be obtained.

 Companies engaged in investment management and brokerage activities are
subject to the adverse effects of economic recession, volatile interest rates,  
and competition from new entrants in their fields of business. Adverse changes  
in the direction of the stock market, investor confidence, the financial health 
of customers, equity transaction volume, the level and direction of interest    
rates and the outlook of emerging markets could adversely affect the financial  
stability, as well as the stock prices, of these companies. Additionally,       
competitive pressures, including increased competition from new and existing    
competitors, the ongoing commoditization of traditional businesses and the need 
for increased capital expenditures on new technology could adversely impact the 
profit margins of companies in the investment management and brokerage          
industries. Companies involved in investment management and brokerage activities
are also subject to extensive regulation by government agencies and self-       
regulatory organizations, and changes in laws, regulations or rules, or in the  
interpretation of such laws, regulations and rules could adversely affect the   
stock prices of such companies.                                                 

Companies involved in the insurance, reinsurance and risk management  
industry underwrite, sell or distribute property, casualty and business         
insurance. Many factors affect insurance, reinsurance and risk management       
company profits, including but not limited to interest rate movements, the      
imposition of premium rate caps, a misapprehension of the risks involved in     
given underwritings, competition and pressure to compete globally, weather      
catastrophes or other natural or man-made disasters and the effects of client   
mergers. Individual companies may be exposed to material risks including reserve
inadequacy and the inability to collect from reinsurance carriers. Insurance    
companies are subject to extensive governmental regulation, including the       
imposition of maximum rate levels, which may not be adequate for some lines of  
business. Proposed or potential tax law changes may also adversely affect       
insurance companies' policy sales, tax obligations and profitability. In        
addition to the foregoing, profit margins of these companies continue to shrink 
due to the commoditization of traditional businesses, new competitors, capital  
expenditures on new technology and the pressure to compete globally.            

In addition to the normal risks of business, companies involved in the
insurance and risk management industry are subject to significant risk factors, 
including those applicable to regulated insurance companies, such as:           

  *  the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property-
    liability loss reserves, and the fact that ultimate losses could
   materially exceed established loss reserves, which could have a
  material adverse effect on results of operations and financial
condition;                                                  

*  the fact that insurance companies have experienced, and can be 
          expected in the future to experience, catastrophic losses, which could
         have a material adverse impact on their financial conditions, results
of operations and cash flow;                                

  *  the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property-
          liability loss reserves due to changes in loss payment patterns caused
by new claim settlement practices;                          

-11-

P-->48738th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
    *  the need for insurance companies and their subsidiaries to maintain
        appropriate levels of statutory capital and surplus, particularly in
  light of continuing scrutiny by rating organizations and state
         insurance regulatory authorities, and in order to maintain acceptable
financial strength or claims-paying ability ratings;        

      *  the extensive regulation and supervision to which insurance companies
are subject, and various regulatory and other legal actions;

      *  the adverse impact that increases in interest rates could have on the
   value of an insurance company's investment portfolio and on the
attractiveness of certain of its products; and              

       *  the uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance
and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables.         

 The state insurance regulatory framework has, during recent years, come
under increased federal scrutiny, and certain state legislatures have considered
or enacted laws that alter and, in many cases, increase state authority to      
regulate insurance companies and insurance holding company systems. Further, the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") and state insurance    
regulators are re-examining existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing
on insurance companies, interpretations of existing laws and the development of 
new laws. In addition, Congress and certain federal agencies have investigated  
the condition of the insurance industry in the United States to determine       
whether to promulgate additional federal regulation. The Sponsor is unable to   
predict whether any state or federal legislation will be enacted to change the  
nature or scope of regulation of the insurance industry, or what effect, if any,
such legislation would have on the industry.                                    

All insurance companies are subject to state laws and regulations that
require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of  
investments in certain investment categories. Failure to comply with these laws 
and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be treated as non-    
admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some        
instances, would require divestiture.                                           

    The value of securities issued by financial services companies may also be
affected by the recent downturn in the housing and mortgage lending markets,    
corresponding declines in the value of mortgage backed securities and the       
resulting impact on all areas of the financial services industry.  In response, 
government authorities have initiated and may continue to engage in             
administrative and legislative action intended to address both short- and long- 
term difficulties facing the housing and mortgage lending markets, mortgage     
backed securities, the financial services industry and the broader economy.     
These government actions may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on   
investment options, increased oversight, regulation and involvement in financial
services company practices, adjustments to capital requirements, the acquisition
of interests in and the extension of credit to private entities and increased   
investigation efforts into the actions of companies and individuals in the      
financial service industry.  No one can predict the action that might be taken  
or the effect any action or inaction will have and it is possible that any      
actions taken by government authorities will not address or help improve the    
state of these                                                                  

-12-

difficulties as intended.  The recent downturn and corresponding government     
action may have far reaching consequences into many geographic regions and areas
of financial services companies and, consequently, the value of securities in   
the portfolio may decline in response to such developments.                     

INDUSTRIALS ISSUERS. The trust may invest significantly in industrials
companies. General risks of industrials companies include the general state of  
the economy, intense competition, consolidation, domestic and international     
politics, excess capacity and consumer spending trends. In addition, capital    
goods companies may also be significantly affected by overall capital spending  
levels, economic cycles, technical obsolescence, delays in modernization,       
limitations on supply of key materials, labor relations, government regulations,
government contracts and ecommerce initiatives. Furthermore, certain companies  
involved in the industry have also faced scrutiny for alleged accounting        
irregularities that may have led to the overstatement of their financial        
results, and other companies in the industry may face similar scrutiny.         

Industrials companies may also be affected by factors more specific to
their individual industries. Industrial machinery manufacturers may be subject  
to declines in commercial and consumer demand and the need for modernization.   
Aerospace and defense companies may be influenced by decreased demand for new   
equipment, aircraft order cancellations, disputes over or ability to obtain or  
retain government contracts, or changes in government budget priorities, changes
in aircraft-leasing contracts and cutbacks in profitable business travel. The   
number of housing starts, levels of public and non-residential construction     
including weakening demand for new office and retail space, and overall         
construction spending may adversely affect construction equipment manufacturers.

    REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS.  Many factors can have an adverse impact on
the performance of a particular real estate investment trust ("REIT"), including
its cash available for distribution, the credit quality of a particular REIT or 
the real estate industry generally.  The success of REITs depends on various    
factors, including the occupancy and rent levels, appreciation of the underlying
property and the ability to raise rents on those properties. Economic recession,
overbuilding, tax law changes, higher interest rates or excessive speculation   
can all negatively impact REITs, their future earnings and share prices.        

  Risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate include, among
other factors,                                                                  

*  general U.S. and global as well as local economic conditions,            

*  decline in real estate values,                                           

*  the financial health of tenants,                                         

*  overbuilding and increased competition for tenants,                      

*  oversupply of properties for sale,                                       

*  changing demographics,                                                   

-13-

P-->48740th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
*  changes in interest rates, tax rates and other operating expenses,       

*  changes in government regulations,                                       

*  changes in zoning laws,                                                  

*  the ability of the owner to provide adequate management, maintenance and 
insurance,                                                            

*  faulty construction and the ongoing need for capital improvements,       

*  the cost of complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act,          

*  regulatory and judicial requirements, including relating to liability for
environmental hazards,                                                

*  natural or man-made disasters,                                           

  *  changes in the perception of prospective tenants of the safety, convenience
 and attractiveness of the properties changes in neighborhood values and
buyer demand, and                                                     

*  the unavailability of construction financing or mortgage loans at rates  
acceptable to developers.                                             

 Variations in rental income and space availability and vacancy rates in
terms of supply and demand are additional factors affecting real estate         
generally and REITs in particular. Properties owned by a REIT may not be        
adequately insured against certain losses and may be subject to significant     
environmental liabilities, including remediation costs.                         

   The value of real estate investments may also be affected by the downturn
in the subprime mortgage lending market in the United States.  Subprime loans   
have higher defaults and losses than prime loans.  Subprime loans also have     
higher serious delinquency rates than prime loans.  The downturn in the subprime
mortgage lending market may have far-reaching consequences into many aspects and
geographic regions of the real estate business, and consequently, the value of  
the portfolio may decline in response to such developments.                     

    You should also be aware that REITs may not be diversified and are subject
to the risks of financing projects. The real estate industry may be cyclical,   
and, if the Trust acquires REIT Securities at or near the top of the cycle,     
there is increased risk of a decline in value of the REIT Securities and        
therefore the value of the Units. REITs are also subject to defaults by         
borrowers and the market's perception of the REIT industry generally.           

    Because of their structure, and the legal requirement that they distribute
at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually, REITs require    
frequent amounts of new funding, through both borrowing money and issuing stock.
Thus, REITs historically have frequently issued substantial amounts of new      
equity shares (or equivalents) to purchase or build new properties. This may    
have adversely affected REIT equity share market prices. Both existing and      

-14-

P-->48741st�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
new share issuances may have an adverse effect on these prices in the future,   
especially when REITs continue to issue stock when real estate prices are       
relatively high and stock prices are relatively low.                            

The value of REITs may also be affected by the recent downturn in the 
housing and mortgage lending markets.  In response, government authorities have 
initiated and may continue to engage in administrative and legislative action   
intended to address both short- and long-term difficulties facing the housing   
and mortgage lending markets and the broader economy.  No one can predict the   
action that might be taken or the effect any action or inaction will have and it
is possible that any actions taken by government authorities will not address or
help improve the state of these difficulties as intended.  The recent downturn  
and corresponding government action may have far reaching consequences into many
geographic regions and, consequently, the value of securities in the portfolio  
may decline in response to such developments.                                   

ADDITIONAL DEPOSITS.  The trust agreement authorizes the sponsor to   
increase the size of a trust and the number of units thereof by the deposit of  
additional securities, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent) 
with instructions to purchase additional securities, in such trust and the      
issuance of a corresponding number of additional units.  In connection with     
these deposits, existing and new investors may experience a dilution of their   
investments and a reduction in their anticipated income because of fluctuations 
in the prices of the securities between the time of the deposit and the purchase
of the securities and because a trust will pay the associated brokerage fees and
other acquisition costs.                                                        

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST                                                     

  DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS.  Income received by a trust is credited by
the trustee to the Income Account for the trust.  All other receipts are        
credited by the trustee to a separate Capital Account for the trust.  The       
trustee will normally distribute any income received by a trust on each         
distribution date or shortly thereafter to unitholders of record on the         
preceding record date. The trust will also generally make required distributions
or distributions to avoid imposition of tax at the end of each year if it has   
elected to be taxed as a "regulated investment company" for federal tax         
purposes.  Unitholders will receive an amount substantially equal to their pro  
rata share of the estimated net annual income distributions to be received by   
the trust.  All distributions will be net of applicable expenses.  There is no  
assurance that any actual distributions will be made since all dividends        
received may be used to pay expenses.  In addition, excess amounts from the     
Capital Account of a trust, if any, will be distributed at least annually to the
unitholders then of record.  Proceeds received from the disposition of any of   
the securities after a record date and prior to the following distribution date 
will be held in the Capital Account and not distributed until the next          
distribution date applicable to the Capital Account.  The trustee shall be      
required to make a distribution from the Capital Account if the cash balance on 
deposit therein available for distribution shall be sufficient to distribute at 
least $0.01 per unit.  The trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held
in the Capital or Income Accounts (but may itself earn interest thereon and     
therefore benefits from the use of such funds).                                 

    The distribution to the unitholders as of each record date will be made on
the following distribution date or shortly thereafter and shall consist of an   
amount substantially equal to such                                              

-15-

P-->48742nd�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
portion of the unitholders' pro rata share of the estimated annual income       
distributions to be received by the trust after deducting estimated expenses.   
Because dividends are not received by a trust at a constant rate throughout the 
year, such distributions to unitholders are expected to fluctuate.  Persons who 
purchase units will commence receiving distributions only after such person     
becomes a record owner.  A person will become the owner of units, and thereby a 
unitholder of record, on the date of settlement provided payment has been       
received.  Notification to the trustee of the transfer of units is the          
responsibility of the purchaser, but in the normal course of business the       
selling broker-dealer provides such notice.                                     

 The trustee will periodically deduct from the Income Account of a trust
and, to the extent funds are not sufficient therein, from the Capital Account of
a trust amounts necessary to pay the expenses of the trust.  The trustee also   
may withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary to  
establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of a trust.        
Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of a trust's assets until   
such time as the trustee shall return all or any part of such amounts to the    
appropriate accounts.  In addition, the trustee may withdraw from the Income and
Capital Accounts of a trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover           
redemptions of units.                                                           

 DISTRIBUTION REINVESTMENT.  Unitholders may reinvest distributions into
additional units of their trust without a sales fee.  Your trust will pay any   
deferred sales fee and creation and development fee per unit regardless of any  
sales fee discounts.  However, if you are eligible to receive a discount such   
that the sales fee you must pay is less than the applicable deferred sales fee  
and creation and development fee, you will be credited the difference between   
your sales fee and the deferred sales fee and the creation and development fee  
at the time you buy your units.  Accordingly, if you reinvest distributions into
additional units of your trust, you will be credited the amount of any remaining
deferred sales fee and creation and development fee on such units at the time of
reinvestment.                                                                   

STATEMENTS TO UNITHOLDERS.  With each distribution, the trustee will  
furnish to each unitholder a statement of the amount of income and the amount of
other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed in each case as a
dollar amount per unit.                                                         

     The accounts of a trust are required to be audited annually, at the related
trust's expense, by independent public accountants designated by the sponsor,   
unless the sponsor determines that such an audit would not be in the best       
interest of the unitholders of the trust.  The accountants' report will be      
furnished by the trustee to any unitholder upon written request.  Within a      
reasonable period of time after the end of each calendar year, the trustee shall
furnish to each person who at any time during the calendar year was a unitholder
of a trust a statement, covering the calendar year, setting forth for the trust:

(A)  As to the Income Account:                                        

          (1)  the amount of income received on the securities (including income
         received as a portion of the proceeds of any disposition of

       (5)  the amounts reserved for purchases of contract securities, for
              purchases made pursuant to replace failed contract securities or
         for purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust

  (6)  the deductions for payment of the depositor's expenses of
      maintaining the registration of the trust units, if any;

(7)  the aggregate distributions to unitholders; and

            liquidation or disposition of any of the securities, excluding
 any portion thereof credited to the Income Account;

       (2)  the amount paid for purchases of replacement securities or for
     purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust
agreement, if any, and for redemptions;

into the Reserve Account;                         

    (4)  the deductions for payment of applicable taxes and fees and
        expenses of the trustee, the depositor, the evaluator, the
              supervisor, counsel, auditors and any other expenses paid by the
trust;                                            

  (5)  the deductions for payment of the depositor's expenses of
organizing the trust;

       (6)  the amounts reserved for purchases of contract securities, for
              purchases made pursuant to replace failed contract securities or
         for purchases of securities otherwise pursuant to the trust
agreement, if any;                                

          (7)  the deductions for payment of deferred sales fee and creation and
development fee, if any;

       (10) the balance remaining after such distributions and deductions,
            expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar amount
            per unit outstanding on the last business day of such calendar
year; and                                         

(C)  the following information:                                       

          (1)  a list of the securities held as of the last business day of such
              calendar year and a list which identifies all securities sold or
          other securities acquired during such calendar year, if any;

         (2)  the number of units outstanding on the last business day of such
calendar year;                                    

        (3)  the unit value based on the last trust evaluation of such trust
made during such calendar year; and               

        (4)  the amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from

  RIGHTS OF UNITHOLDERS.  A unitholder may at any time tender units to the
trustee for redemption.  The death or incapacity of any unitholder will not     
operate to terminate a trust nor entitle legal representatives or heirs to claim
an accounting or to bring any action or proceeding in any court for partition or
winding up of a trust.  No unitholder shall have the right to control the       
operation and management of a trust in any manner, except to vote with respect  
to the amendment of the trust agreement or termination of a trust.              

     AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION.  The trust agreement may be amended from time to
time by the sponsor and trustee or their respective successors, without the     
consent of any of the unitholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or   
supplement any provision which may be defective or inconsistent with any other  
provision contained in the trust agreement, (ii) to make such other provision in
regard to matters or questions arising under the trust agreement as shall not   
materially adversely affect the interests of the unitholders or (iii) to make   
such amendments

as may be necessary (a) for the trust to continue to qualify as a regulated     
investment company for federal income tax purposes if the trust has elected to  
be taxed as such under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as      
amended, or (b) to prevent the trust from being deemed an association taxable as
a corporation for federal income tax purposes if the trust has not elected to be
taxed as a regulated investment company under the United States Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended.  The trust agreement may not be amended, however,     
without the consent of all unitholders then outstanding, so as (1) to permit,   
except in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof, the acquisition     
hereunder of any securities other than those specified in the schedules to the  
trust agreement or (2) to reduce the percentage of units the holders of which   
are required to consent to certain of such amendments.  The trust agreement may 
not be amended so as to reduce the interest in a trust represented by units     
without the consent of all affected unitholders.  Except for the amendments,    
changes or modifications described above, neither the sponsor nor the trustee   
may consent to any other amendment, change or modification of the trust         
agreement without the giving of notice and the obtaining of the approval or     
consent of unitholders representing at least 66 2/3% of the units then          
outstanding of the affected trust.  No amendment may reduce the aggregate       
percentage of units the holders of which are required to consent to any         
amendment, change or modification of the trust agreement without the consent of 
the unitholders of all of the units then outstanding of the affected trust and  
in no event may any amendment be made which would (1) alter the rights to the   
unitholders as against each other, (2) provide the trustee with the power to    
engage in business or investment activities other than as specifically provided 
in the trust agreement, (3) adversely affect the tax status of the trust for    
federal income tax purposes or result in the units being deemed to be sold or   
exchanged for federal income tax purposes or (4) unless the trust has elected to
be taxed as a regulated investment company for federal income tax purposes,     
result in a variation of the investment of unitholders in the trust.  The       
trustee will notify unitholders of the substance of any such amendment.         

The trust agreement provides that a trust shall terminate upon the    
liquidation, redemption or other disposition of the last of the securities held 
in the trust but in no event is it to continue beyond the mandatory termination 
date.  If the value of a trust shall be less than the applicable minimum value  
stated in the prospectus (generally 40% of the total value of securities        
deposited in the trust during the initial offering period), the trustee may, in 
its discretion, and shall, when so directed by the sponsor, terminate the trust.
A trust may be terminated at any time by the holders of units representing 66   
2/3% of the units thereof then outstanding.  In addition, the sponsor may       
terminate a trust if it is based on a security index and the index is no longer 
maintained.  A trust will be liquidated by the trustee in the event that a      
sufficient number of units of the trust not yet sold are tendered for redemption
by the sponsor, so that the net worth of the trust would be reduced to less than
40% of the value of the securities at the time they were deposited in the trust.
If a trust is liquidated because of the redemption of unsold units by the       
sponsor, the sponsor will refund to each purchaser of units the entire sales fee
paid by such purchaser.                                                         

 Beginning nine business days prior to, but no later than, the scheduled
termination date described in the prospectus, the trustee may begin to sell all 
of the remaining underlying securities on behalf of unitholders in connection   
with the termination of the trust.  The sponsor                                 

-19-

may assist the trustee in these sales and receive compensation to the extent    
permitted by applicable law.  The sale proceeds will be net of any incidental   
expenses involved in the sales.                                                 

   The sponsor will generally instruct the trustee to sell the securities as
quickly as practicable during the termination proceedings without in its        
judgment materially adversely affecting the market price of the securities, but 
it is expected that all of the securities will in any event be disposed of      
within a reasonable time after a trust's termination.  The sponsor does not     
anticipate that the period will be longer than one month, and it could be as    
short as one day, depending on the liquidity of the securities being sold.  The 
liquidity of any security depends on the daily trading volume of the security   
and the amount that the sponsor has available for sale on any particular day.   
Of course, no assurances can be given that the market value of the securities   
will not be adversely affected during the termination proceedings.              

     Approximately thirty days prior to termination of a trust, the trustee will
notify unitholders of the termination and provide a form allowing qualifying    
unitholders to elect an in-kind distribution.  A unitholder who owns the minimum
number of units described in the prospectus may request an in-kind distribution 
from the trustee instead of cash.  The trustee will make an in-kind distribution
through the distribution of each of the securities of the trust in book entry   
form to the account of the unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository     
Trust Company.  The unitholder will be entitled to receive whole shares of each 
of the securities comprising the portfolio of a trust and cash from the Capital 
Account equal to the fractional shares to which the unitholder is entitled.  The
trustee may adjust the number of shares of any security included in a           
unitholder's in-kind distribution to facilitate the distribution of whole       
shares.  The sponsor may terminate the in-kind distribution option at any time  
upon notice to the unitholders.  Special federal income tax consequences will   
result if a unitholder requests an in-kind distribution.                        

 Within a reasonable period after termination, the trustee will sell any
securities remaining in a trust and, after paying all expenses and charges      
incurred by the trust, will distribute to unitholders thereof (upon surrender   
for cancellation of certificates for units, if issued) their pro rata share of  
the balances remaining in the Income and Capital Accounts of the trust.         

The sponsor may, but is not obligated to, offer for sale units of a   
subsequent series of a trust at approximately the time of the mandatory         
termination date.  If the sponsor does offer such units for sale, unitholders   
may be given the opportunity to purchase such units at a public offering price  
that includes a reduced sales fee.  There is, however, no assurance that units  
of any new series of a trust will be offered for sale at that time, or if       
offered, that there will be sufficient units available for sale to meet the     
requests of any or all unitholders.                                             

   THE TRUSTEE.  The trustee is The Bank of New York Mellon, a trust company
organized under the laws of New York. The Bank of New York Mellon has its       
principal unit investment trust division offices at 2 Hanson Place, 12th Floor, 
Brooklyn, New York 11217, (800) 848-6468. The Bank of New York Mellon is subject
to supervision and examination by the Superintendent of Banks of the State of   
New York and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and its      
deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent 
permitted by law.

   The trustee, whose duties are ministerial in nature, has not participated
in selecting the portfolio of any trust.  In accordance with the trust          
agreement, the trustee shall keep records of all transactions at its office.    
Such records shall include the name and address of, and the number of units held
by, every unitholder of a trust.  Such books and records shall be open to       
inspection by any unitholder at all reasonable times during usual business      
hours.  The trustee shall make such annual or other reports as may from time to 
time be required under any applicable state or federal statute, rule or         
regulation.  The trustee shall keep a certified copy or duplicate original of   
the trust agreement on file in its office available for inspection at all       
reasonable times during usual business hours by any unitholder, together with a 
current list of the securities held in each trust.  Pursuant to the trust       
agreement, the trustee may employ one or more agents for the purpose of custody 
and safeguarding of securities comprising a trust.                              

    Under the trust agreement, the trustee or any successor trustee may resign
and be discharged of a trust created by the trust agreement by executing an     
instrument in writing and filing the same with the sponsor.                     

The trustee or successor trustee must mail a copy of the notice of    
resignation to all unitholders then of record, not less than sixty days before  
the date specified in such notice when such resignation is to take effect.  The 
sponsor upon receiving notice of such resignation is obligated to appoint a     
successor trustee promptly.  If, upon such resignation, no successor trustee has
been appointed and has accepted the appointment within thirty days after        
notification, the retiring trustee may apply to a court of competent            
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor. In case at any time the trustee
shall not meet the requirements set forth in the trust agreement, or shall      
become incapable of acting, or if a court having jurisdiction in the premises   
shall enter a decree or order for relief in respect of the trustee in an        
involuntary case, or the trustee shall commence a voluntary case, under any     
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in      
effect, or any receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator 
(or similar official) for the trustee or for any substantial part of its        
property shall be appointed, or the trustee shall generally fail to pay its     
debts as they become due, or shall fail to meet such written standards for the  
trustee's performance as shall be established from time to time by the sponsor, 
or if the sponsor determines in good faith that there has occurred either (1) a 
material deterioration in the creditworthiness of the trustee or (2) one or more
grossly negligent acts on the part of the trustee with respect to a trust, the  
sponsor, upon sixty days' prior written notice, may remove the trustee and      
appoint a successor trustee, as hereinafter provided, by written instrument, in 
duplicate, one copy of which shall be delivered to the trustee so removed and   
one copy to the successor trustee.  Notice of such removal and appointment shall
be mailed to each unitholder by the sponsor.  Upon execution of a written       
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee, all the rights,       
powers, duties and obligations of the original trustee shall vest in the        
successor.  The trustee must be a corporation organized under the laws of the   
United States, or any state thereof, be authorized under such laws to exercise  
trust powers and have at all times an aggregate capital, surplus and undivided  
profits of not less than $5,000,000.                                            

   THE SPONSOR.  The sponsor of the trust is Advisors Asset Management, Inc.
acting through its unit investment trust division.  The sponsor is a broker-    
dealer specializing in providing services to broker-dealers, registered         
representatives, investment advisers and other financial professionals. The     
sponsor's headquarters are located at 18925 Base Camp Road,

8100 East 22nd Street North, Suite 900B, Wichita, Kansas 67226-2309 or by using 
the contacts listed on the back cover of the prospectus. The sponsor is a       
registered broker-dealer and investment adviser and a member of the Financial   
Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA) and the Securities Investor         
Protection Corporation (SIPC), and a registrant of the Municipal Securities     
Rulemaking Board (MSRB).                                                        

  If at any time the sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under
the trust agreement or shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged a  
bankrupt or insolvent or shall have its affairs taken over by public            
authorities, then the trustee may (a) appoint a successor sponsor at rates of   
compensation deemed by the trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding such      
reasonable amounts as may be prescribed by the Securities and Exchange          
Commission, (b) terminate the trust agreement and liquidate any trust as        
provided therein, or (c) continue to act as trustee without terminating the     
trust agreement.                                                                

THE EVALUATOR AND SUPERVISOR.  Advisors Asset Management, Inc., the   
sponsor, also serves as evaluator and supervisor.  The evaluator and supervisor 
may resign or be removed by the sponsor and trustee in which event the sponsor  
or trustee is to use its best efforts to appoint a satisfactory successor.  Such
resignation or removal shall become effective upon acceptance of appointment by 
the successor evaluator.  If upon resignation of the evaluator no successor has 
accepted appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the        
evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of 
a successor.  Notice of such resignation or removal and appointment shall be    
mailed by the trustee to each unitholder.                                       

LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY.  The sponsor, evaluator, and supervisor are 
liable for the performance of their obligations arising from their              
responsibilities under the trust agreement but will be under no liability to the
unitholders for taking any action or refraining from any action in good faith   
pursuant to the trust agreement or for errors in judgment, except in cases of   
its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its reckless       
disregard for its duties thereunder.  The sponsor shall not be liable or        
responsible in any way for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale  
of any securities.                                                              

   The trust agreement provides that the trustee shall be under no liability
for any action taken in good faith in reliance upon prima facie properly        
executed documents or for the disposition of moneys, securities or certificates 
except by reason of its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct,  
or its reckless disregard for its duties under the trust agreement, nor shall   
the trustee be liable or responsible in any way for depreciation or loss        
incurred by reason of the sale by the trustee of any securities.  In the event  
that the sponsor shall fail to act, the trustee may act and shall not be liable 
for any such action taken by it in good faith.  The trustee shall not be        
personally liable for any taxes or other governmental charges imposed upon or in
respect of the securities or upon the interest thereof.  In addition, the trust 
agreement contains other customary provisions limiting the liability of the     
trustee.                                                                        

 The trustee and unitholders may rely on any evaluation furnished by the
evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the accuracy thereof.  The trust 
agreement provides that the determinations made by the evaluator shall be made  
in good faith upon the basis of the best

information available to it, provided, however, that the evaluator shall be     
under no liability to the trustee or unitholders for errors in judgment, but    
shall be liable for its gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct or its
reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust agreement.               

  EXPENSES OF THE TRUST.  The sponsor will not charge a trust any fees for
services performed as sponsor.  The sponsor will receive a portion of the sale  
commissions paid in connection with the purchase of units and will share in     
profits, if any, related to the deposit of securities in the trust.             

   The sponsor may receive a fee from your trust for creating and developing
the trust, including determining the trust's objectives, policies, composition  
and size, selecting service providers and information services and for providing
other similar administrative and ministerial functions. The amount of this      
"creation and development fee" is set forth in the prospectus. The trustee will 
deduct this amount from your trust's assets as of the close of the initial      
offering period. No portion of this fee is applied to the payment of            
distribution expenses or as compensation for sales efforts. This fee will not be
deducted from proceeds received upon a repurchase, redemption or exchange of    
units before the close of the initial public offering period.                   

     The trustee receives for its services that fee set forth in the prospectus.
The trustee's fee which is calculated and paid monthly is based on the total    
number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual 
period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based on the  
units outstanding at the end of each month.  The trustee benefits to the extent 
there are funds for future distributions, payment of expenses and redemptions in
the Capital and Income Accounts since these Accounts are non-interest bearing   
and the amounts earned by the trustee are retained by the trustee.  Part of the 
trustee's compensation for its services to a trust is expected to result from   
the use of these funds.                                                         

The supervisor will charge a trust a surveillance fee for services    
performed for the trust in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the 
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation received from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor   
both acts as sponsor and provides portfolio surveillance, exceed the aggregate  
cost to the sponsor of providing such services.  Such fee shall be based on the 
total number of units of the related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any  
annual period, except during the initial offering period the fee will be based  
on the units outstanding at the end of each month.                              

     For evaluation of the securities in a trust, the evaluator shall receive an
evaluation fee in an amount not to exceed that amount set forth in the          
prospectus but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all       
compensation from other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as    
sponsor and provides evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing
such services.  Such fee shall be based on the total number of units of the     
related trust outstanding as of January 1 for any annual period, except during  
the initial offering period the fee will be based on the units outstanding at   
the end of each month.                                                          

For providing bookkeeping and administrative services to a trust, the 
sponsor shall receive an administration fee in an amount not to exceed that     
amount set forth in the prospectus                                              

-23-

P-->48750th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
but in no event will such compensation, when combined with all compensation from
other unit investment trusts for which the sponsor acts as sponsor and provides 
evaluation services, exceed the aggregate cost of providing such services.  Such
fee shall be based on the total number of units of the related trust outstanding
as of January 1 for any annual period, except during the initial offering period
the fee will be based on the units outstanding at the end of each month.        

The trustee's fee, sponsor's fee for providing bookkeeping and        
administrative services to the trust, supervisor's fee and evaluator's fee are  
deducted from the Income Account of the related trust to the extent funds are   
available and then from the Capital Account.  Each such fee (other than any     
creation and development fee) may be increased without approval of unitholders  
by amounts not exceeding a proportionate increase in the Consumer Price Index or
any equivalent index substituted therefor.                                      

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by the trust: 
(a) fees for the trustee's extraordinary services; (b) expenses of the trustee  
(including legal and auditing expenses and reimbursement of the cost of advances
to the trust for payment of expenses and distributions, but not including any   
fees and expenses charged by an agent for custody and safeguarding of           
securities) and of counsel, if any; (c) various governmental charges;           
(d) expenses and costs of any action taken by the trustee to protect the trust  
or the rights and interests of the unitholders; (e) indemnification of the      
trustee for any loss, liability or expense incurred by it in the administration 
of the trust not resulting from negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on  
its part or its reckless disregard of its obligations under the trust agreement;
(f) indemnification of the sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred  
in acting in that capacity without gross negligence, bad faith or willful       
misconduct or its reckless disregard for its obligations under the trust        
agreement; and (g) expenditures incurred in contacting unitholders upon         
termination of the trust.  The fees and expenses set forth herein are payable   
out of a trust and, when owing to the trustee, are secured by a lien on the     
trust.  If the balances in the Income and Capital Accounts are insufficient to  
provide for amounts payable by the trust, the trustee has the power to sell     
securities to pay such amounts.  These sales may result in capital gains or     
losses to unitholders.  A trust may pay the costs of updating its registration  
statement each year.                                                            

PORTFOLIO TRANSACTIONS AND BROKERAGE ALLOCATION                                 

When a trust sells securities, the composition and diversity of the   
securities in the trust may be altered.  In order to obtain the best price for a
trust, it may be necessary for the sponsor to specify minimum amounts in which  
blocks of securities are to be sold.  In effecting purchases and sales of a     
trust's portfolio securities, the sponsor may direct that orders be placed with 
and brokerage commissions be paid to brokers, including brokers which may be    
affiliated with the trust, the sponsor or dealers participating in the offering 
of units.                                                                       

PURCHASE, REDEMPTION AND PRICING OF UNITS                                       

     PUBLIC OFFERING PRICE.  Units of a trust are offered at the public offering
price thereof.  The public offering price per unit is equal to the net asset    
value per unit plus organization costs plus the applicable sales fee referred to
in the prospectus.  The initial sales fee is equal to the difference between the
maximum sales fee and the sum of the remaining deferred sales fee and           

-24-

P-->48751st�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�51st
the total creation and development fee.  The sales fee as a percentage of the   
public offering price and the net amount invested is set forth in the           
prospectus.  The deferred sales fee is a fixed dollar amount and will be        
collected in installments as described in the prospectus. The creation and      
development fee is a fixed dollar amount and will be collected at the end of the
initial offering period as described in the prospectus.  Units purchased after  
the initial deferred sales fee payment will be subject to the remaining deferred
sales fee payments.  Units sold or redeemed prior to such time as the entire    
applicable deferred sales fee has been collected will be assessed the remaining 
deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or redemption. Units sold or        
redeemed prior to such time as the entire applicable creation and development   
fee has been collected will not be assessed the remaining creation and          
development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  During the initial     
offering period, a portion of the public offering price includes an amount of   
securities to pay for all or a portion of the costs incurred in establishing a  
trust.  These costs include the cost of preparing the registration statement,   
the trust indenture and other closing documents, registering units with the     
Securities and Exchange Commission and states, the initial audit of the trust   
portfolio, legal fees and the initial fees and expenses of the trustee.  These  
costs will be deducted from a trust as of the end of the initial offering period
or after six months, if earlier. Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction
fee for processing unit purchases.                                              

As indicated above, the initial public offering price of the units was
established by dividing the aggregate underlying value of the securities by the 
number of units outstanding.  Such price determination as of the opening of     
business on the date a trust was created was made on the basis of an evaluation 
of the securities in the trust prepared by the evaluator.  After the opening of 
business on this date, the evaluator will appraise or cause to be appraised     
daily the value of the underlying securities as of the close of regular trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange on days the New York Stock Exchange is open and  
will adjust the public offering price of the units commensurate with such       
valuation.  Such public offering price will be effective for all orders received
at or prior to the close of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on   
each such day as discussed in the prospectus.  Orders received by the trustee,  
sponsor or authorized financial professionals for purchases, sales or           
redemptions after that time, or on a day when the New York Stock Exchange is    
closed, will be held until the next determination of price as discussed in the  
prospectus.                                                                     

  Had units of a trust been available for sale at the close of business on
the business day before the inception date of the trust, the public offering    
price would have been as shown under "Essential Information" in the prospectus. 
The public offering price per unit of a trust on the date of the prospectus or  
on any subsequent date will vary from the amount stated under "Essential
Information" in the prospectus in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of 
the underlying securities.  Net asset value per unit is determined by dividing  
the value of a trust's portfolio securities, cash and other assets, less all    
liabilities, by the total number of units outstanding.  The portfolio securities
are valued by the evaluator as follows: If the security is listed on a national 
securities exchange, the evaluation will generally be based on the last sale    
price on the exchange (unless the evaluator deems the price inappropriate as a  
basis for evaluation).  If the security is not so listed or, if so listed and   
the principal market for the security is other than on the exchange, the        
evaluation will generally be made by the evaluator in good faith based on an    
appraisal of the fair value of the securities using recognized pricing methods. 

-25-

P-->48752nd�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
     The foregoing evaluations and computations shall be made as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on each business day commencing 
with the trust's inception date of the securities, effective for all sales made 
during the preceding 24-hour period.                                            

   Although payment is normally made three business days following the order
for purchase, payments may be made prior thereto.  A person will become the     
owner of units on the date of settlement provided payment has been received.    
Cash, if any, made available to the sponsor prior to the date of settlement for 
the purchase of units may be used in the sponsor's business and may be deemed to
be a benefit to the sponsor, subject to the limitations of the Securities       
Exchange Act of 1934.  If a unitholder desires to have certificates representing
units purchased, such certificates will be delivered as soon as possible        
following his written request therefor.                                         

     PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION OF UNITS.  The sponsor intends to qualify the units for
sale in a number of states.  Units will be sold through dealers who are members 
of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and through others.     
Sales may be made to or through dealers at prices which represent discounts from
the public offering price as set forth in the prospectus.  Certain commercial   
banks may be making units available to their customers on an agency basis.  The 
sponsor reserves the right to change the discounts from time to time.           

   We may provide, at our own expense and out of our own profits, additional
compensation and benefits to broker-dealers who sell shares of units of this    
trust and our other products. This compensation is intended to result in        
additional sales of our products and/or compensate broker-dealers and financial 
advisors for past sales. We may make these payments for marketing, promotional  
or related expenses, including, but not limited to, expenses of entertaining    
retail customers and financial advisors, advertising, sponsorship of events or  
seminars, obtaining shelf space in broker-dealer firms and similar activities   
designed to promote the sale of the our products. These arrangements will not   
change the price you pay for your units.                                        

  The sponsor reserves the right to reject, in whole or in part, any order
for the purchase of units.                                                      

     PROFITS OF SPONSOR.  The sponsor will receive gross sales fees equal to the
percentage of the offering price of the units of such trusts stated in the      
prospectus and will pay a portion of such sales fees to dealers and agents.  In 
addition, the sponsor may realize a profit or a loss resulting from the         
difference between the purchase prices of the securities to the sponsor and the 
cost of such securities to a trust.  The sponsor may also realize profits or    
losses with respect to securities deposited in a trust which were acquired from 
underwriting syndicates of which the sponsor was a member.  An underwriter or   
underwriting syndicate purchases securities from the issuer on a negotiated or  
competitive bid basis, as principal, with the motive of marketing such          
securities to investors at a profit.  The sponsor may realize additional profits
or losses during the initial offering period on unsold units as a result of     
changes in the daily evaluation of the securities in a trust.                   

   MARKET FOR UNITS.  After the initial offering period, while not obligated
to do so, the sponsor may, subject to change at any time, maintain a market for 
units of the trust offered                                                      

-26-

hereby and to continuously offer to purchase said units at the net asset value  
determined by the evaluator, provided that the repurchase price will not be     
reduced by any remaining creation and development fee or organization costs     
during the initial offering period.  While the sponsor may repurchase units from
time to time, it does not currently intend to maintain an active secondary      
market for units.  Unitholders who wish to dispose of their units should inquire
of their broker as to current market prices in order to determine whether there 
is in existence any price in excess of the redemption price and, if so, the     
amount thereof.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the 
entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the 
amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or          
redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the     
entire creation and development fee on such units has been collected will not be
assessed the amount of the remaining creation and development fee at the time of
such sale or redemption.  The offering price of any units resold by the sponsor 
will be in accord with that described in the currently effective prospectus     
describing such units.  Any profit or loss resulting from the resale of such    
units will belong to the sponsor.  If the sponsor decides to maintain a         
secondary market, it may suspend or discontinue purchases of units of the trust 
if the supply of units exceeds demand, or for other business reasons.           

  REDEMPTION.  A unitholder who does not dispose of units in the secondary
market described above may cause units to be redeemed by the trustee by making a
written request to the trustee at its unit investment trust division office and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by tendering such certificate  
to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument or      
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the trustee.  Unitholders must  
sign the request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their 
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be redeemed.  Additional documentation may be requested, and a     
signature guarantee is always required, from corporations, executors,           
administrators, trustees, guardians or associations.  The signatures must be    
guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program 
("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in addition to, or in        
substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the trustee.  A certificate      
should only be sent by registered or certified mail for the protection of the   
unitholder.  Since tender of the certificate is required for redemption when one
has been issued, units represented by a certificate cannot be redeemed until the
certificate representing such units has been received by the purchasers.        

Redemption shall be made by the trustee no later than the seventh day 
following the day on which a tender for redemption is received (the "Redemption 
Date") by payment of cash equivalent to the redemption price, determined as set 
forth below under "Computation of Redemption Price," as of the close of regular 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange next following such tender, multiplied by
the number of units being redeemed.  Any units redeemed shall be canceled and   
any undivided fractional interest in the related trust extinguished.  The price 
received upon redemption might be more or less than the amount paid by the      
unitholder depending on the value of the securities in the trust at the time of 
redemption.  Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the     
entire deferred sales fee on such units has been collected will be assessed the 
amount of the remaining deferred sales fee at the time of such sale or          
redemption. Unitholders who sell or redeem units prior to such time as the      
entire creation and development fee on such units has been collected will not be
assessed the amount of the                                                      

-27-

remaining creation and development fee at the time of such sale or redemption.  
Certain broker-dealers may charge a transaction fee for processing redemption   
requests.                                                                       

  Under regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service, the trustee is
required to withhold a specified percentage of the principal amount of a unit   
redemption if the trustee has not been furnished the redeeming unitholder's tax 
identification number in the manner required by such regulations.  Any amount so
withheld is transmitted to the Internal Revenue Service and may be recovered by 
the unitholder only when filing a tax return.  Under normal circumstances, the  
trustee obtains the unitholder's tax identification number from the selling     
broker.  However, any time a unitholder elects to tender units for redemption,  
such unitholder should make sure that the trustee has been provided a certified 
tax identification number in order to avoid this possible "back-up withholding."
In the event the trustee has not been previously provided such number, one must 
be provided at the time redemption is requested.  Any amounts paid on redemption
representing interest shall be withdrawn from the Income Account of a trust to  
the extent that funds are available for such purpose.  All other amounts paid on
redemption shall be withdrawn from the Capital Account for a trust.             

  Unitholders tendering units for redemption may request a distribution in
kind (a "Distribution In Kind") from the trustee in lieu of cash redemption of  
an amount and value of securities per unit equal to the redemption price per    
unit as determined as of the evaluation time next following the tender, provided
that the tendering unitholder meets the requirements stated in the prospectus   
and the unitholder has elected to redeem at least thirty days prior to the      
termination of the trust. If the unitholder meets these requirements, a         
Distribution In Kind will be made by the trustee through the distribution of    
each of the securities of the trust in book entry form to the account of the    
unitholder's bank or broker-dealer at Depository Trust Company.  The tendering  
unitholder shall be entitled to receive whole shares of each of the securities  
comprising the portfolio of the trust and cash from the Capital Account equal to
the fractional shares to which the tendering unitholder is entitled.  The       
trustee shall make any adjustments necessary to reflect differences between the 
redemption price of the units and the value of the securities distributed in    
kind as of the date of tender.  If funds in the Capital Account are insufficient
to cover the required cash distribution to the tendering unitholder, the trustee
may sell securities.  The in kind redemption option may be terminated by the    
sponsor at any time.                                                            

The trustee is empowered to sell securities in order to make funds    
available for the redemption of units.  To the extent that securities are sold  
or redeemed in-kind, the size of a trust will be, and the diversity of a trust  
may be, reduced but each remaining unit will continue to represent approximately
the same proportional interest in each security.  Sales may be required at a    
time when securities would not otherwise be sold and may result in lower prices 
than might otherwise be realized.  The price received upon redemption may be    
more or less than the amount paid by the unitholder depending on the value of   
the securities in the portfolio at the time of redemption.                      

 The trustee is irrevocably authorized in its discretion, if the sponsor
does not elect to purchase any unit tendered for redemption, in lieu of         
redeeming such units, to sell such units in the over-the-counter market for the 
account of tendering unitholders at prices which will return to the unitholders 
amounts in cash, net after brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and other      

-28-

P-->48755th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�55th
charges, equal to or in excess of the redemption price for such units.  In the  
event of any such sale, the trustee shall pay the net proceeds thereof to the   
unitholders on the day they would otherwise be entitled to receive payment of   
the redemption price.                                                           

    The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed (1) for any
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than customary 
weekend and holiday closings, or during which (as determined by the Securities  
and Exchange Commission) trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted;  
(2) for any period during which an emergency exists as a result of which        
disposal by the trustee of securities is not reasonably practicable or it is not
reasonably practicable to fairly determine the value of the underlying          
securities in accordance with the trust agreement; or (3) for such other period 
as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by order permit.  The trustee is  
not liable to any person in any way for any loss or damage which may result from
any such suspension or postponement.                                            

COMPUTATION OF REDEMPTION PRICE.  The redemption price for units of each
trust is computed by the evaluator as of the evaluation time stated in the      
prospectus next occurring after the tendering of a unit for redemption and on   
any other business day desired by it, by:                                       

A.   Adding:  (1) the cash on hand in the trust other than cash deposited in the
     trust to purchase securities not applied to the purchase of such securities
 and (2) the aggregate value of each issue of the securities held in the
trust as determined by the evaluator as described above;              

B.   Deducting therefrom (1) amounts representing any applicable taxes or       
   governmental charges payable out of the trust and for which no deductions
have been previously made for the purpose of additions to the Reserve 
   Account; (2) an amount representing estimated accrued expenses, including
  but not limited to fees and expenses of the trustee (including legal and
  auditing fees), the evaluator, the sponsor and counsel, if any; (3) cash
     held for distribution to unitholders of record as of the business day prior
 to the evaluation being made; and (4) other liabilities incurred by the
trust, provided that the redemption price will not be reduced by any  
 remaining creation and development fee or organization costs during the
initial offering period; and                                          

C.   Finally dividing the results of such computation by the number of units of 
the trust outstanding as of the date thereof.                         

RETIREMENT PLANS.  A trust may be suited for purchase by Individual   
Retirement Accounts, Keogh Plans, pension funds and other qualified retirement  
plans.  Generally, capital gains and income received under each of the foregoing
plans are deferred from Federal taxation.  All distributions from such plans are
generally treated as ordinary income but may, in some cases, be eligible for    
special income averaging or tax-deferred rollover treatment.  Investors         
considering participation in any such plan should review specific tax laws      
related thereto and should consult their attorneys or tax advisers with respect 
to the establishment and maintenance of any such plan.  Such plans are offered  
by brokerage firms and other financial institutions.  The trust will lower the  
minimum investment requirement for IRA accounts.  Fees and charges with respect 
to such plans may vary.                                                         

-29-

P-->48756th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�56th
OWNERSHIP OF UNITS.  Ownership of units will not be evidenced by      
certificates unless a unitholder, the unitholder's registered broker/dealer or  
the clearing agent for such broker/dealer makes a written request to the        
trustee.  Units are transferable by making a written request to the trustee and,
in the case of units evidenced by a certificate, by presenting and surrendering 
such certificate to the trustee properly endorsed or accompanied by a written   
instrument or instruments of transfer which should be sent by registered or     
certified mail for the protection of the unitholder.  Unitholders must sign such
written request, and such certificate or transfer instrument, exactly as their  
names appear on the records of the trustee and on any certificate representing  
the units to be transferred.  Such signatures must be guaranteed as described   
above.                                                                          

  Units may be purchased and certificates, if requested, will be issued in
denominations of one unit or any multiple thereof, subject to the minimum       
investment requirement.  Fractions of units, if any, will be computed to three  
decimal places.  Any certificate issued will be numbered serially for           
identification, issued in fully registered form and will be transferable only on
the books of the trustee.  The trustee may require a unitholder to pay a        
reasonable fee, to be determined in the sole discretion of the trustee, for each
certificate re-issued or transferred and to pay any governmental charge that may
be imposed in connection with each such transfer or interchange.  The trustee at
the present time does not intend to charge for the normal transfer or           
interchange of certificates.  Destroyed, stolen, mutilated or lost certificates 
will be replaced upon delivery to the trustee of satisfactory indemnity         
(generally amounting to 3% of the market value of the units), affidavit of loss,
evidence of ownership and payment of expenses incurred.                         

TAXATION                                                                        

 The prospectus contains a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax
issues concerning your trust and the purchase, ownership and disposition of     
trust units. The discussion below supplements the prospectus discussion and is  
qualified in its entirety by the prospectus discussion. Prospective investors   
should consult their own tax advisors with regard to the federal tax            
consequences of the purchase, ownership, or disposition of trust units, as well 
as the tax consequences arising under the laws of any state, locality, non-U.S. 
country, or other taxing jurisdiction.                                          

     The federal income tax summary below and in the prospectus is based in part
on the advice of counsel to your trust. The Internal Revenue Service could      
disagree with any conclusions set forth in these discussions. In addition, our  
counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion with respect  
to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be held by your trust. This
may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of       
avoiding penalties under federal tax law.                                       

     If so indicated in the prospectus, your trust intends (i) to elect and (ii)
to qualify annually as a regulated investment company under the Code and to     
comply with applicable distribution requirements so that it will not pay federal
income tax on income and capital gains distributed to its unitholders.          

  To qualify for the favorable U.S. federal income tax treatment generally
accorded to regulated investment companies, your trust must, among other things,
(a) derive in each taxable                                                      

-30-

P-->48757th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�57th
year at least 90% of its gross income from dividends, interest, payments with   
respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of     
stock, securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to 
its business of investing in such stock, securities or currencies, and net      
income from certain publicly traded partnerships; (b) diversify its holdings so 
that, at the end of each quarter of the taxable year, (i) at least 50% of the   
market value of the trust's assets is represented by cash and cash items        
(including receivables), U.S. government securities, the securities of other    
regulated investment companies and other securities, with such other securities 
of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of this calculation to an  
amount not greater than 5% of the value of the trust's total assets and not     
greater than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and (ii)  
not more than 25% of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities
(other than U.S. government securities or the securities of other regulated     
investment companies) of any one issuer, or two or more issuers which the trust 
controls and are engaged in the same, similar or related trades or businesses,  
or the securities of certain publicly traded partnerships; and (c) distribute at
least 90% of its investment company taxable income (which includes, among other 
items, dividends, interest and net short-term capital gains in excess of net    
long-term capital losses but excludes net capital gain, if any) and at least 90%
of its net tax-exempt interest income each taxable year.                        

     As a regulated investment company, your trust generally will not be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on its investment company taxable income (as that    
term is defined in the Code, but without regard to the deduction for dividends  
paid) and net capital gain (the excess of net long-term capital gain over net   
short term capital loss), if any, that it distributes to unitholders. The trusts
intend to distribute to its unitholders, at least annually, substantially all of
its investment company taxable income and net capital gain. If your trust       
retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income, it will      
generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the    
amount retained. In addition, amounts not distributed on a timely basis in      
accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a       
nondeductible 4% excise tax unless, generally, your trust distributes during    
each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of (1) at least 98% of its        
ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the   
calendar year, (2) at least 98% of its capital gains in excess of its capital   
losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one-year period ending    
October 31 of the calendar year, and (3) any ordinary income and capital gains  
for previous years that were not distributed during those years. To prevent     
application of the excise tax, your trust intends to make its distributions in  
accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement. Further, if your    
trust retains any net capital gain, the trust may designate the retained amount 
as undistributed capital gains in a notice to unitholders who, if subject to    
federal income tax on long-term capital gains (i) will be required to include in
income for federal income tax purposes, as long-term capital gain, their share  
of such undistributed amount, and (ii) will be entitled to credit their         
proportionate share of the tax paid by the trust against their federal income   
tax liabilities if any, and to claim refunds to the extent the credit exceeds   
such liabilities. A distribution will be treated as paid on December 31 of the  
current calendar year if it is declared by your trust in October, November or   
December with a record date in such a month and paid by your trust during       
January of the following calendar year. These distributions will be taxable to  
unitholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared, rather
than the calendar year in which the distributions are received.                 

-31-

P-->48758th�Page�of�62TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�58th
     If your trust failed to qualify as a regulated investment company or failed
to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement in any taxable year, the trust would
be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income (even if such income  
were distributed to its unitholders) and all distributions out of earnings and  
profits would be taxed to unitholders as ordinary dividend income.              

 If the trust is treated as holding directly or indirectly 10 percent or
more of the combined voting power of the stock of a foreign corporation, and all
U.S. shareholders collectively own more than 50 percent of the vote or value of 
the stock of such corporation, the foreign corporation may be treated as a      
"controlled foreign corporation" (a "CFC") from a U.S. tax perspective.  In such
circumstances, the trust will be required to include certain types of passive   
income and certain other types of income relating to insurance, sales and       
services with related parties and oil related income in the trust's taxable     
income whether or not such income is distributed.                               

  If the trust holds an equity interest in any "passive foreign investment
companies" ("PFICs"), which are generally certain foreign corporations that     
receive at least 75% of their annual gross income from passive sources (such as 
interest, dividends, certain rents and royalties or capital gains) or that hold 
at least 50% of their assets in investments producing such passive income, the  
trust could be subject to U.S. federal income tax and additional interest       
charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity         
interests, even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its          
unitholders.  The trust will not be able to pass through to its unitholders any 
credit or deduction for such taxes.  The trust may be able to make an election  
that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences.  In this case, the trust  
would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such PFIC       
shares, and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not
exceed prior increases included in income. Under this election, the trust might 
be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from   
PFICs and its proceeds from dispositions of PFIC stock during that year, and    
such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and   
would be taken into account for purposes of the 4% excise tax (described above).
Dividends paid by PFICs will not be treated as qualified dividend income.

Factoid of the Day


Tuesday, July 25, 2017






The Weather Company announced yesterday that it expects a total of 15 named storms and eight hurricanes (three will be major in scope) in the Atlantic this hurricane season. The 2017 season began on June 1. Its forecast matches the average amount of activity posted from 1995 through 2016 (15 named storms and eight hurricanes/three major in scope). Since 1980, there have been 32 hurricanes in the U.S. that produced damages in excess of $1 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information and Bloomberg. The combined losses, adjusted for inflation, totaled $549.9 billion, with Katrina (2005) accounting for $156.3 billion of it.
