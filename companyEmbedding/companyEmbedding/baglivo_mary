MARY BAGLIVO NAMED CEO OF SAATCHI NEW YORK
Tony Granger Takes Over as Executive Creative Director in Office Shakeup


	By  

Lisa Sanders.
	

	
	
 Published on September 14, 2004. 







		        NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- In a management shakeup at ad agency  Saatchi & Saatchi's New York office, Mary Baglivo is joining the office as CEO and also takes on the new role of worldwide marketing director.

 in London since January 2003, will take the same role at Saatchi New York, succeeding Tod Seisser, who is leaving the company after seven years. 

Saatchi is a unit of French holding company Publicis Groupe.

Procter & Gamble 
Ms. Baglivo, 46, was president of Havas' Arnold Worldwide, New York. Ms. Baglivo has substantial experience working with Saatchi's biggest client, Procter & Gamble Co. She spent 18 years at Havas' Euro RSCG Tatham, Chicago, where she ran major P&G brands in different product categories including Old Spice, Head & Shoulders, Mr. Clean and Clearasil. She was the agency's CEO when she left in 1999 to become J. Walter Thompson's executive vice president and chief operating officer for North America.  JWT is a unit of WPP Group.

Mr. Granger worked in New York as creative director at Interpublic Group of Cos.' Bozell, now defunct, before moving to Saatchi last year. His replacement in London has not been named.

Former co-CEOs 
Saatchi's worldwide CEO, Kevin Roberts, announced the management changes, effective in October, to Saatchi staff this morning in a meeting held in the agency's auditorium. Todd Gilbert was co-CEO of the New York agency until he resigned last week. Mike Burns, the other co-CEO, will return to running Saatchi's General Mills account worldwide. 

Speaking to AdAge.com after the morning meeting, Mr. Roberts said the mission now is to transform the New York office. "I want Saatchi New York to be a new-business machine, leading the agency in pitches as well as the network on global business reviews," he said. "We want Saatchi New York to be the network's heart. Charlotte Street [Saatchi London's address] has always been the soul, the agency's DNA." 

Since its purchase by Publicis in 2000, the agency has operated largely below the radar in the U.S., even though it works with  P&G and General Mills for brands such as Tide, Pampers and Cheerios. But 2003 was a tough year: Johnson & Johnson pulled its accounts, which included Tylenol, St. Joseph, Pepcid and Mylanta brands, and the agency narrowly retained the $330 million account from the Greater New York Toyota Dealers Association in a bitterly fought review.

New-business plans 
Mr. Roberts said he would like the agency to regain over-the-counter health-care brands and add other packaged-goods brands that won't conflict with its main accounts from P&G and General Mills. Another category the agency would like to add would be financial services; Saatchi is competing for the Charles Schwab account, which had been at Omnicom Group's  GSD&M.

In another move to strengthen Saatchi's hold on P&G business, longtime Saatchi New York executive Vaughan Emsley was named to the new position of general manager for P&G worldwide.

Replacement at Havas 
Meanwhile, Arnold's U.S. president, Fran Kelly, will assume Ms. Baglivo's responsibilties at her former agency. Mr. Kelly will split his time between the agency's Boston and New York offices for the "foreseeable future," an Arnold spokesman said. He declined to say whether a search for a New York office head is being conducted.
