Employee Benefits
The right benefits for getting and keeping the best talent in your industry.






Comprehensive Benefits
A comprehensive employee benefits offering is an important recruiting tool and a meaningful way to drive employee satisfaction. TriNet’s expansive offering goes beyond great health and retirement coverage to fringe benefits like pet insurance, commuter benefits, an exclusive discount marketplace and much more. 
Great employee benefit plans shouldn’t be reserved for large companies, and with TriNet, small and midsize businesses get to enjoy rich benefits, too. 
















Access to Comprehensive Group Benefit Plans
TriNet allows you to gain access to our group insurance and retirement plans offered through industry leaders that cover thousands of companies and hundreds of thousands of plan participants. This allows for plan designs and competitive costs that are often out of reach for small and midsize businesses.

Full Compliance
There is a litany of requirements that benefit plans must comply with, and compliance demands expertise, recordkeeping, paperwork and systems. Whether it’s the Affordable Care Act or retirement plan reporting, TriNet provides complete compliance expertise, saving you time, and leaving the administrative headaches to us.

Integrated ACA solution that includes compliant plans, reporting and employee notices (with the ACA, there are still risks of penalties assessed on a client for incorrect information or non-participation, beyond our control and liability)
COBRA administration for your former employees, including notices and payment collection
Plan documents, required notices and filings for health and retirement plans
 













Health Plans
TriNet provides a broad range of plan options and carriers for medical, dental and vision insurance, allowing you to pick the right structure for you and your employees. We work with a combination of top national and regional insurance carriers, ensuring access to select providers and networks. It’s a full-service offering so guidance, compliance, technology, open enrollment and more are all managed by TriNet.

Retirement
A retirement plan is a meaningful part of a company’s benefits offering and of great value to employees so they can better prepare for their financial future. TriNet makes it easy for you to provide a quality 401(k) plan to your employees with customizable company contributions, from no match to rich matching and profit-sharing options.

Transfer of primary fiduciary responsibility to TriNet
Wide array of professionally managed investment options, with competitive expenses
Enrollment support and ongoing participant education
TriNet handles employee benefits administration including participant transactions, compliance testing and Form 5500 filing
 













Full Integration
There are a lot of moving parts to get benefits done right, including guidance, technology, payroll deductions, open enrollment, compliance and more. Because TriNet delivers an integrated HR solution, we’re in a unique position to deliver an excellent benefits experience.
