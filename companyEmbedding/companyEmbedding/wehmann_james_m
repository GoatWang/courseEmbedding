                                                                                                Customer data is more widely available than ever, but leveraging data to drive smarter decisions requires new thinking and a new kind of agility. As companies develop strategies for both cloud computing and for using Big Data to improve customer relationships, analytically-empowered solutions, cloud-based applications and a flexible cloud-based Decision Management development platform become essential.
