        Parnassus Fund

        Investor Shares






                Objective:

                Capital appreciation.

                Strategy

                The Parnassus Fund invests across the capitalization spectrum with high conviction in approximately 40 holdings. The Fund focuses on identifying companies with:                
            

Wide moats or strong competitive advantages that protect market share and profitability
Relevancy over the long term, which provides a compounding growth component
                
Quality management teams that will act in the best interest of shareholders 
                
Stocks trading at a significant discount to their intrinsic value
                


                The Fund's contrarian approach seeks to invest in companies that are currently out of favor with the majority of investors. The Fund strives to outperform the S&P 500 index with a high active share. The Fund avoids companies engaged in the extraction, exploration, production, manufacturing, or refining of fossil fuels.
            

                Risks

                The Funds share price may change daily based on the value of its security holdings.
                Stock markets can be volatile, and stock values fluctuate in response to the asset
                levels of individual companies and in response to general U.S. and international
                market and economic conditions. In addition to large-cap companies, the Fund may
                invest in small- and/or mid-cap companies, which can be more volatile than large-cap
                firms. Security holdings in the fund can vary significantly from broad market indexes.

Avg. Weighted Mkt. Cap ($Bin)
                            The average capitalization of all stocks in the portfolio, weighted by each holding's
                            size in the portfolio. Capitalization, or market value of an entire company, is
                            calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the price per share.

                            (or "trailing" 12 months). This gives us an idea of how "expensive" a stock may
                            be. For a fund, the price/earnings ratio is the weighted average P/E ratio of the
                            stocks it holds.

Alpha
                            A coefficient measuring risk-adjusted performance, considering the risk due to the
                            specific security, rather than the overall market. A large alpha indicates that
                            the stock or mutual fund has performed better than would be predicted, given its
                            beta.

Beta
                            A measurement of a fund's trailing 36-month returns in relation with the market
                            as a whole. A beta of 1 means that the share price moves exactly inline with the
                            market. A beta over 1 suggests that the share price will typically be more volatile
                            than the market, and conversely, a beta below 1 indicates that the share price will
                            typically be less volatile than the market.

        The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (also known as “the S&P
        500 Index”) is a widely recognized index of common stock prices. An individual cannot
        invest directly in an index. An index reflects no deductions for fees, expenses
        or taxes, but mutual fund returns do.

 The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds,
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with
at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population
for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for
variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and
rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5%
receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The
Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures
associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year
rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total
returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns.
While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent
three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Parnassus Fund
was rated against the following numbers of Large Growth Funds over the following time periods: 1,277 funds in the
last three years, 1,152 funds in the last five years, and 803 funds in the last ten years. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Morningstar Rating is for the Investor class only; other classes may have different
performance characteristics.

aThe net expense ratio is what investors pay. 





Annual Returns as of 12/31/16














































Growth of $10,000 as of 12/31/2016
    1








1 The chart shows the growth in value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment since inception, 12/31/1984, and does not reflect the deduction of taxes a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares.

        Performance data quoted represent past performance and are no guarantee of future
        returns. All performance assumes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. The
        investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an
        investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original
        cost.

        The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (also known as "The S&P
        500 Index") is a widely recognized index of common stock prices. An individual cannot
        invest directly in an index. An index reflects no deductions for fees, expenses
        or taxes, but mutual fund returns do.

        Common stock prices fluctuate based on changes to a companys financial condition
        and on overall market and economic conditions.

        In addition to large-cap companies, the Fund may invest in small- and/or mid-cap
        companies, which can be particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions and
        have fewer financial resources or the well-established businesses of large-cap companies.
        Relative to stocks of large-cap companies, the stocks of small- and mid-cap companies
        are often thinly traded, and purchases and sales may result in higher transaction
        costs. Also, small-cap companies tend to perform poorly during times of economic
        stress. Investment return and principal will fluctuate, so that an investors shares,
        when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original principal cost.

        Prior to May 1, 2004, the Parnassus Fund charged a sales load of a maximum of 3.5%,
        which is not reflected in the total return figures.
    

        Returns shown for the Fund do not reflect the declaration of taxes a shareholder
        would pay on the fund distributions or redemption of fund shares.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

4 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 4 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



The fund invests in undervalued stocks. It follows a "contrarian" strategy of seeking to invest in stocks that are currently out of favor with the financial community and are therefore deeply undervalued. The fund's investment adviser expects that if these undervalued companies are financially strong and have good prospects for the future, they will come back into favor and increase in market value. It is a "multi-cap" fund in that it can invest in companies of any size, from larger, well-established companies to smaller companies.


Risk



Growth stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and can be more volatile than other types of stocks. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, economic or other developments. These risks may be magnified in foreign markets. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund scores Average because it delivered returns that were in the middle 35% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category:� top 10% - High� next 22.5% - Above Average� middle 35% - Average� next 22.5% - Below Average� bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
7. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
8. StyleMap� depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
9. Please note Regional Diversification information is based on the equity components only.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
