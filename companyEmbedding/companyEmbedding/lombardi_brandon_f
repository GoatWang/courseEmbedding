Ample room exists for system abuses and simple human error. Financial markets and services attorneys assist in stockholder and investor lawsuits, securities-related class actions, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, private proceedings, broker-dealer claims, and actions involving tender offers and proxy contests.
