					Full Description



Clearside Biomedical, Inc., incorporated on May 26, 2011, is a clinical biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class drug therapies to treat blinding diseases of the eye. The Company's product candidates focus on diseases affecting the retina, which is the tissue that lines the inside of the eye and is primarily responsible for vision, and the choroid, which is the layer adjacent to the retina that supplies the retina with blood, oxygen and nourishment. With its microinjector, drugs are injected into and spread within and through the suprachoroidal space, (SCS), which is the space located between the choroid and the outer protective layer of the eye known as the sclera. With the suprachoroidal injection, its product candidates are more directly administered to the retina and choroid as compared to other ocular drug administration techniques, such as injections of drug into the vitreous, a jelly-like substance that occupies the central portion of the eye. It holds the rights to develop and commercialize drugs for treatment via injection into the SCS. The Company's product candidates are based on commonly used ophthalmic drugs. Its development programs aim to restore or improve visual function primarily by reducing the macular edema associated with a number of diseases affecting the retina and choroid.The Company is developing Zuprata, a preservative-free formulation of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (TA) for the treatment of macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis. It has specifically designed Zuprata to be administered using its SCS Microinjector. It is enrolling patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial. It is also developing Zuprata for the treatment of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a sight-threatening disorder resulting from the blockage of a retinal vein. It is engaged in exploring whether a suprachoroidal injection of Zuprata and a concomitant intravitreal injection of Eylea (aflibercept), an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), can provide improved visual acuity, reduced macular edema and reduced injection frequency as compared to administration of intravitreal Eylea alone. Its Zuprata development program also includes another retinal vascular condition known as diabetic macular edema (DME). DME is a common ocular complication of diabetes that results in swelling in the macula and is the primary cause of vision loss associated with diabetes.The Company is also developing another product candidate, an injectable suspension formulation of the compound axitinib, to be administered suprachoroidally for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Axitinib has activities against both VEGF receptors and receptors of platelet derived growth factor, or PDGF. It is also working with third parties through collaborations and licenses to develop eye disease treatments using its SCS Microinjector and method of drug administration to the choroid and retina through the SCS. It has completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Zuprata injected into the SCS with its SCS Microinjector. It has completed a Phase II clinical trial for the treatment of macular edema associated with RVO, a sight-threatening disorder resulting from the blockage of a retinal vein.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.

I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.

AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

CLS-1001 – Macular Edema Associated with Non-infectious Uveitis
Uveitis is a set of conditions characterized by inflammation in the eye. Macular edema is the most dominant cause of vision distortion and loss in uveitis. We are developing a treatment for macular edema due to noninfectious uveitis using a suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA, (“suprachoroidal CLS-TA”) our proprietary, preservative-free formulation of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide (CLS-TA). We have completed an open label phase 1/2 and masked, randomized phase 2 trial, where we met our primary endpoint showing significant reduction in macular edema (p=0.002) and improvement in best corrected visual acuity (p=0.0004), each at 2 months from baseline.
We are actively enrolling patients in a 6-month controlled, randomized, masked, multi-center phase 3 clinical trial and expect to report data in early 2018. Based on our end-of-Phase 2 review with the FDA in May 2015, we expect this trial to be the only pivotal clinical trial necessary to support a 505(b)(2) NDA filing for CLS-TA.
We believe that CLS-TA will be at least as effective in treating uveitis, including the associated macular edema, as commonly used local treatments with injected corticosteroids. However, we believe that there will be improved bioavailability of drug in the retina and choroid, which may result in faster onset of therapeutic effect, an efficacy profile with similar or lower drug amounts required, and longer duration of therapeutic effect, potentially resulting in a reduced frequency of necessary injections. Based on preclinical studies of ocular distribution of TA sparing the anterior portions of the eye, including the lens, we also believe that CLS-TA may result in fewer side effects compared to commonly used local corticosteroid treatments.
CLS-1003 – Macular Edema Associated with Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO)
RVO is a sight-threatening disorder resulting from the blockage of a retinal vein. In our RVO program, we are developing a potential treatment where suprachoroidal CLS-TA is used along with intravitreal Eylea (aflibercept).
In April 2016, we completed a 46-patient Phase 2 clinical trial with suprachoroidal CLS-TA concomitantly with intravitreal aflibercept in patients with macular edema associated with RVO. The study met the primary endpoint with significantly fewer additional intravitreal aflibercept injections in the combination arm compared to the control monotherapy intravitreal aflibercept arm (p=0.013). Visual acuity and macular edema improvements were also better in the combination arm compared to the monotherapy arm; based on these encouraging positive results, and with feedback from a recent (4Q16) end of phase 2 review with the FDA, we have commenced a Phase 3 clinical trial, the SAPPHIRE study, in RVO patients. SAPPHIRE will enroll approximately 460 patients randomized 1-1 to a combination arm (suprachoroidal CLS-TA with intravitreal aflibercept) and a control arm (monotherapy intravitreal aflibercept) with a primary best corrected visual acuity outcome at 8 weeks.  
We believe that CLS-TA used along with an anti-VEGF agent may provide a differentiated therapeutic benefit for RVO patients since our combination treatment potentially couples the advantages of visual acuity gain and macular edema reduction along with a quarterly, rather than monthly, dosing schedule, compared to currently used monthly intravitreal anti-VEGF injections alone.
CLS-1004 – Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)
We have expanded our CLS-TA development programs to include focusing on treatment for another retinal vascular condition, known as diabetic macular edema, or DME. DME is a common ocular complication of diabetes and is the primary cause of vision loss associated with diabetes.    
In November 2016, we began enrolling patients with DME in an open-label Phase 1/2 clinical trial to collect safety data, in addition to efficacy observations, associated with administering a combination of intravitreal Eylea and suprachoroidal CLS-TA, or following the administration of suprachoroidal CLS-TA alone, in patients with DME over a 6-month evaluation period. We expect to enroll approximately 20 patients in this trial and to report preliminary results in the second half of 2017.   
We are planning a controlled, randomized, masked phase 2 trial where we will compare safety and efficacy outcomes from a combination of suprachoroidal CLS-TA and intravitreal aflibercept to intravitreal aflibercept monotherapy over a nine-month evaluation period.

Clearside Biomedical, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Financial Results and Provides Corporate Update
BY GlobeNewswire— 7:00 AM ET 05/10/2017


ALPHARETTA, Ga., May  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Clearside Biomedical, Inc. (CLSD) , a late-stage biopharmaceutical company developing first-in-class drug therapies to treat back-of-the-eye diseases, today reported financial results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and provided an update on its development programs.
“The Clearside team continues our pursuit of transformative, elegant, precise solutions to restore and preserve vision,” said Daniel H. White, Chief Executive Officer and President. “Together, we continued to advance our pipeline in the first quarter of 2017 as our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis continues enrollment with preliminary data expected in early 2018.  We also enrolled the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion. Additionally, we received notices of allowance of two important U.S. patents, which are representative of a new family of patents that protect the unique drug distribution properties of injecting to the retinal and choroid through the suprachoroidal space.” Update on Key Development Programs  CLS-TA for suprachoroidal administration (“suprachoroidal CLS-TA”), Clearside’s proprietary suspension formulation of the corticosteroid triamcinolone acetonide, used either alone or together with an intravitreal anti-VEGF agent, is part of Clearside’s pipeline for the treatments of unmet or underserved blinding eye diseases where the pathologies manifest in the choroid and retina. Macular Edema Associated with Non-Infectious Uveitis In the first quarter of 2017, Clearside continued to enroll patients in PEACHTREE, the Phase 3 trial of suprachoroidal CLS-TA in patients with macular edema associated with non-infectious uveitis.  Clearside currently anticipates that it will report initial results from PEACHTREE in early 2018.   Macular Edema Associated with Retinal Vein Occlusion (“RVO”) On February 16, 2017, Clearside announced the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase 3 clinical trial, SAPPHIRE, of suprachoroidal CLS-TA used together with intravitreally administered EYLEA® (aflibercept) (“intravitreal Eylea”) for the treatment of macular edema associated with RVO. SAPPHIRE is a multicenter, multi-country, randomized, masked, controlled trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of suprachoroidal CLS-TA used with intravitreal Eylea in subjects with RVO. The primary objective of this trial will be to determine the proportion of patients in each arm with best corrected visual acuity improvement of at least 15 letters from baseline at eight weeks after initial treatment. Several secondary efficacy and safety outcomes will also be evaluated.  Diabetic Macular Edema (“DME”) On April 20, 2017, Clearside announced the completion of enrollment in an exploratory clinical trial, HULK, of suprachoroidal CLS-TA, both with or without intravitreal Eylea, for the treatment of DME. HULK is an open-label, multi-center Phase 1/2 study designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the administration of a suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA along with an intravitreal injection of Eylea in patients with DME naïve to treatment, as well as that of a suprachoroidal injection of CLS-TA alone in patients with DME who have previously been treated with intravitreal anti-VEGF or intravitreal corticosteroid treatment and still require further treatment.  Clearside currently expects to report preliminary results from HULK in the second half of 2017. Clearside is also planning a multicenter, randomized, masked, controlled Phase 2 trial, TYBEE, to evaluate suprachoroidal CLS-TA along with intravitreal Eylea, compared to intravitreal Eylea only, in patients with DME, over a 6-month evaluation period.  The primary endpoint of the trial will be the change in best corrected visual acuity from baseline in the combination treatment arm compared to the intravitreal Eylea only arm.  Clearside currently expects to enroll the first patient in TYBEE in mid-2017. Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (“Wet AMD”) Clearside continues to explore potential opportunities for the use of pharmacological therapies via suprachoroidal injection for the treatment of wet AMD. Collaborations As Clearside’s development programs move further into the clinic, opportunities have been created to collaborate with third-party proprietary programs.  In this regard, Clearside continues preclinical efforts with multiple collaborations in gene therapy, complement inhibition, and alternative mechanisms in the treatment of complex retinal diseases like AMD. First Quarter 2017 Financial Results Clearside’s research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $7.6 million, compared to $4.6 million for the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $3.0 million. This increase was primarily attributable to increased costs related to Clearside’s ongoing clinical development programs for CLS-TA and an increase in device manufacturing costs, partially offset by the decrease in costs from completed clinical trials and Clearside’s discontinuation of preclinical trials in its wet AMD program. General and administrative expenses were $2.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.3 million for the same period last year, an increase of $1.4 million. This year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.5 million in employee-related costs, a $0.2 million increase in patent and trademark costs, a $0.2 million increase for marketing expenses and a $0.3 million increase in the costs of operating as a public company.  Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled $77.5 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $83.6 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease reflects total operating expenses, partially offset by $5.1 million received in January 2017 upon the underwriters’ exercise of their option to purchase additional shares as part of Clearside’s follow-on public offering that initially closed in December 2016. Net loss for the first quarter of 2017 was $10.4 million, or $0.41 per share of common stock, compared to $5.4 million, or $2.05 per share of common stock, for the first quarter of 2016.  The increase in net loss is primarily attributable to higher research and development expenses, while the decrease in net loss per share of common stock is primarily due to an increase in the number of shares of common stock outstanding resulting from Clearside’s financing activities in 2016. Conference Call & Webcast Details Clearside is pleased to invite all interested parties to participate in a conference call today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, during which the results will be discussed. To participate in this conference call, please dial (844) 263-8310 (U.S.) or (213) 358-0959 (international), conference ID 17122858, approximately 10 minutes prior to the start time.  A live, listen-only audio webcast of the conference call can accessed by visiting the “Investor Relations” section at www.clearsidebio.com. An archive of the webcast will be available until June 10, 2017. About Clearside  Clearside Biomedical, Inc.
