 MINNEAPOLIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 6, 2001

 International Multifoods Corp. (NYSE:IMC) today announced two
additions to its senior management team to enhance the company's
ability to capitalize on growth opportunities and better meet customer
needs.

 Dan C. Swander will join the company as president and chief
operating officer, and Daryl Schaller, Ph.D., will join the company as
vice president of research and development, effective upon the closing
of the company's acquisition of the Pillsbury desserts and
specialty products business. Both Swander and Schaller will report to
Gary E. Costley, International Multifoods chairman and chief executive
officer.

 "In Dan Swander and Daryl Schaller, Multifoods is adding two
outstanding business executives to the senior leadership team with the
experience and perspective required to help the company accelerate
growth and improve profitability," said Costley. "The creation
of these positions reflects not only our intent to enhance
Multifoods' competitiveness and its technical resources, but also
our commitment to increase shareholder wealth."

 As president and chief operating officer, Swander will assume
operating responsibility for the company's two primary business
segments -- North America Foods and Multifoods Distribution Group.

 Reporting to Swander will be Robert S. Wright, senior vice
president, International Multifoods, and president of Multifoods
Distribution Group; Donald H. Twiner, vice president, International
Multifoods, and president of Robin Hood Multifoods Inc.; Christopher S.
Tangen, vice president, International Multifoods, and president of the
company's U.S. Foodservice Products division; and James H. White,
who will become vice president, International Multifoods, and president
of the U.S. Consumer Foods division, effective with the closing of the
acquisition.

 Swander, 58, was chairman and managing director of Swander Pace
& Company and a principal of Kurt Salmon Associates, strategic
consultants to the food, consumer packaged goods, soft goods and
retailing industries. Since founding Swander Pace & Company in 1987,
he has worked with clients globally to develop and execute business
strategies to achieve profitable growth and maximize shareholder value.
The firm's clients include Kellogg Company, The Pillsbury Company,
Groupe Danone, Lance, Inc., and Multifoods.

 Earlier in his career, Swander was a principal with McKinsey &
Company, Inc. He also was vice president of operations and marketing for
Victoria Station Inc., a national restaurant chain.

 Swander completed studies towards a master's degree in
marketing at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of
Commerce and Finance, and received a bachelor's degree in economics
with honors from Trinity College, Hartford, Conn. Swander is a frequent
guest speaker at association conferences for the food, beverage and
consumer goods industries, and is a contributing writer to industry
trade publications.

 As vice president of research and development, Schaller will have
overall responsibility for Multifoods' research and development
efforts. Reporting to Schaller will be Peter Vermeulen, who is vice
president, research and development for the company's North America
Foods segment; Sally Arnold, who will become director, quality and food
safety for North America Foods; and Pat Lynch, who has agreed to join
Multifoods as director of consumer product development, following the
closing of the acquisition. Lynch currently is a senior scientist at The
Pillsbury Company.

 Schaller, 58, is a 25-year veteran of Kellogg Company, where he
held numerous executive positions in technology, research, quality and
nutrition. At Kellogg, he directed the company's worldwide research
and development activities, and from 1994 to 1997, he served as senior
vice president, scientific affairs. During his career with Kellogg,
Schaller helped expand the company's research program, initiated a
standardized companywide new-product development system and introduced
the total quality management process.

 Schaller holds a doctorate in food chemistry from the University of
Wisconsin, Madison, Wis. He also was a National Research Council
post-doctoral research fellow at the University of British Columbia,
where he pioneered new techniques in applying scanning electron
microscopy to food science.

 Schaller is a member of the American Chemical Society, the
Institute of Food Technologists and the American Association of Cereal
Chemists. He is a member of the board of directors of Midwest Grain
Products, Inc., and a member of the technical advisory board of Bush
Brothers, Inc. He also was a director of the board and chair of the
research committee of the Iams Company. In addition, Schaller has served
as a member of the research committee of the American Dental
Association; chair of the research committee of the Michigan
Biotechnology Institute's board of trustees and chair of the
research committee of the Institute of Food Technologists; a member of
the University of Wisconsin College of Agriculture and Life
Sciences' board of visitors; a member of the boards of advisors of
Western Michigan University's Engineering Department and the
