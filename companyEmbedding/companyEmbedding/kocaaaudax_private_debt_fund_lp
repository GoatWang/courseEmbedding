Audax Group Closes Fifth Private Equity Fund with $2.25 Billion of 
      Commitments






November 17, 2015 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



BOSTON, NEW YORK and MENLO PARK, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Audax Group (“Audax”), a leading alternative asset management firm 
      specializing in investments in North American middle market companies, 
      today announced the successful final close of Audax Private Equity Fund 
      V at its hard cap of $2.25 billion of aggregate committed capital from a 
      select group of institutional and high-net worth limited partners. The 
      fund was oversubscribed and exceeded its fundraising target of $1.75 
      billion.
    


      Consistent with its predecessor private equity funds, Fund V will 
      continue Audax’ proven strategy of investing in middle-market companies 
      across a select group of industries and will pursue a Buy & Build 
      strategy that seeks to transform smaller companies into strategic assets.
    

      Since its founding in 1999, Audax has raised $12 billion of capital and 
      currently manages more than $9 billion through its private equity and 
      private debt businesses. The firm raises its capital from a broad mix of 
      institutional investors, including public and corporate pension funds, 
      insurance companies, endowments and foundations and high net worth 
      families, in addition to a significant commitment from the firm’s senior 
      professionals.
    

      "We appreciate the support from our existing and new investors and thank 
      them for their commitment to Audax," said Co-Chief Executive Officers, 
      Geoffrey S. Rehnert and Marc B. Wolpow. “The significant demand for our 
      fifth private equity fund underscores the capability of our team and our 
      differentiated strategy, as well as our investors’ confidence in our 
      consistent track record of delivering attractive returns. We look 
      forward to leveraging our deep industry experience to pursue and 
      capitalize on exciting investment opportunities across the lower-middle 
      market.”
