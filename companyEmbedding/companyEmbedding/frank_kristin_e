                                Report abuseTranscript of Copy of Anne FrankAnne FrankAnnelies Marie Frank was born on June 12, 1929 in Frankfurt, Germany, as the second child of Otto and Edith Frank. Anne's sister, Margot Betti Frank, was three years older.The Franks were a middle-class, liberal Jewish family whose ancestors had lived in Germany for centuries. Anne's family was forced into hiding because of the Nazis, and there she wrote in her diary that became one of the most well-known personal accounts of the Holocaust.Anne was one of the 9 million Jews that died during the Holocaust, and although she did not survive, her story did.Her style of writingHow her writing improvedAnne studied and read books while in the annex, which increased her knowledge and vocabulary that she used in her diary.She had lots of free time to think, which she took full advantage of.She had plans to write in the future, which included publishing her diary after the war ended.Anne used her diary as a way of coping with her daily experiences in the secret annex. Writing gave her the freedom to express her deep inner thoughts and emotions, making it a great tool for personal growth and development.The diary helped her mature and keep a positive outlook on her not-so-positive situation.PerspectiveOptimismDesire to learnJudaismAnne's family's beliefsThey were not very religious, and although they did belive in God, they were accpeting of all religionsAnne's personal beliefsAnne believed that having a religion, no matter which one, was good because it "kept a person on the right path."Religion wasn't simply a fear of God in herReligion becomes more and more important to her as time passes.Who is Anne?Writing/ DocumentaryInternal structureReligion"It's utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos, suffering and death. I see the world being slowly transformed into a wilderness; I hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too. I feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when I look up at the sky, I somehow feel that everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too shall end, that peace and tranquility will return once more." - Anne FrankAnne Frank’s diary has become one of the most powerful memoirs of the Holocaust. Its message of courage and hope in the face of adversity has reached millions. The diary has been translated into 75 languages with over 30 million copies sold. Anne Frank’s story is especially meaningful to young people today. For many she is their first, if not their only exposure to the history of the Holocaust.The Anne Frank HouseIn 1960, the building at Prinsengracht 263, home to the Secret Annex, opened to the public as a museum devoted to the life of Anne Frank. Her original diary is on display there.Anne's enduring legacyAnne strived to be like her father, and they had a close relationship.She didn't know much about him, but she did know that he loved her.According to Anne's diary, she felt that her father had a difficult time accepting that she was growing up, but that he was the only one that  ever tried to recognize her maturity.Otto did not really get to know Anne until he read her diary, and he was shocked to discover her intelligence and brightness. Edith Frank (Anne's mother)Anne was not near as close to her mother as she was with her father.She felt like her mother was cold and condescending, and found it impossible to talk to her.The differences in their personalities made it hard for them to get along. She has an idea of what the perfect mother should be, and "Mummy" does not fit the image. It upsets her that Mummy always takes Margot’s side, and seems to prefer her.Margot (Anne's sister)Margot was 3 years older than Anne, and was much quieter and more serious than her.Anne was often jealous of how her mother favored Margot.Anne and Margot's personalities were quite opposite which caused them to be distant growing up, but they grew closer while living in the annex.Margot had a closer relationship with her mother, and Anne was closer to her father, but despite the family differences they all still loved each other.RelationshipsHer story lives onJune 12, 1929 - March 1945Anne lived in Germany until she was 4 years old, and was unaware of political climate outside the boundaries of her rich, green backyard.After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Otto Frank fled to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and the rest of the Frank family followed, with Anne being the last of the family to arrive in February 1934 after staying with her grandparents in Aachen. In 1945 Anne started school in Amsterdam and earned a reputation as an energetic, popular girl.Anne described the cramped and stifling living conditions "prison-like."There were many personality conflicts between the eight that lived together in hidingShe lived an almost normal life and wrote that it was like she was “on vacation in a very peculiar boardinghouse."Concentration campsLiving ConditionsLife before hidingAnne's DiaryAnne was given a diary on her 13th birthday just before they went into hiding.Miep found the diary that she had hidden after their arrests and gave it to Anne's father, Otto Frank, who read it and later published it.Anne's diary allows us to experience her thoughts and emotions throughout her stay in the secret annex.The diary also helped Anne begin to understand herself as a growing individual.The psychological  importance of writingAnne has a very mature writing style that noticeably improves from her first entries to her last. Anne is very relatable because her writing is so unfailingly honest and unashamed about feelings that every adolescent experiences. Because we can relate to her, we care about her and empathize with her situation.FamilyOtto Frank (Anne's father)Relationships continuedPeter Van DaanThe 15 year old son of the Van Daan family lived in the secret annex with the Franks.Anne at first found him boring and weak, but they opened up to each other and formed a strong bond. Anne fell in love with Peter, and he probably fell in love with her in return. He gave her her first kiss. Eventually she became disappointed in Peter's weakness and lack of religion, because she still held on to her ideals despite the adversity.April 11, 1944: "God has never deserted our people. Through the ages Jews have had to suffer, but through the ages they have gone on living, and the centuries of suffering have only made them stronger. The weak shall fall and the strong shall survive and not be defeated!"Anne Frank is a heroine, a role model, a martyr and a reminder of the power and influence one individual can have. Anne Frank's life was a candle in the midst of great darkness. Her flame should burn forever.The Secret AnnexHow her living conditions differed from other victimsAfter being betrayed to the Nazis, Anne, her family, and the others living with them were arrested and deported to Nazi concentration camps. In March of 1945, nine months after she was arrested, Anne Frank died of typhus at Bergen-Belsen. She was only fifteen years old.Anne's father, Otto, was the only family member to survive.Life in the annex was better than the ghettos of Vilna, Bodzentyn, and Nagyvarad.The biggest difference between anne and the others is that she was fairly optimistic.
