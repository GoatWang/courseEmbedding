Investments carry risks, including possible loss of principal.  Additional risks may be associated with investments outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, including currency fluctuations, illiquidity, volatility, and political and economic risks.  Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies may increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Portfolios investing in bonds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds. The value of bonds will fluctuate relative to changes in interest rates, decreasing when interest rates rise.  This effect is more pronounced for longer-term bonds.  Unlike bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) may bear additional risk. Investments in lower rated and unrated bonds may be more sensitive to default, downgrades, and market volatility; these investments may also be less liquid than higher rated bonds. Investments in derivatives are subject to the risks associated with the securities or other assets underlying the pool of securities, including illiquidity and difficulty in valuation. A short position will lose value as the security's price increases. Theoretically, the loss on a short sale can be unlimited. Investments in the Funds are not FDIC insured, nor are they bank deposits or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity.

To determine a fund's Morningstar Rating™, funds and other managed products with at least a three-year history are ranked in their categories by their Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return scores. The top 10% receive 5 stars; the next 22.5%, 4 stars; the middle 35%, 3 stars; the next 22.5%, 2 stars; and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Risk-Adjusted Return accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance (excluding sales charges), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.

Thornburg Bond Funds






































A Tradition of Disciplined Bond Management


				Thornburg Investment Management was founded by Garrett Thornburg in 1982 on the belief that fixed income managers could do a better job of preserving wealth after investors account for inflation, taxes, and expenses. For more than 30 years, we have sought — via a responsible, straightforward, organic approach to bond management — to provide investors with attractive returns and relative stability of principal. 

We launched our first mutual fund in 1984 in the form of the Limited Term Municipal Fund — a laddered portfolio of municipal bonds from throughout the country. Between then and 1995, we began a series of similar actively managed laddered portfolios, both taxable and tax-free, that can serve as core components of a diversified portfolio. From the Intermediate Municipal Fund to the Limited Term Income Fund, each of these conservative funds has followed the same tested strategy since inception. With fixed-income assets totaling $17.5 billion (as of 6/30/2017), Thornburg now offers both core and strategic portfolios, which are defined by their flexibility. The Strategic Income Fund and the Strategic Municipal Income Fund both enjoy broad latitude to invest anywhere along the yield curve, anywhere along the credit spectrum, and across a variety of asset classes. 



A Conservative View of the Role of Bonds in a Portfolio

We view the role of bonds in a portfolio more conservatively than many asset managers. We don’t employ complex, exotic, and risky tactics in an effort to “juice” returns, and believe that a fixed-income position should serve as the ballast for a well-diversified portfolio, not as the sails of the ship. 



A Straightforward, Organic Investment Approach 

We seek the best relative value across a broad array of asset classes. Our strategies are typically simple and straightforward. We don’t reach for yield; we conduct rigorous credit research and invest only when the risk/reward tradeoff appears tilted decidedly in the shareholder’s favor. Whether in the flexible strategic funds or the more conservative core funds, our portfolios are run on a cash-only basis, meaning that we don’t employ leverage or complex trading tactics to try to grab return.

Thornburg’s structure as a global  manager means that each of our portfolio managers and analysts works across a broad array of geographies, sectors, asset classes, and security types, and is conducive to a free exchange of ideas in the pursuit of the best relative-value opportunities.

Investments carry risks, including possible loss of principal.  Additional risks may be associated with investments outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, including currency fluctuations, illiquidity, volatility, and political and economic risks.  Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies may increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Portfolios investing in bonds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds. The value of bonds will fluctuate relative to changes in interest rates, decreasing when interest rates rise.  This effect is more pronounced for longer-term bonds.  Unlike bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) may bear additional risk. Investments in lower rated and unrated bonds may be more sensitive to default, downgrades, and market volatility; these investments may also be less liquid than higher rated bonds. Investments in derivatives are subject to the risks associated with the securities or other assets underlying the pool of securities, including illiquidity and difficulty in valuation. A short position will lose value as the security's price increases. Theoretically, the loss on a short sale can be unlimited. Investments in the Funds are not FDIC insured, nor are they bank deposits or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity.  
Thornburg mutual funds are distributed by Thornburg Securities Corporation.
Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. mutual funds are sold through investment professionals including investment advisors, brokerage firms, bank trust departments, trust companies and certain other financial intermediaries.

Thornburg Equity Funds






































Fundamental, Bottom-Up Research


				We constantly search far and wide for the best stock ideas — within the U.S. and around the globe.  Potential investments that may deserve a deeper look are thoroughly analyzed using both quantitative and qualitative criteria. But the vast majority are discarded. Those that ultimately make it into our highly selective portfolios are continually monitored to determine whether our investment theses unfold as expected.  We know what we own, and why we own it.
			



A Stock-by-Stock View Informs Macro Perspectives

Our processes are inveterately bottom-up, informed at the security level. We reject the practice of making broad calls on the future performance of sectors, economies or interest rates, and positioning portfolios according to a particular "macro" view.  Rather, in constructing portfolios on a  security-by-security basis, we seek to ensure optimal diversification and  return characteristics. At the same time, as ideas are communicated across the  entire investment team, they facilitate the development of nuanced  macroeconomic viewpoints. But these viewpoints aren't the primary drivers  in any of the portfolios. 



Disciplined, Valuation-Focused

As disciplined, long-term investors, we  won't compromise on the rigorous, time-tested standards we follow in our portfolios. We take a broad, comprehensive view of value, which for us spans a variety of metrics designed to ascertain whether the market has appropriately priced a stock’s worth relative to the prospects we see. We tend to be strict about selling as price targets are met, investment theses break down, or more compelling opportunities arise. 




Focused Portfolios, Flexibly Managed 

Our equity portfolios are largely concentrated and diversified, aimed at achieving healthy, risk-adjusted, sustainable returns. Every position in every portfolio matters, given its meaningful individual impact on risk diversification and return. We exploit broad, but well-defined mandates  to search out the best relative-value opportunities. Our equity funds tend to look strikingly different from their benchmarks. 



Home Cooking 

We eat our own cooking. All our portfolio managers invest in the funds they manage, alongside their fellow shareholders, and manage the funds with tax efficiency in mind.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Important Information

Performance data shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than quoted.
Before investing, carefully consider the Fund’s investment goals, risks, charges, and expenses. For a prospectus or summary prospectus containing this and other information, contact your financial advisor or visit our literature center. Read them carefully before investing.
Returns are annualized for periods greater than one year.
*Performance prior to 12/30/2016 is from the predecessor fund, which was managed in a materially equivalent manner to the Thornburg Long/Short Equity Fund. The predecessor fund was not a registered mutual fund and was not subject to the same investment restrictions as the Long/Short Equity Fund. If the predecessor fund had been registered under the 1940 Act, the performance may have been different.

There is no up-front sales charge for class I shares.
Prior to inception of the equity funds' class I shares, performance is calculated from actual returns of the class A shares adjusted for the lower Institutional expenses.
The maximum sales charge for the A shares is as follows: equity funds and Strategic Income Fund: 4.50%; limited-term and low-duration bond funds: 1.50%;  Strategic Municipal Income and intermediate-term bond funds: 2.00%.
C shares include a contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) for the first year only as follows:  equity funds and Strategic Income Fund: 1% CDSC; limited-term and low-duration bond funds: 0.50%; Strategic Municipal Income and intermediate-term bond funds: 0.60% CDSC. 
There is no up-front sales charge for class D shares.
Class I shares may not be available to all investors. Minimum investments for the I share class may be higher than those for other classes.
There is no up-front sales charge for class R shares.
Class R shares are limited to retirement platforms only.
Prior to inception of the Retirement shares, the performance includes actual returns of class A Shares adjusted for class R expenses. After inception of each Retirement share class, actual class R performance was used.

Thornburg Investment Management and/or Thornburg Securities Corporation have contractually agreed to waive fees and reimburse expenses through at least April 10, 2018, for some of the share classes; these are reflected in the net expense ratio. For more detailed information on fund expenses and waivers/reimbursements, please see the fund's prospectus. 
Investments carry risks, including possible loss of principal.  Additional risks may be associated with investments outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, including currency fluctuations, illiquidity, volatility, and political and economic risks.  Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies may increase the risk of greater price fluctuations. Portfolios investing in bonds have the same interest rate, inflation, and credit risks that are associated with the underlying bonds. The value of bonds will fluctuate relative to changes in interest rates, decreasing when interest rates rise.  This effect is more pronounced for longer-term bonds.  Unlike bonds, bond funds have ongoing fees and expenses. Investments in mortgage backed securities (MBS) may bear additional risk. Investments in lower rated and unrated bonds may be more sensitive to default, downgrades, and market volatility; these investments may also be less liquid than higher rated bonds. Investments in derivatives are subject to the risks associated with the securities or other assets underlying the pool of securities, including illiquidity and difficulty in valuation. A short position will lose value as the security's price increases. Theoretically, the loss on a short sale can be unlimited. Investments in the Funds are not FDIC insured, nor are they bank deposits or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity.  
Please see our  glossary for a definition of terms.

Thornburg Investment Management, Inc. mutual funds are sold through investment professionals including investment advisors, brokerage firms, bank trust departments, trust companies and certain other financial intermediaries.
