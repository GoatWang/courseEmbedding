RISK FACTORS & DISCLAIMER


					Some of the statements on our Web Site, including those relating to projected future financial 
					performance or events, are considered forward-looking statements within the meaning of the 
					federal securities laws, specifically the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking 
					statements give our expectations or forecasts of future events. Sometimes these statements will 
					use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," 
					"outlook," "forecast," and other similar words. These statements are not guarantees of our future 
					performance and are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause 
					our actual performance to be materially different from those we project.
					
					Our actual results will be different due to the inherent nature of projections and may be better 
					or worse than projected. Given these uncertainties, you should not rely on forward-looking statements. 
					These forward-looking statements also represent our estimates and assumptions only as of the date that 
					they initially were made. We expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to any forward-looking 
					statements, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, to reflect events or circumstances 
					or changes in expectations or the occurrence of anticipated events after the date they initially were made.
					
					In addition to the factors set forth in our filings with the OTC, the following factors could 
					affect the forward- looking statements: the ability to achieve or quantify savings for our
				   customers; the ability to obtain, or the timing of obtaining, future government awards and contracts; 
				   the availability of government funding and customer requirements; changes in government priorities 
				   due to program reviews or revisions to strategic objectives; difficulties in developing and 
				   producing operationally advanced technology systems; the competitive environment; economic, business 
				   and political conditions domestically and internationally; the timing and customer acceptance of our
					proposals; the outcome of contingencies, including litigation, environmental 
				   remediation, program performance, and completion of any acquisitions and divestitures. These are only 
				   some of the numerous factors, which may affect the forward-looking statements contained on our Web Site.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., Aug. 11, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- STL Marketing Group, Inc. (the "Company") (OTC: STLK) has signed a non-binding Letter of Intent with KINETOS ("KINETOS"), a developer of high end software products. Under the terms of the Letter of Intent, STLK would promote, distribute and sell KINETOS products in the United States, and other markets as agreed to over time. 
"We are pleased to have executed this Letter of Intent with KINETOS. The companies are working diligently on the definitive agreement. KINETOS has developed a hybrid product suite that is high end and very intelligent. While there are challenges with new software applications, there is also great opportunity and we hope that this high end, high revenue product suite will be a success for the Company and for our partners," said Jose P. Quiros, the Chief Executive Officer of STL Marketing Group, Inc.
About STL Marketing Group, Inc./ Versant CorporationVersant Corporation is a subsidiary of STL Marketing Group, Inc. and a Colorado based renewable energy company seeking to develop and operate renewable energy projects. Its first proposed stage of development is focused on wind energy facilities in Costa Rica. For more information on STLK, please visit our web site at www.stlkgroup.com or www.v3rsant.com. 
About KINETOSKinetos' core product is an automated real time communications system driven by a smart flow algorithm with enhanced CRM like functions that automatically assist the client Company's efforts to maintain a close intelligent relationship with the customer. This solution is both automated and scalable and includes push to text, email, call scheduling, mobile app push messages and full interaction etc. based on a Company's business and processes. Kinetos' smart flow follow-up system can be implemented in combination with the analytics product, integrated to other applications, or as a stand-alone. Kinetos also has some more "main stream" products ranging from Automated Campaign Managers, IVRs, Banking Call Logging, Contact Centers or Debt Collection Systems.
In addition to this core product, Kinetos has developed disruptive new software that integrates its existing products with a new world-class, cutting edge and powerful Big Data algorithm based on machine learning. This combined suite of product sorts through a Company's own metadata and predicts with very high accuracy, for instance, the cancellation of a service by an existing customer, and then takes proactive "intelligent" action through Kinetos' follow up system. Existing KINETOS' customers include large regional banks and government entities in Central America.
This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements concerning plan, objectives, goals, strategies, future events or performance, and underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical facts. These statements are subject to uncertainties and risks including, but not limited to, product and service demand and acceptance, changes in technology, economic conditions, the impact of competition and pricing, government regulation, and other risks described in statements filed from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All such forward-looking statements whether written or oral, and whether made by or on behalf of the Company, are expressly qualified by the cautionary statements that may accompany the forward-looking statements. In addition, the Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof.

Description:
STL Marketing Group, Inc., the "Company", has several business operations it is developing. The Company"s initial focus- renewable energy- is currently on hold (please see below) due to government delays in Costa Rica. In the interim, the Company is focusing on other areas such as PhoneSuite Solutions, Kinetos software products and F3TCH. PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc.  PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc. ("PSS"), as the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Strategic Alliance and Distribution Agreement with Call Management Products, Inc. ("CMP"), a Colorado corporation in the business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling telecommunications products. We are currently working on some master contracts CMP has received from major hotel chains, establishing new dealers as per our agreement, and pursuing sales leads. Kinetos The Company entered into a Letter of Intent with a software developer, Kinetos, S.A.. The Company is exploring a variety of approaches to the US market for Kinetos? products. Kinetos is a software developer that has been in business for several decades and has a long list of clients in Central America for its goods and services. The parties have agreed to attempt to complete a definitive agreement by year-end. Kinetos core product is an automated real time communications system driven by a smart flow algorithm with enhanced CRM like functions that automatically assist the client company's efforts to maintain a close intelligent relationship with the customer. This solution is both automated and scalable and includes push to text, email, call scheduling, mobile app push messages and full interaction, etc. based on a company?s business and processes. In addition to this core product, Kinetos has developed disruptive new software that integrates its existing products with a new and powerful Big Data algorithm based on machine learning. This combined suite of product sorts through a company's own metadata and predicts with very high accuracy, for instance, the cancellation of a service by an existing customer, and then takes proactive "intelligent" action through Kinetos follow up system. In short, the software can predict when a customer is going to cancel a service (e.g. cellular service) well before they do and give the service provider an opportunity to retain said customer. F3TCH (Hotel "App") On November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a binding Letter of Intent with Camposagrado, Inc. to exclusively license and commercialize Camposagrado's patent pending Application or "App" to the worldwide hospitality industry. This Application, trademarked as F3TCH, migrates the hotel guest room telephone to a user?s smart device, including their smartphone or tablet, and will allow the guest to utilize their own smart device as their point of contact within the hotel?s communications platform during their stay at a "F3TCH compatible" hotel. The Company believes that this Application has a strong potential for revenue generation and plans to launch this product in the first half of 2016. This Letter of Intent, as well as any subsequent agreement, is a related party transaction (please see the Notes section of the third quarter 2015 10Q for more information). Renewable Energy (Costa Rica) As of December 2015, there has been no movement from the Costa Rican government elected last year to allow any new private generation projects. The ?hold? on any new private generation fields for the proposed "study" is still in place with little hope of a fast resolution. This industry wide hold affects all companies, not just us. Please see our filings with the SEC if you need additional information.

Stl Marketing Group, Inc. (PC) Description



STL Marketing Group, Inc., the "Company", has several business operations it is developing. The Company"s initial focus- renewable energy- is currently on hold (please see below) due to government delays in Costa Rica. In the interim, the Company is focusing on other areas such as PhoneSuite Solutions, Kinetos software products and F3TCH. PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc.  PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc. ("PSS"), as the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a Strategic Alliance and Distribution Agreement with Call Management Products, Inc. ("CMP"), a Colorado corporation in the business of designing, manufacturing, marketing, and selling telecommunications products. We are currently working on some master contracts CMP has received from major hotel chains, establishing new dealers as per our agreement, and pursuing sales leads. Kinetos The Company entered into a Letter of Intent with a software developer, Kinetos, S.A.. The Company is exploring a variety of approaches to the US market for Kinetos? products. Kinetos is a software developer that has been in business for several decades and has a long list of clients in Central America for its goods and services. The parties have agreed to attempt to complete a definitive agreement by year-end. Kinetos core product is an automated real time communications system driven by a smart flow algorithm with enhanced CRM like functions that automatically assist the client company's efforts to maintain a close intelligent relationship with the customer. This solution is both automated and scalable and includes push to text, email, call scheduling, mobile app push messages and full interaction, etc. based on a company?s business and processes. In addition to this core product, Kinetos has developed disruptive new software that integrates its existing products with a new and powerful Big Data algorithm based on machine learning. This combined suite of product sorts through a company's own metadata and predicts with very high accuracy, for instance, the cancellation of a service by an existing customer, and then takes proactive "intelligent" action through Kinetos follow up system. In short, the software can predict when a customer is going to cancel a service (e.g. cellular service) well before they do and give the service provider an opportunity to retain said customer. F3TCH (Hotel "App") On November 3, 2015, the Company entered into a binding Letter of Intent with Camposagrado, Inc. to exclusively license and commercialize Camposagrado's patent pending Application or "App" to the worldwide hospitality industry. This Application, trademarked as F3TCH, migrates the hotel guest room telephone to a user?s smart device, including their smartphone or tablet, and will allow the guest to utilize their own smart device as their point of contact within the hotel?s communications platform during their stay at a "F3TCH compatible" hotel. The Company believes that this Application has a strong potential for revenue generation and plans to launch this product in the first half of 2016. This Letter of Intent, as well as any subsequent agreement, is a related party transaction (please see the Notes section of the third quarter 2015 10Q for more information). Renewable Energy (Costa Rica) As of December 2015, there has been no movement from the Costa Rican government elected last year to allow any new private generation projects. The ?hold? on any new private generation fields for the proposed "study" is still in place with little hope of a fast resolution. This industry wide hold affects all companies, not just us. Please see our filings with the SEC if you need additional information.

   STL Marketing Group, INC           Latest Share Structure  http://www.otcmarkets.com/stock/STLK/profile           Versant Corporation is dedicated to providing clean, sustainable and renewable energy  profitably and with minimal environmental impact.    http://v3dls.com/   http://phonesuitesolutions.com/         CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS  10 Boulder Crescent, Suite 102  Colorado Springs, CO 80903  United States of America  Tel. +1-719-219-5797  Fax. +1-719-302-0632   COSTA RICA OFFICE  Edificio Las Terrazas A, 5o Piso  Plaza Roble, Guachieplin, Escazu  San Jose, Costa Rica  Tel. +506-2505-5840  Fax. +506-2505-5601   SITE  15 km East of the city of La Cruz, Guanacaste  on the North side of Route 4 Del Oro, S.A     Business Description     Energy Energia Renovable Versant SRL (ERV), the Company?s wholly owned subsidiary, a Costa Rican SRL corporation, is developing a wind farm in northern Guanacaste, Costa Rica through its wholly owned operating subsidiary VTRES BACHE SRL. ERV has negotiated a long-term land lease agreement and conducted a series of studies including environmental and Annual Energy Production Reports.  Based on the Company?s studies, we believe the site has an excellent location and terrain for a well-designed wind farm. The site has public road access, mostly flat terrain, and studies indicate it is a proven wind resource. The site comprises over 5,300 contiguous hectares (over 13,000 acres) in area. The first stage is expected to be a 37.5 MW development, whose off-taker is anticipated to be a Costa Rican public utilities provider. The Company intends to produce and sell all of the electricity generated at its power plant to the off-taker through a long-term Power Purchase Agreement.  Telecommunications PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc., the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, has the exclusive distribution rights for the PhoneSuite brand of products for the SMB market in the United States and the worldwide rights outside the US and Canada for the same. The Company is actively promoting, selling and establishing dealer channels for this well established brand by Call Management Products, Inc. dba PhoneSuite. Call Management Products, Inc. is a separate legal entity with no relation to PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc.      WIND STUDIES  The Company can generate approximately 135,000,000 kWh per year (P75). The Company has moved the site slightly to the north (approximately 5 km) to gain access to the interconnection lines.   Benefits:  - Large enough to increase capacity (5,300 hectares of land).  - The land is level and generally flat.  - The SIEPAC regional (Central America) grid traverses through the property. This allows us to transport electricity to the power grid and to our final customers.   COMPETITION:  If we are successful in signing the PPA, we will have no competition for the wind energy generated by our anticipated wind farm. This is not to say that Costa Rica does not have other wind farms or sources of renewable energy but rather that once the wind park is completed, the sales will be guaranteed for the term of the PPA, which is currently proposed as twenty-five (25) years. Once the PPA is signed as our contract covers our entire production and the Off-Taker is committed to buying this electricity over the term. Additionally, each government utility in Costa Rica (our customer) has exclusive territory to its client base by law.   FUNDING (Export-Import Bank):  The Company received a letter of interest (the “Letter of Interest”) from the Export-Import Bank of the United States (“Ex-Im”) for $60,000,000.  The Company has raised over $1,600,000 in the last two fiscalyears and is currently seeking an additional $10,000,000 in equity financing. If the Company is able to raise such capital, it is anticipated that Ex-Im can provide up to approximately $57,000,000 in additional debt financing. This is more than the Company expects that it will need, but provides additional security in case of delays and cost overruns.   WIND TURBINE MANUFACTURER:  The Company has already decided, as required by the Ex Im, to hire the wind turbine manufacturer (e.g.- General Electric, Vestas etc) to handle the Operations & Management of the wind park in building it.    Annual Average (20 Years):  INCOME: $12,660,000  OPERATION COSTS: $4,885,000  EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization): $7,810,000  TAXABLE INCOME: $2,850,000   NET FREE CASH FLOW: $3,000,000 / 12 = $250,000 (Monthly Average)   GE WIND TURBINE FOR V3-BACHE:  1.6-100 and 1.7-100 Wind Turbines (ONSHORE)  http://www.ge-energy.com/products_and_services/products/wind_turbines/ge_1.6_100_1.7_100_wind_turbine.jsp          $STLK charts      Company information  Company name: STL Marketing Group, Inc.

Signs Strategic Alliance & Distribution Agreement with Call  			Management Products, Inc. (PhoneSuite)           			March 18, 2015 ( PhoneSuite ), not to be confused with our PhoneSuite Solutions subsidiary, recently signed a Global Master Services agreement with Hilton Hotels. This is good for us as we can now receive support from Hilton for Hilton branded properties overseas (our territory) as we market and promote the product line to their properties. We will provide a more formal statement as soon as Call Management formally announces their deal.       			COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., June 27, 2014/PRNewswire/ -- PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc. (the "Company"), a wholly owned subsidiary of STLMarketing Group, Inc. (OTC: STLK), has signed a Strategic Alliance & Distribution Agreement with Call Management Products, Inc. ("CMP"), a Coloradotechnology company.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company will promote, distribute and sell CMP's products in markets not currently served by CMP, namely the international market, as well as to the Small BusinessMarket (SMB) in North America. "This is a significant milestone for our Company.  This business fits in perfectly with our strategy to enhance our ability to generate revenue, as we work on the longer-term prospects in our overall business plan.  We are pleased to be working with people we know and respect in this field.  This opportunity is substantial, taking into consideration the size of the worldwide market in communications equipment, as well as CMP's experience, technology and existing brand endorsement from major hotel chains.  PhoneSuite has over 4,000 hotel installations in North America and we look to grow that installed base with our efforts in both the SMB and overseas markets.  Developing these two significant markets will take time, however we expect to begin adding dealers to the network soonest, following with sales thereafter," said Jose P. Quiros, the President & Chief Executive Officer of PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc./STL Marketing Group, Inc. "The international distribution experience represented within STL Marketing Group, Inc. in our own hospitality telephone system market is unsurpassed.  They are a natural partner for us moving forward with expansion to international markets with the Voiceware® product line.  Add to that their vision for expanding Voiceware's powerful business voice side into the U.S. SMB market, and you get a fantastic two-for-one partner.  We are extremely excited about the business relationship PhoneSuite and STL Marketing Group, Inc. begin to forge with this agreement," said Frank Melville, President of PhoneSuite. About PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc./STL Marketing Group, Inc. PhoneSuite Solutions, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of STL Marketing Group, Inc., is a distribution company developing the international market and the Small Business Market (SMB) in North America for CMP's PhoneSuite brands.
