January 20, 2011 06:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



OAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--The Board of Trustees of Mills 
      College, the oldest women’s college in the West, has elected Alecia 
      A. DeCoudreaux as the 13th president in the College’s 159-year 
      history. DeCoudreaux was selected from a field of candidates 
      representing a diversity of backgrounds and accomplishments in a 
      comprehensive national search. DeCoudreaux will assume leadership of 
      Mills College on July 1, 2011.
    


      DeCoudreaux brings to the Office of Mills College President an extensive 
      and distinguished professional background. A senior executive at Eli 
      Lilly and Company, one of Fortune magazine’s “Global Top 
      Companies for Leaders,” she has served in a variety of important 
      executive leadership roles over the span of the last three decades. 
      DeCoudreaux is also the chair of the Board of Trustees at Wellesley 
      College, one of the top women’s colleges in the United States. Her 
      career represents more than 30 years’ experience as a corporate leader, 
      women’s advocate, fundraiser, and community volunteer. DeCoudreaux is 
      herself a product of women’s education, having graduated from Wellesley 
      College in 1976.
    

      “We are extremely pleased to announce Alecia DeCoudreaux as the 13th 
      president of Mills College,” said Kathleen 
      J. Burke, chair of the Mills Board of Trustees. “Her multifaceted 
      background, passion for women’s education, and ability to lead 
      strategically embody the ideal mix of talent and vision to carry the 
      Mills College mission into the future. DeCoudreaux’s commitment to 
      women’s education is clear. She’s demonstrated it with years of 
      advocacy, community involvement, fundraising, alumnae support, coaching, 
      and mentorship. Her skill and leadership will be tremendous assets to 
      our academic culture and will be invaluable to the future growth and 
      success of Mills College.”
    

Demonstrated Leadership Experience


      Over the span of her more than three-decade career, DeCoudreaux has 
      developed a leadership style marked by strategic thinking, collaborative 
      leadership, and accountability. In her numerous roles at Eli Lilly and 
      Company both inside and outside its legal department, DeCoudreaux has 
      worked as a tireless consensus builder, earning the respect of her 
      colleagues and peers. Her impressive professional career is buttressed 
      by extensive involvement in the communities where she has lived and 
      worked, including community activism, volunteer work, and a record of 
      service on numerous charitable and nonprofit boards. DeCoudreaux’s 
      academic experience includes successful terms as director of the Indiana 
      University Foundation and director of the Wellesley College Alumnae 
      Association. DeCoudreaux is currently trustee and board chair at 
      Wellesley College. She will step down from the board chair role prior to 
      beginning her tenure at Mills, but plans to continue to serve as a 
      Wellesley trustee.
    

      “It is with great honor that I accept the position of president of Mills 
      College,” said Alecia DeCoudreaux. “It has been my stated long-term 
      ambition to fill a leadership role in women’s education. I’m proud of 
      the career I’ve led up until now, and I’ve certainly developed the 
      professional and life skills necessary to fulfill the position of Mills 
      College president. But ever since my college years at Wellesley, I’ve 
      maintained my passion for women’s education. I’m ready now to follow my 
      passion and that passion is what carries me into the academic world.”
    

      As both a graduate of a women’s college and as a trustee and chair of 
      the Board of Wellesley, one of the largest and most selective women’s 
      college in the nation, DeCoudreaux provides an extensive professional 
      background which will offer Mills a unique perspective to advance the 
      College in the future.
    

Personal History


      Born in Chicago, Illinois, DeCoudreaux received a bachelor of arts 
      degree in English and political science from Wellesley College in 1976 
      and a doctor of laws degree from the Indiana University School of Law at 
      Bloomington in 1978. Throughout her career, from private practice 
      attorney to a leadership role in a multinational company, DeCoudreaux 
      has demonstrated the core values that Mills sought during its search for 
      candidates. While achieving professional success, she has demonstrated 
      creativity, social responsibility, and community involvement. 
      DeCoudreaux has also shown acumen for budget management, fundraising, 
      and alumnae relations and engagement. In addition to her position on the 
      Wellesley Board, she has served on the boards for the Indiana University 
      Foundation, the Indiana University School of Law Board of Visitors, the 
      Economic Club of Indiana, the Women’s Fund, and the United Way of 
      America Women’s Leadership Council.
    

      “I’m looking forward to working with the faculty, staff, and alumnae of 
      Mills, whose reputation for passion and creativity is well known and 
      highly regarded,” said DeCoudreaux. “I’m also looking forward to leading 
      our diverse student body of bright young women and graduate students 
      pursuing their advanced degrees. I am so honored to be a part of such a 
      highly regarded institution with such a proud history. I will work hard 
      to ensure my leadership builds on the success of the 12 great women and 
      men who held this office before me. My first order of business as I plan 
      our vision for the future is to listen to those around me.”
    

DeCoudreaux Succeeds Holmgren


      DeCoudreaux will succeed current Mills President Janet L. Holmgren who 
      began her 20-year presidency in 1991, one year after the historic strike 
      that kept Mills a women’s college at the undergraduate level. Holmgren 
      was charged with leading the College during this watershed moment in the 
      College’s history and tasked with building Mills into a financially 
      sound institution focused on women’s education in the 21st century.
    

      “Alecia DeCoudreaux’s distinguished professional career along with her 
      commitment to the liberal arts and educational access offer a strong 
      basis for the role of academic leader,” said Mills College President 
      Janet L. Holmgren. “I am pleased to support her as she joins the Mills 
      team to move the College forward as a national leader among independent 
      liberal arts colleges."
    

      President Holmgren has advanced Mills as a nationally recognized model 
      for women’s higher education. Under her leadership, Mills has welcomed 
      students from increasingly diverse backgrounds; achieved record-breaking 
      enrollment; enhanced academic excellence with innovative programs, 
      including the College’s first doctoral degree; invested in campus 
      facilities, including two new environmentally sustainable buildings; and 
      strengthened the endowment.
    

      “Alecia DeCoudreaux’s passion for women’s education and issues facing 
      women as well as her direct and deep experience in the management of a 
      women’s college ensure that Mills’ new president will continue to build 
      on President Holmgren’s 20-year legacy of success,” said Kathleen J. 
      Burke. “We’re grateful to Janet Holmgren for her many successful years 
      of service to Mills College. We’re certain our new president will build 
      on Mills’ reputation as a strong, proud women’s college and as a leader 
      among independent liberal arts colleges.”
