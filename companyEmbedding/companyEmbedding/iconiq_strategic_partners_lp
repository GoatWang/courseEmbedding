A Longtime TCV Partner Resurfaces with a New Fund: Iconiq Strategic Partners

Continue reading on PE HUB
 writes: 


















 


Will Griffith, a venture capitalist who spent a dozen years with Technology Crossover Ventures beginning in 2000, appears to be launching his own San Francisco-based venture firm. According to a new SEC filing, his new fund is called Iconiq Strategic Partners.
The filing does not list a target amount or the names of any other individuals involved in the effort. It does state that no broker-dealer is being used and that the first sale has yet to occur.
Fortune reported in January 2012 that Griffith had left TCV, where he became a general partner in 2003 and worked with a long list of companies, including 2Wire, Adknowledge, MoneyExpert, Orbitz, Tiny Prints, Travelport and Whitepages.
Before joining TCV, Griffith – a Bay Area native who attended Dartmouth before nabbing his MBA at Stanford — was an associate at the Beacon Group, a private equity firm that was acquired by JP Morgan Chase in 1999. Before the Beacon Group, Griffith was an investment banking analyst at Morgan Stanley. 





Iconiq doesn’t yet appear to have a Web presence. It’s also not clear whether or not Griffith’s new endeavor has any ties to Iconiq Capital, a San Francisco-based registered investment advisor that was formed in December 2011 by three colleagues who spun out of Morgan Stanley’s private client group together — and who famously count among their clients Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg.
While Griffith was reportedly involved in a late-stage investment made by TCV in Facebook, none of Iconiq Capital’s three principals are listed among his 400-plus Facebook “friends.”
Neither Griffith nor Divesh Makan, one of Iconiq Capital’s founding partners, has responded to requests for further information.
