	Supplement dated March 28, 2005 to the
	Prospectus dated May 1, 2004





	for the Pacific Value, Pacific Innovations
	Select, Pacific Portfolios, Pacific Portfolios






	for Bank One, Pacific One Select, Pacific
	Odyssey, Pacific Innovations, Pacific One,






	Pacific Select Variable Annuity and Pacific
	Select Variable Annuity II






	variable annuity contracts issued by Pacific
	Life Insurance Company





	Capitalized terms used in this supplement are
	defined in the Prospectus referred to above unless otherwise
	defined herein. We, us, or
	our refer to Pacific Life Insurance Company;
	you or your refer to the Contract Owner.
	For more complete information on the portfolios of Pacific
	Select Fund, including a discussion of each portfolios
	investment techniques and the risks associated with its
	investments, see the accompanying preliminary prospectus. You
	should read the Prospectus carefully.





	Substitution of the Equity Income
	Portfolio





	The Pacific Select Funds Board of Trustees
	approved the substitution of shares of the American Funds
	Growth-Income Portfolio for shares of the Equity Income
	Portfolio. Pacific Select Fund and Pacific Life Insurance
	Company (Pacific Life) will file an application for
	an order of approval of the substitution with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission (SEC). We will notify you of the
	effective date of the substitution (the substitution
	date) set by Pacific Select Fund once the SEC issues the
	order to permit the substitution.



	If the SEC issues an order to permit the
	substitution, the Pacific Select Fund will select a substitution
	date for shares of the Equity Income Portfolio to be
	automatically redeemed and shares of the American Funds
	Growth-Income Portfolio to be automatically purchased. At the
	same time, subaccount units and subaccount annuity units of the
	Equity Income variable account will be automatically exchanged
	for units of the American Funds Growth-Income variable account.
	The Equity Income Portfolio and corresponding Equity Income
	variable accounts will cease to exist.



	On the substitution date, unless you instruct us
	otherwise, any outstanding instruction you have on file with us
	that designates the Equity Income Investment Option, will be
	deemed an instruction for the American Funds Growth-Income
	Investment Option. This includes, but is not limited to,
	instructions for purchase payment allocations, transfer
	instructions (including instructions under any systematic
	transfer, portfolio rebalancing, DCA Plus, earnings sweep or
	dollar cost averaging programs, if applicable), and partial
	withdrawals.



	You need not take any action regarding the
	substitution. The transfer of assets in the Equity Income
	variable account in exchange for units of equal value of the
	American Funds Growth-Income variable account will occur
	automatically on the substitution date.



	If you do not wish to participate in the
	substitution, unless the SEC requires otherwise, the following
	will apply. You will have a 60 day free
	transfer period (which will not begin later than
	30 days before the substitution date). During this
	free transfer period, the first unscheduled
	transfer, and any systematic transfer, from the Equity Income
	Investment Option (and if required by the SEC, the American
	Funds Growth-Income Investment Option after the substitution
	date) will not count towards:













	 



	




	the transfer limitations described in the
	Prospectus, or





	 



	




	any transfer fees that may be assessed in the
	future.






	We do not currently assess transfer fees, but we
	reserve the right to do so, as stated in the Prospectus, in the
	future. We will notify you of your transfer rights at the same
	time we announce the substitution date.







	 





	The changes described below are effective
	May 1, 2005.






	The following Variable Investment Options
	will be added:













	 



	American Funds Growth-Income





	 



	American Funds Growth





	 



	VN Small-Cap Value





	 




	 



	For more complete information on each of the
	three underlying portfolios, including a discussion of the
	portfolios investment techniques, risks associated with
	its investments, charges and expenses, see the accompanying
	preliminary prospectus for the portfolios. No assurance can be
	given that a portfolio will achieve its investment objective.
	You should read the preliminary prospectus carefully. The
	information in the preliminary prospectus for the portfolios is
	not complete and may be changed, and a registration statement
	for the shares of the portfolios has been filed with the SEC,
	and those shares may not be sold until that registration
	statement is effective. The preliminary prospectus is not an
	offer to sell the shares of the portfolios.








	The names of the Aggressive Equity
	Investment Option and Portfolio will be changed
	to:






	Fasciano Small Equity






	The following Portfolios will have new
	Portfolio Managers:






	Equity
	Portfolio



	  Capital Guardian
	Trust Company




	Technology
	Portfolio



	  Columbia
	Management Advisors, Inc.

	Portfolio



	  Jennison
	Associates LLC





	Fasciano Small Equity
	Portfolio



	  Neuberger Berman
	Management Inc.





	(formerly called Aggressive Equity)







	AN OVERVIEW
	OF . . . 

	is amended as
	follows:








	The Fund Annual Operating Expenses
	subsection is replaced with the following:





	This table shows the range (minimum and maximum)
	of fees and expenses charged by any of the Portfolios, expressed
	as a percentage of average daily net assets, for the year ended
	December 31, 2004, adjusted to reflect anticipated fees and
	expenses of new Portfolios.



	Each Variable Account of the Separate Account
	purchases shares of the corresponding Fund Portfolio at net
	asset value. The net asset value reflects the investment
	advisory fees and other expenses that are deducted from the
	assets of the Portfolio. The advisory fees and other expenses
	are not fixed or specified under the terms of the Contract, and
	they may vary from year to year. These fees and expenses are
	described in the Funds Prospectus.








	 




	 




	 




	 




	 




	 




	 




	 




	 







	Total Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses

	1









	Minimum








	Maximum







	Expenses that are deducted from the Funds
	assets, including advisory fees,

	12b-1 distribution expenses and other expenses




	 




	 




	0.29%




	 




	 




	 




	1.63%




	 









	1



	 To help
	limit Pacific Select Fund expenses, Pacific Life has
	contractually agreed to waive all or part of its investment
	advisory fees or otherwise reimburse each Portfolio of Pacific
	Select Fund, except the American Funds Growth-Income Portfolio,
	for operating expenses (including organizational expenses, but
	not including advisory fees, 12b-1 distribution expenses,
	additional costs associated with foreign investing, interest
	(including commitment fees), taxes, brokerage commissions and
	other transactional expenses, extraordinary expenses such as
	litigation expenses, expenses not incurred in the ordinary
	course of business, and expenses of counsel or other persons or
	services retained by the Funds independent trustees) that
	exceed an annual rate of 0.10% of its average daily net assets.
	Such waiver or reimbursement is subject to repayment to Pacific
	Life, for a period of time as permitted under regulatory and/or
	accounting standards (currently three years), to the extent such
	expenses fall below the 0.10% expense cap in future years. Any
	amounts repaid to Pacific Life







	 




	will have the effect of increasing such expenses
	of the Portfolio, but not above the 0.10% expense cap. There is
	no guarantee that Pacific Life will continue to cap expenses
	after April 30, 2006. Until May 1, 2007, or if
	earlier, such time as the American Funds Growth-Income and
	American Funds Growth Portfolios no longer invest substantially
	all of their assets in a master fund, Pacific Life will limit
	its total investment advisory fee to 0.36% for each Portfolio.
	Also, in the case of the American Funds Growth-Income Portfolio,
	Pacific Life has contractually agreed to waive all or part of
	its investment advisory fees or otherwise reimburse the
	portfolio for its ordinary operating expenses including the
	proportionate share of the net fees and expenses of the master
	fund that exceed the annual rate of 1.01% of its average daily
	net assets until April 30, 2006. Additionally if the SEC
	issues an order to permit the substitution of the Equity Income
	Portfolio with the American Funds Growth-Income Portfolio, the
	guarantee period shall include the two year period beginning on
	the effective date of the substitution, unless otherwise
	required.




	Effective May 1, 2005, Pacific Select Fund
	entered into an Advisory Fee Reduction Program
	(Program), which may lower the advisory fee paid to
	Pacific Life under the investment advisory agreement. Pursuant
	to this Program, Pacific Life has agreed to waive 0.00125% of
	its advisory fee for the period from May 1, 2005 through
	April 30, 2006. This reduction is not reflected in the
	chart above. See the Pacific Select Fund Prospectus for
	details on fees and expenses of the Fund and on the Program.





	The Examples section is amended as
	follows:





	The Examples illustrated in your Prospectus or in
	any supplement thereto, are amended to reflect the above
	referenced changes in the Total Annual Pacific Select
	Fund Operating Expenses. The Maximum values currently
	illustrated in the Examples for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 Year
	periods will

	increase

	by no more than, $34, $94, $157,
	and $319, respectively. The Minimum values currently illustrated
	in the Examples for the 1, 3, 5 and 10 Year periods
	will

	decrease

	by no more than $1, $3, $5, and $12,
	respectively.

History[edit]
Pacific Mutual Life was founded in 1868 by former California Governor Leland Stanford in Sacramento, California. Stanford also was the first policy holder of the company. After Stanford died and his university (Stanford University) was strapped for money, his wife used the money from the policy to pay for professors. Starting in 1885, Pacific Mutual Life began issuing accident insurance, which was an innovative move for a life insurance company at the time. In 1906, Pacific Mutual Life merged with Conservative Life, a Los Angeles-based life insurance company. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pacific Mutual Life's board of directors moved the company to Los Angeles.
During the Great Depression, the company was hit with hard times and in 1936 in an effort to save both the policy holders and the company the insurance commissioner, Samuel L. Carpenter, encouraged the policy holders to become part owners of the company through mutualization. In 1955, Pacific Mutual Life became the first company west of the Mississippi River to use the brand new technology of Univac I. At Pacific Mutual Life's one-hundredth birthday the company celebrated with keynote speaker Ronald Reagan. In 1971, the company started Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). The company moved its headquarters to their current Newport Beach, California location in 1972 when management decided that Newport Beach would provide a higher standard of living for their families. In 1997, the company dropped mutual from its name, changing it to Pacific Life Insurance Company. This reflects the company structure's change from a mutual ownership to a mutual holding company structure. Also in 1997, the company adopted the humpback whale as symbol of the company because of the whale's persistence, performance, and strength.[1]
On May 30, 2007, Pacific Asset Management was created. Pacific Asset Management offers advisory services and institutional fixed income management. Pacific Asset Management focuses on credit oriented fixed income. Pacific Asset Management's investment team manages bank loans, high yield corporate bonds, investment grade bonds and money market securities. Pacific Asset Management provides their clients the ability to invest with an entrepreneurial, boutique investment group focused on fundamental credit analysis and supported by the scale and infrastructure of Pacific Life. Pacific Asset Management currently manage registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as well as separate accounts.
The Pacific Life Foundation was established in 1984 and is headquartered in Newport Beach, CA. At year-end 2011, the Foundation's trust principal was approximately $63.5 million. In 2011, $5.5 million was contributed to over 400 agencies in the areas of health and human services; civic, community, and environment; education; and arts and culture[2] and $5.6 million is committed through 2012.[3]

History[edit]
Pacific Mutual Life was founded in 1868 by former California Governor Leland Stanford in Sacramento, California. Stanford also was the first policy holder of the company. After Stanford died and his university (Stanford University) was strapped for money, his wife used the money from the policy to pay for professors. Starting in 1885, Pacific Mutual Life began issuing accident insurance, which was an innovative move for a life insurance company at the time. In 1906, Pacific Mutual Life merged with Conservative Life, a Los Angeles-based life insurance company. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pacific Mutual Life's board of directors moved the company to Los Angeles.
During the Great Depression, the company was hit with hard times and in 1936 in an effort to save both the policy holders and the company the insurance commissioner, Samuel L. Carpenter, encouraged the policy holders to become part owners of the company through mutualization. In 1955, Pacific Mutual Life became the first company west of the Mississippi River to use the brand new technology of Univac I. At Pacific Mutual Life's one-hundredth birthday the company celebrated with keynote speaker Ronald Reagan. In 1971, the company started Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). The company moved its headquarters to their current Newport Beach, California location in 1972 when management decided that Newport Beach would provide a higher standard of living for their families. In 1997, the company dropped mutual from its name, changing it to Pacific Life Insurance Company. This reflects the company structure's change from a mutual ownership to a mutual holding company structure. Also in 1997, the company adopted the humpback whale as symbol of the company because of the whale's persistence, performance, and strength.[1]
On May 30, 2007, Pacific Asset Management was created. Pacific Asset Management offers advisory services and institutional fixed income management. Pacific Asset Management focuses on credit oriented fixed income. Pacific Asset Management's investment team manages bank loans, high yield corporate bonds, investment grade bonds and money market securities. Pacific Asset Management provides their clients the ability to invest with an entrepreneurial, boutique investment group focused on fundamental credit analysis and supported by the scale and infrastructure of Pacific Life. Pacific Asset Management currently manage registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as well as separate accounts.
The Pacific Life Foundation was established in 1984 and is headquartered in Newport Beach, CA. At year-end 2011, the Foundation's trust principal was approximately $63.5 million. In 2011, $5.5 million was contributed to over 400 agencies in the areas of health and human services; civic, community, and environment; education; and arts and culture[2] and $5.6 million is committed through 2012.[3]

After Stanford died and his university (Stanford University) was strapped for money, his wife used the money from the policy to pay for professors. Starting in 1885, Pacific Mutual Life began issuing accident insurance, which was an innovative move for a life insurance company at the time. In 1906, Pacific Mutual Life merged with Conservative Life, a Los Angeles-based life insurance company. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pacific Mutual Life's board of directors moved the company to Los Angeles.
During the Great Depression, the company was hit with hard times and in 1936 in an effort to save both the policy holders and the company the insurance commissioner, Samuel L. Carpenter, encouraged the policy holders to become part owners of the company through mutualization. In 1955, Pacific Mutual Life became the first company west of the Mississippi River to use the brand new technology of Univac I. At Pacific Mutual Life's one-hundredth birthday the company celebrated with keynote speaker Ronald Reagan. In 1971, the company started Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). The company moved its headquarters to their current Newport Beach, California location in 1972 when management decided that Newport Beach would provide a higher standard of living for their families. In 1997, the company dropped mutual from its name, changing it to Pacific Life Insurance Company. This reflects the company structure's change from a mutual ownership to a mutual holding company structure. Also in 1997, the company adopted the humpback whale as symbol of the company because of the whale's persistence, performance, and strength.[1]
On May 30, 2007, Pacific Asset Management was created. Pacific Asset Management offers advisory services and institutional fixed income management. Pacific Asset Management focuses on credit oriented fixed income. Pacific Asset Management's investment team manages bank loans, high yield corporate bonds, investment grade bonds and money market securities. Pacific Asset Management provides their clients the ability to invest with an entrepreneurial, boutique investment group focused on fundamental credit analysis and supported by the scale and infrastructure of Pacific Life. Pacific Asset Management currently manage registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as well as separate accounts.
The Pacific Life Foundation was established in 1984 and is headquartered in Newport Beach, CA. At year-end 2011, the Foundation's trust principal was approximately $63.5 million. In 2011, $5.5 million was contributed to over 400 agencies in the areas of health and human services; civic, community, and environment; education; and arts and culture[2] and $5.6 million is committed through 2012.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Pacific Mutual Life was founded in 1868 by former California Governor Leland Stanford in Sacramento, California. Stanford also was the first policy holder of the company. After Stanford died and his university (Stanford University) was strapped for money, his wife used the money from the policy to pay for professors. Starting in 1885, Pacific Mutual Life began issuing accident insurance, which was an innovative move for a life insurance company at the time. In 1906, Pacific Mutual Life merged with Conservative Life, a Los Angeles-based life insurance company. Following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, Pacific Mutual Life's board of directors moved the company to Los Angeles.
During the Great Depression, the company was hit with hard times and in 1936 in an effort to save both the policy holders and the company the insurance commissioner, Samuel L. Carpenter, encouraged the policy holders to become part owners of the company through mutualization. In 1955, Pacific Mutual Life became the first company west of the Mississippi River to use the brand new technology of Univac I. At Pacific Mutual Life's one-hundredth birthday the company celebrated with keynote speaker Ronald Reagan. In 1971, the company started Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO). The company moved its headquarters to their current Newport Beach, California location in 1972 when management decided that Newport Beach would provide a higher standard of living for their families. In 1997, the company dropped mutual from its name, changing it to Pacific Life Insurance Company. This reflects the company structure's change from a mutual ownership to a mutual holding company structure. Also in 1997, the company adopted the humpback whale as symbol of the company because of the whale's persistence, performance, and strength.[1]
On May 30, 2007, Pacific Asset Management was created. Pacific Asset Management offers advisory services and institutional fixed income management. Pacific Asset Management focuses on credit oriented fixed income. Pacific Asset Management's investment team manages bank loans, high yield corporate bonds, investment grade bonds and money market securities. Pacific Asset Management provides their clients the ability to invest with an entrepreneurial, boutique investment group focused on fundamental credit analysis and supported by the scale and infrastructure of Pacific Life. Pacific Asset Management currently manage registered investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as well as separate accounts.
The Pacific Life Foundation was established in 1984 and is headquartered in Newport Beach, CA. At year-end 2011, the Foundation's trust principal was approximately $63.5 million. In 2011, $5.5 million was contributed to over 400 agencies in the areas of health and human services; civic, community, and environment; education; and arts and culture[2] and $5.6 million is committed through 2012.[3]

When to Use

 
Plan Status
Reason
 

Fully Funded Plan
Ensures the plan remains fully funded under all market conditions.
Underfunded Plan
Enables implementation of a predictable and budgeted contribution strategy to fund the shortfall.

Alternatively, facilitates implementation of a dynamic asset allocation strategy for plans choosing to retain some equity risk exposure to help “earn their way” to full funding.

Either way, Pacific Insured LDI reduces the risk of dropping below certain target funding levels that could result in benefit limitations or employee notifications.
Frozen Plan
Interim de-risking solution until plan is ready to terminate and distribute assets.
Active Plan
Ongoing de-risking solution for plans not yet seeking to terminate.
Collective Bargained Plan
 Ease collective bargaining negotiations by achieving more predictable future pension costs.

AN OVERVIEW OF PACIFIC SELECT
VARIABLE ANNUITY II 




This overview tells you some key
things you should know about your Contract. It’s designed
as a summary only – please read this Prospectus, your
Contract and the Statement of Additional Information (SAI) for
more detailed information.






Certain Contract features described
in this Prospectus may vary or may not be available in your
state. The state in which your Contract is issued governs
whether or not certain features, Riders, charges or fees are
allowed or will vary under your Contract. These variations are
reflected in your Contract and in Riders or Endorsements to your
Contract. The terms of your Contract and of any Rider or
Endorsement prevail over what is in this Prospectus. See your
Registered Representative or contact us for specific information
that may be applicable to your state.






In this Prospectus, you and
your mean the Contract Owner or Policyholder. Pacific
Life, we, us and our refer to Pacific Life Insurance
Company. Contract means a Pacific Select Variable
Annuity II variable annuity contract, unless we state
otherwise.






Some of the Terms used in this
Prospectus may be new to you. You will find a glossary of
certain terms in the TERMS USED IN THIS PROSPECTUS
section.




Pacific Select Variable
Annuity II Basics

An annuity contract may be appropriate if
you’re looking for retirement income or you want to meet
other long-term financial objectives. Discuss with your
qualified investment professional whether a variable annuity,
optional benefits and underlying Investment Options are
appropriate for you, taking into consideration your age, income,
net worth, tax status, insurance needs, financial objectives,
investment goals, liquidity needs, time horizon, risk tolerance
and other relevant information. Together you can decide if a
variable annuity is right for you. 

This Contract may not be the right one for you
if you need to withdraw money for short-term needs, because
withdrawal charges and tax penalties for early withdrawal may
apply. 

You should consider the Contract’s
investment and income benefits, as well as its costs. 

Pacific Select Variable Annuity II is an
annuity contract between you and Pacific Life Insurance Company.
Annuity contracts have two phases, the accumulation phase and
the annuitization (income) phase. The two phases are discussed
below.




This Contract is designed for long-term financial
planning. It allows you to invest money on a tax-deferred basis
for retirement or other goals, and/or to receive income in a
variety of ways, including a series of income payments for life
or for a specified period of years.




Non-Qualified and Qualified Contracts are
available. You buy a Non-Qualified Contract with
“after-tax” dollars. You buy a Qualified Contract
under a qualified retirement or pension plan, or some form of an
individual retirement annuity or account (IRA). It’s
important to know that IRAs and qualified plans are already
tax-deferred which means the tax deferral feature of a variable
annuity does not provide a benefit in addition to that already
offered by an IRA or qualified plan. An annuity contract should
only be used to fund an IRA or qualified plan to benefit from
the annuity’s features other than tax deferral.


Pacific Select Variable Annuity II is a
variable annuity, which means that the value of your Contract
fluctuates depending on the performance of the Investment
Options you choose. The Contract allows you to choose how often
you make Investments (“Purchase Payments”) and how
much you add each time.


Your Right to Cancel (“Free
Look”)



During the Free Look period, you have the right
to cancel your Contract and return it with instructions to us or
to your registered representative for a refund. The amount
refunded may be more or less than the Investments you’ve
made, depending on the state where you signed your application
and the type of Contract you buy.






You will find more information about the Right
to Cancel (“Free Look”) period starting on
page 32.

AN OVERVIEW OF PACIFIC SELECT
VARIABLE ANNUITY II 

The Accumulation
Phase

The Investment Options you choose and how they
perform will affect the value of your Contract during the
accumulation phase, as well as the amount available to annuitize
on the Annuity Date. 

The accumulation phase begins on your Contract
Date and continues until your Annuity Date. During the
accumulation phase, you can put money in your Contract by making
Investments, and choose Investment Options in which to allocate
them. You can also take money out of your Contract by making a
withdrawal.


Investments (“Purchase
Payments”)



Your initial Investment must be at least $5,000
for a Non-Qualified Contract and at least $2,000 for a Qualified
Contract. Additional Investments must be at least $100 for a
Non-Qualified Contract and $50 for a Qualified Contract. We also
call your Investments “Purchase Payments”.






You will find more information about Making
Your Investments (“Purchase Payments”) starting on
page 11.




Investment Options



You can ask your registered representative to
help you choose the right Investment Options for your goals and
risk tolerance. Any financial firm or registered representative
you engage to provide advice and/or make transfers for you is
not acting on our behalf. We are not responsible for any
investment decisions or allocations you make, recommendations
such financial representatives make or any allocations or
specific transfers they choose to make on your behalf.






You can choose from a variety of Variable
Investment Options (also called Subaccounts), each of which
invests in a corresponding Portfolio of the Pacific Select Fund,
AllianceBernstein Variable Products Series Fund, Inc., BlackRock
Variable Series Funds, Inc. or Franklin Templeton Variable
Insurance Products Trust. The value of each Portfolio will
fluctuate with the value of the investments it holds, and
returns are not guaranteed.




You can also choose any available fixed option
that earns a guaranteed rate of interest of at least 3% annually.


We allocate your Investments to the Investment
Options you choose. The value of your Contract will fluctuate
during the accumulation phase depending on the Investment
Options you’ve chosen. You bear the investment risk of any
Variable Investment Options you choose.




You will find more information about the
Investment Options and the Investment Advisers starting on
page 9.




Transferring among Investment
Options



You can transfer among Investment Options any
time, subject to certain limitations, until your Annuity Date
without paying any current income tax. Transfers are limited to
25 for each calendar year. Only 2 transfers per month may
involve the International Value, International Small-Cap,
International Large-Cap or Emerging Markets Investment Options.
In addition, only 2 transfers into or out of the American Funds
Growth or American Funds Growth-Income Investment Options may
occur in any calendar month. If you have used all
25 transfers in a calendar year, you may make one
additional transfer of all or a portion of your Variable Account
Value to the Money Market Investment Option before the start of
the next calendar year. You can also make systematic transfers
by enrolling in our dollar cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing
or earnings sweep programs. Transfers made under these
systematic transfer programs or under an asset allocation
program established and maintained by us are excluded from the
limitation. Some restrictions may apply to transfers to or from
any fixed option.






You will find more information about transfers
and transfer limitations starting on page 18.



Withdrawals

You can make full and partial withdrawals to
supplement your income or for other purposes. You can withdraw a
certain amount each year without paying a withdrawal charge, but
any amount withdrawn in excess of this amount may incur a
withdrawal charge on Investments that are less than 6 years old.
Some restrictions may apply to making partial withdrawals from
any fixed option.




In general, you may have to pay income taxes on
withdrawals or other distributions from your Contract. If
you’re under age 59 1/2, a 10% federal tax penalty may also
apply to taxable withdrawals.

Table of Contents



You will find more information about
withdrawals starting on page 30.



The Income
Phase

The income phase of your Contract begins on your
Annuity Date. Generally, you can choose to surrender your
Contract and receive a single payment or you can annuitize your
Contract and receive a series of income payments over a fixed
period or for life.


You can choose fixed or variable annuity
payments, or a combination of both. Variable annuity payments
may not be available in all states. You can choose monthly,
quarterly, semi-annual or annual payments. We’ll make the
income payments to your designated payee. The Owner is
responsible for any tax consequences of any annuity payments.




If you choose variable annuity payments, the
amount of the payments will fluctuate depending on the
performance of the Variable Investment Options you choose. After
your Annuity Date, if you choose variable annuity payments, you
can exchange your Subaccount Annuity Units among the Variable
Investment Options up to 4 times in any 12-month period.






You will find more information about
annuitization starting on page 23 and annuity options
available under the Contract starting page 25.



The Death
Benefit



Generally, the Contract provides a death benefit
upon the first death of an Owner or the death of the sole
surviving Annuitant, whichever occurs first, during the
accumulation phase. Death benefit proceeds are payable when we
receive proof of death and payment instructions in proper form.
To whom we pay a death benefit, and how we calculate the amount
of the death benefit depends on who dies first and the type of
Contract you own.






You will find more information about the death
benefit starting on page 26.

Table of Contents

Total Annual Fund
Operating Expenses



You will find more about the underlying Funds
starting on page 9, and in each underlying Fund Prospectus which
accompanies this Prospectus.






This table shows the minimum and maximum total
annual operating expenses paid by the Portfolios that you
indirectly pay during the time you own the Contract. This table
shows the range (minimum and maximum) of fees and expenses paid
by any of the Portfolios, expressed as an annual percentage of
average daily net assets. The amounts are based on expenses paid
in the year ended December 31, 2007, adjusted to reflect
anticipated changes in fees and expenses, or, for new
Portfolios, are based on estimates for the current fiscal year.






Each Variable Account of the Separate Account
purchases shares of the corresponding Funds’ Portfolio at
net asset value. The net asset value reflects the investment
advisory fees and other expenses that are deducted from the
assets of the Portfolio. The advisory fees and other expenses
are not fixed or specified under the terms of the Contract, and
they may vary from year to year. These fees and expenses are
described in each Fund Prospectus.

  Select Fund, has contractually agreed to reduce its investment
  advisory fees or otherwise reimburse certain Portfolios of the
  Pacific Select Fund which may reduce the expenses reflected
  above. See the Fees and Expenses section of the Pacific
  Select Fund prospectus for complete information regarding annual
  fund operating expenses.

Examples



The following examples are intended to help you
compare the cost of investing in your Contract with the cost of
investing in other variable annuity contracts. The maximum
amounts reflected below include the periodic Contract expenses,
Separate Account annual expenses and the Portfolio with the
highest fees and expenses for the year ended December 31,
2007. The minimum amounts reflected below include the periodic
Contract expenses, Separate Account annual expenses and the
Portfolio with the lowest fees and expenses for the year ended
December 31, 2007.






The examples assume that you invest $10,000 in
the Contract for the time periods indicated. They also assume
that your Investment has a 5% return each year and assumes the
maximum and minimum fees and expenses of all of the Investment
Options available. Although your actual costs may be higher or
lower, based on these assumptions, your maximum and minimum
costs would be:

The Investment Adviser






Pacific Life Fund Advisors LLC (PLFA) is the
investment adviser for the Pacific Select Fund. PLFA and the
Pacific Select Fund’s Board of Trustees oversee the
management of all the Pacific Select Fund’s portfolios.
PLFA, a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company, also does
business under the name “Pacific Asset Management”
(PAM) and manages the Pacific Select Fund’s Money Market
and High Yield Bond portfolios under the PAM name.







Your Fixed Option

The fixed option offers you a guaranteed minimum
interest rate on amounts that you allocate to this option.
Amounts you allocate to this option, and your earnings credited
are held in our General Account. For more detailed information
about this option, see THE GENERAL ACCOUNT section in
this Prospectus.





PURCHASING YOUR CONTRACT




How to Apply for Your Contract



To purchase a Contract, you must work with your
registered representative to fill out an application and submit
it along with your initial Investment to Pacific Life Insurance
Company at P.O. Box 2290, Omaha, Nebraska 68103-2290. Your
registered representative’s broker-dealer firm has up to
7 business days to review and approve your application
before the application is sent to us. In those instances when we
receive electronic transmission of the information on the
application from your representative’s broker-dealer firm
and our administrative procedures with your broker-dealer so
provide, we consider the application to be received on the
Business Day we receive the transmission. If the address on your
Contract specification pages is different and our administrative
procedures with your broker-dealer so provide, in those
instances when information regarding your Investment is
electronically transmitted to us by the broker-dealer, we will
consider the Investment to be received by us on the Business Day
we receive the transmission of the information. If your
application and Investment are complete when received, or once
they have become complete, we will issue your Contract within
2 Business Days. If some information is missing from your
application, we may delay issuing your Contract while we obtain
the missing information. However, we will not hold your initial
Investment for more than 5 Business Days without your
permission. In any case, we will not hold your initial
Investment after 20 Business Days.




You may also purchase a Contract by exchanging
your existing annuity. You must submit all contracts to be
exchanged when you submit your application. Call your
registered representative, or call us at 1-800-722-4448.
Registered Representatives may call us at 1-800-722-2333.


We reserve the right to reject any application or
Investment for any reason, subject to any applicable
nondiscrimination laws and to our own standards and guidelines.
On your application, you must provide us with a valid U.S. tax
identification number for federal and state tax reporting
purposes.




The maximum age of a Contract Owner/Annuitant,
including Joint and Contingent Owners/Annuitants, for which a
Contract will be issued is 85. The Contract Owner’s age is
calculated as of his or her last birthday. If any Contract Owner
or any sole Annuitant named in the application for a Contract
dies and we are notified of the death before we issue the
Contract, then we will return the amount we received. If we are
not notified of the death and we issue the Contract, then the
application for the Contract and/or any Contract issued will be
deemed cancelled and a refund will be issued. Depending on the
state where your application was signed, the amount of the
refund may be more or less than the initial Investment received,
or any other Investment we received in connection with an
exchange or transfer. In most states, the refund will be the
Contract Value based upon the next determined Accumulated Unit
Value (AUV) after we receive proof of death, in proper form, of
the Contract Owner or Annuitant, plus a refund of any amount
used to pay premium taxes and/or any other taxes. If there are
Joint Owners named on the Contract, the Contract will be owned
as Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship and not as Tenants
in Common. Any refund may subject the refunded assets to probate.







Making Your Investments (“Purchase
Payments”)

Making Your Initial Investment

Your initial Investment must be at least $5,000
if you are buying a Non-Qualified Contract, and at least $2,000
if you are buying a Qualified Contract. Currently, we are not
enforcing the minimum initial Investment on Qualified Contracts
but we reserve the right to enforce the minimum initial
Investment on Qualified Contracts in the future. For
Non-Qualified Contracts, if the entire minimum initial
Investment is not included when you submit your application, you
must submit a portion of the

 

11




Table of Contents








required Contract minimum and/or establish a
pre-authorized checking plan (PAC). A PAC allows you to pay the
remainder of the required initial Investment in equal
installments over the first year. Further requirements for PAC
are discussed in the PAC form. We also call each Investment you
make a Purchase Payment.




You must obtain our consent before making an
initial or additional Investment that will bring your aggregate
Investments over $1,000,000. As of July 23, 2004, if you
allocate all or part of an additional Purchase Payment to the
Fixed Option, the maximum aggregate Investment you may have in
the Fixed Option is currently $250,000. This limitation is
subject to change at any time. Ask your registered
representative about current limitations.


Making Additional Investments



You may choose to invest additional amounts in
your Contract at any time. If your Contract is Qualified, the
method of contribution and contribution limits may be restricted
by the Qualified Plan or the Internal Revenue Code (“the
Code”). Each additional Investment must be at least $100
for Non-Qualified Contracts and $50 for Qualified Contracts.
Currently, we are not enforcing the minimum additional
Investment amounts but we reserve the right to enforce the
minimum additional Investment amounts in the future. In certain
states additional Investments are limited.




Forms of Investment

Your initial and additional Investments may be
sent by personal or bank check or by wire transfer. Investments
must be made in a form acceptable to us before we can process
it. Acceptable forms of Investments are:









 
• 

personal checks or cashier’s checks drawn on
  a U.S. bank,
  


 


 
• 

money orders and traveler’s checks in single
  denominations of more than $10,000 if they originate in a
  U.S. bank,
  


 




 
• 

third party payments when there is a clear
  connection of the third party to the underlying transaction, and
  




 


 
• 

wire transfers that originate in U.S. banks.
  



We will not accept Investments in the following
forms:









 
• 

cash,
  


 


 
• 

credit cards or checks drawn against a credit
  card account,
  


 




 
• 

money orders or traveler’s checks in single
  denominations of $10,000 or less,
  




 


 
• 

cashier’s checks, money orders,
  traveler’s checks or personal checks drawn on
  non-U.S. banks, even if the payment may be effected through
  a U.S. bank,
  


 




 
• 

third party payments if there is not a clear
  connection of the third party to the underlying transaction, and
  




 


 
• 

wire transfers that originate from foreign bank
  accounts.
  



All unacceptable forms of Investments will be
returned to the payor along with a letter of explanation. We
reserve the right to reject or accept any form of payment. If
you make Investments by check other than a cashier’s check,
your payment of any withdrawal proceeds and any refund during
the “Right to Cancel” period may be delayed until we
receive confirmation in our Annuities administrative office that
your check has cleared.





HOW YOUR INVESTMENTS ARE ALLOCATED




Choosing Your Investment Options



You may allocate your Investments among any of
the available Investment Options. Allocations of your initial
Investment to the Investment Options you selected will be
effective on your Contract Date. Each additional Investment will
be allocated to the Investment Options according to your
allocation instructions in your application, or most recent
instructions, if any, subject to the terms described in the
WITHDRAWALS— Right to Cancel (“Free Look”)
section in this Prospectus. We reserve the right to require that
your allocation to any particular Investment Option must be at
least $500. We also reserve the right to transfer any remaining
Account Value that is not at least $500 to your other Investment
Options on a pro rata basis relative to your most recent
allocation instructions.

If your Contract is issued in exchange for
another annuity contract or a life insurance policy, our
administrative procedures may vary depending on the state in
which your Contract is delivered.





Portfolio Optimization

The Service.
Portfolio Optimization is an asset allocation service that is
offered at no additional charge for use within this variable
annuity. Asset allocation refers to the manner that investments
are distributed among asset classes to help attain an investment
goal. For your variable annuity, Portfolio Optimization can help
with decisions about how you should allocate your Contract Value
among available Investment Options. The theory behind Portfolio
Optimization is that diversification among asset classes can
help reduce volatility over the long term.




As part of the Portfolio Optimization service,
several asset allocation models have been developed
(“Portfolio Optimization Models” or
“Models”), each based on different profiles of an
investor’s willingness to accept investment risk. If you
decide to subscribe to the Portfolio Optimization service and
select one of the Portfolio Optimization Models, your initial
Purchase Payment (in the case of a new application) or Contract
Value, as applicable, will be allocated to the Investment
Options according to the Model you select. Subsequent Purchase
Payments, if allowed under your Contract, will also be allocated
accordingly, unless you instruct us otherwise. If you choose,
you can rebalance your Contract Value quarterly, semi-annually,
or annually, to maintain the current allocations of your
Portfolio Optimization Model, since changes in the net asset
values of the underlying Portfolios within each Model will alter
your asset allocation over time. If you also allocate part of
your Purchase Payment or Contract Value that is not currently
included in your Model and you elect periodic rebalancing, such
amounts will not be considered when rebalancing. If you
subscribe to Portfolio Optimization and elect periodic
rebalancing, only the Investment Options within your Model will
be rebalanced.




If you subscribe to Portfolio Optimization,
Pacific Life Fund Advisors LLC (Adviser), a subsidiary of
Pacific Life, will serve as your investment adviser for the
service solely for purposes of development of the Portfolio
Optimization Models and periodic updates of the Models.


On a periodic basis (typically annually), the
Portfolio Optimization Models are evaluated and the Models are
updated, as discussed below. If you subscribe to Portfolio
Optimization, your Contract Value or subsequent Purchase
Payments, as applicable, will automatically be reallocated in
accordance with the Model you select as it is updated from time
to time based on discretionary authority that you grant to the
Adviser, unless you instruct otherwise. For more information on
the role of the investment adviser for the Portfolio
Optimization service, please see the brochure from the
Adviser’s Form ADV, the SEC investment adviser
registration form, which will be delivered to Contract Owners at
the time they apply for a Contract. Please contact us if you
would like to receive a copy of this brochure. In developing and
periodically updating the Portfolio Optimization Models, the
Adviser currently relies on the recommendations of an
independent third-party analytical firm. The Adviser may change
the firm that it uses from time to time, or, to the extent
permissible under applicable law, use no independent firm at all.


The Portfolio Optimization
Models. Five asset allocation models
are offered, each comprised of a carefully selected combination
of Investment Options (reflecting the underlying Portfolios of
Pacific Select Fund). Development of the Portfolio Optimization
models is a multi-step process. First, an optimization analysis
is performed to determine the breakdown of asset classes.
Optimization analysis requires forecasting returns, standard
deviations and correlation coefficients of asset classes over
the desired investing horizon and an analysis using a
state-of-the art program and a statistical analytical technique
known as “mean-variance optimization”. Next, after the
asset class exposures are known, a determination is made of how
available Investment Options (underlying Portfolios) can be used
to implement the asset class level allocations. The Investment
Options are selected by evaluating the asset classes represented
by the underlying Portfolios and combining Investment Options to
arrive at the desired asset class exposures. The
Portfolio-specific analysis uses historical returns-based style
analysis and asset performance and regression and attribution
analyses. It may also include portfolio manager interviews.
Based on this analysis, Investment Options are selected in a way
intended to optimize potential returns for each Model, given a
particular level of risk tolerance. This process could, in some
cases, result in the inclusion of an Investment Option in a
Model based on its specific asset class exposure or other
specific optimization factors, even where another Investment
Option may have better historical performance.


Periodic Updates of the Portfolio Optimization
Model and Notices of Updates. Each of
the Portfolio Optimization Models are evaluated periodically
(generally, annually) to assess whether the combination of
Investment Options within each Model should be changed to better
seek to optimize the potential return for the level of risk
tolerance intended for the Model. As a result of the periodic
analysis, each Model may change and Investment Options may be
added to a Model (including Investment Options not currently
available), or Investment Options may be deleted from a Model.

Table of Contents







When your Portfolio Optimization Model is
updated, your Contract Value (and Subsequent Purchase Payments,
if applicable) will automatically be reallocated in accordance
with any changes to the Model you have selected. This means the
allocation of your Contract Value, and potentially the
Investment Options in which you are invested, will automatically
change and your Contract Value (and Subsequent Purchase
Payments, if applicable) will automatically be reallocated among
the Investment Options in your updated Model (independently of
any automatic rebalancing you may have selected). The Adviser
requires that you grant it discretionary investment authority to
periodically reallocate your Contract Value (and Subsequent
Purchase Payments, if applicable) in accordance with the updated
version of the Portfolio Optimization Model you have selected,
if you wish to participate in Portfolio Optimization.




When the Adviser updates the Portfolio
Optimizations Models, a written notice of the updated Models
will be sent to participants at least 30 days in advance of
the date the Adviser intends the updated version of the Model to
be effective. You should carefully review these notices. If you
wish to accept the changes in your selected Model, you will not
need to take any action, as your Contract Value (or Subsequent
Purchase Payments, if applicable) will automatically be
reallocated in accordance with the updated Model. If you do not
wish to accept the changes to your selected Model, you can
change to a different Model or withdraw from the Portfolio
Optimization service.




Selecting a Portfolio Optimization
Model. If you choose to subscribe to
the Portfolio Optimization service, you need to determine which
Portfolio Optimization Model is best for you. Neither the
Adviser nor its affiliates will make this decision. You should
consult with your registered representative on this decision.
Your registered representative can help you determine which
Model is best suited to your financial needs, investment time
horizon, and willingness to accept investment risk. You should
periodically review these factors with your registered
representative to determine if you should change Models to keep
up with changes in your personal circumstances. Your registered
representative can assist you in completing the proper forms to
subscribe to the Portfolio Optimization service or to change to
a different Model. You may, in consultation with your registered
representative, utilize analytical tools made available by the
Adviser, including an investor profile questionnaire, which asks
questions intended to help you or your registered representative
assess your financial needs, investment time horizon, and
willingness to accept investment risk. Your responses can be
analyzed using the service available on our website. While the
information from our website may assist you, it is your
decision, in consultation with your registered representative,
to select a Model or to change to a different Model, and the
Adviser and its affiliates bear no responsibility for this
decision. You may change to a different Model at any time,
subject to transfer and market timing restrictions, with a
proper written request or by telephone or electronic
instructions provided a valid telephone/electronic authorization
is on file with us.


Periodic Reports.
Participants in the Portfolio Optimization service will
periodically be sent performance information regarding the
Investment Options within a selected Model. This information may
also be accessed online. Information concerning the current
Models is described below.


Risks. Although the
Models are designed to optimize returns given the various levels
of risk, there is no assurance that a Model portfolio will not
lose money or that investment results will not experience
volatility. Investment performance of your Contract Value could
be better or worse by participating in a Portfolio Optimization
Model than if you had not participated. A Model may perform
better or worse than any single Investment Option or asset class
or other combinations of Investment Options or asset classes.
Model performance is dependent upon the performance of the
component Investment Options (and their underlying Portfolios).
The timing of your investment and the frequency of automatic
rebalancing may affect performance. Your Contract Value will
fluctuate, and when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the
original cost.


A Portfolio Optimization Model may not perform as
intended. Although the Models are intended to optimize returns
given various levels of risk tolerance, portfolio, market and
asset class performance may differ in the future from the
historical performance and assumptions upon which the Models are
based, which could cause the Models to be ineffective or less
effective in reducing volatility.


Periodic updating of the Portfolio Optimization
Models can cause the underlying Portfolios to incur
transactional expenses to raise cash for money flowing out of
the Portfolios or to buy securities with money flowing into the
Portfolios. These expenses can adversely affect performance of
the pertinent Portfolios and the Models.




The Adviser may be subject to competing interests
that have the potential to influence its decision making with
regard to Portfolio Optimization. For example, one Portfolio may
provide a higher advisory fee to the Adviser than another
Portfolio, and provide the Adviser with incentive to use the
Portfolio with the higher fee as part of a Portfolio
Optimization Model. In addition, the Adviser may believe that
certain Portfolios may benefit from additional assets or could
be harmed by redemptions. As adviser to Pacific Select Fund, the
Adviser monitors the Portfolios, and may, from time to time,
recommend to the Pacific Select Fund’s Board of Trustees a
change in portfolio management firm or strategy or the closure
or merger of a Portfolio, all of which could impact a Model. All
Pacific Select Fund Portfolios, except those expected to be
liquidated or



 



14






Table of Contents








merged, are analyzed by the independent third
party analytical firm. The third party analytical firm
determines the number of Portfolios in a Model, the percent that
any Portfolio represents in a Model, and which Portfolios may be
selected. The Adviser will work with the analytical firm to
resolve any investment related matters derived from the
analytical firm’s recommendations. The Adviser believes
that its reliance on the recommendations of an independent
third-party analytical firm to develop and update the Models (as
described above) reduces or eliminates the potential for the
Adviser to be influenced by these competing interests, but there
can be no assurance of this.




The Adviser and its affiliates are under no
contractual obligation to continue this service and have the
right to terminate or change the Portfolio Optimization service
at any time.

Investing in Variable Investment
Options

Each time you allocate your Investment to a
Variable Investment Option, your Contract is credited with a
number of “Subaccount Units” in that Subaccount. The
number of Subaccount Units credited is equal to the amount you
have allocated to that Subaccount, divided by the “Unit
Value” of one Unit of that Subaccount.








 

Example: You allocate $600 to the Inflation
  Managed Subaccount. At the end of the Business Day on which your
  allocation is effective, the value of one Unit in the Inflation
  Managed Subaccount is $15. As a result, 40 Subaccount Units
  are credited to your Contract for your $600 ($600/$15 = 40).
  



Your Variable Account Value Will
Change

After we credit your Contract with Subaccount
Units, the value of those Units will usually fluctuate. This
means that, from time to time, your Investment allocated to the
Variable Investment Options may be worth more or less than the
original Investments to which those amounts can be attributed.
Fluctuations in Subaccount Unit Value will not change the number
of Units credited to your Contract.


Subaccount Unit Values will vary in accordance
with the investment performance of the corresponding Portfolio.
For example, the value of Units in the Managed Bond Subaccount
will change to reflect the performance of the Managed Bond
Portfolio (including that Portfolio’s investment income,
its capital gains and losses, and its expenses). Subaccount Unit
Values are also adjusted to reflect the Administrative Fee and
applicable Risk Charge imposed on the Separate Account.


We calculate the value of all Subaccount Units on
each Business Day.


Calculating Subaccount Unit Values

We calculate the Unit Value of the Subaccount
Units in each Variable Investment Option at the close of the New
York Stock Exchange which usually closes at 4:00 p.m.
Eastern Time on each Business Day. At the end of each Business
Day, the Unit Value for a Subaccount is equal to:


Y × Z




 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where
  

 

(Y)
  
 

=
  
 

the Unit Value for that Subaccount as of the end
  of the preceding Business Day; and
  


 
 

(Z)
  
 

=
  
 

the Net Investment Factor for that Subaccount for
  the period (a “valuation period”) between that
  Business Day and the immediately preceding Business Day.
  




The “Net Investment Factor” for a
Subaccount for any valuation period is equal to:


(A ÷ B) - C




 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where
  

 

(A)
  
 

=
  
 

the “per share value of the assets” of
  that Subaccount as of the end of that valuation period, which is
  equal to: a+b+c
  






 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where
  

 

(a)
  
 

=
  
 

the net asset value per share of the
  corresponding Portfolio shares held by that Subaccount as of the
  end of that valuation period;
  


 
 

(b)
  
 

=
  
 

the per share amount of any dividend or capital
  gain distributions made by each Fund for that Portfolio during
  that valuation period; and
  


 
 

(c)
  
 

=
  
 

any per share charge (a negative number) or
  credit (a positive number) for any income taxes and/or any other
  taxes or other amounts set aside during that valuation period as
  a reserve for any income and/or any other taxes which we
  determine to have resulted from the operations of the Subaccount
  or Contract, and/or any taxes attributable, directly or
  indirectly, to Investments;
  






 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 

(B)
  
 

=
  
 

the net asset value per share of the
  corresponding Portfolio shares held by the Subaccount as of the
  end of the preceding valuation period; and
  


 
 

(C)
  
 

=
  
 

a factor that assesses against the Subaccount net
  assets for each calendar day in the valuation period the basic
  Risk Charge plus any applicable increase in the Risk Charge and
  the Administrative Fee (see the CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS
  section in this Prospectus).

Table of Contents








When Your Investment is Effective

Your initial Investment is effective on the day
we issue your Contract. Any additional Investment is effective
on the day we receive it in proper form. See the ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION— Inquiries and Submitting Forms and
Requests section in this Prospectus.


The day your Investment is effective determines
the Unit Value at which Subaccount Units are attributed to your
Contract. In the case of transfers or withdrawals, the effective
day determines the Unit Value at which affected Subaccount Units
are debited and/or credited under your Contract. That Unit Value
is the value of the Subaccount Units next calculated after your
transaction is effective. Your Variable Account Value begins to
reflect the investment performance results of your new
allocations on the day after your transaction is effective.


Transfers and Market–timing
Restrictions




Transfers 



Transfers are allowed 30 days after the
Contract Date. Currently, we are not enforcing this restriction
but we reserve the right to enforce it in the future. Once your
Investments are allocated to the Investment Options you
selected, you may transfer your Account Value less Loan Account
Value from any Investment Option to any other Investment Option.
Transfers are limited to 25 for each calendar year. Only
2 transfers in any calendar month may involve any of the
following Investment Options: International Value, International
Small-Cap, International Large-Cap, or Emerging Markets. In
addition, only 2 transfers into or out of the American
Funds Growth or American Funds Growth-Income Investment Options
may occur in any calendar month.




Transfers to or from a Variable Investment Option
cannot be made before the seventh calendar day following the
last transfer to or from the same Variable Investment Option. If
the seventh calendar day is not a Business Day, then a transfer
may not occur until the next Business Day. The day of the last
transfer is not considered a calendar day for purposes of
meeting this requirement. For example, if you make a transfer
into the Diversified Research Variable Investment Option on
Monday, you may not make any transfers to or from that Variable
Investment Option before the following Monday. Transfers to or
from the Money Market Variable Investment Option are excluded
from this limitation.




For the purpose of applying the limitations,
multiple transfers that occur on the same day are considered
1 transfer. A transfer of Account Value from the Loan
Account back into your Investment Options following a loan
repayment is not considered a transfer under these limitations.
Transfers that occur as a result of the dollar cost averaging
program, the portfolio rebalancing program, the earnings sweep
program, approved corporate owned life insurance policy
rebalancing programs or an approved asset allocation service are
excluded from these limitations. Also, allocations of Purchase
Payments are not subject to these limitations.






If you have used all 25 transfers available
to you in a calendar year, you may no longer make transfers
between the Investment Options until the start of the next
calendar year. However, you may make 1 transfer of all or a
portion of the Account Value remaining in the Variable
Investment Options into the Money Market Investment Option prior
to the start of the next calendar year.




There are no exceptions to the above transfer
limitations in the absence of an error by us, a substitution of
Investment Options, or reorganization of underlying Portfolios,
or other extraordinary circumstances.


If we deny a transfer request, we will notify
your registered representative via telephone. If you (or your
registered representative) request a transfer via telephone that
exceeds the above limitations, we will notify you (or your
registered representative) immediately.


Certain restrictions apply to any available fixed
option. See THE GENERAL ACCOUNT section in this
Prospectus. Transfer requests are generally effective on the
Business Day we receive them in proper form, unless you request
a date in the future or a systematic transfer program.


We have the right, at our option (unless
otherwise required by law), to require certain minimums in the
future in connection with transfers. These may include a minimum
transfer amount and a minimum Account Value, if any, for the
Investment Option from which the transfer is made or to which
the transfer is made. If your transfer request results in your
having a remaining Account Value in an Investment Option that is
less than $500 immediately after such transfer, we may transfer
that Account Value to your other Investment Options on a pro
rata basis, relative to your most recent allocation instructions.


We reserve the right (unless otherwise required
by law) to limit the size of transfers, to restrict transfers,
to require that you submit any transfer requests in writing, to
suspend transfers, and to impose further limits on the number
and frequency of

 

18




Table of Contents






transfers you can make. We also reserve the right
to reject any transfer request. Any policy we may establish with
regard to the exercise of any of these rights will be applied
uniformly to all Contract Owners.




Market-timing Restrictions

The Contract is not designed to serve as a
vehicle for frequent trading in response to short-term
fluctuations in the market. Accordingly, organizations or
individuals that use market-timing investment strategies and
make frequent transfers should not purchase the Contract. Such
frequent trading can disrupt management of the underlying
Portfolios and raise expenses. The transfer limitations set
forth above are intended to reduce frequent trading. In
addition, we monitor certain large transaction activity in an
attempt to detect trading that may be disruptive to the
Portfolios. In the event transfer activity is found to be
disruptive, certain future transactions by such Contract Owners,
or by a registered representative or other party acting on
behalf of one or more Contract Owners, will require
preclearance. Frequent trading and large transactions that are
disruptive to portfolio management can have an adverse effect on
Portfolio performance and therefore your Contract’s
performance. Such trading may also cause dilution in the value
of the Investment Options held by long-term Contract Owners.
While these issues can occur in connection with any of the
underlying Portfolios, Portfolios holding securities that are
subject to market pricing inefficiencies are more susceptible to
abuse. For example, Portfolios holding international securities
may be more susceptible to time-zone arbitrage which seeks to
take advantage of pricing discrepancies occurring between the
time of the closing of the market on which the security is
traded and the time of pricing of the Portfolios.


Our policies and procedures which limit the
number and frequency of transfers and which may impose
preclearance requirements on certain large transactions are
applied uniformly to all Contract Owners. However, there is a
risk that these policies and procedures will not detect all
potentially disruptive activity or will otherwise prove
ineffective in whole or in part. Further, we and our affiliates
make available to our variable annuity and variable life
insurance Contract Owners underlying funds not affiliated with
us. We are unable to monitor or restrict the trading activity
with respect to shares of such funds not sold in connection with
our Contracts. In the event the Board of Trustees/Directors of
any underlying fund imposes a redemption fee or trading
(transfer) limitations, we will pass them on to you.


We reserve the right to restrict, in our sole
discretion and without prior notice, transfers initiated by a
market timing organization or individual or other party
authorized to give transfer instructions on behalf of multiple
Contract Owners. Such restrictions could include:









 
• 

not accepting transfer instructions from a
  registered representative acting on behalf of more than one
  Contract Owner, and
  


 


 
• 

not accepting preauthorized transfer forms from
  market timers or other entities acting on behalf of more than
  one Contract Owner at a time.
  



We further reserve the right to impose, without
prior notice, restrictions on transfers that we determine, in
our sole discretion, will disadvantage or potentially hurt the
rights or interests of other Contract Owners; or to comply with
any applicable federal and state laws, rules and regulations.


Exchanges of Annuity Units



Exchanges of Annuity Units in any Subaccount(s)
to any other Subaccount(s) after the Annuity Date are limited to
4 in any 12-month period. See THE GENERAL ACCOUNT section
in the Prospectus and THE CONTRACTS AND THE SEPARATE
ACCOUNT section in the SAI.







Systematic Transfer Options



We offer 3 systematic transfer options: dollar
cost averaging, portfolio rebalancing, and earnings sweep. There
is no charge for these options and transfers under these options
are not counted towards your total transfers in a Calendar Year.
However, they are subject to the same requirements and
restrictions as non-systematic transfers. You can have only one
dollar cost averaging or earnings sweep program in effect at one
time. The systematic transfer options are not available after
you annuitize.




Dollar Cost Averaging

Dollar cost averaging is a method in which you
buy securities in a series of regular purchases instead of in a
single purchase. This allows you to average the securities’
prices over time, and may permit a “smoothing” of
abrupt peaks and drops in price. Prior to your Annuity Date, you
may use dollar cost averaging to transfer amounts, over time,
from any Investment Option with an Account Value of at least
$5,000 to one or more Variable Investment Options. Each transfer
must be for at least $250.

 

19




Table of Contents






Currently, we are not enforcing the minimum
Account Value and/or transfer amounts but we reserve the right
to enforce such minimum amounts in the future. Transfers from
the Fixed Option under the dollar cost averaging program are
subject to a minimum duration of 12 months. Detailed
information appears in the SAI.


Portfolio Rebalancing



You may instruct us to maintain a specific
balance of Variable Investment Options under your Contract
(e.g., 30% in the Equity Index Subaccount, 40% in
the Managed Bond Subaccount, and 30% in the Growth
LT Subaccount) prior to your Annuity Date. Periodically, we
will “rebalance” your values in the elected
Subaccounts to the percentages you have specified. Rebalancing
may result in transferring amounts from a Subaccount earning a
relatively higher return to one earning a relatively lower
return. You may choose to have rebalances made quarterly,
semi-annually or annually until your Annuity Date. Portfolio
rebalancing is not available after you annuitize. Only Variable
Investment Options are available for rebalancing. Detailed
information appears in the SAI.




Earnings Sweep

You may instruct us to make automatic periodic
transfers of your earnings from the Money Market Subaccount or
from the Fixed Option to one or more Variable Investment Options
(other than the Money Market Subaccount). Detailed information
appears in the SAI.





CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS



Withdrawal Charge

No sales charge is imposed on any Purchase
Payment which means the entire amount of your Purchase Payment
is allocated to the Investment Options you selected. Your
Purchase Payments may, however, be subject to a withdrawal
charge. This charge may apply to amounts you withdraw under your
Contract prior to the Annuity Date, depending on the length of
time each Purchase Payment has been invested and on the amount
you withdraw. This amount is deducted proportionately among all
Investment Options from which the withdrawal occurs. See the
Choosing Your Annuity Option— Annuity Options
section for withdrawal charges that may apply to redemptions
after the Annuity Date. No withdrawal charge is imposed on:











 
• 

the free withdrawal amount (see
  WITHDRAWALS— Withdrawals Free of a Withdrawal
  Charge),
  




 




 
• 

amounts converted after the first Contract Year,
  if annuitized for at least 5 years, unless guaranteed
  variable annuity payments under Annuity Option 2 or 4 are
  subsequently redeemed (see the ANNUITIZATION AND DEATH
  BENEFITS—Choosing Your Annuity Option section in this
  Prospectus),
  




 




 
• 

payment of death benefit proceeds under the
  Contract for certain non-natural Owners,
  




 




 
• 

withdrawals by Owners to meet the minimum
  distribution rules for Qualified Contracts as they apply to
  amounts held under the Contract, or
  




 




 
• 

withdrawals after the first Contract Anniversary,
  if the last or sole Annuitant has been diagnosed with a
  medically determinable condition that results in a life
  expectancy of 12 months or less and we are provided with
  medical evidence satisfactory to us.
  







Transfers of all or part of your Account Value
from one Investment Option to another are not considered a
withdrawal of an amount from your Contract, so no withdrawal
charge is imposed at the time of transfer. See the HOW YOUR
INVESTMENTS ARE ALLOCATED— Transfers and Market-timing
Restrictions and THE GENERAL ACCOUNT sections in this
Prospectus.




How the Withdrawal Charge is
Determined

The amount of the withdrawal charge depends on
how long each Purchase Payment was held under your Contract.
Each Purchase Payment you make is considered to have a certain
“age,” depending on the length of time since that
Purchase Payment was effective. A Purchase Payment is “one
year old” or has an “age of one” from the day it
is effective until the beginning of the day preceding your next
Contract Anniversary. Beginning on the day preceding that
Contract Anniversary, your Purchase Payment will have an
“age of two” and increases in age on the day preceding
each Contract Anniversary. When

 

20




Table of Contents






you withdraw an amount subject to the withdrawal
charge, the “age” of the Purchase Payment you withdraw
determines the level of withdrawal charge as follows:

We calculate your withdrawal charge by assuming
that amounts withdrawn are attributed to Purchase Payments first
and in the order your Purchase Payments were received by us,
then Earnings and before any deductions for other charges due or
taxes are made. The withdrawal charge will be deducted
proportionately among all Investment Options from which the
withdrawal occurs. Unless you specify otherwise, a partial
withdrawal amount requested will be processed as a
“gross” amount, which means that applicable charges
and taxes will be deducted from the requested amount. If a
partial withdrawal amount is requested to be a “net”
amount, applicable charges and taxes will be added to the
requested amount and the withdrawal charges and taxes will be
calculated on the grossed up amount.






Example: You make an initial Purchase Payment of
$10,000 in Contract Year 1 and make an additional Purchase
Payment of $7,000 in Contract Year 2. With Earnings, your
Contract Value in Contract Year 3 is $19,000. In Contract
Year 3 you make a withdrawal of $9,000. At this point,
total Purchase Payments equal $17,000, Earnings equal $2,000,
and the “age” of the applicable Purchase Payments
withdrawn is 3 Years. 10% of all remaining Purchase
Payments made ($1,700) may be withdrawn free of a withdrawal
charge per Contract Year. The amount of the withdrawal charge
applied would be $365 ($9,000-$1,700=$7,300; $7,300*5%=$365).




The withdrawal charge is designed to reimburse us
for sales commissions and other expenses associated with the
promotion and solicitation of offers for the Contracts, although
our actual expenses may be greater or less than the amount of
the withdrawal charge. See the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION—
Distribution Arrangements section in this Prospectus for
information regarding commissions and other amounts paid to
broker-dealers in connection with distribution of the Contracts.





Premium Taxes



Depending on your state of residence (among other
factors), a tax may be imposed on your Investments
(“premium tax”) at the time your Investment is made,
at the time of a partial or full withdrawal, at the time any
death benefit proceeds are paid, at annuitization or at such
other time as taxes may be imposed. Tax rates ranging from 0% to
3.5% are currently in effect, but may change in the future. Some
local jurisdictions also impose a tax.






If we pay any premium taxes attributable to
Investments, we will impose a similar charge against your
Contract Value. Premium tax is subject to state requirements. We
normally will charge you when you annuitize some or all of your
Contract Value. We reserve the right to impose this charge for
applicable premium taxes and/or other taxes when you make a full
or partial withdrawal, at the time any death benefit proceeds
are paid, or when those taxes are incurred. For these purposes,
“premium taxes” include any state or local premium or
retaliatory taxes and, where approval has been obtained, federal
premium taxes and any federal, state or local income, excise,
business or any other type of tax (or component thereof)
measured by or based upon, directly or indirectly, the amount of
Investments we have received. We will base this charge on the
Contract Value, the amount of the transaction, the aggregate
amount of Investments we receive under your Contract, or any
other amount, that in our sole discretion we deem appropriate.




We may also charge the Separate Account or your
Contract Value for taxes attributable to the Separate Account or
the Contract, including income taxes attributable to the
Separate Account or to our operations with respect to the
Contract, or taxes attributable, directly or indirectly, to
Investments. Currently, we do not impose any such charges.





Annual Fee

We will charge you an Annual Fee of $30 on each
Contract Anniversary prior to the Annuity Date, and at the time
you withdraw your entire Net Contract Value (on a pro rated
basis for that Contract Year) if your Net Contract Value is less
than $50,000 on that date. The fee is not imposed on amounts you
annuitize or on payment of death benefit proceeds. The fee

 

21




Table of Contents








reimburses certain costs in administering the
Contracts and the Separate Account. We do not intend to realize
a profit from this fee. This fee is guaranteed not to increase
for the life of your Contract.




Your Annual Fee will be charged proportionately
against your Investment Options. Assessments against your
Variable Investment Options are made by debiting some of the
Subaccount Units previously credited to your Contract. That is,
assessment of the Annual Fee does not change the Unit Value for
those Subaccounts. Any portion of the Annual Fee we deduct from
any of our fixed options (if available under the Contract) will
not be greater than the annual interest credited in excess of
that fixed option’s minimum guaranteed interest rate.





Waivers and Reduced Charges



We may agree to waive or reduce charges under our
Contracts, in situations where selling and/or maintenance costs
associated with the Contracts are reduced, such as the sale of
several Contracts to the same Contract Owner(s), sales of large
Contracts, sales of Contracts in connection with a group or
sponsored arrangement or mass transactions over multiple
Contracts.






We will only waive or reduce such charges on any
Contract where expenses associated with the sale or distribution
of the Contract and/or costs associated with administering and
maintaining the Contract are reduced. We reserve the right to
terminate waiver and reduced charge programs at any time,
including for issued Contracts.







Mortality and Expense Risk Charge



We assess a charge against the assets of each
Subaccount to compensate for certain mortality and expense risks
that we assume under the Contract (the “Risk Charge”).
The risk that an Annuitant will live longer (and therefore
receive more annuity payments) than we predict through our
actuarial calculations at the time the Contract is issued is
“mortality risk.” We also bear mortality risk in
connection with death benefit payable under the Contract. The
risk that the expense charges and fees under the Contract and
Separate Account are less than our actual administrative and
operating expenses is called “expense risk.”




This Risk Charge is assessed daily at an annual
rate equal to 1.25% of each Subaccount’s assets. This
charge may not be increased for the duration of your Contract.




The Risk Charge will stop at the Annuity Date if
you select fixed annuity payments. The base Risk Charge will
continue after the Annuity Date if you choose variable annuity
payments, even though we do not bear mortality risk if your
Annuity Option is Period Certain Only.






We will realize a gain if the Risk Charge exceeds
our actual cost of expenses and benefits, and will suffer a loss
if such actual costs exceed the Risk Charge. Any gain will
become part of our General Account. We may use it for any
reason, including covering sales expenses on the Contracts.







Administrative Fee

We charge an Administrative Fee as compensation
for costs we incur in operating the Separate Account, issuing
and administering the Contracts, including processing
applications and payments, and issuing reports to you and to
regulatory authorities.




The Administrative Fee is assessed daily at an
annual rate equal to 0.15% of the assets of each Subaccount.
This rate is guaranteed not to increase for the life of your
Contract. A correlation will not necessarily exist between the
actual administrative expenses attributable to a particular
Contract and the Administrative Fee paid in respect of that
particular Contract. The Administrative Fee will continue after
the Annuity Date if you choose any variable annuity. We do not
intend to realize a profit from this fee.









Fund Expenses





Your Variable Account Value reflects advisory
fees and other expenses incurred by the various Portfolios of
the Funds, net of any applicable reductions and/or
reimbursements. These fees and expenses may vary. Each Fund is
governed by its own Board of Trustees, and your Contract does
not fix or specify the level of expenses of any Portfolio. A
Fund’s fees and expenses are described in detail in the
applicable Fund Prospectus and SAI.

ANNUITIZATION AND DEATH BENEFITS



Selecting Your Annuitant

When you submit the application for your
Contract, you must choose a sole Annuitant or Joint Annuitants.
If you are buying a Qualified Contract, you must be the sole
Annuitant. If you are buying a Non-Qualified Contract you may
choose yourself and/or another person as Annuitant. Whether you
have a sole or Joint Annuitants, you may choose a Contingent
Annuitant. The Contingent Annuitant will not have any Contract
benefits, including death benefit proceeds, until becoming the
sole surviving Annuitant. You will not be able to add or change
a sole or Joint Annuitant after your Contract is issued.
However, if you are buying a Qualified Contract, you may add a
Joint Annuitant on the Annuity Date. You will be able to add or
change a Contingent Annuitant until your Annuity Date or the
death of your sole Annuitant or both Joint Annuitants, whichever
occurs first. However, once your Contingent Annuitant has become
the Annuitant under your Contract, no additional Contingent
Annuitant may be named. No Annuitant (Primary, Joint or
Contingent) may be named upon or after reaching his or her
86th birthday. We reserve the right to require proof
of age or survival of the Annuitant(s).





Annuitization



Annuitization occurs on the Annuity Date when you
convert your Contract from the accumulation phase to the
annuitization (income) phase. You may choose both your Annuity
Date and your Annuity Option. At the Annuity Date, you may elect
to annuitize some or all of your Net Contract Value, less any
applicable charge for premium taxes and/or other taxes, (the
“Conversion Amount”), as long as such Conversion
Amount annuitized is at least $10,000. We will send the annuity
payments to the payee that you designate.




If you annuitize only a portion of this available
Contract Value, you may have the remainder distributed, less any
applicable charge for premium taxes and/or other taxes, any
applicable withdrawal charge, and any Annual Fee. This option of
distribution may or may not be available, or may be available
for only certain types of contracts. Currently, we only allow
this option on Qualified Contracts but we reserve the right to
make it available on other contract types in the future. We will
distribute your Net Contract Value, less any applicable charge
for premium taxes, any applicable withdrawal charge, and any
Annual Fee, to you in a single sum if the net amount of your
Contract Value available to convert to an annuity is less than
$10,000 on your Annuity Date. Currently, we are not enforcing
this minimum but we reserve the right to enforce it in the
future. Distributions under your Contract may have tax
consequences. You should consult a qualified tax adviser for
information on full or partial annuitization.


If you annuitize only a portion of your Net
Contract Value on your Annuity Date, you may, at that time, have
the option to elect not to have the remainder of your Contract
Value distributed, but instead to continue your Contract with
that remaining Contract Value (a “continuing
Contract”). If this option is available, you would then
choose a second Annuity Date for your continuing Contract, and
all references in this Prospectus to your “Annuity
Date” would, in connection with your continuing Contract,
be deemed to refer to that second Annuity Date. The second
Annuity Date may not be later than the date specified in the
Choosing Your Annuity Date section of this Prospectus.
This option may not be available, or may be available only for
certain types of Contracts. You should be aware that some or all
of the payments received before the second Annuity Date may be
fully taxable. We recommend that you contact a qualified tax
adviser for more information if you are interested in this
option.





Choosing Your Annuity Date

You should choose your Annuity Start Date when
you submit your application or we will apply a default Annuity
Date to your Contract. You may change your Annuity Date by
notifying us in writing (or other form acceptable to us). We
must receive your written notice at least ten Business Days
prior to the earlier of your old Annuity Date or your new
Annuity Date. Your Annuity Date cannot be earlier than your
first Contract Anniversary.


If you have a sole Annuitant, your Annuity Date
cannot be later than his or her 95th birthday. If you
have Joint Annuitants, your Annuity Date cannot be later than
your younger Joint Annuitant’s 95th birthday. In
the case of certain trusts, the Annuity Date cannot be later
than the Annuitant’s 100th birthday. Different
requirements may apply as required by any applicable state law
or the Code. We may, at our sole discretion, allow you to
extend your Annuity Date regardless of whether we may have
granted any extensions to you or to any others in the past. We
reserve the right, at any time, to not offer any extension to
your Annuity Date. Some Broker/Dealers may not allow their
clients to extend the Annuity Date beyond age 95.




If your Contract is a Qualified Contract, you may
also be subject to additional restrictions. In order to meet the
Code minimum distribution rules, your Required Minimum
Distributions (RMDs) may begin earlier than your Annuity Date.
For

instance, under Section 401 of the Code (for
Qualified Plans) and Section 408 of the Code (for IRAs),
the entire interest under the Contract must be distributed to
the Owner/ Annuitant not later than the Owner/ Annuitant’s
Required Beginning Date (“RBD”), or distributions over
the life of the Owner/ Annuitant (or the Owner/ Annuitant and
his Beneficiary) must begin no later than the RBD. For more
information see the FEDERAL TAX ISSUES section in this
Prospectus.









Default Annuity Date and Options



If you have a Non-Qualified Contract and you do
not choose an Annuity Date when you submit your application,
your Annuity Date will be your Annuitant’s 95th
birthday or your younger Joint Annuitant’s 95th
birthday, whichever applies. However some states’ laws may
require a different Annuity Date. Certain Qualified plans may
require distribution to occur at an earlier age.




If you have not specified an Annuity Option or do
not instruct us otherwise, at your Annuity Date your Net
Contract Value, less any charges for premium taxes and/or other
taxes, will be annuitized (if this net amount is at least
$10,000) as follows:









 
• 

the net amount from your Fixed Option Value will
  be converted into a fixed-dollar annuity,
  


 


 
• 

and the net amount from your Variable Account
  Value will be converted into a variable-dollar annuity directed
  to the Subaccounts proportionate to your Account Value in each.
  



If the net amount is less than $10,000, the
entire amount will be distributed. If you have a Non-Qualified
Contract, or if you have a Qualified Contract and are not
married, your default Annuity Option will be Life with Ten Year
Period Certain. If you have a Qualified Contract and you are
married, your default Annuity Option will be Joint and Survivor
Life with survivor payments of 50% and your spouse will
automatically be named your Joint Annuitant.





Choosing Your Annuity Option

You should carefully review the Annuity Options
with a qualified tax adviser, and, for Qualified Contracts,
reference should be made to the terms of the particular plan and
the requirements of the Code for pertinent limitations regarding
annuity payments, Required Minimum Distributions
(“RMDs”), and other matters.


You may make three basic decisions about your
annuity payments. First, you may choose whether you want those
payments to be a fixed-dollar amount and/or a variable-dollar
amount. Second, you may choose the form of annuity payments (see
Annuity Options below). Third, you may decide how often
you want annuity payments to be made (the “frequency”
of the payments). You may not change these selections after the
Annuity Date.


Fixed and Variable Payment Options



You may choose fixed annuity payments based on a
fixed rate and the 1983a Annuity Mortality Table with the ages
set back ten (10) years, variable annuity payments that vary
with the Investment results of the Subaccounts you select, or
you may choose both, converting one portion of the net amount
you annuitize into fixed annuity payments and another portion
into variable annuity payments.






If you select fixed annuity payments, each
periodic annuity payment received will be equal to the initial
annuity payment, unless you select a Joint and Survivor Life
annuity with reduced survivor payments when the Primary
Annuitant dies. Any net amount you convert to fixed annuity
payments will be held in our General Account (but not under any
fixed option).






If you select variable annuity payments, you may
choose as many Variable Investment Options as you wish. The
amount of the periodic annuity payments will vary with the
investment results of the Variable Investment Options selected
and may be more or less than a fixed payment option. After the
Annuity Date, Annuity Units may be exchanged among available
Variable Investment Options up to four times in any twelve-month
period. How your Contract converts into variable annuity
payments is explained in more detail in THE CONTRACTS AND THE
SEPARATE ACCOUNT section in the SAI.




Annuity Options



Four Annuity Options are currently available
under the Contract, although additional options may become
available in the future.













 
1. 

Life Only. Periodic
  payments are made to the designated payee during the
  Annuitant’s lifetime. Payments stop when the Annuitant dies.
  




 

24




Table of Contents















 
2. 

Life with Period
  Certain. Periodic payments are made to
  the designated payee during the Annuitant’s lifetime, with
  payments guaranteed for a specified period. You may choose to
  have payments guaranteed for anywhere from 5 through
  30 years (in full years only).
  




 




 
3. 

Joint and Survivor
  Life. Periodic payments are made to
  the designated payee during the lifetime of the Primary
  Annuitant. After the death of the Primary Annuitant, periodic
  payments will continue to be made during the lifetime of the
  secondary Annuitant named in the election. You may choose to
  have the payments to the surviving secondary Annuitant equal
  50%, 66 2/3% or 100% of the original amount payable made during
  the lifetime of the Primary Annuitant (you must make this
  election when you choose your Annuity Option). If you elect a
  reduced payment based on the life of the secondary Annuitant,
  fixed annuity payments will be equal to 50% or 66 2/3% of the
  original fixed payment payable during the lifetime of the
  Primary Annuitant; variable annuity payments will be determined
  using 50% or 66 2/3%, as applicable, of the number of Annuity
  Units for each Subaccount credited to the Contract as of the
  date of death of the Primary Annuitant. Payments stop when both
  Annuitants have died.
  




 




 
4. 

Period Certain Only.
  Periodic payments are made to the designated payee over a
  specified period. You may choose to have payments continue for
  anywhere from 5 through 30 years (in full years only).
  







Periodic payment amounts will differ based on the
Annuity Option selected. Generally, the longer the possible
payment period, the lower the payment amount.




Additionally, if variable payments are elected
under Annuity Options 2 and 4, you may redeem all remaining
guaranteed variable payments after the Annuity Date. Also, under
Option 4, partial redemptions of remaining guaranteed
variable payments after the Annuity Date are available. The
amount available upon full redemption would be the present value
of any remaining guaranteed variable payments at the assumed
investment return, any applicable withdrawal charge will be
deducted from the present value as if you made a full
withdrawal, or if applicable, a partial withdrawal. For purposes
of calculating the withdrawal charge and Free Withdrawal amount,
it will be assumed that the Contract was never converted to
provide annuity payments and any prior variable annuity payments
in that Contract Year will be treated as if they were partial
withdrawals from the Contract (see the CHARGES, FEES AND
DEDUCTIONS—Withdrawal Charge section in this
Prospectus). For example, assume that a Contract was issued with
a single investment of $10,000 and in Contract Year 3 the Owner
elects to receive variable annuity payments under Annuity Option
4. In Contract Year 4, the Owner elects to make a partial
redemption of $5,000. The withdrawal charge as a percentage of
the Purchase Payments with an age of 4 years is 3%.
Assuming the Free Withdrawal amount immediately prior to the
partial redemption is $200, the withdrawal charge for the
partial redemption will be $144 (($5,000 – $200) *
3%). No withdrawal charge will be imposed on a redemption if:











 
• 

the Annuity Option is elected as the form of
  payments of death benefit proceeds, or
  




 


 
• 

the Annuitant dies before the period certain has
  ended and the Beneficiary requests a redemption of the variable
  annuity payments.
  





If the Annuitant dies before the guaranteed
payments under Annuity Options 2 and 4 are completed, we
will pay the remainder of the guaranteed payments to the first
person among the following who is (1) living; or
(2) an entity or corporation entitled to receive the
remainder of the guaranteed payments:











 
• 

the Owner;
  


 


 
• 

the Joint Owner;
  


 


 
• 

the Contingent Owner;
  


 


 
• 

the Beneficiary; or
  


 


 
• 

the Contingent Beneficiary.
  



If none are living (or if there is no entity or
corporation entitled to receive the remainder of the guaranteed
payments), we will pay the remainder of the guaranteed payments
to the Owner’s estate.




If the Owner dies on or after the Annuity Date,
but payments have not yet been completed, then distributions of
the remaining amounts payable under the Contract must be made at
least as rapidly as the method of distribution that was being



 

25




Table of Contents






used at the date of the Owner’s death. All
of the Owner’s rights granted by the Contract will be
assumed by the first among the following who is (1) living;
or (2) an entity or corporation entitled to assume the
Owner’s rights granted by the Contract:









 
• 

the Joint Owner;
  


 


 
• 

the Contingent Owner;
  


 


 
• 

the Beneficiary; or
  


 


 
• 

the Contingent Beneficiary.
  



If none are living (or if there is no entity or
corporation entitled to assume the Owner’s rights granted
by the Contract), all of the Owner’s rights granted by the
Contract will be assumed by the Owner’s estate.




For Qualified Contracts, please refer to the
Choosing Your Annuity Date section in this Prospectus. If
your Contract was issued in connection with a Qualified Plan
subject to Title I of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), your spouse’s
consent may be required when you seek any distribution under
your Contract, unless your Annuity Option is Joint and Survivor
Life with survivor payments of at least 50%, and your spouse is
your Joint Annuitant.







Your Annuity Payments

Frequency of Payments

You may choose to have annuity payments made
monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. The amount of a
variable payment will be determined in each period on the date
corresponding to your Annuity Date, and payment will be made on
the next succeeding day.


Your initial annuity payment must be at least
$250. Depending on the net amount you annuitize, this
requirement may limit your options regarding the period and/or
frequency of annuity payments.


Amount of the First Payment

Your Contract contains tables that we use to
determine the amount of the first annuity payment under your
Contract, taking into consideration the annuitized portion of
your Net Contract Value at the Annuity Date. This amount will
vary, depending on the annuity period and payment frequency you
select. This amount will be larger in the case of shorter Period
Certain annuities and smaller for longer Period Certain
annuities. Similarly, this amount will be greater for a Life
Only annuity than for a Joint and Survivor Life annuity, because
we will expect to make payments for a shorter period of time on
a Life Only annuity. If you do not choose the Period Certain
Only annuity, this amount will also vary depending on the age of
the Annuitant(s) on the Annuity Date and, for some Contracts in
some states, the sex of the Annuitant(s).




For fixed annuity payments, the guaranteed income
factors in our tables are based on an annual interest rate of 3%
and the 1983a Annuity Mortality Table with the ages set back
10 years. If you elect a fixed annuity, fixed annuity
payments will be based on the periodic income factors in effect
for your Contract on the Annuity Date which are at least the
guaranteed income factors under the Contract.






For variable annuity payments, the tables are
based on an assumed annual investment return of 5% and the 1983a
Annuity Mortality Table with the ages set back 10 years. If
you elect a variable annuity, your initial variable annuity
payment will be based on the applicable variable annuity income
factors in effect for your Contract on the Annuity Date which
are at least the variable annuity income factors under the
Contract. You may choose any other annuity option we may offer
on the option’s effective date. A higher assumed investment
return would mean a larger first variable annuity payment, but
subsequent payments would increase only when actual net
investment performance exceeds the higher assumed rate and would
fall when actual net investment performance is less than the
higher assumed rate. A lower assumed rate would mean a smaller
first payment and a more favorable threshold for increases and
decreases. If the actual net investment performance is a
constant 5% annually, annuity payments will be level. The
assumed investment return is explained in more detail in the SAI
under THE CONTRACTS AND THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT.







Death Benefits

Death benefit proceeds may be payable before the
Annuity Date on proof of death of the sole surviving Annuitant
or of any Contract Owner while the Contract is in force.


Any death benefit payable will be calculated on
the “Notice Date”, which is the day on which we
receive, in proper form, proof of death and instructions
regarding payment of death benefit proceeds. If a Contract has
multiple recipients, death benefit

 

26




Table of Contents






proceeds will be calculated when we first receive
proof of death and instructions, in proper form, from any
recipient. The death benefit proceeds still remaining to be paid
to other recipients will fluctuate with the performance of the
underlying Investment Options.


Death Benefit Proceeds



Death benefit proceeds will be payable on the
Notice Date. Such proceeds will be reduced by any charge for
premium taxes and/or other taxes and any Contract Debt. The
death benefit proceeds may be payable in a single sum, as an
Annuity Option available under the Contract, towards the
purchase of any other Annuity Option we then offer, or in any
other manner permitted by the IRS and approved by us. The
Owner’s spouse may continue the Contract (see the Death
Benefits— Spousal Continuation section of this
Prospectus). In addition, there may be legal requirements that
limit the recipient’s Annuity Options and the timing of any
payments. A recipient should consult a qualified tax adviser
before making a death benefit election.




Mandatory Distribution on Death

The Contract is intended to comply with all
applicable provisions of Code Section 72(s) and any
successor provision, as deemed necessary by us to qualify the
Contract as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes.
If an Owner of a Non-Qualified Contract dies before the Annuity
Date, distribution of the death benefit proceeds must begin
within 1 year after the Owner’s death or complete
distribution within 5 years after the Owner’s death.
In order to satisfy this requirement, the designated recipient
must receive a final lump sum payment by the fifth anniversary
of the death of the Contract Owner, or elect to receive an
annuity for life or over a period that does not exceed the life
expectancy of the designated recipient with annuity payments
that start within 1 year after the Owner’s death or,
if permitted by the IRS, elect to receive a systematic
distribution over a period not exceeding the beneficiary’s
life expectancy using a method that would be acceptable for
purposes of calculating the minimum distribution required under
section 401(a)(9) of the Code. If an election to receive an
annuity is not made within 60 days of our receipt of proof,
in proper form, of the Owner’s death or, if earlier,
60 days (or shorter period as we permit) prior to the first
anniversary of the Owner’s death, the lump sum option will
be deemed elected, unless otherwise required by law. If the lump
sum option is deemed elected, we will consider that deemed
election as receipt of instructions regarding payment of the
death benefit proceeds. If a Non-Qualified Contract has Joint
Owners, this requirement applies to the first Contract Owner to
die.


The Owner may designate that the Beneficiary will
receive death benefit proceeds through annuity payments for life
or life with Period Certain. The Owner must designate the
payment method in writing in a form acceptable to us. The Owner
may revoke the designation only in writing and only in a form
acceptable to us. Once the Owner dies, the Beneficiary cannot
revoke or modify the Owner’s designation.


Death Benefit Amounts

The Death Benefit Amount as of the Notice Date
and prior to the Annuity Date is equal to the greater of:









 
• 

your Contract Value as of that day, or
  


 


 
• 

your aggregate Purchase Payments, reduced by any
  applicable charges and fees, and further reduced by an amount
  for each withdrawal that is calculated by multiplying the
  aggregate Purchase Payments received by the ratio of the amount
  of each withdrawal, including applicable withdrawal charges, to
  the Contract Value immediately prior to each withdrawal.
  



Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit
Amount

The actual Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit
(GMDB) Amount will be calculated only when a death benefit
becomes payable as a result of the death of the sole Annuitant,
or the first death of an Owner who is also an Annuitant, and is
determined as follows: We look at the Contract as of the first
Contract Anniversary and as of every subsequent Contract
Anniversary prior to the Annuity Date, that is, the
1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc., until the
earlier of:









 
• 

the date the Annuitant reaches his or her
  81st birthday,
  


 


 
• 

the date of the Annuitant’s death, or
  


 


 
• 

the Annuity Date, (each of these Anniversaries is
  a “Milestone Date”).
  


 

27




Table of Contents






For each Milestone Date, we calculate the Death
Benefit Amount and:









 
• 

add the aggregate amount of any Purchase Payments
  received by us after that Milestone Date,
  


 


 
• 

subtract an amount for each withdrawal that is
  calculated by multiplying that Death Benefit Amount before the
  withdrawal by the ratio of the amount of each withdrawal that
  has occurred since that Milestone Date, including applicable
  withdrawal charges, to the Contract Value immediately prior to
  each withdrawal, and
  


 


 
• 

subtract the aggregate amount of any previous
  charges, fees, and/or taxes effected since that Milestone Date.
  



The highest of these adjusted Death Benefit
Amounts, as of the Notice Date, is the GMDB Amount.
Calculations of any actual Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit
are only made once death benefit proceeds become payable under
your Contract.


Spousal Continuation

Generally, a sole designated recipient who is the
Owner’s spouse may elect to become the Owner (and sole
Annuitant if the deceased Owner had been the Annuitant) and
continue the Contract until the earliest of the spouse’s
death, the death of the Annuitant, or the Annuity Date, except
in the case of a Qualified Contract issued under
section 403 of the Code. On the Notice Date, if the
surviving spouse is deemed to have continued the Contract, we
will set the Contract Value equal to the death benefit proceeds
that would have been payable to the spouse as the deemed
Beneficiary/ designated recipient of the death benefit proceeds
(“Add-In Amount”). The Add-In Amount will be added to
the Contract Value on the Notice Date. There will not be an
adjustment to the Contract Value if the Contract Value is equal
to or greater than the death benefit proceeds as of the Notice
Date. The Add-In Amount will be allocated among Investment
Options in accordance with the current allocation instructions
for the Contract and may be, under certain circumstances,
considered earnings. A Joint or Contingent Owner who is the
designated recipient, but not the Owner’s spouse, may not
continue the Contract.




Example: On the Notice Date, the Owner’s
surviving spouse elects to continue the Contract. On that date,
the death benefit proceeds were $100,000 and the Contract Value
was $85,000. Since the surviving spouse elected to continue the
Contract in lieu of receiving the death benefit proceeds, we
will increase the Contract Value by an Add-In Amount of $15,000
($100,000-$85,000=$15,000). If the Contract Value on the Notice
Date was $100,000 or higher, then nothing would be added to the
Contract Value.




Qualified Contract Death of Annuitant
Distribution Rules

Under Internal Revenue Service regulations and
our administrative procedures, if the Contract is owned under a
Qualified Plan as defined in Sections 401, 403, 457(b) or
Sections 408, or 408A of the Code and the Annuitant dies
before the Required Beginning Date, the payment of any death
benefit proceeds must be made to the designated recipient in
accordance with one of two rules. One rule generally requires
the death benefit proceeds to commence distribution by
December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar
year of the Annuitant’s death and continue over the life of
his or her Beneficiary (the “life expectancy method”).
The second rule requires distribution of the entire death
benefit proceeds no later than December 31 of the calendar
year in which the fifth anniversary of the Annuitant’s
death falls (the “five-year rule”).


However, the life expectancy method and the
five-year rule are modified if the sole primary Beneficiary is a
surviving spouse. If the surviving spouse elects to continue the
Contract and not do an eligible rollover to an IRA or another
existing eligible plan in his or her name, then he or she will
be subject to the five-year rule. However, the surviving spouse
may waive the five-year requirement and elect to take
distributions over his or her life expectancy, and if the
surviving spouse elects to defer the commencement of required
distributions beyond the first anniversary of the
Annuitant’s death, the surviving spouse will be deemed to
continue the Contract. In this instance, the surviving spouse
may defer required distributions until the later of:









 
• 

December 31 of the year following the year
  the Annuitant died, or
  


 


 
• 

December 31 of the year in which the
  deceased Annuitant would have turned 70 1/2.
  





Further, under our administrative procedures, if
the required distributions election is not received by us in
good order by December 31 of the year following the
Annuitant’s death or by December 31 of the year in
which the Annuitant would have attained age 70 1/2, the lump sum
option will be deemed by us to have been elected, unless
otherwise required by law. If the lump sum option is deemed
elected, we will treat that deemed election as receipt of
instructions regarding payment of death benefit proceeds.




If the Annuitant dies after the commencement of
RMDs (except in the case of a Roth IRA when RMDs do not apply)
but before the Annuitant’s entire interest in the Contract
(other than a Roth IRA) has been distributed, the remaining
interest in

 

28




Table of Contents






the Contract must be distributed to the
designated recipient at least as rapidly as under the
distribution method in effect at the time of the
Annuitant’s death.


The Amount of the Death Benefit: Death of the
Annuitant

If the sole surviving Annuitant or the first
Owner who is also an Annuitant dies on or before the first
Contract Anniversary, or if the Annuitant had already reached
his or her 81st birthday as of the first Contract
Anniversary, the death benefit proceeds will be equal to the
Death Benefit Amount as of the Notice Date. For Non-Natural
Owners, the Death Benefit proceeds will be payable on proof of
death of the first Annuitant.


If the sole surviving Annuitant or the first
Owner who is also an Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity Date
but after the first Contract Anniversary, and had not yet
reached his or her 81st birthday as of the first
Contract Anniversary, the death benefit proceeds will be equal
to the greater of:









 
• 

the Death Benefit Amount as of the Notice Date, or
  


 


 
• 

the GMDB Amount as of the Notice Date.
  



If the Annuitant who is not an Owner dies, the
designated sole Annuitant will then be the first living person
in the following order and no death benefit proceeds will be
payable:









 
• 

a surviving Joint Annuitant, or
  


 


 
• 

a surviving Contingent Annuitant.
  



If there is no surviving Joint or Contingent
Annuitant, the death benefit proceeds will be payable to the
first living person in the following order:









 
• 

Beneficiary, or
  


 


 
• 

Contingent Beneficiary.
  



If none are living, the death benefit proceeds
will be payable to the Owner’s Estate.


If the Owner is not an Annuitant and the Owner
and Annuitant die simultaneously, the death benefit proceeds
will be paid to the first living person in the following order:









 
• 

Beneficiary, or
  


 


 
• 

Contingent Beneficiary.
  



If none are living, the death benefit proceeds
will be payable to the Owner’s Estate


The Amount of the Death Benefit: Death of a
Contract Owner

If a Contract Owner who is not an Annuitant dies
before the Annuity Date, the death benefit proceeds will be
equal to the Death Benefit Amount as of the Notice Date
and will be paid in accordance with the Death Benefit
Proceeds section above. The death benefit proceeds will be
paid to the first living person in the following order:









 
• 

Joint Owner,
  


 


 
• 

Contingent Owner,
  


 


 
•

equal to the greater of your Death Benefit Amount or the GMDB
Amount as of the Notice Date and will be paid in accordance with
the Death Benefit Proceeds section above.

WITHDRAWALS



Optional Withdrawals



You may, on or prior to your Annuity Date,
withdraw all or a portion of the amount available under your
Contract, so long as any of your Annuitants are still living.
You may surrender your Contract and make a full withdrawal at
any time. If you surrender your Contract it will be terminated
as of the Effective Date of the withdrawal. Beginning
30 days after your Contract Date, you also may make partial
withdrawals from your Investment Options at any time. Currently,
we are not requiring the 30-day waiting period on partial
withdrawals, but we reserve the right to require the 30-day
waiting period on partial withdrawals in the future. You may
request to withdraw a specific dollar amount or a specific
percentage of an Account Value or your Net Contract Value. You
may choose to make your withdrawal from specified Investment
Options. If you do not specify Investment Options, your
withdrawal will be made from all of your Investment Options
proportionately. Each partial withdrawal must be for $500 or
more. Pre-authorized partial withdrawals must be at least $250,
except for pre-authorized withdrawals distributed by Electronic
Funds Transfer (EFT), which must be at least $100. If your
partial withdrawal from an Investment Option would leave a
remaining Account Value in that Investment Option of less than
any minimum Account Value we may require in the future, we also
reserve the right, at our option, to transfer that remaining
amount to your other Investment Options on a proportionate basis
relative to your most recent allocation instructions. If your
partial withdrawal leaves you with a Net Contract Value of less
than $1,000, or if your partial withdrawal request is for an
amount exceeding the amount as described in the Amount
Available for Withdrawal section below, we have the right,
at our option, to terminate your Contract and send you the
withdrawal proceeds. Partial withdrawals from the Fixed Option
in any Contract Year may be subject to restrictions.




Amount Available for Withdrawal



The amount available for withdrawal is your Net
Contract Value (Contract Value less Contract Debt) at the end of
the Business Day on which your withdrawal request is effective,
less any applicable Annual Fee, withdrawal charge, and any
charge for premium taxes and/or other taxes. The amount we send
to you (your “withdrawal proceeds”) will also reflect
any adjustment for federal and state income tax withholding. See
the FEDERAL TAX ISSUES and THE GENERAL ACCOUNT
sections in this Prospectus.






You assume investment risk on Purchase Payments
in the Subaccounts. As a result, the amount available to you for
withdrawal from any Subaccount may be more or less than the
total Purchase Payments you have allocated to that Subaccount.






Withdrawals Free of a Withdrawal
Charge





Subject to the amount available for withdrawal
provisions as described above, we will not impose a withdrawal
charge on your withdrawal to the extent that total withdrawals
that are free of charge during the Contract Year do not exceed
10% of the sum of your remaining Purchase Payments at the
beginning of the Contract Year that have been held under your
Contract for less than six years plus additional Purchase
Payments applied to your Contract during that Contract Year. Our
calculations of the withdrawal charge deduct this “free
10%” from your “oldest” Purchase Payment that is
still otherwise subject to the charge. For purposes of
determining the free withdrawal amounts, withdrawal of mandatory
required minimums from certain Qualified Plans are included
within the calculations.












 

Example: You make an initial Purchase Payment of
  $10,000 in Contract Year 1, and make additional Purchase
  Payments of $1,000 and $6,000 in Contract Year 2. With Earnings,
  your Contract Value in Contract Year 3 is $19,000. In Contract
  Year 3, you may withdraw $1,700 free of the withdrawal charge
  (your total Purchase Payments were $17,000, so 10% of that total
  equals $1,700). After this withdrawal, your Contract Value is
  $17,300 ($15,300 attributable to Purchase Payments and $2,000
  attributable to earnings). In Contract Year 4, your Contract
  Value falls to $12,500; you may withdraw $1,530 (10% of $15,300)
  free of any withdrawal charges.
  





See the Choosing Your Annuity
Option — Annuity Options section for Free
Withdrawal amounts that apply to redemptions after the Annuity
Date.




Qualified Contracts have special restrictions on
withdrawals. For purposes of determining the free withdrawal
amounts, withdrawal of mandatory required minimums from certain
Qualified Contracts are included within the calculations. For
additional information, see Special Restrictions Under
Qualified Plans below. For those Contracts issued to a
Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT), the amount available for
withdrawal free of withdrawal charges during a Contract Year
includes all eligible Purchase Payments plus all earnings even
if all Purchase Payments have not been deemed withdrawn.

Table of Contents







Pre-Authorized Withdrawals



If your Contract Value is at least $5,000, you
may select the pre-authorized withdrawal option, and you may
choose monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual withdrawals.
Currently, we are not enforcing the minimum Contract Value
amount but we reserve the right to enforce the minimum amount in
the future. Each withdrawal must be for at least $250, except
for withdrawals distributed by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT),
which must be at least $100. Each pre-authorized withdrawal is
subject to federal income tax on its taxable portion and may be
subject to a tax penalty of 10% if you have not reached age 59
1/2. Pre-authorized withdrawals cannot be used to continue the
Contract beyond the Annuity Date. See the FEDERAL TAX
ISSUES and THE GENERAL ACCOUNT sections in this
Prospectus. Additional information and options are set forth in
the SAI.




Special Requirements for Full
Withdrawals

If you wish to withdraw the entire amount
available under your Contract, you must either return your
Contract to us or sign and submit a Withdrawal Request form or a
Lost Contract Affidavit if no Withdrawal Request form is
completed.


Special Restrictions Under Qualified
Plans



Qualified Plans may have additional rules
regarding withdrawals from a Contract purchased under such a
Plan. In general, if your Contract was issued under certain
Qualified Plans, you may not withdraw amounts
attributable to contributions made pursuant to a salary
reduction agreement (as defined in Section 402(g)(3)(A) of
the Code) or to transfers from a custodial account (as defined
in Section 403(b)(7) of the Code) except in cases of
your:











 
• 

severance from employment,
  


 


 
• 

death,
  


 


 
• 

disability as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of
  the Code,
  


 


 
• 

reaching age 59 1/2, or
  


 


 
• 

hardship as defined for purposes of
  Section 401 of the Code.
  



These limitations do not affect certain rollovers
or exchanges between Qualified Plans, and do not apply to
rollovers from these Qualified Plans to an individual retirement
account or individual retirement annuity. In the case of a
403(b) plan, these limitations do not apply to certain salary
reduction contributions made, and investment results earned,
prior to dates specified in the Code.




Hardship withdrawals under the exception provided
above are restricted to amounts attributable to salary reduction
contributions, and do not include investment results. This
additional restriction does not apply to salary reduction
contributions made, or investment results earned, prior to dates
specified in the Code.






Certain distributions, including rollovers, may
be subject to mandatory withholding of 20% for federal income
tax and to a tax penalty of 10% if the distribution is not
transferred directly to the trustee of another Qualified Plan,
or to the custodian of an individual retirement account or
issuer of an individual retirement annuity. See the FEDERAL
TAX ISSUES section in this Prospectus. Distributions may
also trigger withholding for state income taxes. The tax and
ERISA rules relating to withdrawals from Contracts issued to
Qualified Plans are complex. We are not the administrator of any
Qualified Plan. You should consult your qualified tax adviser
and/or your Plan Administrator before you withdraw any portion
of your Contract Value.






Effective Date of Withdrawal
Requests

Withdrawal requests are normally effective on the
Business Day we receive them in proper form. If you make
Purchase Payments by check and submit a withdrawal request
immediately afterwards, payment of your withdrawal proceeds may
be delayed until we receive confirmation in our Annuities
administrative office that your check has cleared.





Tax Consequences of Withdrawals



All withdrawals, including pre-authorized
withdrawals, will generally have federal income tax
consequences, which could include tax penalties. You should
consult with a qualified tax adviser before making any
withdrawal or selecting the pre-authorized withdrawal
option. See the FEDERAL TAX ISSUES section in this
Prospectus.

Right to Cancel (“Free
Look”)





You may return your Contract for cancellation and
a refund during your Free Look period. Your Free Look period is
usually the 10-day period beginning on the day you receive your
Contract, but may vary if required by state law. The amount of
your refund may be more or less than the Purchase Payments
you’ve made. If you return your Contract and it is
post-marked during the Free Look period, it will be cancelled as
of the date we receive your Contract. In most states, you will
then receive a refund of your Contract Value, based upon the
next determined Accumulated Unit Value (AUV) after we
receive your Contract for cancellation, plus a refund of any
amounts that may have been deducted as Contract fees and charges.






In some states we are required to refund your
Purchase Payments. If your Contract was issued in such a state
and you cancel your Contract during the Free Look period, we
will return the greater of your Purchase Payments or the
Contract Value. In addition, if your Contract was issued as an
IRA and you return your Contract within 7 days after you
receive it, we will return the greater of your Purchase Payments
(less any withdrawals made) or the Contract Value.






Your Purchase Payments are allocated to the
Investment Options you indicated on your application, unless
otherwise required by state law. If state law requires that your
Purchase Payments must be allocated to Investment Options
different than you requested, we will comply with state
requirements. At the end of the Free Look period, we will
allocate your Purchase Payments based on your allocation
instructions.






See the ADDITIONAL INFORMATION —
State Considerations section of this Prospectus.




For replacement business and in some states, the
Free Look period may be extended and the amount returned may be
different than as otherwise described above. Please consult with
your registered representative if you have any questions
regarding your state’s Free Look period and the amount of
any refund.




You will find a complete description of the Free
Look period and amount to be refunded that applies to your
Contract on the Contract’s cover page, or on a notice that
accompanies your Contract.






If your Contract is issued in exchange for
another annuity contract or a life insurance policy, our
administrative procedures may vary, depending on the state in
which your Contract is issued.







PACIFIC LIFE AND THE SEPARATE
ACCOUNT



Pacific Life



Pacific Life Insurance Company is a life
insurance company domiciled in Nebraska. Along with our
subsidiaries and affiliates, our operations include life
insurance, annuity, pension and institutional products, mutual
funds, broker-dealer operations, and investment advisory
services. At the end of 2007, we had $207.5 billion of
individual life insurance in force and total admitted assets of
approximately $96.6 billion.




We are authorized to conduct our life insurance
and annuity business in the District of Columbia and in all
states except New York. Our executive office is located at 700
Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, California 92660.


We were originally organized on January 2,
1868, under the name “Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company
of California” and reincorporated as “Pacific Mutual
Life Insurance Company” on July 22, 1936. On
September 1, 1997, we converted from a mutual life
insurance company to a stock life insurance company ultimately
controlled by a mutual holding company and were authorized by
California regulatory authorities to change our name to Pacific
Life Insurance Company. On September 1, 2005, Pacific Life
changed from a California corporation to a Nebraska corporation.
Pacific Life is a subsidiary of Pacific LifeCorp, a holding
company, which, in turn, is a subsidiary of Pacific Mutual
Holding Company, a mutual holding company. Under their
respective charters, Pacific Mutual Holding Company must always
hold at least 51% of the outstanding voting stock of Pacific
LifeCorp, and Pacific LifeCorp must always own 100% of the
voting stock of Pacific Life. Owners of Pacific Life’s
annuity contracts and life insurance policies have certain
membership interests in Pacific Mutual Holding Company,
consisting principally of the right to vote on the election of
the Board of Directors of the mutual holding company and on
other matters, and certain rights upon liquidation or
dissolutions of the mutual holding company.


Our subsidiary, Pacific Select Distributors, Inc.
(PSD) serves as the principal underwriter (distributor) for the
Contracts. PSD is located at 700 Newport Center Drive, Newport
Beach, California 92660. We and PSD enter into selling
agreements with broker-dealers, whose registered representatives
are authorized by state insurance departments to sell the
Contracts.


We may provide you with reports of our ratings
both as an insurance company and as to our claims-paying ability
with respect to our General Account assets.

Separate Account B

Separate Account B was established on
September 25, 1996 as a separate account of Pacific Life,
and is registered with the SEC under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 (the “1940 Act”), as a type of investment
company called a “unit investment trust.”


Obligations arising under your Contract are our
general corporate obligations. We are also the legal owner of
the assets in the Separate Account. Assets of the Separate
Account attributed to the reserves and other liabilities under
the Contract and other contracts issued by us that are supported
by the Separate Account may not be charged with liabilities
arising from any of our other business; any income, gain or loss
(whether or not realized) from the assets of the Separate
Account are credited to or charged against the Separate Account
without regard to our other income, gain or loss.


We may invest money in the Separate Account in
order to commence its operations and for other purposes, but not
to support contracts other than variable annuity contracts. A
portion of the Separate Account’s assets may include
accumulations of charges we make against the Separate Account
and investment results of assets so accumulated. These
additional assets are ours and we may transfer them to our
General Account at any time; however, before making any such
transfer, we will consider any possible adverse impact the
transfer might have on the Separate Account. Subject to
applicable law, we reserve the right to transfer our assets in
the Separate Account to our General Account.




The Separate Account is not the sole investor in
the Funds. Investment in a Fund by other separate accounts in
connection with variable annuity and variable life insurance
contracts may create conflicts. See the accompanying Prospectus
and SAI for the Funds for more information.

FEDERAL TAX ISSUES





The following summary of federal income tax
issues is based on our understanding of current tax laws and
regulations, which may be changed by legislative, judicial or
administrative action. The summary is general in nature and is
not intended as tax advice. Moreover, it does not consider any
applicable foreign, state or local tax laws. We do not make any
guarantee regarding the tax status, federal, foreign, state or
local, of any Contract or any transaction involving the
Contracts. Accordingly, you should consult a qualified tax
adviser for complete information and advice before purchasing a
Contract. Additional tax information is included in the
SAI.





Diversification Requirements and Investor
Control





Section 817(h) of the Code provides that the
investments underlying a variable annuity must satisfy certain
diversification requirements in order for the contract to be
treated as an annuity contract and qualify for tax deferral. We
believe the underlying Variable Investment Options for the
contract meet these requirements. Details on these
diversification requirements appear in the Pacific Select Fund
SAI.






In addition, for a variable annuity contract to
qualify for tax deferral, assets in the separate accounts
supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the
insurance company and not by the contract owner. Under current
U.S. tax law, if a contract owner has excessive control over the
investments made by a separate account, or the underlying fund,
the contract owner will be taxed currently on income and gains
from the account or fund. In other words, in such a case of
investor control the contract owner would not derive the tax
benefits normally associated with variable annuities. For more
information regarding investor control, please refer to the
contract SAI.






Taxation of Annuities - General
Provisions



Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation
of annuities in general, and we designed the Contracts to meet
the requirements of Section 72 of the Code. We believe
that, under current law, the Contract will be treated as an
annuity for federal income tax purposes if the Contract Owner is
a natural person or an agent for a natural person, and that we
(as the issuing insurance company), and not the Contract
Owner(s), will be treated as the owner of the investments
underlying the Contract. Accordingly, no tax should be payable
by you as a Contract Owner as a result of any increase in
Contract Value until you receive money under your Contract. You
should, however, consider how amounts will be taxed when you do
receive them. The following discussion assumes that your
Contract will be treated as an annuity for federal income tax
purposes.




Non-Qualified Contracts - General
Rules



These general rules apply to Non-Qualified
Contracts. As discussed below, however, tax rules may differ for
Qualified Contracts and you should consult a qualified tax
adviser if you are purchasing a Qualified
Contract.



Taxes Payable





A Contract Owner is not taxed on the increases in
the value of a Contract until an amount is received or deemed to
be received. An amount could be received or deemed to be
received, for example, if there is a partial distribution, a
lump sum distribution, an Annuity payment or a material change
in the Contract. Increases in Contract Value that are received
or deemed to be received are taxable to the Contract Owner as
ordinary income. Distributions of net investment income or
capital gains that each Subaccount receives from its
corresponding Portfolio are automatically reinvested in such
Portfolio unless we, on behalf of the Separate Account, elect
otherwise. As noted above, you will be subject to federal income
taxes on the investment income from your Contract only when it
is distributed to you.






Non-Natural Persons as Owners





If a contract is not owned or held by a natural
person or as agent for a natural person, the contract generally
will not be treated as an “annuity” for tax purposes,
meaning that the contract owner will be subject to current tax
on annual increases in Contract Value at ordinary income rates
unless some other exception applies. Certain entities, such as
some trusts, may be deemed to be acting as agents for natural
persons. Corporations, including S corps, C corps,
LLCs, partnerships and FLPs, and tax exempt entities are non
natural persons that will not be deemed to be acting as agents
for natural persons.

Taxes Payable on Withdrawals Prior to the
Annuity Date



Amounts you withdraw before annuitization,
including amounts withdrawn from your Contract Value in
connection with partial withdrawals for payment of any charges
and fees, will be treated first as taxable income to the extent
that your Contract Value exceeds the aggregate of your
Investments (reduced by non-taxable amounts previously
received), and then as non-taxable recovery of your Investments.
Therefore, you include in your gross income the smaller of:
a) the amount of the partial withdrawal, or b) the
amount by which your Contract Value (determined without
considering any surrender charge) immediately before you receive
the distribution exceeds your Investment in the Contract at that
time. If at the time of a partial withdrawal your Contract Value
does not exceed your Investment in the Contract, then the
withdrawal will not be includable in gross income and will
simply reduce your Investment.




Exceptions to this rule are distributions in full
discharge of your Contract (a full surrender) or distributions
from contracts issued and investments made before
August 14, 1982. The assignment or pledge of (or agreement
to assign or pledge) the value of the Contract for a loan will
be treated as a withdrawal subject to these rules. You should
consult your tax adviser for additional information regarding
taking a partial or a full distribution from your Contract.






Multiple Contracts (Aggregation
Rule)





Multiple Non-Qualified Contracts that are issued
after October 21, 1988, by us or our affiliates to the same
Owner during the same calendar year are treated as one Contract
for purposes of determining the taxation of distributions (the
amount includible in gross income under Code Section 72(e))
prior to the Annuity Date from any of the Contracts. A Contract
received in a tax-free exchange under Code Section 1035 may
be treated as a new Contract for this purpose. For Contracts
subject to the Aggregation Rule, the values of the Contracts and
the Investments in the Contracts should be added together to
determine the taxation under Code Section 72(e).
Withdrawals will be treated first as withdrawals of income until
all of the income from all such Contracts is withdrawn. The
Treasury Department has specific authority under Code Section
72(e)(11) to issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the
income-out-first rules for withdrawals prior to the Annuity Date
through the serial purchase of Contracts or otherwise. As of the
date of this Prospectus there are no regulations interpreting
these aggregation provisions.






10% Tax Penalty Applicable to Certain
Withdrawals and Annuity Payments





The Code provides that the taxable portion of a
withdrawal or other distribution may be subject to a tax penalty
equal to 10% of that taxable portion unless the withdrawal is:











 
• 

made on or after the date you reach age
  59 1/2,
  


 


 
• 

made by a Beneficiary after your death,
  


 


 
• 

attributable to your becoming disabled,
  


 




 
• 

any payment made under an immediate annuity,
  




 




 
• 

attributable to an investment in the Contract
  made prior to August 14, 1982, or
  




 




 
• 

any distribution that is a part of a series of
  substantially equal periodic payments (Code Section 72q
  payments) made (at least annually) over your life (or life
  expectancy) or the joint lives (or life expectancies) of you and
  your designated beneficiary.
  





Additional exceptions may apply to certain
Qualified Contracts (see the Taxes Payable on Annuity
Payments and the applicable Qualified Contracts
sections of this Prospectus).




Distributions After the Annuity Date



After you annuitize, a portion of each annuity
payment you receive under a Contract generally will be treated
as a partial recovery of Investments (as used here,
“Investments” means the aggregate Investments less any
amounts that were previously received under the Contract but not
included in income) and will not be taxable. (In certain
circumstances, subsequent modifications to an
initially-established payment pattern may result in the
imposition of a penalty tax.) The remainder of each annuity
payment will be taxed as ordinary income. However, after the
full amount of aggregate Investments has been recovered, the
full amount of each annuity payment will be taxed as ordinary
income. Exactly how an annuity payment is divided into taxable
and non-taxable portions depends on the period over which
annuity payments are expected to be received,

 

40




Table of Contents








which in turn is governed by the form of annuity
selected and, where a lifetime annuity is chosen, by the life
expectancy of the Annuitant(s) or payee(s). Such a payment may
also be subject to a tax penalty.






Distributions to Beneficiary After Contract Owner’s
Death





Generally, the same tax rules apply to amounts
received by the Beneficiary as those that apply to the Contract
Owner, except that the early withdrawal penalty tax does not
apply. Thus, any annuity payments or lump sum withdrawal will be
divided into taxable and non-taxable portions.






If within sixty days after the date on which a
lump sum death benefit first becomes payable and the Beneficiary
elects to receive annuity or life expectancy payments in lieu of
the lump sum death benefit, then the Beneficiary will not be
treated for tax purposes as having received the lump sum death
benefit in the tax year it first becomes payable. Rather, in
that case, the Beneficiary will be taxed on the annuity or life
expectancy payments as they are received.






If death occurs after the Annuity Date, but
before the expiration of a period certain option, the
Beneficiary will recover the balance of the Investments as
payments are made and may be allowed a deduction on the final
tax return for the unrecovered Investments. A lump sum payment
taken by the Beneficiary in lieu of remaining monthly annuity
payments is not considered an annuity payment for tax purposes.
The portion of any lump sum payment to a Beneficiary in excess
of aggregate unrecovered Investments would be subject to income
tax.






For additional information on death benefit
payouts, see the Death Benefits - Nonqualified
Contract Distribution Rules section of this Prospectus.






Contract Owner’s Estate





Generally, any amount payable to a Beneficiary
after the Contract Owner’s death, whether before or after
the Annuity Date, will be included in the estate of the Contract
Owner for federal estate tax purposes. If the inclusion of the
value of the Contract triggers a federal estate tax to be paid,
the Beneficiary may be able to use a deduction called Income in
Respect of Decedent (IRD) in calculating the income taxes
payable upon receipt of the death benefit proceeds. In addition,
designation of a non-spouse Beneficiary who either is
37 1/2 or more years younger than a Contract Owner or is a
grandchild of a Contract Owner may have Generation Skipping
Transfer Tax (GSTT) consequences under section 2601 of the
Code. You should consult with a qualified tax advisor if you
have questions about IRD or GSTT.






Gifts of Annuity Contracts





Generally, gifts of Non-Qualified Contracts prior
to the annuity start date will trigger tax reporting to the
donor on the gain on the Contract, with the donee getting a
stepped-up basis for the amount included in the donor’s
income. The 10% early withdrawal tax penalty and gift tax also
may be applicable. This provision does not apply to transfers
between spouses or incident to a divorce, or transfers to and
from a trust acting as agent for the Owner or the Owner’s
spouse.






Tax Withholding for Non-Qualified
Contracts





Unless you elect to the contrary, any amounts you
receive under your Contract that are attributable to investment
income will be subject to withholding to meet federal income tax
obligations. For nonperiodic distributions, you will have the
option to provide us with withholding information at the time of
your withdrawal request. If you do not provide us with
withholding information, we will generally withhold 10% of the
taxable distribution amount and remit it to the IRS. For
periodic (annuity) payments, the rate of withholding will be
determined on the basis of the withholding information you
provide to us with your application. If you do not provide us
with withholding information, we are required to determine the
withholding, from every annuity payment, as if you are a married
person with 3 exemptions.






Certain states have indicated that pension and
annuity withholding will apply to payments made to residents.
Generally, an election out of federal withholding will also be
considered an election out of state withholding.






Please call 1-800-722-4448 with any questions
about the required withholding information. Registered
Representatives may call us at 1-800-722-2333.






Tax Withholding for Nonresident Aliens or Non
U.S. Persons





Taxable distributions to Contract Owners who are
non-resident aliens or other non U.S. persons are generally
subject to U.S. federal income tax withholding at a 30% rate,
unless a lower treaty rate applies. Prospective foreign owners
are advised to consult with a tax advisor regarding the U.S.,
state and foreign tax treatment of a Contract.

Exchanges of Nonqualified Contracts (1035
Exchanges)





You may make your initial or an additional
Investment through an exchange of an existing annuity contract
or endowment life insurance contract pursuant to
Section 1035 of the Code (a 1035 exchange). The exchange
can be effected by completing the Transfer/Exchange form,
indicating in the appropriate section of the form that you are
making a 1035 exchange and submitting any applicable state
replacement form. The form is available by calling your
Registered Representative or by calling our Contract Owner
number at 1-800-722-4448. Registered Representatives can call
1-800-722-2333. Once completed, the form should be mailed to us,
along with the annuity contract or life insurance policy you are
exchanging. If you are making an initial Investment, a completed
Contract application should also be attached.




In general terms, Section 1035 of the Code
provides that no gain or loss is recognized when you exchange
one annuity or life insurance contract for another annuity
contract. Transactions under Section 1035, however, may be
subject to special rules and may require special procedures and
record keeping, particularly if the exchanged annuity contract
was issued prior to August 14, 1982. You should consult
your tax adviser prior to effecting a 1035 exchange.




Partial 1035 Exchanges





Rev. Proc. 2008-24 adopted the provisions of
Notice 2003-51, with some modifications, finalizing the
guidelines for partial 1035 exchanges. Under Rev. Proc. 2008-24,
the 24 month period is reduced to 12 months, so that a
partial exchange will be treated as tax-free under Code
Section 1035 if there are no distributions within
12 months of the partial 1035 exchange. Alternatively, a
partial 1035 exchange will be treated as tax-free under Code
Section 1035 if the taxpayer demonstrates that any distribution
taken within the 12 months is due to a specifically
identified condition that occurred between the date of the
partial transfer and the distribution (the conditions are death,
disability, attaining age 59 1/2, divorce or loss of
employment). Rev Proc. 2008-24 removes the subjective
element of Notice 2003-51 (whether the distribution was
contemplated at the time of the partial exchange). Also, Rev.
Proc. 2008-24 provides that if the partial exchange does
not qualify as a tax-free exchange under Code Section 1035,
it will be treated as a taxable distribution with a subsequent
repurchase, and that if the partial exchange is treated as
tax-free under Code Section 1035 and this Rev. Proc., the
two contracts will not be aggregated and treated as one
contract, but rather will be treated as two separate contracts
for tax and penalty purposes.






You should consult your tax adviser prior to
effecting a partial 1035 exchange.




Impact of Federal Income Taxes

In general, in the case of Non-Qualified
Contracts, if you are an individual and expect to accumulate
your Contract Value over a relatively long period of time
without making significant withdrawals, there may be federal
income tax advantages in purchasing such a Contract. This is
because any increase in Contract Value is not subject to current
taxation. Income taxes are deferred until the money is
withdrawn, at which point taxation occurs only on the gain from
the investment in the Contract. With income taxes deferred, you
may accumulate more money over the long term through a variable
annuity than you may through non-tax-deferred investments. The
advantage may be greater if you decide to liquidate your
Contract Value in the form of monthly annuity payments after
your retirement, or if your tax rate is lower at that time than
during the period that you held the Contract, or both.




When withdrawals or distributions are taken from
the variable annuity, the gain is taxed as ordinary income. This
may be a potential disadvantage because money that had been
invested in other types of assets may qualify for a more
favorable federal tax rate. For example, the tax rate applicable
both to the sale of capital gain assets held more than
1 year and to the receipt of qualifying dividends by
individuals is generally 15% (5% for lower-income individuals).
In contrast, an ordinary income tax rate of up to 35% applies to
taxable withdrawals on distributions from a variable annuity.
Also, withdrawals or distributions taken from a variable annuity
may be subject to a tax penalty equal to 10% of the taxable
portion, although exceptions to the tax penalty may apply.







An owner of a variable annuity cannot deduct or
offset losses on transfers to or from Subaccounts, or at the
time of any partial withdrawals. If you surrender your Contract
and your Net Contract Value is less than the aggregate of your
Investments in the Contract (reduced by any previous non-taxable
distributions), there may be a deductible ordinary income loss,
although the deduction may be limited. Consult with your tax
adviser regarding the impact of federal income taxes on your
specific situation.

Taxes on Pacific Life





Although the Separate Account is registered as an
investment company, it is not a separate taxpayer for purposes
of the Code. The earnings of the Separate Account are taxed as
part of our operations. No charge is made against the Separate
Account for our federal income taxes (excluding the charge for
premium taxes), but we will review, periodically, the question
of charges to the Separate Account or your Contract for such
taxes. Such a charge may be made in future years for any federal
income taxes that would be attributable to the Separate Account
or to our operations with respect to your Contract, or
attributable, directly or indirectly, to Investments on your
Contract.






Under current law, we may incur state and local
taxes (in addition to premium taxes) in several states. At
present, these taxes are not significant and they are not
charged against the Contract or the Separate Account. If there
is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws, the
imposition of any such taxes upon us that are attributable to
the Separate Account or to our operations with respect to your
Contract may result in a corresponding charge against the
Separate Account or your Contract.






Given the uncertainty of future changes in
applicable federal, state or local tax laws, we cannot
appropriately describe the effect a tax law change may have on
taxes that would be attributable to the Separate Account or your
Contract.






Qualified Contracts - General Rules





The Contracts are available to a variety of
Qualified Plans and IRAs. Tax restrictions and consequences for
Contracts under each type of Qualified Plan and IRAs differ from
each other and from those for Non-Qualified Contracts. No
attempt is made herein to provide more than general information
about the use of the Contract with the various types of
Qualified Plans and IRAs. Participants under such Qualified
Plans, as well as Contract Owners, Annuitants and Beneficiaries,
are cautioned that the rights of any person to any benefits
under such Qualified Plans may be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Plans themselves or limited by applicable law,
regardless of the terms and conditions of the Contract issued in
connection therewith.






Tax Deferral





It is important to know that Qualified Plans such
as 401(k)s, as well as IRAs, are already tax-deferred.
Therefore, an annuity contract should be used to fund an IRA or
Qualified Plan to benefit from the annuity’s features other
than tax deferral. The other benefits of using a variable
annuity to fund a Qualified Plan or an IRA include the lifetime
income options, guaranteed death benefit options and the ability
to transfer among investment options without sales or withdrawal
charges. You should consider if the Contract is a suitable
investment if you are investing through a Qualified Plan or IRA.






Taxes Payable





Generally, amounts received from Qualified
Contracts are taxed as ordinary income under Section 72, to
the extent that they are not treated as a tax free recovery of
after tax contributions. Different rules apply for Roth IRAs.
Consult your tax advisor before requesting a distribution from a
Qualified Contract.






10% Tax Penalty for Early
Withdrawals





Generally, distributions from IRAs and Qualified
Plans that occur before you attain age 59 1/2 are subject to a
10% tax penalty imposed on the amount of the distribution that
is includable in gross income, with certain exceptions. These
exceptions include distributions:













 
• 

made to a beneficiary after the
  owner’s/participant’s death,
  




 




 
• 

attributable to the owner/participant becoming
  disabled under Section 72(m)(7),
  




 




 
• 

that are part of a series of substantially equal
  periodic payments (also referred to as SEPPs or 72(t) payments)
  made (at least annually) over your life (or life expectancy) or
  the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of you and your
  designated beneficiary,
  




 




 
• 

for certain higher education expenses (IRAs only),
  




 




 
• 

used to pay for certain health insurance premiums
  or medical expenses (IRAs only),
  




 




 
• 

for costs related to the purchase of your first
  home (IRAs only), and
  




 




 
• 

(except for IRAs) made to an employee after
  separation from service after reaching age 55 (or age 50 in the
  case of a qualified public safety employee).

Tax Withholding for Qualified
Contracts





Distributions from a Contract under a Qualified
Plan (not including an individual retirement annuity subject to
Code Section 408 or Code Section 408A) to an employee,
surviving spouse, or former spouse who is an alternate payee
under a qualified domestic relations order, in the form of a
lump sum settlement or periodic annuity payments for a fixed
period of fewer than 10 years are subject to mandatory
income tax withholding of 20% of the taxable amount of the
distribution, unless:













 
• 

the distributee directs the transfer of such
  amounts in cash to another Qualified Plan or a traditional IRA,
  or
  




 




 
• 

the payment is a minimum distribution required
  under the Code.
  







The taxable amount is the amount of the
distribution less the amount allocable to after-tax
contributions. All other types of taxable distributions are
subject to withholding unless the distributee elects not to have
withholding apply.






Certain states have indicated that pension and
annuity withholding will apply to payments made to residents.
Generally, an election out of federal withholding will also be
considered an election out of state withholding.






Required Minimum Distributions





The regulations provide that you cannot keep
assets in Qualified Plans or IRAs indefinitely. Eventually they
are required to be distributed; at that time (the Required
Beginning Date (RBD)), Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) are
the amount that must be distributed each year.






Under Section 401 of the Code (for Qualified
Plans) and Section 408 of the Code (for IRAs), the entire
interest under the Contract must be distributed to the Owner/
Annuitant no later than the Owner/ Annuitant’s RBD, or
distributions over the life of the Owner/ Annuitant (or the
Owner/ Annuitant and his beneficiary) must begin no later than
the RBD.






The RBD for distributions from a Qualified
Contract maintained for an IRA under Section 408 of the
Code is generally April 1 of the calendar year following
the year in which the Owner/ Annuitant reaches age 70 1/2. The
RBD for a Qualified Contract maintained for a qualified
retirement or pension plan under Section 401 of the Code or
a Section 403(b) annuity is April 1 of the calendar
year following the later of the year in which the Owner/
Annuitant reached 70 1/2, or, if the plan so provides, the year
in which the Owner/ Annuitant retires. There is no RBD for a
Roth IRA maintained pursuant to Section 408A of the Code.






The IRS issued Final and Temporary Regulations on
April 17, 2002 (“Final Regulations”). Effective
January 1, 2003, the IRS requires that all IRA holders and
Qualified Plan Participants (with one exception discussed below)
use the Uniform Lifetime Table to calculate their RMDs.






The Uniform Lifetime Table is based on a joint
life expectancy and uses the IRA owner’s actual age and
assumes that the beneficiary is 10 years younger than the
IRA owner. Note that under these Final Regulations, the IRA
owner does not need to actually have a named beneficiary when
they turn 70 1/2.






The exception noted above is for an IRA owner who
has a spouse, who is more than 10 years younger, as the
sole beneficiary on the IRA. In that situation, the
spouse’s actual age (and life expectancy) will be used in
the joint life calculation.






If the Owner/Annuitant dies prior to his RBD or
complete distribution from the Qualified Contract, the remainder
shall be distributed as provided in the “Qualified Contract
Distribution Rules” section of this Prospectus. For
non-spouse beneficiaries, life expectancy is initially computed
by use of the Single Life Table of the Final Regulations
(Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-9). Subsequent life
expectancy shall be calculated by reducing the life expectancy
of the Beneficiary by one in each following calendar year.






For calendar year 2003 and thereafter, taxpayers
(and the underlying Qualified Plan) must rely on the Final and
Temporary Regulations (discussed above) for determining RMDs. If
any future guidance from the IRS is more restrictive than the
guidance in these Final and Temporary Regulations, the future
guidance will be issued without retroactive effect.






The method of distribution selected must comply
with the minimum distribution rules of Code
Section 401(a)(9), and the applicable proposed Regulations
thereunder.






Actuarial Value





In accordance with recent changes in laws and
regulations, RMDs may be calculated based on the sum of the
contract value and the actuarial value of any additional death
benefits and benefits from optional riders that you have
purchased under the Contract. As a result, RMDs may be larger
than if the calculation were based on the contract value only,
which may in turn

Table of Contents








result in an earlier (but not before the required
beginning date) distribution under the Contract and an increased
amount of taxable income distributed to the contract owner, and
a reduction of death benefits and the benefits of any optional
riders.






RMDs and Annuity Options





Under the Final Regulations, for retirement plans
that qualify under Section 401 or 408 of the Code, the
period elected for receipt of RMDs as annuity payments under
Annuity Options 2 and 4 generally may be:













 
• 

no longer than the joint life expectancy of the
  Annuitant and Beneficiary in the year that the Annuitant reaches
  age 70 1/2, and
  




 




 
• 

must be shorter than such joint life expectancy
  if the Beneficiary is not the Annuitant’s spouse and is
  more than 10 years younger than the Annuitant.
  







Under Annuity Option 3, if the Beneficiary
is not the Annuitant’s spouse and is more than
10 years younger than the Annuitant, the 66 2/3% and 100%
elections specified below may not be available. The restrictions
on options for retirement plans that qualify under
Sections 401 and 408 also apply to a retirement plan that
qualifies under Section 403(b) with respect to amounts that
accrued after December 31, 1986.






Loans





Certain Owners of Qualified Contracts may borrow
against their Contracts. Otherwise loans from us are not
permitted. You may request a loan from us, using your Contract
Value as your only security if yours is a Qualified Contract
that is:













 
• 

not subject to Title 1 of ERISA,
  




 




 
• 

issued under Section 403(b) of the Code, and
  




 




 
• 

permits loans under its terms (a “Loan
  Eligible Plan”).
  







You may have only one loan outstanding at any
time. The minimum loan amount is $1,000, subject to certain
state limitations. Your Contract Debt at the effective date of
your loan may not exceed the lesser of:













 
• 

50% of your Contract Value, or
  




 




 
• 

$50,000 less your highest outstanding Contract
  Debt during the 12-month period immediately preceding the
  effective date of your loan.
  







If your request for a loan is processed, you will
be charged interest on your Contract Debt at a fixed annual rate
equal to 5%. The amount held in the Loan Account to secure your
loan will earn a return equal to an annual rate of 3%. This loan
rate may vary by state.






Interest charges accrue on your Contract Debt
daily, beginning on the effective date of your loan. Interest
earned on the Loan Account Value accrue daily beginning on the
day following the effective date of the loan, and those earnings
will be transferred once a year to your Investment Options in
accordance with your most recent allocation instructions. For
more information about loans, including the consequences of
loans, loan procedures, loan terms and repayment terms, see the
SAI.






We may change these loan provisions to reflect
changes in the Code or interpretations thereof. We urge you
to consult with a qualified tax adviser prior to effecting any
loan transaction under your Contract.






IRAs and Qualified Plans





The following is only a general discussion
about types of IRAs and Qualified Plans for which the Contracts
are available. We are not the administrator of any Qualified
Plan. The plan administrator and/or custodian, whichever is
applicable, (but not us) is responsible for all Plan
administrative duties including, but not limited to,
notification of distribution options, disbursement of Plan
benefits, handling any processing and administration of
Qualified Plan loans, compliance regulatory requirements and
federal and state tax reporting of income/ distributions from
the Plan to Plan participants and, if applicable, Beneficiaries
of Plan participants and IRA contributions from Plan
participants. Our administrative duties are limited to
administration of the Contract and any disbursements of any
Contract benefits to the Owner, Annuitant, or Beneficiary of the
Contract, as applicable. Our tax reporting responsibility is
limited to federal and state tax reporting of income/
distributions to the applicable payee and IRA contributions from
the Owner of a Contract, as recorded on our books and records.
The Qualified Plan (the plan administrator or the custodian) is
required to provide us with information regarding individuals
with signatory authority on the Contract(s) owned. If you are
purchasing a Qualified Contract, you

Table of Contents








should consult with your plan administrator
and/or a qualified tax adviser. You should also consult with a
qualified tax adviser and/or plan administrator before you
withdraw any portion of your Contract Value.



Individual Retirement Annuities
(“IRAs”)



In addition to “traditional” IRAs
established under Code 408, there are SEP IRAs under Code
Section 408(k), Roth IRAs governed by Code Section 408A and
SIMPLE IRAs established under Code Section 408(p). Also,
Qualified Plans under Section 401, 403(b), or 457(b) of the
Code that include after-tax employee contributions may be
treated as deemed IRAs subject to the same rules and limitations
as traditional IRAs. Contributions to each of these types of
IRAs are subject to differing limitations. The following is a
very general description of each type of IRA and other Qualified
Plans.




Traditional IRAs



Traditional IRAs are subject to limitations on
the amount that may be contributed each year, the persons who
may be eligible to contribute, when rollovers are available and
when distributions must commence. Depending upon the
circumstances of the individual, contributions to a traditional
IRA may be made on a deductible or non-deductible basis.






Annual contributions are generally allowed for
persons who have not attained age 70 1/2 and who have
compensation (as defined by the IRS) of at least the
contribution amount. Distributions of minimum amounts specified
by the Code must commence by April 1 of the calendar year
following the calendar year in which you attain age 70 1/2.
Failure to make mandatory minimum distributions may result in
imposition of a 50% tax penalty on any difference between the
required distribution amount and the amount actually
distributed. Additional distribution rules apply after your
death.






You (or your surviving spouse if you die) may
rollover funds (such as proceeds from existing insurance
policies, annuity contracts or securities) from certain existing
Qualified Plans into your traditional IRA if those funds are in
cash. This will require you to liquidate any value accumulated
under the existing Qualified Plan. Mandatory withholding of 20%
may apply to any rollover distribution from your existing
Qualified Plan if the distribution is not transferred directly
to your traditional IRA. To avoid this withholding you should
have cash transferred directly from the insurance company or
plan trustee to your traditional IRA.




SIMPLE IRAs



The Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of
Small Employers (“SIMPLE Plan”) is a type of IRA
established under Code Section 408(p)(2). Depending upon
the SIMPLE Plan, employers may make plan contributions into a
SIMPLE IRA established by each participant of the SIMPLE Plan.
Like other IRAs, a 10% tax penalty is imposed on certain
distributions that occur before an employee attains age 59
1/2. In addition, the tax penalty is increased to 25% for
amounts received or rolled to another IRA or Qualified Plan
during the 2-year period beginning on the date an employee first
participated in a qualified salary reduction arrangement
pursuant to a SIMPLE Plan maintained by their employer.
Contributions to a SIMPLE IRA will generally include employee
salary deferral contributions and employer contributions.
Distributions from a SIMPLE IRA may be transferred to another
SIMPLE IRA tax free or may be eligible for tax free rollover to
a traditional IRA, a 403(b), a 457(b) or other Qualified Plan
after the required 2-year period.






SEP-IRAs





A Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) is an
employer sponsored retirement plan under which an employer is
allowed to make contributions toward their employees’
retirement, as well as their own retirement (if the employer is
self-employed). A SEP is a type of IRA established under Code
Section 408(k). Under a SEP, a separate IRA account called a
SEP-IRA is set up by or for each eligible employee and the
employer makes the contribution to the account. Like other IRAs,
a 10% tax penalty is imposed on certain distributions that occur
before an employee attains age 59 1/2.




Roth IRAs

Section 408A of the Code permits eligible
individuals to establish a Roth IRA. Contributions to a Roth IRA
are not deductible, but withdrawals of amounts contributed and
the earnings thereon that meet certain requirements are not
subject to federal income tax. In general, Roth IRAs are subject
to limitations on the amount that may be contributed and the
persons who may be eligible to contribute and are subject to
certain required distribution rules on the death of the Contract
Owner. Unlike a traditional IRA, Roth IRAs are not subject to
minimum required distribution rules during the Contract
Owner’s lifetime. Generally, however, the amount remaining
in a Roth IRA must be distributed by the end of the fifth year
after the death of the Contract Owner/ Annuitant or distributed
over the life expectancy of the Designated Beneficiary. The
owner of a traditional

 

46




Table of Contents






IRA may convert a traditional IRA into a Roth IRA
under certain circumstances. The conversion of a traditional IRA
to a Roth IRA will subject the amount of the converted
traditional IRA to federal income tax. Anyone considering the
purchase of a Qualified Contract as a Roth IRA or a
“conversion” Roth IRA should consult with a qualified
tax adviser.


In accordance with recent changes in laws and
regulations, at the time of either a full or partial conversion
from a Traditional IRA annuity to a Roth IRA annuity, the
determination of the amount to be reported as income will be
based on the annuity contract’s “fair market
value”, which will include all front-end loads and other
non-recurring charges assessed in the 12 months immediately
preceding the conversion, and the actuarial present value of any
additional contract benefits.


Tax Sheltered Annuities
(“TSAs”)



Employees of certain tax-exempt organizations,
such as public schools or hospitals, may defer compensation
through an eligible plan under Code Section 403(b). Salary
deferral amounts received from employers for these employees are
excludable from the employees’ gross income (subject to
maximum contribution limits). Distributions under these
Contracts must comply with certain limitations as to timing, or
result in tax penalties. Distributions from amounts contributed
to a TSA pursuant to a salary reduction arrangement, may be made
from a TSA only upon attaining age 59 1/2, severance from
employment, death, disability, or financial hardship.
Section 403(b) annuity distributions can be rolled over to
other Qualified Plans in a manner similar to those permitted by
Qualified Plans that are maintained pursuant to Section 401
of the Code.






In accordance with Code Section 403(b) and
final regulations published on July 26, 2007 (“Final
Regulations”), as of January 1, 2009 (or earlier if we
or your 403(b) employer has entered into an agreement pursuant
to the Final Regulations), we are required to provide
information regarding loans or hardship distributions from your
Contract to your 403(b) employer or an agent of your 403(b)
employer, upon request. In addition, prior to processing your
request for a loan, a hardship distribution or a rollover, we
are required to verify certain information about you with your
403(b) employer (or if applicable, former 403(b) employer).






Section 457(b) Non-Qualified Deferred
Compensation Plans





Certain employees of governmental entities or tax
exempt employers may defer compensation through an eligible plan
under Code section 457(b). Contributions to a Contract of
an eligible plan are subject to limitations. Subject to plan
provisions and a qualifying triggering event, assets in a
Section 457(b) plan established by a governmental entity
may be transferred or rolled into an IRA or another Qualified
Plan, if the Qualified Plan allows the transfer or rollover. If
a rollover to an IRA is completed, the assets become subject to
IRA rules, including the 10% penalty on distributions prior to
age 59 1/2. Assets from other plans may be rolled into a
governmental 457(b) plan if the 457(b) plan allows the rollover
and if the investment provider is able to segregate the assets
for tax reporting purposes. Consult both the distributing plan
and the receiving plan prior to making this election. Assets in
a 457(b) plan set up by a tax exempt employer may not be rolled
to a different type of Qualified Plan or IRA at any time.






401(k) Plans; Pension and Profit-Sharing
Plans



Qualified Plans may be established by an employer
for certain eligible employees under Section 401 of the
Code. These plans may be 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans, or
other pension or retirement plans. Contributions to these plans
are subject to limitations. Rollover to other eligible plans may
be available. Please consult your Qualified Plans Summary Plan
description for more information.





ADDITIONAL INFORMATION



Voting Rights



We are the legal owner of the shares of the
Portfolios held by the Subaccounts. We may vote on any matter
voted on at shareholders’ meetings of the Funds. However,
our current interpretation of applicable law requires us to vote
the number of shares attributable to your Variable Account Value
(your “voting interest”) in accordance with your
directions.




We will pass proxy materials on to you so that
you have an opportunity to give us voting instructions for your
voting interest. You may provide your instructions by proxy or
in person at the shareholders’ meeting. If there are shares
of a Portfolio held by a Subaccount for which we do not
receive timely voting instructions, we will vote those shares in
the same proportion as all other shares of that Portfolio held
by that Subaccount for which we have received timely
voting instructions. If we do not receive any voting
instructions for the shares in a Separate Account, we will vote
the shares in that Separate Account in the same proportion as
the total votes for all of our separate accounts for which
we’ve received timely instructions. If we hold

 

47




Table of Contents






shares of a Portfolio in our General Account, we
will vote such shares in the same proportion as the total votes
cast for all of our separate accounts, including Separate
Account B. We will vote shares of any Portfolio held by our
non-insurance affiliates in the same proportion as the total
votes for all separate accounts of ours and our insurance
affiliates. As a result of proportional voting, the votes cast
by a small number of Contract Owners may determine the outcome
of a vote.


We may elect, in the future, to vote shares of
the Portfolios held in Separate Account B in our own right if we
are permitted to do so through a change in applicable federal
securities laws or regulations, or in their interpretation.


The number of Portfolio shares that form the
basis for your voting interest is determined as of the record
date set by the Board of Trustees of the Fund. It is equal to:









 
• 

your Contract Value allocated to the Subaccount
  corresponding to that Portfolio, divided by
  


 


 
• 

the net asset value per share of that Portfolio.
  



Fractional votes will be counted. We reserve the
right, if required or permitted by a change in federal
regulations or their interpretation, to amend how we calculate
your voting interest.


After your Annuity Date, if you have selected a
variable annuity, the voting rights under your Contract will
continue during the payout period of your annuity, but the
number of shares that form the basis for your voting interest,
as described above, will decrease throughout the payout period.





Changes to Your Contract

Contract Owner(s) and Contingent
Owner

Transfer of Contract ownership may involve
federal income tax and/or gift tax consequences; you should
consult a qualified tax adviser before effecting such a
transfer. A change to or from joint Contract ownership is
considered a transfer of ownership. If your Contract is
Non-Qualified, you may change Contract ownership at any time
while the Annuitant is living and prior to your Annuity Date.
You may name a different Owner or add or remove a Joint Owner or
Contingent Owner. A Contract cannot name more than two Contract
Owners (either as Joint or Contingent Owners) at any time. Any
newly-named Contract Owners, including Joint and/or Contingent
Owners, must be under the age of 86 at the time of change or
addition. If there are Joint Owners, the Contract will be owned
as Joint Tenants With Right of Survivorship and not as Tenants
in Common. The Contract Owner(s) may make all decisions
regarding the Contract, including making allocation decisions
and exercising voting rights. Transactions under a Contract with
Joint Owners require approval from both Owners.




If your Contract is Qualified under Code
Sections 401 or 457(b), the Qualified Plan must be the sole
Owner of the Contract and the ownership cannot be changed unless
and until a triggering event has been met under the terms of the
Qualified Plan. Upon such event, the ownership can only be
changed to the Annuitant. If your Contract is Qualified under
Code Sections 408 and 403(b), you must be the sole Owner of
the Contract and no changes can be made.




Annuitant and Contingent or Joint
Annuitant

Your sole Annuitant cannot be changed, and Joint
Annuitants cannot be added or changed, once your Contract is
issued. Certain changes may be permitted in connection with
Contingent Annuitants. See the ANNUITIZATION AND DEATH
BENEFITS— Selecting Your Annuitant section in this
Prospectus. There may be limited exceptions for certain
Qualified Contracts.


Beneficiaries

Your Beneficiary is the person(s) or entity who
may receive death benefit proceeds under your Contract or any
remaining annuity payments after the Annuity Date if the
Annuitant or Owner dies. You may change or remove your
Beneficiary or add Beneficiaries at any time prior to the death
of the Annuitant or Owner, as applicable. Any change or addition
will generally take effect only when we receive all necessary
documents, in proper form, at our Service Center and we record
the change or addition. Any change or addition will not affect
any payment made or any other action taken by us before the
change or addition was received and recorded.


Spousal consent may be required to change the
Beneficiary of an IRA. If you have named your Beneficiary
irrevocably, you will need to obtain that Beneficiary’s
consent before making any changes. Qualified Contracts may have
additional restrictions on naming and changing Beneficiaries. If
your Contract was issued in connection with a Qualified Plan
subject to Title I of ERISA, contact your Plan
Administrator for details. We require that Contracts issued
under Code Sections 401 and 457(b)

 

48




Table of Contents






name the Plan as Beneficiary. If you leave no
surviving Beneficiary or Contingent Beneficiary, your estate
will receive any death benefit proceeds under your Contract.





Changes to All Contracts

If, in the judgment of our management, continued
investment by Separate Account B in one or more of the
Portfolios becomes unsuitable or unavailable, we may seek to
alter the Variable Investment Options available under the
Contracts. We do not expect that a Portfolio will become
unsuitable, but unsuitability issues could arise due to changes
in investment policies, market conditions, tax laws, or due to
marketing or other reasons.


Alterations of Variable Investment Options may
take differing forms. We reserve the right to substitute shares
of any Portfolio that were already purchased under any Contract
(or shares that were to be purchased in the future under a
Contract) with shares of another Portfolio, shares of another
investment company or series of another investment company, or
another investment vehicle. We may also purchase, through a
Subaccount, other securities for other series or other classes
of contracts, and may permit conversions or exchanges between
series or classes of contracts on the basis of Contract Owner
requests. Required approvals of the SEC and state insurance
regulators will be obtained before any such substitutions are
effected, and you will be notified of any planned substitution.




We may add new Subaccounts to Separate Account B
and any new Subaccounts may invest in Portfolios of a Fund or in
other investment vehicles. Availability of any new Subaccounts
to existing Contract Owners will be determined at our
discretion. We will notify you, and will comply with the filing
or other procedures established by applicable state insurance
regulators, to the extent required by applicable law. We also
reserve the right, after receiving any required regulatory
approvals, to do any of the following:











 
• 

cease offering any Subaccount;
  


 


 
• 

combine Subaccounts;
  


 


 
• 

delete or substitute Subaccounts;
  


 


 
• 

combine Separate Account B or part of it
  with another of our separate accounts or with any of our
  affiliates’ separate accounts;
  


 


 
• 

transfer Separate Account B assets
  attributable to the Contracts to another of our separate
  accounts;
  


 


 
• 

deregister the Separate Account under the 1940
  Act;
  


 


 
• 

operate Separate Account B as a management
  investment company under the 1940 Act or another form permitted
  by law;
  


 


 
• 

establish a committee, board or other group to
  manage aspects of the Separate Account’s operations;
  


 


 
• 

make any changes required by the 1940 Act or
  other federal securities laws;
  


 


 
• 

make any changes necessary to maintain the status
  of the Contracts as annuities under the Code;
  


 


 
• 

make other changes required under federal or
  state law relating to annuities; and
  


 


 
• 

suspend or discontinue sale of the Contracts.

The effective date of certain notices or of
instructions is determined by the date and time on which we
“receive” the notice or instructions. We
“receive” this information only when it arrives, in
proper form, at the correct mailing address set out above. In
those instances when we receive electronic transmission of the
information on the application from your representative’s
broker-dealer firm and our administrative procedures with your
broker-dealer so provide, we consider the application to be
received on the Business Day we receive the transmission. If the
address on your Contract specification pages is different and
our administrative procedures with your broker-dealer so
provide, in those instances when information regarding your
Investment is electronically transmitted to us by the
broker-dealer, we will consider the Investment to be received by
us on the Business Day we receive the transmission of the
information. Please call us at 1-800-722-4448 if you have any
questions regarding which address you should use. Registered
Representatives may call us at 1-800-722-2333.


We reserve the right to process any Investment
received at an incorrect address when it is received at either
the address indicated in your Contract specification pages or
the appropriate address indicated in the Prospectus.




Investments after your initial Investment, loan
requests, transfer requests, loan repayments and withdrawal
requests we receive before the close of the New York Stock
Exchange, which usually closes at 4:00 p.m. Eastern time, will
normally be effective at the end of the same Business Day that
we receive them in “proper form,” unless the
transaction or event is scheduled to occur on another day.
Generally, whenever you submit any other form, notice or
request, your instructions will be effective on the next
Business Day after we receive them in “proper form”
unless the transaction or event is scheduled to occur on another
day. “Proper form” means in a form satisfactory to us
and may require, among other things, a signature guarantee or
other verification of authenticity. We do not generally require
a signature guarantee unless it appears that your signature may
have changed over time or the signature does not appear to be
yours; or an executed application or confirmation of
application, as applicable, in proper form is not received by
us; or, to protect you or us. Requests regarding death benefit
proceeds must be accompanied by both proof of death and
instructions regarding payment satisfactory to us. You should
call your registered representative or us if you have questions
regarding the required form of a request.







Telephone and Electronic
Transactions

You are automatically entitled to make certain
transactions by telephone or, to the extent available,
electronically. You may also authorize other people to make
certain transaction requests by telephone or, to the extent
available, electronically by so indicating on the application or
by sending us instructions in writing in a form acceptable to
us. We cannot guarantee that you or any other person you
authorize will always be able to reach us to complete a
telephone or electronic transaction; for example, all telephone
lines may be busy or access to our website may be unavailable
during certain periods, such as periods of substantial market
fluctuations or other drastic economic or market change, or
telephones or the Internet may be out of service or unavailable
during severe weather conditions or other emergencies. Under
these circumstances, you should submit your request in writing
(or other form acceptable to us). Transaction instructions we
receive by telephone or electronically before the close of the
New York Stock Exchange, which usually closes at 4:00 p.m.
Eastern time, on any Business Day will usually be effective at
the end of that day, and we will provide you confirmation of
each telephone or electronic transaction.


We have established procedures reasonably
designed to confirm that instructions communicated by telephone
or electronically are genuine. These procedures may require any
person requesting a telephone or electronic transaction to
provide certain personal identification upon our request. We may
also record all or part of any telephone conversation with
respect to transaction instructions. We reserve the right to
deny any transaction request made by telephone or
electronically. You are authorizing us to accept and to act upon
instructions received by telephone or electronically with
respect to your Contract, and you agree that, so long as we
comply with our procedures, neither we, any of our affiliates,
nor any Fund, or any of their directors, trustees, officers,
employees or agents will be liable for any loss, liability, cost
or expense (including attorneys’ fees) in connection with
requests that we believe to be genuine. This policy means that
so long as we comply with our procedures, you

 

50




Table of Contents






will bear the risk of loss arising out of the
telephone or electronic transaction privileges of your Contract.
If a Contract has Joint Owners, each Owner may individually make
telephone and/or electronic transaction requests.





Electronic Delivery Authorization

Subject to availability, you may authorize us to
provide Prospectuses, statements, and other information
(“documents”) electronically by so indicating on the
application, via telephone, or by sending us instructions in
writing in a form acceptable to us to receive such documents
electronically. You must provide us with a current and active
e-mail address and have Internet access to use this service.
While we impose no additional charge for this service, there may
be potential costs associated with electronic delivery, such as
on-line charges. Documents will be available on our Internet
website. You may access and print all documents provided through
this service. As documents become available, we will notify you
of this by sending you an e-mail message that will include
instructions on how to retrieve the document. You are
responsible for any e-mail filters that may prevent you from
receiving e-mail notifications and for notifying us promptly in
the event that your e-mail address changes. You may revoke your
consent for electronic delivery at any time, provided that we
are properly notified, and we will then start providing you with
a paper copy of all required documents. We will provide you with
paper copies at any time upon request. Such a request will not
constitute revocation of your consent to receive required
documents electronically.





Timing of Payments and Transactions



For withdrawals, including exchanges under Code
Section 1035 and other Qualified transfers, from the
Variable Investment Options or for death benefit payments
attributable to your Variable Account Value, we will normally
send the proceeds within 7 calendar days after your request
is effective or after the Notice Date, as the case may be. We
will normally effect periodic annuity payments on the day that
corresponds to the Annuity Date and will make payment on the
following day. Payments or transfers may be suspended for a
longer period under certain extraordinary circumstances. These
include: a closing of the New York Stock Exchange other than on
a regular holiday or weekend; a trading restriction imposed by
the SEC; or an emergency declared by the SEC. Amounts withdrawn
or transferred from any fixed-rate General Account Investment
Option may be delayed for up to six months after the request is
effective. See THE GENERAL ACCOUNT section in this
Prospectus for more details.







Confirmations, Statements and Other Reports to
Contract Owners



Confirmations will be sent out for unscheduled
Investments and transfers, loans, loan repayments, unscheduled
partial withdrawals, a full withdrawal and on payment of any
death benefit proceeds. Periodically, we will send you a
statement that provides certain information pertinent to your
Contract. These statements disclose Contract Value, Subaccount
values, any fixed option values, fees and charges applied to
your Contract Value, transactions made and specific Contract
data that apply to your Contract. Confirmations of your
transactions under the pre-authorized checking plan, dollar cost
averaging, earnings sweep, portfolio rebalancing, and
pre-authorized withdrawal options will appear on your quarterly
account statements. Your fourth-quarter statement will contain
annual information about your Contract Value and transactions.
You may also access these statements online.






If you suspect an error on a confirmation or
quarterly statement, you must notify us in writing as soon as
possible to ensure proper accounting to your Contract. When you
write, tell us your name, contract number and a description of
the suspected error. We assume transactions are accurate unless
you notify us otherwise within 30 days of receiving the
transaction confirmation or, if the transaction is first
confirmed on the quarterly statement, within 30 days of
receiving the quarterly statement. All transactions are deemed
final and may not be changed after the applicable 30 day
period.






You will also be sent an annual report for the
Separate Account and the Funds and a list of the securities held
in each Portfolio of the Funds, as required by the 1940 Act; or
more frequently if required by law.






Contract Owner
Mailings. To help reduce expenses,
environmental waste and the volume of mail you receive, only one
copy of Contract Owner documents (such as the prospectus,
supplements, announcements, and each annual and semi-annual
report) may be mailed to Contract Owners who share the same
household address (Householding). If you are already
participating, you may opt out by contacting us. Please allow 30
calendar days for regular delivery to resume. You may also elect
to participate in Householding by writing to us. The current
documents are available on our website any time or an individual
copy of any of these documents may be requested — see
the last page of this Prospectus for more information.

Distribution Arrangements

PSD, a broker-dealer and our subsidiary, pays
various forms of sales compensation to broker-dealers (including
other affiliates) that solicit applications for the Contracts.
PSD also may reimburse other expenses associated with the
promotion and solicitation of applications for the Contracts.




We offer the Contracts for sale through
broker-dealers that have entered into selling agreements with
PSD. Broker-dealers sell the Contracts through their registered
representatives. PSD pays compensation to broker-dealers for the
promotion and sale of the Contracts. The individual registered
representative who sells you a Contract typically will receive a
portion of the compensation, under the representative’s own
arrangement with his or her broker-dealer. Broker-dealers may
receive aggregate commissions of up to 6.50% of your aggregate
Purchase Payments. Under certain circumstances where PSD pays
lower initial commissions, certain broker-dealers that solicit
applications for Contracts may be paid an ongoing persistency
trail commission (sometimes called a residual) which will take
into account, among other things, the Account Value and the
length of time Purchase Payments have been held under a
Contract. A trail commission is not anticipated to exceed 1.50%,
on an annual basis, of the Account Value considered in
connection with the trail commission. Certain broker-dealers may
also be paid an amount under a persistency program which will be
based on assets under management and duration of Contracts. The
amount under the persistency program for a registered
representative is not expected to exceed .25% of their total
assets under management.




We may also provide compensation to
broker-dealers for providing ongoing service in relation to
Contracts that have already been purchased.


Additional Compensation and Revenue
Sharing



To the extent permitted by SEC and FINRA rules
and other applicable laws and regulations, selling
broker-dealers may receive additional payments in the form of
cash, other special compensation or reimbursement of expenses,
sometimes called “revenue sharing”. These additional
compensation or reimbursement arrangements may include, for
example, payments in connection with the firm’s “due
diligence” examination of the contracts, payments for
providing conferences or seminars, sales or training programs
for invited registered representatives and other employees,
payments for travel expenses, including lodging, incurred by
registered representatives and other employees for such seminars
or training programs, seminars for the public, advertising and
sales campaigns regarding the Contracts, and payments to assist
a firm in connection with its administrative systems, operations
and marketing expenses and/or other events or activities
sponsored by the firms. Subject to applicable FINRA rules and
other applicable laws and regulations, PSD and its affiliates
may contribute to, as well as sponsor, various educational
programs, sales contests and/or promotions in which
participating firms and their salespersons may receive prizes
such as merchandise, cash, or other awards. Such additional
compensation may give us greater access to registered
representatives of the broker-dealers that receive such
compensation or may otherwise influence the way that a
broker-dealer and registered representative market the Contracts.




These arrangements may not be applicable to all
firms, and the terms of such arrangements may differ between
firms. We provide additional information on special compensation
or reimbursement arrangements involving selling firms and other
financial institutions in the Statement of Additional
Information, which is available upon request. Any such
compensation will not result in any additional direct charge to
you by us.


The compensation and other benefits provided by
PSD or its affiliates may be more or less than the overall
compensation on similar or other products. This may influence
your registered representative or broker-dealer to present this
Contract over other investment options available in the
marketplace. You may ask your registered representative about
these differing and divergent interests, how he/she is
personally compensated and how his/her broker-dealer is
compensated for soliciting applications for the Contract.





Service Arrangements

PSD shall pay American Funds Distributors, Inc.
at a rate of 0.16% of Purchase Payments up to $1.5 billion,
0.14% on Purchase Payments on next $1.5 billion and 0.10%
on Purchase Payments made in excess, attributable to the Master
Funds for certain marketing assistance.





Replacement of Life Insurance or
Annuities

The term “replacement” has a special
meaning in the life insurance industry and is described more
fully below. Before you make your purchase decision, we want you
to understand how a replacement may impact your existing plan of
insurance.

 

52




Table of Contents






A policy “replacement” occurs when a
new policy or contract is purchased and, in connection with the
sale, an existing policy or contract is surrendered, lapsed,
forfeited, assigned to the replacing insurer, otherwise
terminated, or used in a financed purchase. A “financed
purchase” occurs when the purchase of a new life insurance
policy or annuity contract involves the use of funds obtained
from the values of an existing life insurance policy or annuity
contract through withdrawal, surrender or loan.


There are circumstances in which replacing your
existing life insurance policy or annuity contract can benefit
you. As a general rule, however, replacement is not in your best
interest. Accordingly, you should make a careful comparison of
the costs and benefits of your existing policy or contract and
the proposed policy or contract to determine whether replacement
is in your best interest.






State Considerations






Certain Contract features described in this
Prospectus may vary or may not be available in your state. The
state in which your Contract is issued governs whether or not
certain features, Riders, charges or fees are available or will
vary under your Contract. These variations are reflected in your
Contract and in Riders or Endorsements to your Contract. See
your Registered Representative or contact us for specific
information that may be applicable to your state.





For Contracts issued in the state of
Pennsylvania, any person who knowingly and with intent to
defraud any insurance company or other person files an
application for insurance or statement of claim containing any
materially false information or conceals for the purpose of
misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto
commits a fraudulent insurance act, which is a crime and
subjects such person to criminal and civil penalties.






In addition, you understand that benefits and
values provided under the Contract may be on a variable basis.
Amounts directed into one or more variable Investment Options
will reflect the investment experience of those Investment
Options. These amounts may increase or decrease and are not
guaranteed as to a dollar amount.






California applicants age 60 or
older





For residents of the state of California
60 years of age or older, the Free Look period is a 30-day
period beginning on the day you receive your Contract. If you
are a California applicant age 60 or older and your Contract is
delivered or issued for delivery on or after July 1, 2004,
you must elect, at the time you apply for your Contract, to
receive a return of either your Purchase Payments or your
Contract Value proceeds if you exercise your Right to Cancel and
return your Contract to us.






If you elect to receive the return of Purchase
Payments option, the following will apply













 
• 

We will allocate all or any portion of any
  Purchase Payment we receive to any available fixed option if you
  instruct us to do so. We will allocate all or any portion of any
  Purchase Payment designated for any Variable Investment Option
  to the Money Market Subaccount until the Free Look Transfer
  Date. The Free Look Transfer Date is 30 days from the
  Contract Date. On the Free Look Transfer Date, we will
  automatically transfer your Money Market Subaccount Value
  according to the instructions on your application, or your most
  recent instruction, if any. This automatic transfer to the
  Variable Investment Options according to your initial allocation
  instruction is excluded from the Transfer limitations. See the
  HOW YOUR INVESTMENTS ARE ALLOCATED—Transfers and
  Market-timing Restrictions section in this Prospectus.
  




 




 
• 

If you specifically instruct us to allocate all
  or any portion of any additional Purchase Payments we receive to
  any Variable Investment Option other than the Money Market
  Subaccount before the Free Look Transfer Date, you will
  automatically change your election to the return of your
  Contract Value proceeds option. This will automatically cancel
  your election of the “return of Purchase Payments”
  option for the entire Contract.
  




 




 
• 

If you request a transfer of all or any portion
  of your Contract Value from the Money Market Subaccount to any
  other Variable Investment Option before the Free Look Transfer
  Date, you will automatically change your election to the return
  of your Contract Value proceeds option. This will automatically
  cancel your election of the “return of Purchase
  Payments” option for the entire Contract.
  




 




 
• 

If you exercise your Right to Cancel, we will
  send you your Purchase Payments.
  







If you elect the return of Contract Value
proceeds option, the following will apply:













 
• 

We will immediately allocate any Purchase
  Payments we receive to the Investment Options you select on your
  application or your most recent instructions, if any.

Additional Information.







THE GENERAL ACCOUNT



General Information

All amounts allocated to a fixed option become
part of our General Account. Subject to applicable law, we
exercise sole discretion over the investment of General Account
assets, and bear the associated investment risk. You will not
share in the investment experience of General Account assets.


Because of exemptive and exclusionary provisions,
interests in the General Account under the Contract are not
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the
General Account has not been registered as an investment company
under the 1940 Act. Any interest you have in a fixed option is
not subject to these Acts, and we have been advised that the SEC
staff has not reviewed disclosure in this Prospectus relating to
any fixed option. This disclosure may, however, be subject to
certain provisions of federal securities laws relating to the
accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses.


Guarantee Terms

When you allocate any portion of your Investments
or Contract Value to any fixed option, we guarantee you an
interest rate (a “Guaranteed Interest Rate”) for a
specified period of time (a “Guarantee Term”) of up to
one year. Guarantee Terms will be offered at our discretion.


Guaranteed Interest Rates for any fixed option
may be changed periodically for new allocations. Your allocation
will receive the Guaranteed Interest Rate in effect for that
fixed option on the effective date of your allocation. All
Guaranteed Interest Rates will be expressed as annual effective
rates, however, interest will accrue daily. The Guaranteed
Interest Rate on your fixed option will remain in effect for the
Guarantee Term and will never be less than an annual rate of 3%.


Withdrawals and Transfers

Prior to the Annuity Date, you may withdraw or
transfer amounts from any fixed option to one or more of the
other Variable Investment Options. No partial withdrawal or
transfer may be made from a fixed option within 30 days of
the Contract Date. Currently, we are not requiring the 30-day
waiting period on partial withdrawals and transfers, but we
reserve the right to require the 30-day waiting period on
partial withdrawals and transfers in the future. If your
withdrawal leaves you with a Net Contract Value of less than
$1,000, we have the right, at our option, to terminate your
Contract and send you the withdrawal proceeds.


Amounts transferred or withdrawn from any fixed
option may be delayed, as described under the ADDITIONAL
INFORMATION— Timing of Payments and Transactions
section in this Prospectus. Any amount delayed, so long as it is
held under any fixed option, will continue to earn interest at
the Guaranteed Interest Rate then in effect until that Guarantee
Term has ended, and the minimum guaranteed interest rate of 3%
thereafter, unless state law requires a greater rate be paid.





Fixed Option

Each allocation (or rollover) you make to the
Fixed Option receives a Guarantee Term that begins on the day
that allocation or rollover is effective and ends at the end of
that Contract Year or, if earlier, on your Annuity Date. At the
end of that Contract Year, we will roll over your Fixed Option
Value on that day into a new Guarantee Term of one year (or, if
shorter, the time remaining until your Annuity Date) at the then
current Guaranteed Interest Rate, unless you instruct us
otherwise.

 

54




Table of Contents














 

Example: Your
  Contract Anniversary is February 1. On February 1 of
  year 1, you allocate $1,000 to the Fixed Option and receive
  a Guarantee Term of one year and a Guaranteed Interest Rate of
  5%. On August 1, you allocate another $500 to the Fixed
  Option and receive a Guaranteed Interest Rate of 6%. Through
  January 31, year 1, your first allocation of $1,000
  earns 5% interest and your second allocation of $500 earns 6%
  interest. On February 1, year 2, a new interest rate
  may go into effect for your entire Fixed Option Value.
  



You may make one transfer or partial withdrawal
from your Fixed Option during any Contract Year, except that
this limitation does not apply under the dollar cost averaging,
earnings sweep and pre-authorized withdrawal programs. You may
make one transfer or one partial withdrawal within the
30 days after the end of each Contract Anniversary.
Normally, you may transfer or withdraw up to one-half (50%) of
your Fixed Option Value in any given Contract Year. However, in
consecutive Contract Years, you may transfer or withdraw 50% of
your Fixed Option Value in the first year and your remaining
Fixed Option Value in the second consecutive year. In addition,
if, as a result of a partial withdrawal or transfer, the Fixed
Option Value is less than $500, we have the right, at our
option, to transfer the entire remaining amount to your other
Investment Options on a proportionate basis relative to your
most recent allocation instructions.




We reserve the right to waive the restrictions
that limit transfers from the Fixed Option to one transfer
within the 30 days after the end of each Contract
Anniversary. We also reserve the right to waive the limitations
on the maximum amount you may transfer from the Fixed Option in
any given Contract year. Currently, we are not enforcing any of
the Fixed Option withdrawal and transfer restrictions. We may
process requests for transfers from the Fixed Option that are
within the maximum number of allowable transfers among the
Investment Options each calendar year; i.e. transfers are
limited to 25 for each calendar year.

If any transaction or event called for under a Contract is
scheduled to occur on a day that is not a Business Day, such
transaction or event will be deemed to occur on the next
following Business Day unless otherwise specified. Any
systematic pre-authorized transaction scheduled to occur on
December 30 or December 31 where that day is not a
Business Day will be deemed an order for the last Business Day
of the calendar year and will be calculated using the applicable

tax treatment under the Code.




Qualified
Plan –
A retirement plan that receives favorable tax treatment under
Section 401, 403, or 457 of the Code.


SEC –
Securities and Exchange Commission.




Separate Account B (the
“Separate
Account”) –
A separate account of ours registered as a unit investment trust
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the
“1940 Act”).




Subaccount –
An investment division of the Separate Account. Each Subaccount
invests its assets in shares of a corresponding Portfolio.




Subaccount Annuity
Unit –
Subaccount Annuity Units (or “Annuity Units”) are used
to measure variation in variable annuity payments. To the extent
you elect to convert all or some of your Contract Value into
variable annuity payments, the amount of each annuity payment
(after the first payment) will vary with the value and number of
Annuity Units in each Subaccount attributed to any variable
annuity payments. At annuitization (after any applicable premium
taxes and/or other taxes are paid), the amount annuitized to a
variable annuity determines the amount of your first variable
annuity payment and the number of Annuity Units credited to your
annuity in each Subaccount. The value of Subaccount Annuity
Units, like the value of Subaccount Units, is expected to
fluctuate daily, as described in the definition of Unit Value.






Subaccount
Unit –
Before your Annuity Date, each time you allocate an amount to a
Subaccount, your Contract is credited with a number of
Subaccount Units in that Subaccount. These Units are used for
accounting purposes to measure your Account Value in that
Subaccount. The value of Subaccount Units is expected to
fluctuate daily, as described in the definition of Unit Value.






Unit
Value –
The value of a Subaccount Unit (“Subaccount Unit
Value”) or Subaccount Annuity Unit (“Subaccount
Annuity Unit Value”). Unit Value of any Subaccount is
subject to change on any Business Day in much the same way that
the value of a mutual fund share changes each day. The
fluctuations in value reflect the investment results, expenses
of and charges against the Portfolio in which the Subaccount
invests its assets. Fluctuations also reflect charges against
the Separate Account. Changes in Subaccount Annuity Unit Values
also reflect an additional factor that adjusts Subaccount
Annuity Unit Values to offset our Annuity Option Table’s
implicit assumption of an annual investment return of 5%. The
effect of this assumed investment return is explained in detail
in the SAI. Unit Value of a Subaccount Unit or Subaccount
Annuity Unit on any Business Day is measured as of the close of
the New York Stock Exchange on that Business Day, which usually
closes at 4:00 p.m., Eastern time, although it occasionally
closes earlier.




Variable Account
Value –
The aggregate amount of your Contract Value allocated to all
Subaccounts.


Variable Investment
Option –
A Subaccount (also called a Variable Account).

  growth.
  
 

You want an investment that is geared for growth

PERFORMANCE

From time to time, our reports or other
communications to current or prospective Contract Owners or our
advertising or other promotional material may quote the
performance (yield and total return) of a Subaccount. Quoted
results are based on past performance and reflect the
performance of all assets held in that Subaccount for the stated
time period. Quoted results are neither an estimate nor a
guarantee of future investment performance, and do not represent
the actual experience of amounts invested by any particular
Contract Owner.



Total Returns

A Subaccount may advertise its “average
annual total return” over various periods of time.
“Total return” represents the average percentage
change in value of an investment in the Subaccount from the
beginning of a measuring period to the end of that measuring
period. “Annualized” total return assumes that the
total return achieved for the measuring period is achieved for
each such period for a full year. “Average annual”
total return is computed in accordance with a standard method
prescribed by the SEC, and is also referred to as
“standardized return.”


Average Annual Total Return

To calculate a Subaccount’s average annual
total return for a specific measuring period, we first take a
hypothetical $1,000 investment in that Subaccount, at its
then-applicable Subaccount Unit Value (the “initial
payment”) and we compute the ending redeemable value
(“full withdrawal value”) of that initial payment at
the end of the measuring period. The redeemable value reflects
the effect of all recurring fees and charges applicable to a
Contract Owner under the Contract, including the Risk Charge,
the asset-based Administrative Fee and the deduction of the
applicable withdrawal charge, but does not reflect any charges
for applicable premium taxes. The Annual Fee is also taken into
account, assuming an average Contract Value of $35,000. The
redeemable value is then divided by the initial payment and this
quotient is raised to the 365/N power (N represents
the number of years in the measuring period), and 1 is
subtracted from this result. Average annual total return is
expressed as a percentage.


T = (ERV/P)(365/N) — 1




 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where

P
  
 

=

N

Average annual total return figures will be given
for recent one-, three-, five- and ten-year periods (if
applicable), and may be given for other periods as well (such as
from commencement of the Subaccount’s operations, or on a
year-by-year basis).


When considering “average” total return
figures for periods longer than one year, it is important to
note that the relevant Subaccount’s annual total return for
any one year in the period might have been greater or less than
the average for the entire period.


Aggregate Total Return

A Subaccount may use “aggregate” total
return figures along with its “average annual” total
return figures for various periods; these figures represent the
cumulative change in value of an investment in the Subaccount
for a specific period. Aggregate total returns may be shown by
means of schedules, charts or graphs and may indicate subtotals
of the various components of total return. The SEC has not
prescribed standard formulas for calculating aggregate total
return.


Total returns may also be shown for the same
periods that do not take into account the withdrawal charge or
the Annual Fee.

Yields

Money Market Subaccount

The “yield” (also called “current
yield”) of the Money Market Subaccount is computed in
accordance with a standard method prescribed by the SEC. The net
change in the Subaccount’s Unit Value during a seven-day
period is divided by the Unit Value at the beginning of the
period to obtain a base rate of return. The current yield is
generated when the base rate is “annualized” by
multiplying it by the fraction 365/7; that is, the base rate of
return is assumed to be generated each week over a 365-day
period and is shown as a percentage of the investment. The
“effective yield” of the Money Market Subaccount is
calculated similarly but, when annualized, the base rate of
return is assumed to be reinvested. The effective yield will be
slightly higher than the current yield because of the
compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment.


The formula for effective yield is: [(Base Period
Return + 1) (To the power of (365/7))] - 1.


Realized capital gains or losses and unrealized
appreciation or depreciation of the assets of the underlying
Money Market Portfolio are not included in the yield
calculation. Current yield and effective yield do not reflect
the deduction of charges for any applicable premium taxes and/or
any other taxes, but do reflect a deduction for the Annual Fee,
the Risk Charge and the Administrative Fee and assumes an
average Contract Value of $35,000. Yield information may be
accompanied by yield quotations that do not take certain charges
into account.


Other Subaccounts

“Yield” of the other Subaccounts is
computed in accordance with a different standard method
prescribed by the SEC. The net investment income (investment
income less expenses) per Subaccount Unit earned during a
specified one-month or 30-day period is divided by the
Subaccount Unit Value on the last day of the specified period.
This result is then annualized (that is, the yield is assumed to
be generated each month or each 30-day period for a year),
according to the following formula, which assumes semi-annual
compounding:




 
 
 
 
 




YIELD = 2[(
  

 

a - b
cd
  
 

+ 1)6 - 1]
  






 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where:
  

 

a
  
 

=
  
 

net investment income earned during the period by
  the Portfolio attributable to the Subaccount.
  


 
 

b
  
 

=
  
 

expenses accrued for the period (net of
  reimbursements).
  


 
 

c
  
 

=
  
 

the average daily number of Subaccount Units
  outstanding during the period that were entitled to receive
  dividends.
  


 
 

d
  
 

=
  
 

the Unit Value of the Subaccount Units on the
  last day of the period.
  




The yield of each Subaccount reflects the
deduction of all recurring fees and charges applicable to the
Subaccount, such as the Risk Charge, the asset-based
Administrative Fee and the Annual Fee (assuming an average
Contract Value of $35,000), but does not reflect any withdrawal
charge or any charge for applicable premium taxes and/or any
other taxes. Yield information may be accompanied by yield
quotations that do not take certain charges into account.


General

The Subaccounts’ yields will vary from time
to time depending upon market conditions, the composition of
each Portfolio and operating expenses of the Fund allocated to
each Portfolio. Consequently, any given performance quotation
should not be considered representative of the Subaccount’s
performance in the future. Yield should also be considered
relative to changes in Subaccount Unit Values and to the
relative risks associated with the investment policies and
objectives of the various Portfolios. In addition, because
performance will fluctuate, it may not provide a basis for
comparing the yield of a Subaccount with certain bank deposits
or other investments that pay a fixed yield or return for a
stated period of time.

Performance Comparisons and
Benchmarks



In advertisements and sales literature, we may
compare the performance of some or all of the Subaccounts to the
performance of other variable annuity issuers in general and to
the performance of particular types of variable annuities
investing in mutual funds, or series of mutual funds, with
investment objectives similar to each of the Subaccounts. This
performance may be presented as averages or rankings compiled by
Lipper Analytical Services, Inc. (“Lipper”), or
Morningstar, Inc. (“Morningstar”), which are
independent services that monitor and rank the performance of
variable annuity issuers and mutual funds in each of the major
categories of investment objectives on an industry-wide basis.
Lipper’s rankings include variable life issuers as well as
variable annuity issuers. The performance analyses prepared by
Lipper and Morningstar rank such issuers on the basis of total
return, assuming reinvestment of dividends and distributions,
but do not take sales charges, redemption fees or certain
expense deductions at the separate account level into
consideration. In addition, Morningstar prepares risk adjusted
rankings, which consider the effects of market risk on total
return performance. We may also compare the performance of the
Subaccounts with performance information included in other
publications and services that monitor the performance of
insurance company separate accounts or other investment
vehicles. These other services or publications may be general
interest business publications such as The Wall Street
Journal, Barron’s, Business Week, Forbes, Fortune, and
Money.




In addition, our reports and communications to
Contract Owners, advertisements, or sales literature may compare
a Subaccount’s performance to various benchmarks that
measure the performance of a pertinent group of securities
widely regarded by investors as being representative of the
securities markets in general or as being representative of a
particular type of security. We may also compare the performance
of the Subaccounts with that of other appropriate indices of
investment securities and averages for peer universes of funds
or data developed by us derived from such indices or averages.
Unmanaged indices generally assume the reinvestment of dividends
or interest but do not generally reflect deductions for
investment management or administrative costs and expenses.



Tax Deferred Accumulation

In reports or other communications to you or in
advertising or sales materials, we may also describe the effects
of tax-deferred compounding on the Separate Account’s
investment returns or upon returns in general. These effects may
be illustrated in charts or graphs and may include comparisons
at various points in time of returns under the Contract or in
general on a tax-deferred basis with the returns on a taxable
basis. Different tax rates may be assumed.


In general, individuals who own annuity contracts
are not taxed on increases in the value under the annuity
contract until some form of distribution is made from the
contract. Thus, the annuity contract will benefit from tax
deferral during the accumulation period, which generally will
have the effect of permitting an investment in an annuity
contract to grow more rapidly than a comparable investment under
which increases in value are taxed on a current basis. The
following chart illustrates this benefit by comparing
accumulation under a variable annuity contract with
accumulations from an investment on which gains are taxed on a
current ordinary income basis.




The chart shows accumulations on a single
Purchase Payment of $10,000, assuming hypothetical annual
returns of 0%, 4% and 8%, compounded annually, and a tax rate of
33%. The values shown for the taxable investment do not include
any deduction for management fees or other expenses but assume
that taxes are deducted annually from investment returns. The
values shown for the variable annuity do not reflect the
deduction of contractual expenses such as the Risk Charge (equal
to an annual rate of 1.25% of average daily Account Value), the
Administrative Fee (equal to an annual rate of 0.15% of average
daily Account Value), and the Annual Fee (equal to $30 per year
if Net Contract Value is $50,000 or less), charge for premium
taxes and/or other taxes, any applicable withdrawal charge; or
the expenses of an underlying investment vehicle, such as the
Fund.




Generally, the withdrawal charge is equal to 7%
of the amount withdrawn attributable to Purchase Payments that
are one year old, 6% of the amount withdrawn attributable to
Purchase Payments that are two years old, 5% of the amount
withdrawn attributable to Purchase Payments that are three years
old, 3% of the amount

3



Table of Contents

withdrawn attributable to Purchase Payments that
are four years old, 1% of the amount withdrawn attributable to
Purchase Payments that are five years old, and 0% of the amount
withdrawn attributable to Purchase Payments that are six years
old or older. The age of Purchase Payments is determined as
described in the Prospectus.



There is no withdrawal charge to the extent that
total withdrawals that are free of charge during the Contract
Year do not exceed 10% of the sum of your remaining Purchase
Payments at the beginning of the Contract Year that have been
held under your Contract for less than six years plus additional
Purchase Payments applied to your Contract during that Contract
Year. For a description of the charges and expenses under the
Contract, see the CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS section in
the Prospectus. If these expenses and fees were taken into
account, they would reduce the investment return shown for both
the taxable investment and the hypothetical variable annuity
contract. In addition, these values assume that you do not
surrender the Contract or make any withdrawals until the end of
the period shown. The chart assumes a full withdrawal, at the
end of the period shown, of all Contract Value and the payment
of taxes at the 33% rate on the amount in excess of the Purchase
Payment.


The rates of return illustrated are hypothetical
and are not an estimate or guarantee of performance. Actual tax
rates may vary for different assets (e.g. capital gains and
qualifying dividend income) and taxpayers from that illustrated
and withdrawals by and distributions to Contract Owners who have
not reached age 59 1/2 may be subject to a tax penalty of
10%.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTRACTS




Pacific Select Distributors, Inc.
(PSD)



Pacific Select Distributors, Inc., our
subsidiary, acts as the distributor of the Contracts and offers
the Contracts on a continuous basis. PSD is located at 700
Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach, California 92660. PSD is
registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of
FINRA. We pay PSD for acting as distributor under a Distribution
Agreement. We and PSD enter into selling agreements with
broker-dealers whose registered representatives are authorized
by state insurance departments to solicit applications for the
Contracts. The aggregate amount of underwriting commissions paid
to PSD for 2007, 2006 and 2005 with regard to this Contract was
$49,980, $56,164 and $63,235 respectively, of which $0 was
retained.




PSD or an affiliate pays various sales
compensation to broker-dealers that solicit applications for the
Contracts. PSD or an affiliate also may provide reimbursement
for other expenses associated with the promotion and
solicitation of applications for the Contracts. Your registered
representative typically receives a portion of the compensation
that is payable to his or her broker-dealer in connection with
the Contract, depending on the agreement between your registered
representative and his or her firm. Pacific Life is not involved
in determining that compensation arrangement, which may present
its own incentives or conflicts. You may ask your registered
representative how he/she will personally be compensated for the
transaction.




Under certain circumstances where PSD pays lower
initial commissions, certain broker-dealers that solicit
applications for Contracts may be paid an ongoing persistency
trail commission (sometimes called a residual). The mix of
Purchase Payment-based versus trail commissions varies depending
upon our agreement with the selling broker-dealer and the
commission option selected by your registered representative or
broker-dealer. Certain broker-dealers may also be paid an amount
under a persistency program which will be based on assets under
management and duration of contracts. The amount under the
persistency program for a registered representative is not
expected to exceed .25% of their total assets under management.






In addition to the Purchase Payment-based, trail
commissions and persistency program described above, we and/or
an affiliate may pay additional cash compensation from our own
resources in connection with the promotion and solicitation of
applications for the Contracts by some, but not all,
broker-dealers. The range of additional cash compensation based
on Purchase Payments generally does not exceed 0.40% and
trailing compensation based on Account Value generally does not
exceed 0.10% on an annual basis. Such additional compensation
may give Pacific Life greater access to registered
representatives of the broker-dealers that receive such
compensation. While this greater access provides the opportunity
for training and other educational programs so that your
registered representative may serve you better, this additional
compensation also may afford Pacific Life a
“preferred” status at the recipient broker-dealer and
provide some other marketing benefit such as website placement,
access to registered representative lists, extra marketing
assistance or other heightened visibility and access to the
broker-dealer’s sales force that may otherwise influence

THE CONTRACTS AND THE SEPARATE
ACCOUNT
 


Calculating Subaccount Unit Values


The Unit Value of the Subaccount Units in each
Variable Investment Option is computed at the close of the
New York Stock Exchange, which is usually 4:00 p.m.
Eastern time on each Business Day. The initial Unit Value of
each Subaccount was $10 on the Business Day the Subaccount began
operations. At the end of each Business Day, the Unit Value for
a Subaccount is equal to:


Y × Z




 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where
  

 

(Y)
  
 

=
  
 

the Unit Value for that Subaccount as of the end
  of the preceding Business Day; and
  


 
 

(Z)
  
 

=
  
 

the Net Investment Factor for that Subaccount for
  the period (a “valuation period”) between that
  Business Day and the immediately preceding Business Day.
  




The “Net Investment Factor” for a
Subaccount for any valuation period is equal to:

6



Table of Contents

(A ÷ B) — C




 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where
  

 

(A)
  
 

=
  
 

the “per share value of the assets” of
  that Subaccount as of the end of that valuation period, which is
  equal to: a+b+c
  






 
 
 
 
 
 
 




where
  

 

(a)
  
 

=
  
 

the net asset value per share of the
  corresponding Portfolio shares held by that Subaccount as of the
  end of that valuation period;
  


 
 

(b)
  
 

=
  
 

the per share amount of any dividend or capital
  gain distributions made by the Fund for that Portfolio during
  that valuation period; and
  


 
 

(c)
  
 

=
  
 

any per share charge (a negative number) or
  credit (a positive number) for any income taxes or other amounts
  set aside during that valuation period as a reserve for any
  income and/or any other taxes which we determine to have
  resulted from the operations of the Subaccount or Contract,
  and/or any taxes attributable, directly or indirectly, to
  Investments;
  






 
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
 

(B)
  
 

=
  
 

the net asset value per share of the
  corresponding Portfolio shares held by the Subaccount as of the
  end of the preceding valuation period; and
  


 
 

(C)
  
 

=
  
 

a factor that assesses against the Subaccount net
  assets for each calendar day in the valuation period, the basic
  Risk Charge plus any applicable increase in the Risk Charge and
  the Administrative Fee (see the CHARGES, FEES AND DEDUCTIONS
  section in the Prospectus).
  




As explained in the Prospectus, the Annual Fee,
if applicable, will be charged proportionately against your
Investment Options. Assessments against your Variable Investment
Options are assessed against your Variable Account Value through
the automatic debit of Subaccount Units; the Annual Fee
decreases the number of Subaccount Units attributed to your
Contract but does not alter the Unit Value for any Subaccount.



Variable Annuity Payment Amounts

The following steps show how we determine the
amount of each variable annuity payment under your Contract.


First: Pay Applicable Premium Taxes



When you convert your Net Contract Value into
annuity payments, you must pay any applicable charge for premium
taxes and/or other taxes on your Contract Value (unless
applicable law requires those taxes to be paid at a later time).
We assess this charge by reducing your Account Value
proportionately, relative to your Account Value in each
Subaccount and in any fixed option, in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of the charges. The remaining amount of your
available Net Contract Value may be used to provide variable
annuity payments. Alternatively, your remaining available Net
Contract Value may be used to provide fixed annuity payments, or
it may be divided to provide both fixed and variable annuity
payments. You may also choose to withdraw some or all of your
remaining Net Contract Value, less any applicable Annual Fees,
any charge for an optional Rider, and/or withdrawal charge, and
any charges for premium taxes and/or other taxes without
converting this amount into annuity payments.




Second: The First Variable Payment

We begin by referring to your Contract’s
Option Table for your Annuity Option (the “Annuity Option
Table”). The Annuity Option Table allows us to calculate
the dollar amount of the first variable annuity payment under
your Contract, based on the amount applied toward the variable
annuity. The number that the Annuity Option Table yields will be
based on the Annuitant’s age (and, in certain cases, sex)
and assumes a 5% rate of return, as described in more detail
below.










 

Example: Assume a
  man is 65 years of age at his Annuity Date and has selected
  a lifetime annuity with monthly payments guaranteed for
  10 years. According to the Annuity Option Table, this man
  should receive an initial monthly payment of $5.79 for every
  $1,000 of his Contract Value (reduced by applicable
  




7



Table of Contents








 

charges) that he will be using to provide
  variable payments. Therefore, if his Contract Value after
  deducting applicable fees and charges is $100,000 on his Annuity
  Date and he applies this entire amount toward his variable
  annuity, his first monthly payment will be $579.00.
  





You may choose any other Annuity Option Table
that assumes a different rate of return which we offer at the
time your Annuity Option is effective.


Third: Subaccount Annuity Units

For each Subaccount, we use the amount of the
first variable annuity payment under your Contract attributed to
each Subaccount to determine the number of Subaccount Annuity
Units that will form the basis of subsequent payment amounts.
First, we use the Annuity Option Table to determine the amount
of that first variable payment for each Subaccount. Then, for
each Subaccount, we divide that amount of the first variable
annuity payment by the value of one Subaccount Annuity Unit (the
“Subaccount Annuity Unit Value”) as of the end of the
Annuity Date to obtain the number of Subaccount Annuity Units
for that particular Subaccount. The number of Subaccount Annuity
Units used to calculate subsequent payments under your Contract
will not change unless exchanges of Annuity Units are made, (or
if the Joint and Survivor Annuity Option is elected and the
Primary Annuitant dies first,) but the value of those Annuity
Units will change daily, as described below.


Fourth: The Subsequent Variable
Payments

The amount of each subsequent variable annuity
payment will be the sum of the amounts payable based on each
Subaccount. The amount payable based on each Subaccount is equal
to the number of Subaccount Annuity Units for that Subaccount
multiplied by their Subaccount Annuity Unit Value at the end of
the Business Day in each payment period you elected that
corresponds to the Annuity Date.


Each Subaccount’s Subaccount Annuity Unit
Value, like its Subaccount Unit Value, changes each day to
reflect the net investment results of the underlying investment
vehicle, as well as the assessment of the Risk Charge at an
annual rate of 1.25% and the Administrative Fee at an annual
rate of 0.15%. In addition, the calculation of Subaccount
Annuity Unit Value incorporates an additional factor; as
discussed in more detail below, this additional factor adjusts
Subaccount Annuity Values to correct for the Option Table’s
implicit assumption of a 5% annual investment return on amounts
applied but not yet used to furnish annuity benefits.


Different Subaccounts may be selected for your
Contract before and after your Annuity Date, subject to any
restrictions we may establish. Currently, you may exchange
Subaccount Annuity Units in any Subaccount for Subaccount
Annuity Units in any other Subaccount(s) up to four times in any
twelve month period after your Annuity Date. The number of
Subaccount Annuity Units in any Subaccount may change due to
such exchanges. Exchanges following your Annuity Date will be
made by exchanging Subaccount Annuity Units of equivalent
aggregate value, based on their relative Subaccount Annuity Unit
Values.


Understanding the “Assumed Investment
Return” Factor

The Annuity Option Table incorporates a number of
implicit assumptions in determining the amount of your first
variable annuity payment. As noted above, the numbers in the
Annuity Option Table reflect certain actuarial assumptions based
on the Annuitant’s age, and, in some cases, the
Annuitant’s sex. In addition, these numbers assume that the
amount of your Contract Value that you convert to a variable
annuity will have a positive net investment return of 5% each
year during the payout of your annuity; thus 5% is referred to
as an “assumed investment return.”


The Subaccount Annuity Unit Value for a
Subaccount will increase only to the extent that the investment
performance of that Subaccount exceeds the Risk Charge, the
Administrative Fee, and the assumed investment return. The
Subaccount Annuity Unit Value for any Subaccount will generally
be less than the Subaccount Unit Value for that same Subaccount,
and the difference will be the amount of the assumed investment
return factor.

8



Table of Contents







 

Example: Assume the
  net investment performance of a Subaccount is at a rate of 5.00%
  per year (after deduction of the 1.25% Risk Charge and the 0.15%
  Administrative Fee). The Subaccount Unit Value for that
  Subaccount would increase at a rate of 5.00% per year, but
  the Subaccount Annuity Unit Value would not increase (or
  decrease) at all. The net investment factor for that 5%
  return [1.05] is then divided by the factor for the 5% assumed
  investment return [1.05] and 1 is subtracted from the result to
  determine the adjusted rate of change in Subaccount Annuity Unit
  Value:
  





 
 
 



1.05
1.05
  
 

= 1; 1 — 1 = 0; 0 × 100% = 0%.
  




If the net investment performance of a
Subaccount’s assets is at a rate less than 5.00% per year,
the Subaccount Annuity Unit Value will decrease, even if the
Subaccount Unit Value is increasing.








 

Example: Assume the net investment performance of
  a Subaccount is at a rate of 2.60% per year (after deduction of
  the 1.25% Risk Charge and the 0.15% Administrative Fee). The
  Subaccount Unit Value for that Subaccount would increase at a
  rate of 2.60% per year, but the Subaccount Annuity Unit Value
  would decrease at a rate of 2.29% per year. The net
  investment factor for that 2.6% return [1.026] is then divided
  by the factor for the 5% assumed investment return [1.05] and 1
  is subtracted from the result to determine the adjusted rate of
  change in Subaccount Annuity Unit Value:
  





 
 
 



1.026
1.05
  
 

= 0.9771; 0.9771 — 1 = —0.0229;
  —0.0229 × 100% = —2.29%.
  




The assumed investment return will always cause
increases in Subaccount Annuity Unit Values to be somewhat less
than if the assumption had not been made, will cause decreases
in Subaccount Annuity Unit Values to be somewhat greater than if
the assumption had not been made, and will (as shown in the
example above) sometimes cause a decrease in Subaccount Annuity
Unit Values to take place when an increase would have occurred
if the assumption had not been made. If we had assumed a higher
investment return in our Annuity Option tables, it would produce
annuities with larger first payments, but the increases in
subaccount annuity payments would be smaller and the decreases
in subsequent annuity payments would be greater; a lower assumed
investment return would produce annuities with smaller first
payments, and the increases in subsequent annuity payments would
be greater and the decreases in subsequent annuity payments
would be smaller.



Redemptions of Remaining Guaranteed Variable
Payments Under Options 2 and 4



If variable payments are elected under Annuity
Options 2 and 4, you may redeem all remaining guaranteed
variable payments after the Annuity Date. Also, under
Option 4, partial redemptions of remaining guaranteed
variable payments after the Annuity Date are available. The
amount available upon full redemption would be the present value
of any remaining guaranteed variable payments at the assumed
investment return. Any applicable withdrawal charge will be
deducted from the present value as if you made a full
withdrawal, or if applicable, a partial withdrawal. For purposes
of calculating the withdrawal charge and Free Withdrawal amount,
it will be assumed that the Contract was never converted to
provide annuity payments and any prior variable annuity payments
in that Contract Year will be treated as if they were partial
withdrawals from the Contract (See the CHARGES, FEES AND
DEDUCTIONS — Withdrawal Charge section in the
Prospectus). For example, assume that a Contract was issued with
a single investment of $10,000 and in Contract Year 3 the
Owner elects to receive variable annuity payments under Annuity
Option 4. In Contract Year 4, the Owner elects to make
a partial redemption of $5,000. The withdrawal charge as a
percentage of the Purchase Payments with an age of 4 years
is 3%. Assuming the Free Withdrawal amount immediately prior to
the partial redemption is $200, the withdrawal charge for the
partial redemption will be $144 (($5,000 - $200) * 3%). No
withdrawal charge will be imposed on a redemption if:











 
• 

the Annuity Option is elected as the form of
  payments of death benefit proceeds, or
  


 


 
• 

the Annuitant dies before the period certain has
  ended and the Beneficiary requests a redemption of the variable
  annuity payments.
  


9



Table of Contents

The variable payment amount we use in calculating
the present value is determined by summing an amount for each
Subaccount, which we calculate by multiplying your Subaccount
Annuity Units by the Annuity Unit Value next computed after we
receive your redemption request. This variable payment amount is
then discounted at the assumed investment return from each
future Annuity Payment date that falls within the payment
guaranteed period. The sum of these discounted remaining
variable payment amounts is the present value of remaining
guaranteed variable payments.




If you elect to redeem all remaining guaranteed
variable payments in a single sum, we will not make any
additional variable annuity payments during the remaining
guaranteed period after the redemption.




If you elect to redeem a portion of the remaining
guaranteed variable payments in a single sum, we will reduce the
number of Annuity Units for each Subaccount by the same
percentage as the partial redemption value bears to the amount
available upon a full redemption.


Redemption of remaining guaranteed variable
payments will not affect the amount of any fixed annuity
payments.



Corresponding Dates

If any transaction or event under your Contract
is scheduled to occur on a “corresponding date” that
does not exist in a given calendar period, the transaction or
event will be deemed to occur on the following Business Day. In
addition, as stated in the Prospectus, any event scheduled to
occur on a day that is not a Business Day will occur on the next
succeeding Business Day.








 

Example: If your
  Contract is issued on February 29 in year 1 (a leap year),
  your Contract Anniversary in years 2, 3 and 4 will be on
  March 1.
  


 


 

 Example: If your
  Annuity Date is July 31 and you select monthly annuity
  payments, the payments received will be based on valuations made
  on July 31, August 31, October 1 (for September),
  October 31, December 1 (for November),
  December 31, January 31, March 1 (for February),
  March 31, May 1 (for April), May 31 and
  July 1 (for June).
  




Age and Sex of Annuitant

The Contracts generally provide for sex-distinct
annuity income factors in the case of life annuities.
Statistically, females tend to have longer life expectancies
than males; consequently, if the amount of annuity payments is
based on life expectancy, they will ordinarily be higher if an
annuitant is male than if an annuitant is female. Certain
states’ regulations prohibit sex-distinct annuity income
factors, and Contracts issued in those states will use unisex
factors. In addition, Contracts issued in connection with
Qualified Plans are required to use unisex factors.


We may require proof of your Annuitant’s age
and sex before or after commencing annuity payments. If the age
or sex (or both) of your Annuitant are incorrectly stated in
your Contract, we will correct the amount payable to equal the
amount that the annuitized portion of the Contract Value under
that Contract would have purchased for your Annuitant’s
correct age and sex. If we make the correction after annuity
payments have started, and we have made overpayments based on
the incorrect information, we will deduct the amount of the
overpayment, with interest at 3% a year, from any payments due
then or later; if we have made underpayments, we will add the
amount, with interest at 3% a year, of the underpayments to the
next payment we make after we receive proof of the correct age
and/or sex.


Additionally, we may require proof of the
Annuitant’s or Owner’s age before any payments
associated with the Death Benefit provisions of your Contract
are made. If the age or sex of the Annuitant is incorrectly
stated in your Contract, we will base any payment associated
with the Death Benefit provisions on your Contract on the
Annuitant’s or Owner’s correct age or sex.

Systematic Transfer Programs

The fixed option(s) are not available in
connection with portfolio rebalancing. If you are using the
earnings sweep, you may also use portfolio rebalancing only if
you selected the Money Market Subaccount, or, the Fixed Option
as your sweep option. You may not use dollar cost averaging and
the earnings sweep at the same time. The systematic transfer
options are not available after you annuitize and are subject to
the same requirements and restrictions as non-systematic
transfers. In addition, no fixed option(s) may be used as the
target Investment Option under any systematic transfer program.


Dollar Cost Averaging



When you request dollar cost averaging, you are
authorizing us to make periodic reallocations of your Contract
Value without waiting for any further instruction from you. You
may request to begin or stop dollar cost averaging at any time
prior to your Annuity Date; the effective date of your request
will be the day we receive notice from you in a form
satisfactory to us. Your request may specify the date on which
you want your first transfer to be made. Your first transfer may
not be made until 30 days after your Contract Date, and if
you specify an earlier date, your first transfer will be delayed
until one calendar month after the date you specify. If you
request dollar cost averaging on your application for your
Contract and you fail to specify a date for your first transfer,
your first transfer will be made one period after your Contract
Date (that is, if you specify monthly transfers, the first
transfer will occur 30 days after your Contract Date;
quarterly transfers, 90 days after your Contract Date;
semi-annual transfers, 180 days after your Contract Date;
and if you specify annual transfers, the first transfer will
occur on your Contract Anniversary). If you stop dollar cost
averaging, you must wait 30 days before you may begin this
option again. Currently, we are not enforcing the 30 day
waiting period but we reserve the right to enforce such waiting
period in the future.




Your request to begin dollar cost averaging must
specify the Investment Option you wish to transfer money
from (your “source account”). You may choose
any one Investment Option as your source account. The Account
Value of your source account must be at least $5,000 for you to
begin dollar cost averaging. Currently, we are not enforcing the
minimum Account Value but we reserve the right to enforce such
minimum amounts in the future.


Your request to begin dollar cost averaging must
also specify the amount and frequency of your transfers. You may
choose monthly, quarterly, semiannual or annual transfers. The
amount of your transfers may be specified as a dollar amount or
a percentage of your source Account Value; however, each
transfer must be at least $250. Currently, we are not enforcing
the minimum transfer amount but we reserve the right to enforce
such minimum amounts in the future. Dollar cost averaging
transfers are not subject to the same requirements and
limitations as other transfers.


Finally, your request must specify the Variable
Investment Option(s) you wish to transfer amounts to
(your “target account(s)”). If you select more than
one target account, your dollar cost averaging request must
specify how transferred amounts should be allocated among the
target accounts. Your source account may not also be a target
account.


Your dollar cost averaging transfers will
continue until the earlier of:









 
• 

your request to stop dollar cost averaging is
  effective, or
  


 


 
• 

your source Account Value is zero, or
  


 


 
• 

your Annuity Date.
  



If, as a result of a dollar cost averaging
transfer, your source Account Value falls below any minimum
Account Value we may establish, we have the right, at our
option, to transfer that remaining Account Value to your target
account(s) on a proportionate basis relative to your most recent
allocation instructions. We may change, terminate or suspend the
dollar cost averaging option at any time.

11



Table of Contents

Portfolio Rebalancing

Portfolio rebalancing allows you to maintain the
percentage of your Contract Value allocated to each Variable
Investment Option at a pre-set level prior to annuitization.








 

For example, you could specify that 30% of your
  Contract Value should be in the Equity Index Subaccount, 40% in
  the Managed Bond Subaccount, and 30% in the Growth LT Subaccount.
  



Over time, the variations in each
Subaccount’s investment results will shift this balance of
these Subaccount Value allocations. If you elect the portfolio
rebalancing feature, we will automatically transfer your
Subaccount Value back to the percentages you specify.


You may choose to have rebalances made quarterly,
semi-annually or annually until your Annuity Date; portfolio
rebalancing is not available after you annuitize.




Procedures for selecting portfolio rebalancing
are generally the same as those discussed in detail above for
selecting dollar cost averaging: You may make your request at
any time prior to your Annuity Date and it will be effective
when we receive it in a form satisfactory to us. If you stop
portfolio rebalancing, you must wait 30 days to begin
again. Currently, we are not enforcing the 30-day waiting period
but we reserve the right to enforce such waiting period in the
future. If you specify a date fewer than 30 days after your
Contract Date, your first rebalance will be delayed one month,
and if you request rebalancing on your application but do not
specify a date for the first rebalance, it will occur one period
after your Contract Date, as described above under Dollar Cost
Averaging. We may change, terminate or suspend the portfolio
rebalancing feature at any time.




Earnings Sweep



An earnings sweep automatically transfers the
earnings from the Fixed Option or the Money Market Subaccount
(the “sweep option”) to one or more other Variable
Investment Options (your “target option(s)”). The
Account Value of your sweep option will be required to be at
least $5,000 when you elect the earnings sweep. Currently, we
are not enforcing the minimum Account Value but we reserve the
right to enforce such minimum amounts in the future.




You may choose to have earnings sweeps occur
monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually until you
annuitize. At each earnings sweep, we will automatically
transfer your accumulated earnings attributable to your sweep
option for the previous period proportionately to your target
option(s). That is, if you select a monthly earnings sweep, we
will transfer the sweep option earnings from the preceding
month; if you select a semi-annual earnings sweep, we will
transfer the sweep option earnings accumulated over the
preceding six months. Earnings sweep transfers are not subject
to the same requirements and limitations as other transfers.


To determine the earnings, we take the change in
the sweep option’s Account Value during the sweep period,
add any withdrawals or transfers out of the sweep option Account
that occurred during the sweep period, and subtract any
allocations to the sweep option Account during the sweep period.
The result of this calculation represents the “total
earnings” for the sweep period.


If, during the sweep period, you withdraw or
transfer amounts from the sweep option Account, we assume that
earnings are withdrawn or transferred before any other Account
Value. Therefore, your “total earnings” for the sweep
period will be reduced by any amounts withdrawn or transferred
during the sweep option period. The remaining earnings are
eligible for the sweep transfer.


Procedures for selecting the earnings sweep are
generally the same as those discussed in detail above for
selecting dollar cost averaging and portfolio rebalancing: You
may make your request at any time and it will be effective when
we receive it in a form satisfactory to us. If you stop the
earnings sweep, you must wait 30 days to begin again.
Currently, we are not enforcing the 30-day waiting period but we
reserve the right to enforce such waiting period in the future.
If you specify a date fewer than 30 days after your
Contract Date, your first earnings sweep will be delayed one
month, and if you request the earnings sweep on your application
but do not specify a date for the first sweep, it will occur one
period after your Contract Date, as described above under Dollar
Cost Averaging.

12



Table of Contents



If you are using the earnings sweep, you may also
use portfolio rebalancing only if you selected the Fixed Option
as your sweep option or, if the Money Market was elected as the
sweep option, it may not be rebalanced as part of portfolio
rebalancing. You may not use the earnings sweep and dollar cost
averaging at the same time. If, as a result of an earnings sweep
transfer, your source Account Value falls below any minimum
Account Value we may establish, we have the right, at our
option, to transfer that remaining Account Value to your target
account(s) on a proportionate basis relative to your most recent
allocation instructions. We may change, terminate or suspend the
earnings sweep option at any time.





Pre-Authorized Withdrawals

You may specify a dollar amount for your
pre-authorized withdrawals, or you may specify a percentage of
your Contract Value or an Account Value. You may direct us to
make your pre-authorized withdrawals from one or more specific
Investment Options. If you do not give us these specific
instructions, amounts will be deducted proportionately from your
Account Value in each Investment Option.




Procedures for selecting pre-authorized
withdrawals are generally the same as those discussed in detail
above for selecting dollar cost averaging, portfolio
rebalancing, and earnings sweeps: You may make your request at
any time and it will be effective when we receive it in a form
satisfactory to us. If you stop the pre-authorized withdrawals,
you must wait 30 days to begin again. Currently, we are not
enforcing the 30-day waiting period but we reserve the right to
enforce such waiting period in the future.




If your pre-authorized withdrawals cause your
Account Value in any Investment Option to fall below $500, we
have the right, at our option, to transfer that remaining
Account Value to your other Investment Options on a
proportionate basis relative to your most recent allocation
instructions. If your pre-authorized withdrawals cause your
Contract Value to fall below $1,000, we may, at our option,
terminate your Contract and send you the remaining withdrawal
proceeds.




Pre-authorized withdrawals are subject to the
same withdrawal charges as are other withdrawals, and each
withdrawal is subject to any applicable charge for premium taxes
and/or other taxes, to federal income tax on its taxable
portion, and, if you have not reached age 59 1/2, may be subject
to a 10% federal tax penalty.





Death Benefit



The standard death benefit payable will be
calculated as of the date we receive, in a form satisfactory to
us, proof of the Annuitant’s death (or, if applicable, the
Contract Owner’s death) and instructions regarding payment.
Any Guaranteed Minimum Death Benefit payable will be calculated
as of the date we are first notified of the death. Any claim of
a death benefit must be made in a form satisfactory to us. A
recipient of death benefit proceeds may elect to have this
benefit paid in one lump sum, in periodic payments, in the form
of a lifetime annuity or in some combination of these. Annuity
payments normally will begin within 30 days once we receive
all information necessary to process the claim.




If your Contract names Joint or Contingent
Annuitants, no death benefit will be payable unless and until
the last Annuitant dies prior to the Annuity Date or a Contract
Owner dies prior to the Annuity Date. If both the Contract
Owner(s) and the Annuitant(s) are non-natural persons, no death
benefit will be payable, and any distribution will be treated as
a withdrawal and subject to any applicable charges for Annual
Fees, transaction fees, withdrawal fees, premium taxes and/or
other taxes, and withdrawal charges.


Death of an Annuitant



If a Joint Annuitant who is not a Contract Owner
dies prior to the Annuity Date, the surviving Joint Annuitant
becomes the Annuitant. If your Annuitant is not a Contract Owner
and dies, or if there is no surviving Joint Annuitant, the
surviving Contingent Annuitant becomes the Annuitant. If there
is no surviving Contingent Annuitant, the death benefit becomes
payable.






Any death benefit payable on the death of the
Annuitant is payable to the surviving Beneficiary. If no
Beneficiary survives, any death benefit will be payable to the
surviving Owner, if there is one; if not, any death benefit will
be payable to the Owner’s estate.



13



Table of Contents

Death of a Contract Owner



If any Contract Owner dies prior to the Annuity
Date while the Annuitant is still living, a death benefit may be
payable. If that Contract Owner was the sole Annuitant or a
Joint Annuitant under the Contract, any death benefit will be
payable to the surviving Beneficiary, or to the Owner’s
estate if no Beneficiary survives. If that Contract Owner was
not an Annuitant under the Contract, any death benefit will be
payable to the surviving Joint Owner of the Contract, if there
is one; if not, the death benefit will be payable to the
surviving Contingent Owner, if there is one; if not, any death
benefit will be payable to the surviving designated Beneficiary,
or to the Owner’s estate if no designated Beneficiary
survives. If the Joint or Contingent Owner is the deceased
Contract Owner’s surviving spouse, he or she may elect to
become the Contract Owner and continue the Contract rather than
receive the death benefit proceeds.





Joint Annuitants on Qualified
Contracts

On your Annuity Date, if your Contract was issued
in connection with a Qualified Plan subject to Title I of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
(“ERISA”), and you change your marital status after
your Contract Date, you may be permitted to add a Joint
Annuitant and to change your Joint Annuitant. Generally
speaking, you may be permitted to add a new spouse as a Joint
Annuitant, and you may be permitted to remove a Joint Annuitant
who is no longer your spouse.




More on Federal Tax Issues





Section 817(h) of the Code provides that the
investments underlying a variable annuity must satisfy certain
diversification requirements. Details on these diversification
requirements appear in the Pacific Select Fund SAI. We believe
the underlying Variable Investment Options for the Contract meet
these requirements. In connection with the issuance of temporary
regulations relating to diversification requirements under
Section 817(h), the Treasury Department announced that such
regulations do not provide guidance concerning the extent to
which you may direct your investments to particular divisions of
a separate account. Such guidance may be included in regulations
or revenue rulings under Section 817(d) relating to the
definition of a variable contract. We reserve the right to make
such changes as we deem necessary or appropriate to ensure that
your Contract continues to qualify as an annuity for tax
purposes. Any such changes will apply uniformly to affected
Contract Owners and will be made with such notice to affected
Contract Owners as is feasible under the circumstances.






For a variable life insurance contract or a
variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral, assets in
the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered
to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract
owner. Under current U.S. tax law, if a contract owner has
excessive control over the investments made by a separate
account, or the underlying fund, the contract owner will be
taxed currently on income and gains from the account or fund. In
other words, in such a case of “investor control” the
contract owner would not derive the tax benefits normally
associated with variable life insurance or variable annuities.






Generally, according to the IRS, there are two
ways that impermissible investor control may exist. The first
relates to the design of the contract or the relationship
between the contract and a separate account or underlying fund.
For example, at various times, the IRS has focused on, among
other factors, the number and type of investment choices
available pursuant to a given variable contract, whether the
contract offers access to funds that are available to the
general public, the number of transfers that a contract owner
may make from one investment option to another, and the degree
to which a contract owner may select or control particular
investments.






With respect to this first aspect of investor
control, we believe that the design of our contracts and the
relationship between our contracts and the Portfolios satisfy
the current view of the IRS on this subject, such that the
investor control doctrine should not apply. However, because of
some uncertainty with respect to this subject and because the
IRS may issue further guidance on this subject, we reserve the
right to make such changes as we deem necessary or appropriate
to reduce the risk that your contract might not qualify as a
life insurance contract or as an annuity for tax purposes.






The second way that impermissible investor
control might exist concerns your actions. Under the IRS
pronouncements, you may not select or control particular
investments, other than choosing among broad investment choices



14



Table of Contents



such as selecting a particular Portfolio. You may
not select or direct the purchase or sale of a particular
investment of a Separate Account, a Subaccount (or Variable
Investment Option), or a Portfolio. All investment decisions
concerning the Separate Accounts and the Subaccounts must be
made by us, and all investment decisions concerning the
underlying Portfolios must be made by the portfolio manager for
such Portfolio in his or her sole and absolute discretion, and
not by the contract owner. Furthermore, under the IRS
pronouncements, you may not enter into an agreement or
arrangement with a portfolio manager of a Portfolio or
communicate directly or indirectly with such a portfolio manager
or any related investment officers concerning the selection,
quality, or rate of return of any specific investment or group
of investments held by a Portfolio, and you may not enter into
any such agreement or arrangement or have any such communication
with us or PLFA.







Finally, the IRS may issue additional guidance on
the investor control doctrine, which might further restrict your
actions or features of the variable contract. Such guidance
could be applied retroactively. If any of the rules outlined
above are not complied with, the IRS may seek to tax you
currently on income and gains from a Portfolio such that you
would not derive the tax benefits normally associated with
variable life insurance or variable annuities. Although highly
unlikely, such an event may have an adverse impact on the fund
and other variable contracts. We urge you to consult your own
tax adviser with respect to the application of the investor
control doctrine.






Loans





Certain Owners of Qualified Contracts may borrow
against their Contracts. Otherwise loans from us are not
permitted. You may request a loan from us, using your Contract
Value as your only security if yours is a Qualified Contract
that is:













 
• 

not subject to Title 1 of ERISA,
  




 




 
• 

issued under Section 403(b) of the Code, and
  




 




 
• 

permits loans under its terms (a “Loan
  Eligible Plan”).
  







You will be charged interest on your Contract
Debt at a fixed annual rate equal to 5%. The amount held in the
Loan Account to secure your loan will earn a return equal to an
annual rate of 3%. This loan rate may vary by state.






Interest charges accrue on your Contract Debt
daily, beginning on the effective date of your loan. Interest
earned on the Loan Account Value accrue daily beginning on the
day following the effective date of the loan, and those earnings
will be transferred once a year to your Investment Options in
accordance with your most recent allocation instructions.






We may change these loan provisions to reflect
changes in the Code or interpretations thereof.






Tax and Legal Matters





The tax and ERISA rules relating to Contract
loans are complex and in many cases unclear. For these reasons,
and because the rules vary depending on the individual
circumstances, these loans are processed by your Plan
Administrator. We urge you to consult with a qualified tax
adviser prior to effecting any loan transaction under your
Contract.






Generally, interest paid on your loan under a
403(b) tax-sheltered annuity will be considered non-deductible
“personal interest” under Section 163(h) of the
Code, to the extent the loan comes from and is secured by your
pre-tax contributions, even if the proceeds of your loan are
used to acquire your principal residence.






In order to secure your loan, on the effective
date of your loan, we will transfer an amount equal to the
principal amount of your loan into an account called the
“Loan Account.” The Loan Account is held under the
General Account. To make this transfer, we will transfer amounts
proportionately from your Investment Options based on your
Account Value in each Investment Option.






As your loan is repaid, a portion, corresponding
to the amount of the repayment of any amount then held as
security for your loan, will be transferred from the Loan
Account back into your Investment Options relative to your most
recent allocation instructions.



15



Table of Contents



A transfer from the Loan Account back into your
Investment Options following a loan repayment is not considered
a transfer under the transfer limitations as stated in the
HOW YOUR INVESTMENTS ARE ALLOCATED— Transfers and
Market-timing Restrictions section in the Prospectus.






Loan Terms





You may have only one loan outstanding at any
time. The minimum loan amount is $1,000, subject to certain
state limitations. Your Contract Debt at the effective date of
your loan may not exceed the lesser of:













 
• 

50% of your Contract Value, or
  




 




 
• 

$50,000 less your highest outstanding Contract
  Debt during the 12-month period immediately preceding the
  effective date of your loan.
  







You should refer to the terms of your particular
Loan Eligible Plan for any additional loan restrictions. If you
have other loans outstanding pursuant to other Loan Eligible
Plans, the amount you may borrow may be further restricted. We
are not responsible for making any determination (including loan
amounts permitted) or any interpretation with respect to your
Loan Eligible Plan.






Repayment Terms





Your loan, including principal and accrued
interest, generally must be repaid in quarterly installments. An
installment will be due in each quarter on the date
corresponding to the effective date of your loan, beginning with
the first such date following the effective date of your loan.
See the Qualified Contracts — Loans
section in the Prospectus.












 

 Example: On May 1, we receive your
  loan request, and your loan is effective. Your first quarterly
  payment will be due on August 1.
  







Adverse tax consequences may result if you fail
to meet the repayment requirements for your loan. You must repay
principal and interest of any loan in substantially equal
payments over the term of the loan. Generally, the term of the
loan will be 5 years from the effective date of the loan.
However, if you have certified to us that your loan proceeds are
to be used to acquire a principal residence for yourself, you
may request a loan term of 30 years. In either case,
however, you must repay your loan prior to your Annuity Date. If
you elect to annuitize (or withdraw) your Net Contract Value
while you have an outstanding loan, we will deduct any Contract
Debt from your Contract Value at the time of the annuitization
(or withdrawal) to repay the Contract Debt.






You may prepay your entire loan at any time. If
you do so, we will bill you for any unpaid interest that has
accrued through the date of payoff. Your loan will be considered
repaid only when the interest due has been paid. Subject to any
necessary approval of state insurance authorities, while you
have Contract Debt outstanding, we will treat all payments you
send us as Investments unless you specifically indicate that
your payment is a loan repayment or include your loan payment
notice with your payment. To the extent allowed by law, any loan
repayments in excess of the amount then due will be applied to
the principal balance of your loan. Such repayments will not
change the due dates or the periodic repayment amount due for
future periods. If a loan repayment is in excess of the
principal balance of your loan, any excess repayment will be
refunded to you. Repayments we receive that are less than the
amount then due will be returned to you, unless otherwise
required by law.






If we have not received your full payment by its
due date, we will declare the entire remaining loan balance in
default. At that time, we will send written notification of the
amount needed to bring the loan back to a current status. You
will have sixty (60) days from the date on which the loan
was declared in default (the “grace period”) to make
the required payment.






If the required payment is not received by the
end of the grace period, the defaulted loan balance plus accrued
interest and any withdrawal charge will be withdrawn from your
Contract Value, if amounts under your Contract are eligible
for distribution. In order for an amount to be eligible for
distribution from a TSA funded by salary reductions you must
meet one of five triggering events. The triggering events are:



16



Table of Contents










 
• 

attainment of age 59 1/2,
  




 




 
• 

severance from employment,
  




 




 
• 

death,
  




 




 
• 

disability, and
  




 




 
• 

financial hardship (with respect to contributions
  only, not income or earnings on these contributions).
  







If those amounts are not eligible for
distribution, the defaulted loan balance plus accrued interest
and any withdrawal charge will be considered a Deemed
Distribution and will be withdrawn when such Contract Values
become eligible. In either case, the Distribution or the Deemed
Distribution will be considered a currently taxable
event, and may be subject to federal tax withholding, the
withdrawal charge and may be subject to a 10% federal tax
penalty.






If there is a Deemed Distribution under your
Contract and to the extent allowed by law, any future
withdrawals will first be applied as repayment of the defaulted
Contract Debt, including accrued interest and charges for
applicable taxes. Any amounts withdrawn and applied as repayment
of Contract Debt will first be withdrawn from your Loan Account,
and then from your Investment Options on a proportionate basis
relative to the Account Value in each Investment Option. If you
have an outstanding loan that is in default, the defaulted
Contract Debt will be considered a withdrawal for the purpose of
calculating any Death Benefit Amount and/or Guaranteed Minimum
Death Benefit.






The terms of any such loan are intended to
qualify for the exception in Code Section 72(p)(2) so that
the distribution of the loan proceeds will not constitute a
distribution that is taxable to you. To that end, these loan
provisions will be interpreted to ensure and maintain such tax
qualification, despite any other provisions to the contrary.
Subject to any regulatory approval, we reserve the right to
amend your Contract to reflect any clarifications that may be
needed or are appropriate to maintain such tax qualification or
to conform any terms of our loan arrangement with you to any
applicable changes in the tax qualification requirements. We
will send you a copy of any such amendment. If you refuse such
an amendment, it may result in adverse tax consequences to you.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Pacific Life Insurance Company and Subsidiaries:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
financial condition of Pacific Life Insurance Company and
Subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholder’s equity
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2007. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes consideration of internal
control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for
the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly,
we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pacific
Life Insurance Company and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2007 and
2006, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2007 in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in
2007 the Company changed its method of accounting and reporting for
deferred acquisition costs in connection with modifications or
exchanges of insurance contracts and for defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans.

As discussed in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to give effect to broker-dealer discontinued
operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




1.
 
ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


 

 
 
ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS


 


 

 
 
Pacific Life Insurance Company (Pacific Life) was established in 1868 and is domiciled in the
State of Nebraska as a stock life insurance company. Pacific Life is an indirect subsidiary
of Pacific Mutual Holding Company (PMHC), a Nebraska mutual holding company, and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Pacific LifeCorp, an intermediate Delaware stock holding company. PMHC
and Pacific LifeCorp were organized pursuant to consent received from the California
Department of Insurance and the implementation of a plan of conversion to form a mutual
holding company structure in 1997 (the Conversion).


 

 
 
Pacific Life and its subsidiaries and affiliates have primary business operations consisting
of life insurance, individual annuities, mutual funds, and pension and institutional products.
Pacific Life’s primary business operations provide life insurance products, individual
annuities and mutual funds, and offer to individuals, businesses, and pension plans a variety
of investment products and services.


 

 
 
Pacific Life transferred its legal domicile from the State of California to the State of
Nebraska effective September 1, 2005. PMHC transferred its state of legal domicile from the
State of California to the State of Nebraska, effective June 29, 2007, to reunite PMHC and
Pacific Life under one regulatory authority.


 

 
 
BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION


 


 

 
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Pacific Life and its subsidiaries (the
Company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Pacific Life and its majority
owned and controlled subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) in which the Company
was determined to be the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. Included in other liabilities is minority interest of $181
million and $92 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.


 

 
 
Pacific Life prepares its regulatory financial statements in accordance with statutory
accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the Nebraska Department of Insurance (NE DOI),
which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP (Note 2). These
consolidated financial statements materially differ from those filed with regulatory
authorities.


 

 
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as
of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


 

 
 
In developing these estimates, management makes subjective and complex judgments that are
inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop.
Management has identified the following estimates as significant, as they involve a higher
degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability:






 
•
 
The fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values


 

 
•
 
Investment impairments


 

 
•
 
Application of the consolidation rules to certain investments


 

 
•
 
The fair value of and accounting for derivatives


 

 
•
 
The capitalization and amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)


 

 
•
 
The liability for future policyholder benefits


 

 
•
 
Accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred income tax assets and
liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits


 

 
•
 
Accounting for reinsurance transactions


 

 
•
 
Litigation and other contingencies

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2006 and 2005 consolidated financial
statements to conform to the 2007 financial statement presentation. The most significant
conforming reclassification was reflecting the Company’s broker-dealer operations as a
discontinued operation (Note 6).


 

 
 
RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS


 


 

 
 
Effective December 31, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans. This statement requires an employer to
recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an
asset or liability in its statement of financial condition and to recognize changes in that
funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income. The
Company’s adoption of SFAS No. 158 resulted in a reduction to other comprehensive income (OCI)
of $20 million, net of taxes.


 

 
 
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 48, Accounting
for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. FIN 48 presents
a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and
measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. There is a
two-step evaluation process. The first step is recognition and a company must determine
whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained. The second step is
measurement. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold should
be measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized
upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant
information. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and
penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company’s policy is
to recognize interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a
component of the provision for income taxes. The adoption of FIN 48 had no impact on the
Company’s consolidated financial statements, and therefore, there was no cumulative effect
related to the adoption of FIN 48.


 

 
 
Effective May 2, 2007, the Company adopted FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. FIN 48-1, Definition
of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48. This FSP amends FIN 48 to provide guidance on
how to determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing
previously unrecognized tax benefits. This statement is effective upon the initial adoption
of FIN 48 with retrospective application if the provisions of this FSP were not previously
applied. The adoption of this FSP had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
statements, and therefore, there was no retrospective adjustment.


 

 
 
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid
Instruments. SFAS No. 155 amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and
Hedging Activities and SFAS No. 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, a replacement of FASB Statement No. 125. SFAS No.
155 (i) permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an
embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation; (ii) clarifies which
interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the requirements of SFAS No.
133; (iii) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to
identify interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments
that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation; (iv) clarifies that concentrations
of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives; and (v) amends SFAS
No. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity (SPE) from holding
a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another
derivative financial instrument. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 did not have a material impact
on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 05-1, Accounting by Insurance Enterprises
for Deferred Acquisition Costs in Connection With Modifications or Exchanges of Insurance
Contracts. This SOP provides guidance on accounting for DAC on internal replacements on
insurance and investment contracts other than those described in SFAS No. 97, Accounting
and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Long-Duration Contracts and for
Realized Gains and Losses from the Sale of Investments. SOP 05-1 defines an internal
replacement as a modification in product benefits, features, rights, or coverages that
occur by the exchange of a contract for a new contract, or by amendment, endorsement, or
rider to a contract, or by the election of a feature or coverage within a contract. SOP
05-1 is effective for internal replacements occurring in fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006. In addition, in February 2007, the AICPA issued related Technical
Practice Aids (TPAs) to provide further clarification of SOP 05-1. The TPAs became
effective concurrently with the adoption of SOP 05-1. The adoption of SOP 05-1 and the
related TPAs resulted in a

reduction to DAC and the Company recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of $29 million, net
of taxes, which was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.






 
 
In April 2006, the FASB issued FSP FIN 46(R)-6, Determining the Variability to Be Considered
in Applying FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). This FSP addresses how an entity determines the
variability to be considered in applying FIN 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46(R)). The variability
affects the determination of whether an entity is a VIE, which interests are variable
interests in an entity, and which party is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. That
variability affects any calculation of expected losses and expected residual returns, if such
a calculation is necessary. FSP FIN 46(R)-6 was effective for the Company beginning July 1,
2006. Adoption did not impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error
Corrections. This statement changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of
a change in accounting principle and applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle
as well as changes required by a new accounting pronouncement. It establishes, unless
impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in
accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to a newly
adopted accounting principle.


 

 
 
Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted FSP SFAS No. 115-1 and SFAS No. 124-1, The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. The
guidance within this FSP is applicable to debt and equity securities that are within the scope
of SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities. This FSP
nullifies certain requirements of Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-1, The
Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments,
regarding the recognition of other than temporary impairments and restores the guidance for
determination of other than temporary impairment to SFAS No. 115, EITF Issue No. 99-20,
Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Purchased and Retained Beneficial Interests
in Securitized Financial Assets, and Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 18, The Equity
Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock. This FSP adopts the disclosure
requirements of EITF Issue No. 03-1. For other than temporarily impaired debt securities, the
investor will account for the debt security as if the debt security was purchased on the
measurement date of the other than temporary impairment. The discount recorded for the debt
security will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt security as a yield adjustment.
Adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
Under FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,
the consolidation requirements for the Company’s VIEs, created prior to December 31, 2003,
were applied effective January 1, 2005. The Company determined that it is the primary
beneficiary of a Collateralized Debt Obligation (CDO) VIE of high-yield debt securities that
it sponsored in 1998 (Note 4). In accordance with the transition provisions of FIN 46(R), the
Company increased assets $67 million, liabilities $65 million, including non-recourse debt of
$62 million, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) $4 million and decreased net income
by $2 million as a cumulative adjustment due to a change in accounting principle upon the
adoption of FIN 46(R).


 

 
 
FUTURE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS


 


 

 
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51. SFAS No. 160 improves the relevance,
comparability and transparency of the financial information that a company provides in its
consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards for the
noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. This
statement is effective beginning January 1, 2009. The Company is evaluating the impact of
SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS
No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for
how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets
acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, recognizes
and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information
to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial
effects of the business combination. This statement is effective beginning January 1, 2009.
The Company is evaluating the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on its consolidated financial
statements.

Table of Contents







 
 
In April 2007, the FASB issued FSP No. FIN 39-1, Amendment of FASB Interpretation No. 39. FSP
FIN 39-1 amends FIN No. 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts, to permit a
reporting entity to offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash
collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) against fair
value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under
the same master netting arrangement that have been offset in accordance with FIN 39. FSP FIN
39-1 also amends FIN 39 for certain terminology modifications. This statement permits
offsetting of fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting
arrangements. FSP FIN 39-1 is effective beginning January 1, 2008 and adoption is not
expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities — Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. This statement
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This statement also
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons
between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and
liabilities. This statement is effective beginning January 1, 2008. Adoption of SFAS No. 159
is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement
creates a common definition of fair value to be used throughout U.S. GAAP. SFAS No. 157 will
apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at
fair value, with certain exceptions. The standard establishes a hierarchy for determining
fair value, which emphasizes the use of observable market data whenever available. The
statement also requires expanded disclosures, which include the extent to which assets and
liabilities are measured at fair value, the methods and assumptions used to measure fair value
and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. This statement is effective beginning
January 1, 2008. Adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s

Fixed maturity and equity securities available for sale are reported at estimated fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes and adjustments related to DAC
and future policy benefits, recorded as a component of OCI. For mortgage-backed securities
and asset-backed securities (ABS) included in fixed maturity securities available for sale,
the Company recognizes income using a constant effective yield based on anticipated
prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments
change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated
future payments. For fixed rate securities, the net investment in the securities is adjusted
to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the
acquisition of the securities. These adjustments are reflected in net investment income.
Trading securities are reported at estimated fair value with changes in estimated fair value
included in net realized investment gain (loss).


 

 
 
Investment income consists primarily of interest and dividends, net investment income from
partnership interests, prepayment fees on fixed maturity securities and mortgage loans, and
income from certain derivatives. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis and dividends are
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Amortization of premium and accretion of discount on fixed
maturity securities is recorded using the effective interest method.


 

 
 
The estimated fair value of fixed maturity and equity securities is generally obtained from
independent pricing services. For fixed maturity securities not able to be priced by
independent services (generally private placement and low volume traded securities), an
internally developed matrix is used. The matrix utilizes the fair market yield curves,
provided by a major independent data service, which determines the discount yield based upon
the security’s weighted-average life, rating, and liquidity spread. The estimated fair value
of the security is calculated as the present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at
the yield determined above. For those securities not priced externally or by the matrix, the
estimated fair value is internally determined, utilizing various techniques in valuing complex
investments with variable cash flows. Equity securities available for sale include common
stocks that have a readily determinable fair value and perpetual preferred stocks.

The matrix-priced securities primarily consist of private placements and have an average
duration of four and a half years as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.


 

 
 
The Company assesses whether other than temporary impairments have occurred based upon the
Company’s case-by-case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in estimated fair
value. All securities with a gross unrealized loss at the consolidated statement of financial
condition date are subjected to the Company’s process for identifying other than temporary
impairments. The Company considers a wide range of factors, as described below, about the
security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the
estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near-term recovery.
Inherent in the Company’s evaluation of each security are assumptions and estimates about the
operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential.


 

 
 
Considerations used by the Company in the impairment evaluation process include, but are not
limited to, the following:






 
•
 
The duration and extent that the estimated fair value has been below net carrying
amount


 

 
•
 
Industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area that are negatively
affecting the security


 

 
•
 
Underlying valuation of assets specifically pledged to support the credit


 

 
•
 
Past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants


 

 
•
 
Deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer


 

 
•
 
Downgrades by a rating agency


 

 
•
 
Ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time to allow for a
recovery of value


 

 
•
 
Fundamental analysis of the liquidity and financial condition of the specific
issuer






 
 
Also, the Company estimates the cash flows over the life of certain purchased beneficial
interests in securitized financial assets. Based upon current information and events, if the
estimated fair value of its beneficial interests is less than or equal to its net carrying
amount and if there has been an adverse change in the estimated cash flows since the last
revised estimate, considering both timing and amount, then an other than temporary impairment
is recognized.


 

 
 
Securities and purchased beneficial interests that are deemed to be other than temporarily
impaired are written down to estimated fair value in the period the securities or purchased
beneficial interest are deemed to be impaired.


 

 
 
Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are determined on a specific
identification basis and are included in net realized investment gain (loss). The Company
also includes other than temporary impairment write-downs in net realized investment gain
(loss).


 

 
 
Mortgage loans on real estate are carried at their unpaid principal balance, net of deferred
origination fees, valuation allowances and write-downs. Mortgage loans are considered to be
impaired when management estimates that based upon current information and events, it is
probable that the Company will not be able to collect amounts due according to the contractual
terms of the mortgage loan agreement. For mortgage loans deemed to be impaired, a valuation
allowance is established for the difference between the carrying amount and the Company’s
estimate of the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the current
market rate. Changes to the valuation allowance are recorded in net realized investment gain
(loss). Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances.



PL-11

Other investments primarily consist of partnership and joint ventures, real estate
investments, derivative instruments, non marketable equity securities, and low income housing
related investments qualifying for tax credits (LIHTC). Partnership and joint venture
interests where the Company does not have a controlling interest or majority ownership are
recorded under the cost or equity method of accounting depending on the equity ownership
position. Real estate investments are carried at depreciated cost, net of write-downs, or,
for real estate acquired in satisfaction of debt, estimated fair value less estimated selling
costs at the date of acquisition, if lower than the related unpaid balance.


 

 
 
All derivatives, whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be
recorded at estimated fair value. If the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the
effective portion of changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in OCI
and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. If the derivative is
designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the estimated fair value of the derivative
and the hedged item are recognized in net realized investment gain (loss). The change in
value of the hedged item associated with the risk being hedged is reflected as an adjustment
to the carrying amount of the hedged item. For derivative instruments not designated as
hedges, the change in estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in net realized
investment gain (loss). Estimated fair value exposure is calculated based on the aggregate
estimated fair value of all derivative instruments with each counterparty, net of collateral
received, in accordance with legally enforceable counterparty master netting agreements (Note
9).


 

 
 
The periodic cash flows for all hedging derivatives are recorded consistent with the hedged
item on an accrual basis. For derivatives that are hedging securities, these amounts are
included in net investment income. For derivatives that are hedging liabilities, these
amounts are included in interest credited to policyholder account balances. For derivatives
not designated as hedging instruments, the periodic cash flows are reflected in net realized
investment gain (loss) on an accrual basis. Upon termination of a cash flow hedging
relationship, the accumulated amount in OCI is amortized into net investment income or
interest credited to policyholder account balances over the remaining life of the hedged item.
Upon termination of a fair value hedging relationship, the accumulated cost basis adjustment
to the hedged item is amortized into net investment income or interest credited to
policyholder account balances over its remaining life.


 

 
 
Investments in LIHTC are recorded under either the effective interest method, if they meet
certain requirements, including a projected positive yield based solely on guaranteed credits,
or are recorded under the equity method if these certain requirements are not met. For
investments in LIHTC recorded under the effective interest method, the amortization of the
original investment and the tax credits are recorded in the provision for income taxes. For
investments in LIHTC recorded under the equity method, the amortization of the initial
investment is included in net investment income, and the related tax credits are recorded in
the provision for income taxes. The amortization recorded in net investment income was $20
million, $24 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively.


 

 
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS


 


 

 
 
Cash and cash equivalents include all investments with an original maturity of three months or
less.


 

 
 
DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS


 


 

 
 
The costs of acquiring new insurance business, principally commissions, medical examinations,
underwriting, policy issue and other expenses, all of which vary with and are primarily
associated with the production of new business, are deferred and recorded as an asset commonly
referred to as DAC. DAC related to internally replaced contracts (as defined by SOP 05-1), is
immediately written off to expense and any new deferrable expenses associated with the
replacement are deferred if the contract modification substantially changes the contract.
However, if the contract modification does not substantially change the contract, the existing
DAC asset remains in place and any acquisition costs associated with the modification are
immediately expensed. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of DAC was $4.5
billion and $4.2 billion, respectively (Note 7).


 

 
 
For universal life (UL), variable annuities and other investment-type contracts, acquisition
costs are amortized through earnings in proportion to the present value of estimated gross
profits (EGPs) from projected investment, mortality and expense
margins, and surrender charges
over the estimated lives of the contracts. Actual gross margins or profits can vary from
management’s estimates, which can increase or decrease the rate of DAC amortization. DAC
related to traditional policies is amortized through earnings over the premium-paying period
of the related policies in proportion to premium revenues recognized, using assumptions and
estimates consistent with those used in computing policy



PL-12



Table of Contents



 
 
reserves. DAC related to certain unrealized components in OCI, primarily unrealized gains and
losses on securities available for sale, is recorded directly to equity through OCI.






 
 
Significant assumptions in the development of EGPs include investment returns, surrender and
lapse rates, rider utilization, interest spreads, and mortality margins. The Company’s
long-term assumption for the underlying separate account investment return ranges up to 8.0%.


 

 
 
A change in the assumptions utilized to develop EGPs results in a change to amounts expensed
in the reporting period in which the change was made by adjusting the DAC balance to the level
DAC would have been had the EGPs been calculated using the new assumptions over the entire
amortization period. In general, favorable experience variances result in increased expected
future profitability and may lower the rate of DAC amortization, whereas unfavorable
experience variances result in decreased expected future profitability and may increase the
rate of DAC amortization. All critical assumptions utilized to develop EGPs are evaluated at
least annually and necessary revisions are made to future EGPs to the extent that actual or
anticipated experience necessitates such a prospective change (Note 7).


 

 
 
The Company defers sales inducements and amortizes them over the life of the policy using the
same methodology and assumptions used to amortize DAC. The Company offers a sales inducement
to the policyholder where the policyholder receives a bonus credit, typically ranging from
4.0% to 5.0% of each deposit. The capitalized sales inducement balances included in the DAC
asset were $552 million and $538 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.


 

 
 
GOODWILL FROM ACQUISITIONS


 


 

 
 
The Company’s acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Goodwill from acquisitions, included in other assets, totaled $15 million and $22 million as
of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. There were no goodwill impairment write-downs
from continuing operations during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.


 

 
 
POLICYHOLDER ACCOUNT BALANCES


 


 

 
 
Policyholder account balances on UL and investment-type contracts, such as funding agreements,
fixed account liabilities and guaranteed interest contracts (GICs), are valued using the
retrospective deposit method and are equal to accumulated account values, which consist of
deposits received, plus interest credited, less withdrawals and assessments. Interest
credited to these contracts primarily ranged from 2.0% to 8.0%.


 

 
 
FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS


 


 

 
 
Annuity reserves, which primarily consist of group retirement and structured settlement
annuities, are equal to the present value of estimated future payments using pricing
assumptions, as applicable, for interest rates, mortality, morbidity, retirement age and
expenses. Interest rates used in establishing such liabilities ranged from 1.6% to 11.0%.


 

 
 
Policy charges assessed against policyholders that represent compensation to the Company for
services to be provided in future periods, or unearned revenue reserves, are recognized in
income over the expected life of the contract using the same methods and assumptions used to
amortize DAC. Unearned revenue related to certain unrealized components in OCI, primarily
unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale, is recorded directly to equity
through OCI.


 

 
 
Life insurance reserves are valued using the net level premium method on the basis of
actuarial assumptions appropriate at policy issue. Mortality and persistency assumptions are
generally based on the Company’s experience, which, together with interest and expense
assumptions, include a margin for possible unfavorable deviations. Interest rate assumptions
ranged from 4.5% to 9.3%. Future dividends for participating business are provided for in the
liability for future policy benefits.


 

 
 
As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, participating experience rated policies paying dividends
represent less than 1% of direct life insurance in force.


 

 
 
Estimates of future policy benefit reserves and liabilities are continually reviewed and, as
experience develops, are adjusted as necessary. Such changes in estimates are included in
earnings for the period in which such changes occur.



PL-13

REVENUES, BENEFITS AND EXPENSES


 


 

 
 
Insurance premiums, annuity contracts with life contingencies and traditional life and term
insurance contracts, are recognized as revenue when due. Benefits and expenses are matched
against such revenues to recognize profits over the lives of the contracts. This matching is
accomplished by providing for liabilities for future policy benefits, expenses of contract
administration and the amortization of DAC.


 

 
 
Receipts for UL and investment-type contracts are reported as deposits to either policyholder
account balances or separate account liabilities, and are not included in revenue. Policy
fees consist of mortality charges, surrender charges and expense charges that have been earned
and assessed against related account values during the period. The timing of policy fee
revenue recognition is determined based on the nature of the fees. Certain amounts assessed
that represent compensation for services to be provided in future periods are reported as
unearned revenue and recognized in revenue over the periods benefited. Benefits and expenses
include policy benefits and claims incurred in the period that are in excess of related
policyholder account balances, interest credited to policyholder account balances, expenses of
contract administration and the amortization of DAC.


 

 
 
Reinsurance premiums ceded and reinsurance recoveries on benefits and claims incurred are
deducted from their respective revenue and benefit and expense accounts.


 

 
 
Investment advisory fees are primarily fees earned from the Pacific Select Fund, the
investment vehicle provided to the Company’s variable universal life (VUL) and variable
annuity contract holders. These fees are based upon the net asset value of the underlying
portfolios, and are recorded as earned. Related subadvisory expense is included in operating
expenses and recorded when incurred.


 

 
 
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION


 


 

 
 
Depreciation of investment real estate is computed using the straight-line method over
estimated useful lives, which range from 5 to 30 years. Depreciation of investment real
estate is included in net investment income. Certain other assets are depreciated or
amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 40
years. Depreciation and amortization of certain other assets are included in operating
expenses.


 

 
 
INCOME TAXES


 


 

 
 
Pacific Life and its includable subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Federal income
tax return of PMHC. Pacific Life and its wholly owned, Arizona domiciled life insurance
subsidiary, Pacific Life & Annuity Company (PL&A), and Pacific Alliance Reinsurance Company of
Vermont (PAR Vermont), a Vermont-based life reinsurance company wholly owned by Pacific Life,
are taxed as life insurance companies for Federal income tax purposes. Pacific Life’s
non-insurance subsidiaries are either included in PMHC’s combined California franchise tax
return or, if necessary, file separate state tax returns. Companies included in the
consolidated Federal income tax return of PMHC and/or the combined California franchise tax
return of PMHC are allocated tax expense or benefit based principally on the effect of
including their operations in PMHC’s returns under a tax sharing agreement. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the differences are
expected to be recovered or settled.


 

 
 
SEPARATE ACCOUNTS


 


 

 
 
Separate accounts primarily include variable annuity and life contracts, as well as other
guaranteed and non-guaranteed accounts. Separate account assets and liabilities are recorded
at estimated fair value and represent legally segregated contract holder funds. Deposits to
separate accounts, investment income and realized and unrealized gains and losses on the
separate account assets accrue directly to contract holders and, accordingly, are not
reflected in the consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Amounts charged to the
separate account for mortality, surrender and expense charges are included in revenues as
policy fees.


 

 
 
In accordance with SOP 03-1, Accounting and Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Non
Traditional Long-Duration Contracts and for Separate Accounts,
for separate account funding
agreements where the Company provides a



PL-14



Table of Contents



 
 
guarantee of principal and interest to the contract holder and the Company bears all the risks
and rewards of the investments underlying the separate account, the related investments and
liabilities are recognized as investments and liabilities in the consolidated statements of
financial condition. Revenue and expenses are recognized within the respective revenue, and
benefit and expense lines in the consolidated statements of operations.






 
 
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS


 


 

 
 
The estimated fair value of financial instruments, disclosed in Notes 8, 9 and 12, has been
determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.
However, considerable judgment is often required to interpret market data to develop the
estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented may not be indicative of the
amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies could have a significant effect on the estimated
fair value amounts.


 

2.
 
STATUTORY FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS


 

 
 
STATUTORY ACCOUNTING PRACTICES


 


 

 
 
Pacific Life prepares its regulatory statutory financial statements in accordance with
statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the NE DOI, which is a comprehensive
basis of accounting other than U.S. GAAP. Statutory accounting practices primarily differ
from U.S. GAAP by charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, recognizing
certain policy fees as revenue when billed, establishing future policy benefit liabilities
using different actuarial assumptions, reporting surplus notes as surplus instead of debt, as
well as valuing investments and certain assets and accounting for deferred income taxes on a
different basis.


 

 
 
As a result of Pacific Life’s use of a NE DOI permitted accounting practice and a NE DOI
prescribed accounting practice that differs from statutory accounting practices adopted by the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), Pacific Life’s statutory capital and
surplus as of December 31, 2007 did not reflect a net unrealized loss of $45 million. This
net unrealized loss primarily relates to certain statutory separate account assets that are
carried at book value instead of estimated fair value. Pacific Life’s statutory capital and
surplus as of December 31, 2006 did not reflect a net gain of $5 million related to these
practices.


 

 
 
STATUTORY NET INCOME AND SURPLUS


 


 

 
 
Statutory net income of Pacific Life was $362 million, $362 million and $234 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of
Pacific Life was $3,708 million and $3,218 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.


 

 
 
RISK-BASED CAPITAL


 


 

 
 
Risk-based capital is a method developed by the NAIC to measure the minimum amount of capital
appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in
consideration of its size and risk profile. The formulas for determining the amount of
risk-based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or
various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. Additionally, certain risks
are required to be measured using actuarial cash flow modeling techniques, subject to
formulaic minimums. The adequacy of a company’s actual capital is measured by the risk-based
capital results, as determined by the formulas. Companies below minimum risk-based capital
requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective
action. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, Pacific Life, PL&A and PAR Vermont exceeded the
minimum risk-based capital requirements.


 

 
 
DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS


 


 

 
 
The payment of dividends by Pacific Life to Pacific LifeCorp is subject to restrictions set
forth in the State of Nebraska insurance laws. These laws require (i) notification to the NE
DOI for the declaration and payment of any dividend and (ii) approval by the NE DOI for
accumulated dividends within the preceding twelve months that exceed the greater of 10% of
statutory policyholder surplus as of the preceding December 31 or statutory net gain from
operations for the preceding twelve months ended December 31. Generally, these restrictions pose
no short-term liquidity concerns for



PL-15



Table of Contents



 
 
Pacific LifeCorp. Based on these restrictions and 2007 statutory results, Pacific Life could
pay $350 million in dividends in 2008 to Pacific LifeCorp without prior approval from the NE
DOI, subject to the notification requirement.






 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2006, Pacific Life paid two dividends totaling $185 million
to Pacific LifeCorp; a $25 million dividend, consisting of $9 million in cash and a real
estate investment with an estimated fair value of $16 million, and a $160 million cash
dividend. No dividends were paid during 2007 and 2005.


 

 
 
The maximum amount of ordinary dividends that can be paid by PL&A to Pacific Life without
restriction cannot exceed the lesser of 10% of statutory surplus as regards to policyholders,
or the statutory net gain from operations. Based on this limitation and 2007 statutory
results, PL&A could pay $6 million in dividends to Pacific Life in 2008 without prior
regulatory approval. No dividends were paid during 2007, 2006 and 2005.


 

3.
 
CLOSED BLOCK


 

 
 
In connection with the Conversion, an arrangement known as a closed block (the Closed Block)
was established, for dividend purposes only, for the exclusive benefit of certain individual
life insurance policies that had an experience based dividend scale for 1997. The Closed
Block was designed to give reasonable assurance to holders of the Closed Block policies that
policy dividends will not change solely as a result of the Conversion.


 

 
 
Assets that support the Closed Block, which are primarily included in fixed maturity
securities and policy loans, amounted to $284 million and $280 million as of December 31, 2007
and 2006, respectively. Liabilities allocated to the Closed Block, which are primarily
included in future policy benefits, amounted to $308 million and $306 million as of December
31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The net contribution to income from the Closed Block was
insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The following table presents, as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the total assets and maximum

PRIVATE EQUITY FUND

Private equity fund is a limited partnership that was established in July 2005 and is the
general partner of two funds that invest in private equity funds for outside investors. The
Company provides investment management services to the fund for a fee and receives carried
interest based upon the performance of the fund. The Company has not guaranteed the
performance, liquidity or obligations of the fund, and the Company’s maximum exposure to loss
is equal to the carrying amounts. The Company was determined to be the primary beneficiary of
this VIE and it is consolidated into the financial statements of the Company.

WAREHOUSE FACILITY

The Company determined that it was the primary beneficiary of a warehouse facility that it
sponsored in 2007 for the purpose of issuing a collateralized loan obligation. The Company
has not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the warehouse facility. The
maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of the retained interests, which
represent the equity in the facility. This facility was consolidated into the financial
statements of the Company. Non-recourse debt consolidated from the facility was $13 million
as of December 31, 2007.

COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS

The Company is the collateral manager and beneficial interest holder of CDOs of high yield
debt securities. As the collateral manager, the Company earns management fees on the
outstanding asset balance, which are recorded in net investment income as earned. The
collateral management fees were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and
2005. The Company has not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the CDO.
The maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amounts of retained interests.

The Company determined that it is the primary beneficiary of a CDO that it sponsored in 1998
and it is consolidated into the financial statements of the Company. Non-recourse debt
consolidated from this CDO was $2 million and $22 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. There were two other CDOs not consolidated by the Company as the Company had
determined that it was not the primary beneficiary of these entities. These two entities were
fully repaid during the year ended December 31, 2007, and the Company is no longer the
collateral manager.

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

As part of the Company’s investment strategy, the Company purchases primarily investment grade
beneficial interests in ABS. These beneficial interests are issued from bankruptcy-remote
SPEs, which are collateralized by financial assets including corporate debt. The Company has
not guaranteed the performance, liquidity or obligations of the SPEs, and the Company’s
maximum exposure to loss is limited to its carrying value of the beneficial interests in the
SPEs. The ABS investments are not consolidated by the Company as the Company has determined
that it is not the primary beneficiary of these entities.

ASSET
MANAGEMENT FINANCE CORP.

On August 1, 2007, Pacific Life sold its 43% common stock ownership in Asset Management
Finance Corp. (AMFC), a financial advisor for investment management firms, and

beneficiary of the VIE and AMFC was not consolidated into the financial statements of the
Company. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $20 million in subordinated debt that Pacific Life
funded to AMFC was outstanding.

Table of Contents

In May 2000, Allianz of America, Inc. (Allianz), a subsidiary of Allianz SE, acquired
substantially all interests in PIMCO, other than those beneficially owned by the Company. In
connection with this transaction, the interest in PIMCO is subject to a Continuing Investment
Agreement (Agreement) with Allianz that provides for put options held by the Company, and call
options held by Allianz. The per unit value, as determined by a formula in the Agreement, is
subject to a cap and a floor of $600,000 and $500,000 per unit, respectively. The per unit
value reached the cap of $600,000 as of June 30, 2007 and was $600,000 as of December 31, 2007
and $596,084 as of December 31, 2006. In January 2005, the Company and Allianz reached an
agreement whereby Allianz agreed to pay an additional $5,373 per unit for all of the Company’s
interest in PIMCO. The higher unit price was applied retroactively to all units previously
sold and will be applied prospectively to the sale of all remaining units. The Company
recognized a pre-tax gain of $1 million and $17 million during the years ended December 31,
2006 and 2005, respectively, related to this agreement.

During the year ended December 31, 2006, Allianz exercised a call option of $88 million to
purchase a portion of the Company’s interest in PIMCO. The pre-tax gain recognized for the
year ended December 31, 2006 was $31 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2005, Allianz exercised a call option and bought
approximately $250 million of the Company’s interest in PIMCO. The pre-tax gain recognized
for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $87 million.

During the first quarter of 2008, the Company exercised a put option and sold all of its
remaining interest in PIMCO to Allianz for $288 million.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS



The Company’s broker-dealer operations and group insurance business have been reflected as
discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Discontinued
operations do not include the operations of Pacific Select Distributors, Inc. (PSD), a
wholly owned broker-dealer subsidiary of Pacific Life, which primarily serves as the
underwriter/distributor of registered investment-related products and services, principally
variable life and variable annuity contracts issued by the Company, and mutual funds.

In March 2007, the Company classified its broker-dealer subsidiaries, other than PSD, as held
for sale. On June 20, 2007, a transaction closed whereby the Company sold certain of these
broker-dealer subsidiaries to an unrelated third-party. Proceeds from the sale included cash
of $53 million and a common stock interest in the buyer’s parent of $57 million. A pre-tax
gain of $54 million was recognized from this sale. On December 31, 2007, a transaction closed
whereby the Company sold another one of its broker-dealer subsidiaries to subsidiary
management. The Company incurred a pre-tax loss of $1 million from this transaction. As of December
31, 2007, one broker-dealer subsidiary remained classified as held for sale. On February 1,
2008, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell this held for sale subsidiary to an
unrelated third-party. The Company does not anticipate incurring a significant loss from this
transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2008, subject to
regulatory approval.

On April 27, 2005 (Closing Date), the Company sold its group insurance business to an
unrelated third-party. The transaction is structured as a coinsurance arrangement whereby the
Company cedes to the buyer future premiums received for its existing group insurance business
and the buyer assumes future claim liabilities following the Closing Date. Group insurance
business liabilities arising prior to the Closing Date will not be reinsured. The buyer also
obtained renewal rights for the existing business as of the Closing Date.

During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company revised certain
assumptions to develop EGPs for its products subject to DAC amortization (Note 1). This
resulted in decreases in DAC amortization expense of $12 million and $16 million for the years
ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and an increase in DAC amortization expense of
$29 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The revised EGPs also resulted in decreased
amortization of unearned revenue of $15 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and
increased amortization of unearned revenue of $4 million and $5 million for the years ended
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

INVESTMENTS



The net carrying amount, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated fair value of fixed
maturity and equity securities available for sale are shown below. The net carrying amount
represents amortized cost adjusted for other than temporary declines in value and changes in
the estimated fair value of fixed maturity securities attributable to the hedged risk in a
fair value hedge. The estimated fair value of publicly traded securities is based on quoted
market prices. For securities not actively traded, fair values were estimated based on
amounts provided by independent pricing services specializing in matrix pricing and modeling
techniques. The Company also estimates certain fair values based on interest rates, credit
quality and average maturity utilizing matrix pricing and other modeling techniques.

The Company has evaluated fixed maturity and other securities
with gross unrealized losses and determined that the unrealized
losses are temporary and that the Company has the ability and intent
to hold the securities until recovery.

Sub-prime mortgage lending is the origination of residential loans to
customers with weak credit profiles. Alt-A mortgage lending is the
origination of residential mortgage loans to customers who have
credit ratings above sub-prime, but do not conform to
government-sponsored enterprise standards. The slowing U.S. housing
market, greater use of affordability mortgage products and relaxed
underwriting standards for some originators for these loans has led
to higher delinquency and loss rates, especially within the 2007 and
2006 vintage years.

The Company has exposure to sub-prime and Alt-A residential loans
through direct purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities.
These securities are included in the table above as mortgage-backed
and asset-backed securities. The Company’s net carrying value and
estimated fair value of direct investments to sub-prime residential
mortgage-backed securities was $532 million and $514 million,
respectively, as of December 31, 2007. 79% of these securities are
rated Aaa and 19% Aa by an independent rating agency. The vintage
year break-down of the underlying collateral for these securities is
2% originated during 2007, 1% during 2006, 22% during 2005, 34%
during 2004 and 41% during 2003 and prior. The Company’s net
carrying value and estimated fair value of direct investments to
Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities was $991 million and
$972 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.

99% of these
securities are rated Aaa by an independent rating agency. The
vintage year break-down of the underlying collateral for these
securities is 56% originated during 2007, 31% during 2006 and 13% during 2005
and prior.

The Company’s net carrying amount and estimated fair value of investments in CDOs that have
exposure to sub-prime residential mortgage loans are both $58 million as of December 31, 2007.
The ratings distribution of these holdings as of December 31, 2007 is 16% A, 74% A-, 5% Baa
and 5% Baa-, as determined by an independent rating agency. Other than temporary impairments
of $73 million were recorded for these investments during the year ended December 31, 2007,
based upon projections of estimated future cash flows.

Monoline insurers guarantee the timely payment of principal and interest of certain
securities. The Company’s net carrying value and estimated fair value of total monoline
insured securities was $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2007.
Included in these amounts are monoline insured municipal securities with a net carrying value
and estimated fair value of $877 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31,
2007. Municipalities will often purchase monoline insurance to wrap a security issuance in
order to benefit from better market execution. 100% of the overall credit quality of the
municipal bond portfolio, including the benefits of monoline insurance, was rated AAA by an
independent rating agency. The Company’s direct investments in monoline insurers are
immaterial.

Assets with an estimated fair value of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2007 are in a custodial
account pledged as collateral to support $1.7 billion in funding agreements issued to the
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Topeka, which are included in policyholder account balances.
Additional assets with an estimated fair value of $2.0 billion are also on deposit at the FHLB
of Topeka in the custodian account and could be used for future issuances of funding
agreements and other corporate debt. The Company maintains control over these assets.

The Company loans securities in connection with its securities lending program administered by
a qualified financial institution. The Company requires an amount equal to 102% of the
estimated fair value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained as collateral for
the loaned securities. The collateral is restricted and not available for general use.
Securities loaned were $2 million and $187 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES



The Company primarily utilizes derivative instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate
risk, foreign currency risk, credit risk, and equity risk. Derivative instruments are also
used to manage the duration mismatch of assets and liabilities. The Company utilizes a
variety of derivative instruments including swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, caps,
floors, and options.

The Company applies hedge accounting by designating derivative instruments as either fair
value or cash flow hedges on the date the Company enters into a derivative contract. The
Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as
well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge
transactions. In this documentation, the Company specifically identifies the asset,
liability, firm commitment, or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged
item and states how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the
hedged item. The Company formally measures effectiveness of its hedging relationships both at
the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with its risk management policy.

Notional amount represents a standard of measurement of the volume of derivatives. Notional
amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and is not recorded on the
consolidated statements of financial condition. Notional amounts generally represent those
amounts used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received,
except for certain contracts such as currency swaps.



PL-27



Table of Contents







 
 
The following table summarizes the asset and liability values of the Company’s derivative
instruments and are calculated based on the aggregate estimated fair value of all derivative
instruments with each counterparty, net of collateral received or pledged, in accordance with
legally enforceable counterparty master netting agreements. Net cash collateral received from
counterparties was $270 million and $253 million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006,
respectively. This unrestricted cash collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents and
the obligation to return it is netted against the estimated fair value of derivatives in other
investments or other assets. If the net estimated fair value exposure to the counterparty is
positive, the amount is reflected in other investments or other assets, whereas, if the net
estimated fair value exposure to the counterparty is negative, the estimated fair value is
included in future policy benefits or other liabilities, depending on the nature of the
derivative.

As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had also accepted collateral consisting of
various securities with an estimated fair value of $16 million and zero, respectively, which are
held in separate custodial accounts. The Company is permitted by contract to sell or repledge
this collateral, and as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, $16 million and none of the collateral
had been repledged, respectively.


 

 
 
As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had pledged cash collateral of zero and $19
million, respectively. This cash collateral is not included in cash and cash equivalents and
the right to receive it is netted against the estimated fair value of derivatives recorded in
other liabilities. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company provided collateral in the
form of various securities of $14 million and zero, respectively, which are included in fixed
maturity securities. The counterparties are permitted by contract to sell or repledge this
collateral.


 

 
 
CASH FLOW HEDGES


 

 
 
The Company primarily uses foreign currency interest rate swaps, forward starting interest
rate swaps and interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to variability in cash flows due to
changes in foreign currencies and the benchmark interest rate. These cash flows include those
associated with existing assets and liabilities, as well as the forecasted interest cash flows
related to anticipated investment purchases and liability issuances. Such anticipated
investment purchases and liability issuances are considered probable to occur and are
generally completed within 22 years of the inception of the hedge.


 

 
 
Foreign currency interest rate swap agreements are used to convert a fixed or floating rate,
foreign-denominated asset or liability to a U.S. dollar fixed rate asset or liability. The
foreign currency interest rate swaps involve the exchange of an initial principal amount in
two currencies, and the agreement to re-exchange the currencies at a future date, at an agreed
exchange rate. There is also periodic exchange of interest payments in the two currencies at
specified intervals, calculated using agreed upon rates and the exchanged principal amounts.
The main currencies that the Company hedges are the Euro, British Pound, and Canadian Dollar.


 

 
 
Forward starting interest rate swaps are used to hedge the variability in the future interest
receipts or payments stemming from the anticipated purchase of fixed rate securities or
issuance of fixed rate liabilities due to changes in benchmark interest rates. These
derivatives are predominantly used to lock in interest rate levels to match future cash flow
characteristics of assets and liabilities. Forward starting interest rate swaps involve the
exchange, at specified intervals, of interest payments resulting from the difference between
fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an underlying notional
amount to begin at a specified date in the future for a specified period of time. Generally,
no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by
either party. The



PL-28



Table of Contents



 
 
notional amounts of the contracts do not represent future cash requirements, as the Company
intends to close out open positions prior to expiration.






 
 
Interest rate swap agreements are used to convert a floating rate asset or liability to a
fixed rate to hedge the variability of cash flows of the hedged asset or liability due to
changes in benchmark interest rates. These derivatives are predominantly used to better match
the cash flow characteristics between assets and liabilities. These agreements involve the
exchange, at specified intervals, of interest payments resulting from the difference between
fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an underlying
notional amount. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the outset of the contract and no
principal payments are made by either party.


 

 
 
When a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of changes in the
estimated fair value of the derivative is recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings when the
hedged item affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the estimated fair
value of the derivative is recorded in net realized investment gain (loss). For the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the gains and losses related to the ineffective portion of
designated cash flow hedges were insignificant. No component of the
hedging instrument’s estimated fair
value is excluded from the determination of effectiveness. For the years ended December 31,
2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company had net losses of $21 million, $2 million and zero,
respectively, reclassified from AOCI to earnings resulting from the discontinuance of cash
flow hedges due to forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring. Over
the next twelve months, the Company anticipates that $15 million of deferred gains on
derivative instruments in AOCI will be reclassified to earnings. For the years ended December
31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, all of the Company’s hedged forecasted transactions were determined
to be probable of occurring.


 

 
 
FAIR VALUE HEDGES


 

 
 
The Company primarily uses interest rate swaps to manage its
exposure to changes in the estimated fair
values of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate.


 

 
 
Interest rate swap agreements are used to convert a fixed rate asset or liability to a
floating rate to hedge the changes in estimated fair value of the hedged asset or liability due to
changes in benchmark interest rates. These derivatives are used primarily to closely match
the duration of the assets supporting specific liabilities.


 

 
 
When a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the changes in the estimated fair value
of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in net realized investment gain (loss). The
change in value of the hedged item associated with the risk being hedged is reflected as an
adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item. For the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, hedge ineffectiveness related to designated fair value hedges reflected in
net realized investment gain (loss) was insignificant. No component
of the hedging instrument’s estimated fair value is excluded from the determination of effectiveness.


 

 
 
DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS


 

 
 
The Company has certain insurance and reinsurance contracts that are considered to have
embedded derivatives. When it is determined that the embedded derivative possesses economic
and risk characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to those of the host
contract and that a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative
instrument, it is separated from the host contract and accounted for as a stand-alone
derivative.


 

 
 
The Company offers a rider on certain variable annuity contracts that guarantees net principal
over a ten-year holding period, as well as riders on certain variable annuity contracts that
guarantee a minimum withdrawal benefit over specified periods, subject to certain
restrictions. These variable annuity riders (VA Riders) are considered embedded derivatives
and are recorded in future policy benefits.


 

 
 
The Company employs hedging strategies designed to mitigate the equity risk associated with
the portion of VA Riders not covered by reinsurance. Equity put swaps are utilized to
economically hedge against movements in the equity markets. These equity put swaps involve
the exchange of periodic fixed rate payments for the return, at the end of the swap agreement,
of the equity index below a specified strike price. Generally, no cash is exchanged at the
outset of the contract and no principal payments are made by either party. Additionally, the
Company utilizes total return swaps based upon the S&P 500 Index (S&P 500) primarily to
economically hedge the equity risk of the mortality and expense fees in its variable annuity
products. These contracts provide periodic payments to the Company in exchange for the



PL-29



Table of Contents



 
 
total return of the S&P 500 in the form of a payment or receipt, depending on whether the
return relative to the index on trade date is positive or negative, respectively.






 
 
VA Riders on new variable annuity contracts issued since January 1, 2007 are partially covered
by reinsurance. These reinsurance arrangements are used to offset a portion of the Company’s
exposure to the VA Riders for the lives of the host variable annuity contracts issued since
January 1, 2007. The ceded portion of the VA Riders is considered an embedded derivative and
is recorded in other assets or other liabilities as either a reinsurance recoverable or
reinsurance payable.


 

 
 
The decrease in the estimated fair value of the embedded derivatives, net of reinsurance, and
net of the results of the variable annuity hedging strategies, which includes periodic
derivative settlements, resulted in before DAC and pre-tax unrealized gains (losses) of ($178)
million, ($30) million and $11 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively, which were recorded as a component of net realized investment gain (loss).


 

 
 
Additionally, certain policy fee revenue related to the VA Riders of $78 million, $64 million
and $29 million is included in net realized investment gain (loss) for the years ended
December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


 

 
 
The Company issues synthetic GICs to Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)
qualified defined contribution employee benefit plans (ERISA Plan). The ERISA Plan uses the
contracts in its stable value or guaranteed fixed income option. The Company does not manage
the assets underlying synthetic GICs; however, the Company pre-approves all investment
guidelines to mitigate any investment risk. The Company receives a fee for providing
liquidity to the benefit plan sponsor in the event that qualified plan benefit requests exceed
plan cash flows. In the event that plan participant elections exceed the fair value of the
assets or if the contract is terminated and at the end of the termination period the book
value under the contract exceeds the fair value of the assets, then the Company is required to
pay the ERISA Plan the difference. The estimated fair value of the assets was greater than
the book value under the contracts by $34 million as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31,
2006, the estimated fair value of the assets was below the book value under the contracts by
$64 million. As of December 31, 2006, the Company did not record a contingent liability as
the probability of making a payment under these provisions was considered remote.


 

 
 
CREDIT EXPOSURE


 

 
 
Credit exposure is measured on a counterparty basis as the net positive aggregate estimated
fair value, net of collateral received, if any. The credit exposure for over the counter
derivatives as of December 31, 2007 was $196 million.


 

 
 
For all derivative contracts other than VA Riders and synthetic GICs, the Company enters into
master agreements that may include a termination event clause associated with the Company’s
insurer financial strength rating. If the Company’s insurer financial strength rating falls
below a specified level assigned by certain rating agencies or, in most cases, if one of the
rating agencies ceases to provide an insurer financial strength rating, the counterparty can
terminate the master agreement with payment due based on the estimated fair value of the
underlying derivatives. As of December 31, 2007, the Company’s insurer financial strength
rating was above the specified level.


 

 
 
The Company attempts to limit its credit exposure by dealing with creditworthy counterparties,
establishing risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master netting agreements, and
obtaining collateral where appropriate. In addition, each counterparty is reviewed to
evaluate its financial stability before entering into each agreement and throughout the period
that the financial instrument is owned. All of the Company’s credit exposure from derivative
contracts is with investment grade counterparties. The Company has not incurred any losses on
derivative financial instruments due to counterparty nonperformance.

SHORT-TERM DEBT


 

 
 
Pacific Life maintains a $700 million commercial paper program. The amount outstanding as of
December 31, 2007 was $100 million, bearing an average interest rate of 4.4%. There was no
commercial paper debt outstanding as of December 31, 2006. In addition, Pacific Life has a
bank revolving credit facility of $400 million maturing in 2012 that serves as a back-up line
of credit for the commercial paper program. This facility had no debt outstanding as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006. As of and during the year ended December 31, 2007, Pacific Life
was in compliance with the debt covenants related to this facility.


 

 
 
During a majority of the first nine months of 2006, Pacific Life was a member of the FHLB of
San Francisco, which enabled Pacific Life to borrow from the FHLB of San Francisco amounts
that were based on a percentage of statutory capital and surplus. During the third quarter of
2006, Pacific Life moved its membership in the FHLB from San Francisco to Topeka. Pacific
Life has approval from the FHLB of Topeka to advance amounts up to 40% of Pacific Life’s
statutory general account assets provided it has available collateral and is in compliance
with debt covenant restrictions and insurance laws and regulations. There was no debt
outstanding with the FHLB of Topeka as of December 31, 2007 and 2006.


 

 
 
In December 2006, PL&A became eligible to borrow from the FHLB of San Francisco amounts based
on a percentage of statutory capital and surplus and could borrow up to amounts of $102
million. Of this amount, half, or $51 million, can be borrowed for terms other than
overnight, out to a maximum term of nine months. These borrowings are at variable rates of
interest, collateralized by certain mortgage loan and government securities. As of December
31, 2007 and 2006, PL&A had no debt outstanding with the FHLB of San Francisco.


 

 
 
LONG-TERM DEBT


 

 
 
Pacific Life has $150 million of surplus notes
outstanding at an interest rate of 7.9%,
maturing on December 30, 2023. Interest is payable semiannually on June 30 and December 30.
The surplus notes may not be redeemed at the option of Pacific Life or any holder of the
surplus notes. The surplus notes are unsecured and subordinated to all present and future
senior indebtedness and policy claims of Pacific Life. All future payments of interest and
principal on the surplus notes can be made only with the prior approval of the Director of
Insurance of the State of Nebraska.


 

 
 
Pacific Life entered into interest rate swaps converting the fixed interest rate surplus notes
to variable rate notes based upon the London Interbank Offered Rate. In accordance with SFAS
No. 133, the interest rate swaps were designated as fair value hedges of the surplus notes.
The SFAS No. 133 fair value adjustment, which increased long-term debt by $13 million and $6
million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, represents the cumulative change in
the estimated fair value of the interest rate swaps. An offsetting fair value adjustment has
also been recorded for the interest rate swap derivative instruments.


 

 
 
Certain subsidiaries of Pacific Asset Holding LLC (PAH), a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific
Life and formerly known as Pacific Asset Management LLC, entered into various term loans with
third parties. Interest on these loans accrues at fixed rates, is payable monthly and range
from 5.8% to 6.2% as of December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, there was $87 million
outstanding on these loans with maturities ranging from 2010 to 2012. None of these loans
were in place at December 31, 2006. All of these loans are secured by real estate properties
and are non-recourse to the Company.


 

 
 
Certain subsidiaries of PAH also entered into various property improvement loans with third
parties for a maximum loan balance of $43 million. Interest on these loans accrues at
variable rates, is payable monthly and range from 6.4% to 7.0% as of December 31, 2007. As of
December 31, 2007, there was $32 million outstanding on these loans with maturities ranging
from 2009 to 2011. As of December 31, 2006, only one of these loans was in place with a
maximum loan balance of $12 million, interest rate of 7.8%, maturity in 2009 and an
outstanding loan balance of $9 million. All of these loans are secured by real estate
properties and are non-recourse to the Company.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of these financial
instruments as of December 31, 2007 and 2006:


 

 
 
MORTGAGE LOANS


 

 
 
The estimated fair value of the mortgage loan portfolio is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash flows, using a market rate that is applicable to the yield, credit
quality and average maturity of the composite portfolio.


 

 
 
POLICY LOANS


 

 
 
The carrying amounts of policy loans are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because
interest rates are generally variable and based on current market rates.


 

 
 
OTHER INVESTED ASSETS


 

 
 
The estimated fair value of private equity investments is based on the ownership percentage of
the underlying equity of the investments. The estimated fair value of trading securities is
based on quoted market prices, and non marketable equity securities is based on management’s
estimate of fair value.


 

 
 
COLLATERAL RECEIVED AND PLEDGED


 

 
 
The carrying values of cash collateral received and pledged approximate fair value due to the
short-term maturities of these instruments.


 

 
 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS


 

 
 
The carrying values approximate fair values due to the short-term maturities of these
instruments.



PL-33



Table of Contents



 
 
FUNDING AGREEMENTS AND GICs


 

 
 
The fair value of funding agreements and GICs is estimated using the rates currently offered
for deposits of similar remaining maturities.


 

 
 
FIXED ACCOUNT LIABILITIES


 

 
 
Fixed account liabilities include annuity and deposit liabilities. The estimated fair value
of annuity liabilities approximates carrying value and primarily includes policyholder
deposits and accumulated credited interest. The estimated fair value of deposit liabilities
with no defined maturities is the amount payable on demand.


 

 
 
SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT


 

 
 
The carrying amount of short-term debt is a reasonable estimate of its fair value because the
interest rates are variable and based on current market rates. The estimated fair value of
long-term debt is based on market quotes, except for VIE debt and non-recourse debt, for which
the carrying amounts are reasonable estimates of their fair values because the interest rate
approximates current market rates.

REINSURANCE


 

 
 
The Company has reinsurance agreements with other insurance companies to limit potential
losses, reduce exposure arising from larger risks, and provide additional capacity for future
growth.


 

 
 
As part of a strategic alliance, the Company also reinsures risks associated with policies
written by an independent producer group through modified coinsurance arrangements with this
producer group’s reinsurance company.


 

 
 
All assets associated with business reinsured on a modified coinsurance basis remain with, and
under the control of, the Company. As part of its risk management process, the Company
routinely evaluates its reinsurance programs and may change retention limits, reinsurers or
other features at any time.


 

 
 
Certain no lapse guarantee rider (NLGR) benefits of Pacific Life’s UL insurance products are
subject to Actuarial Guideline 38 (AG 38) statutory reserving requirements. U.S. GAAP benefit
reserves for such riders are based on SOP 03-1. AG 38, as revised in October 2005 and in
September 2006, results in additional statutory reserves on UL



PL-35



Table of Contents



 
 
products with NLGRs issued after June 30, 2005. The U.S. GAAP benefit reserves relating to
NLGRs issued after June 30, 2005 are ceded from Pacific Life to Pacific Alliance Reinsurance
Ltd. (PAR Bermuda), a Bermuda-based life reinsurance company wholly owned by Pacific LifeCorp
and PAR Vermont under reinsurance agreements. Funded reserves in a trust account with Pacific
Life as beneficiary and irrevocable letters of credit, in which Pacific LifeCorp is the
co-applicant with PAR Bermuda and PAR Vermont, provide security for statutory reserve credits
taken by Pacific Life.






 
 
During 2006, the Company entered into treaties to reinsure a portion of new variable annuity
business sold under modified coinsurance arrangements. In 2007, the Company increased the
quota-share reinsured on new variable annuity business as well as extended reinsurance
coverage under coinsurance agreements to cover portions of variable annuity living and death
benefit riders.


 

 
 
Reinsurance receivables and payables generally include amounts related to claims, reserves and
reserve related items. Reinsurance receivables were $349 million and $161 million as of
December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Reinsurance payables were $54 million and $8
million as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.


 

 
 
The ceding of risk does not discharge the Company from its primary obligations to contract
owners. To the extent that the assuming companies become unable to meet their obligations
under reinsurance contracts, the Company remains contingently liable. Each reinsurer is
reviewed to evaluate its financial stability before entering into each reinsurance contract
and throughout the period that the reinsurance contract is in place.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS


 

 
 
PENSION PLANS


 

 
 
Pacific Life provides a defined benefit pension plan covering all
eligible employees of the Company. Certain subsidiaries do not
participate in this plan. The full-benefit vesting period for
all participants is five years. Pacific Life’s funding policy is
to contribute amounts to the plan sufficient to meet the minimum
funding requirements set forth in ERISA, plus such additional
amounts as may be determined appropriate. All such contributions
are made to a tax-exempt trust.


 

 
 
During 2007, the Company amended the defined benefit pension plan to terminate
effective December 31, 2007. The net assets of the defined benefit pension plan will be
allocated for payment of plan benefits to the participants in an order of priority determined
in accordance with ERISA, applicable regulations thereunder and the defined benefit pension
plan document. The final termination of the plan and payment of plan benefits to the
participants is subject to regulatory approval.


 

 
 
In 2007, the defined benefit pension plan’s investment strategy was revised and the mutual
fund investments were sold, transferred to a separate account of the Company and invested
primarily in fixed income investments.


 

 
 
Effective January 1, 2005, the contribution credits for employees with less than 10 years of
service were suspended and replaced by contribution credits into the Retirement Incentive
Savings Plan (RISP) provided by Pacific Life pursuant to section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Effective January 1, 2007, the contribution credits for all other employees
were suspended and also replaced by contribution credits into the RISP.


 

 
 
In addition, Pacific Life maintains supplemental employee retirement plans (SERPs) for certain
eligible employees. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the projected benefit obligation was
$34 million. The fair value of plan assets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was zero. The
net periodic benefit cost of the SERPs was $6 million, $6 million and $26 million for the
years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. New provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code allowed vested participants of certain non-qualified plans to receive
distributions in 2005. Accordingly, $77 million was distributed to participants electing to
receive distributions from the SERPs, which resulted in a settlement expense of $16 million
for the year ended December 31, 2005.


 

 
 
In connection with the sale of the group insurance business (Note 6), and the resulting
termination of a large group of the Company’s employees, the Company incurred $8 million in
curtailment, settlement and special termination costs for the year ended December 31, 2005,
which are included in discontinued operations.

In developing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers many
factors. These factors consist of a review of historical returns and the future expectations
for returns for each asset class, as well as the target asset allocation of the plan’s
portfolio. This resulted in the selection of the 8.00% long-term rate of return on asset
assumption for the first three months of 2007. In April 2007, the Company changed the asset
allocation to fixed income assets in order to better match the expected duration of
liabilities. The expected return on asset assumption was then lowered to 5.50% resulting in a
weighted-average expected return on asset assumption of 6.13% for 2007.


 

 
 
Benefit payments for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $45 million. Pacific Life
expects to contribute $4 million to these plans in 2008. The expected benefit payments are as

Prior to 2007, it was intended that the defined benefit pension plan assets be invested in
equity-type and fixed income investments, as long as the investments were consistent with the
assumption that more than average risk and appropriate overall diversification was maintained
and liquidity was sufficient to meet cash flow requirements. The defined benefit pension plan
established and maintained a fundamental and long-term orientation in the determination of
asset mix and selection of investment funds. This tolerance for more than average risk and
long-term orientation provided the basis for a larger allocation to equities with some
additional bias to higher risk investments for higher return. In anticipation of the final
settlement of the plan, the asset allocation was changed to fixed income assets in order to
better match the expected duration of liabilities.

RETIREMENT INCENTIVE SAVINGS PLAN


 

 
 
Pacific Life provides a RISP covering all eligible employees of Pacific LifeCorp and certain
of its subsidiaries. The RISP matches 75% of each employee’s contributions, up to a maximum
of 6% of eligible employee compensation in cash. Since 1997, the RISP provided the Company
match in the form of Pacific LifeCorp common stock. In October 2006, Pacific LifeCorp’s Board
of Directors authorized a plan to terminate the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) feature
of the RISP, replace it with a cash match benefit and repurchase the outstanding allocated and
unallocated shares of the ESOP. On October 25, 2006, the outstanding allocated and
unallocated shares were repurchased by Pacific LifeCorp in cash for $112 million and an ESOP
loan, with an outstanding balance of $2 million, was also repaid to Pacific Life.
Contributions made by the Company to the RISP amounted to $24 million, $20 million and $20
million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and are included
in operating expenses.


 

 
 
Amounts loaned to the ESOP by Pacific Life were included in unearned ESOP shares. The
unearned ESOP shares account was reduced as ESOP shares were released for allocation to
participants through ESOP contributions by Pacific Life. In addition, when the fair value of
ESOP shares being released for allocation to participants was different from the original
issue price of those shares, the difference was recorded in paid-in capital.


 

 
 
POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS


 

 
 
Pacific Life provides a defined benefit health care plan and a defined benefit life insurance
plan (the Plans) that provide postretirement benefits for all eligible retirees and their
dependents. Generally, qualified employees may become eligible for these benefits if they
have reached normal retirement age, have been covered under Pacific Life’s policy as an active
employee for a minimum continuous period prior to the date retired, and have an employment
date before January 1, 1990. The Plans contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and
coinsurance, and require retirees to make contributions, which can be adjusted annually.
Pacific Life’s commitment to qualified employees who retire after April 1, 1994 is limited to
specific dollar amounts. Pacific Life reserves the right to modify or terminate the Plans at
any time. As in the past, the general policy is to fund these benefits on a pay-as-you-go
basis.


 

 
 
The net periodic postretirement benefit cost for each of the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005 was $1 million. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the accumulated benefit
obligation was $18 million. The actuarial gain due to the Medicare subsidy was $2 million as
of December 31, 2005. The fair value of the plan assets as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 was
zero. The amount of accrued benefit cost included in other liabilities prior to the adoption
of the funded status provisions of SFAS No. 158 was $20 million as of December 31, 2006. The
liabilities recognized after the adoption of the funded status provisions of SFAS No. 158 were
$18 million as of December 31, 2007.


 

 
 
The adjustment related to postretirement benefits to reflect the adoption of SFAS No. 158
resulted in an increase in AOCI of $2 million, pre-tax, as of December 31, 2007.


 

 
 
The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was
6.25% and 5.75% for 2007 and 2006, respectively.


 

 
 
Benefit payments for the year ended December 31, 2007 amounted to $3 million. The expected
benefit payments are as follows for the years ending December 31 (In Millions):

OTHER PLANS


 

 
 
The Company has deferred compensation plans that permit eligible employees to defer portions
of their compensation and earn interest on the deferred amounts. The interest rate is
determined annually. The compensation that has been deferred has been accrued and the primary
expense related to this plan, other than compensation, is interest on the deferred amounts.
The Company also has performance-based incentive compensation plans for its employees.

Upon adoption of FIN 48 on January 1, 2007 (Note 1), the Company had unrecognized tax benefits
of $32 million, which relate entirely to an uncertain tax position regarding refund claims for
the impact of short-term capital gains on computing dividends received deductions relating to
the Company’s separate accounts (DRD). A reconciliation of the changes in the unrecognized
tax benefits from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007 is as follows (In Millions):

Depending on the outcome of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) appeals proceedings, approximately
$7 million of the unrecognized DRD tax benefits may be realized during the next twelve months.
All realized tax benefits and related interest will be recorded as a discrete item that will
impact the effective tax rate in the accounting period in which the uncertain DRD tax position
is ultimately settled.


 

 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, the Company paid an immaterial amount of interest and
penalties to state tax authorities.

SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes requires the reduction of deferred tax assets by a
valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not
that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on management’s
assessment, it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized through
future taxable earnings.


 

 
 
The Company files income tax returns in U.S. Federal and various state
jurisdictions and have tax years open by statute, or valid extension thereof, for tax years
after 1997. The Company is under continuous audit by the IRS and is audited periodically by
some state taxing authorities. The IRS and state taxing authorities have completed audits of
the Company’s tax returns through the tax years ended December 31, 2003 and are currently
auditing the tax years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. The Company does not expect the
Federal and state audits to result in any material assessments.

SEGMENT INFORMATION


 

 
 
The Company has three operating segments: Life Insurance, Investment Management, and
Annuities & Mutual Funds. These segments are managed separately and have been identified
based on differences in products and services offered. All other activity is included in
Corporate and Other segment.


 

 
 
The Life Insurance segment offers UL, VUL and other life insurance products to individuals,
small businesses and corporations through a network of distribution channels that include
regional life offices, sales centers, marketing organizations, wirehouse broker-dealer firms
and a national producer group that has produced over 10% of the segment’s in force business.


 

 
 
The Investment Management segment offers investment and annuity products to pension fund
sponsors and other institutional investors primarily through its home office marketing team
and other intermediaries.


 

 
 
The Annuities & Mutual Funds segment offers variable annuities, fixed annuities and mutual
funds to individuals and small businesses through Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
(FINRA) firms, regional and national wirehouses, and financial institutions. FINRA was
created in July 2007 through the consolidation of the National Association of Securities
Dealers and the member regulation, enforcement and arbitration functions of the New York Stock
Exchange.


 

 
 
The Corporate and Other segment primarily includes investment income, expenses and assets not
attributable to the operating segments, and the operations of certain subsidiaries that do not
qualify as operating segments. The Corporate and Other segment also includes the interest in
PIMCO and the elimination of intersegment transactions. Discontinued operations (Note 6) are
also included in Corporate and Other segment.


 

 
 
The Company uses the same accounting policies and procedures to measure segment net income and
assets as it uses to measure its consolidated net income and assets. Net investment income
and net realized investment gain (loss) are allocated based on invested assets purchased and
held as is required for transacting the business of that segment. Overhead expenses are
allocated based on services provided. Interest expense is allocated based on the short-term
borrowing needs of the segment and is included in net investment income. The provision for
income taxes is allocated based on each segment’s actual tax provision.


 

 
 
The operating segments are allocated equity based on formulas determined by management and
receive a fixed interest rate of return on interdivision debentures supporting the allocated
equity. The debenture amount is reflected as investment expense in net investment income in
the Corporate and Other segment and as investment income in the operating segments.


 

 
 
The Company generates substantially all of its revenues and net income from customers located
in the U.S. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Company had foreign investments with an
estimated fair value of $6.8 billion and $6.4 billion, respectively.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES


 

 
 
Pacific Life Fund Advisors LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Life formed in 2007,
serves as the investment adviser for the Pacific Select Fund, an investment vehicle provided
to the Company’s variable life insurance policyholders and variable annuity contract owners,
and the Pacific Life Funds, the investment vehicle for the Company’s mutual fund products.
Prior to May 1, 2007, Pacific Life served in this capacity. Investment advisory and other
fees are based primarily upon the net asset value of the underlying portfolios. These fees
amounted to $326 million, $316 million and $246 million for the years ended December 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005, respectively. In addition, Pacific Life provides certain support services to
the Pacific Select Fund, the Pacific Life Funds and other affiliates based on an allocation of
actual costs. These fees amounted to $8 million, $7 million and $5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.


 

 
 
In addition, effective May 1, 2007, a service plan adopted by the Pacific Select Fund went
into effect whereby the fund pays PSD, as distributor of the fund, a service fee in connection
with services rendered or procured to or for shareholders of the fund or their variable
contract owners. These services may include, but are not limited to, payment of compensation
to broker-dealers, including PSD itself, and other financial institutions and organizations
which assist in providing any of the services. For the period May 1, 2007 through December
31, 2007, PSD received $74 million in

service fees from the Pacific Select Fund, which is recorded in other income. The service
fees were allocated to the operating segments, primarily the Annuities & Mutual Funds segment
(Note 17).






 
 
In April 2006, Pacific Life made a $16 million non-cash dividend to Pacific LifeCorp,
consisting of a real estate investment, which resulted in a gain of $9 million for Pacific
Life.


 

 
 
As discussed in Note 14, no lapse guarantee benefit riders are coinsured with PAR Bermuda.

In March 2007, the Company began construction of a new office building in Aliso Viejo,
California that was completed in February 2008. The Company will retain its corporate
headquarters in Newport Beach, California.


 

 
 
CONTINGENCIES — LITIGATION


 

 
 
During the year ended December 31, 2007, Pacific Life settled a national class action lawsuit,
Cooper v. Pacific Life, for a combination of cash distributions and contract credits to owners
of qualified annuity contracts who purchased their contracts between August 19, 1998, and
April 30, 2002, or paid premium payments during that time period. Pacific Life strongly
disagreed with the claims in the lawsuit. The settlement is not considered an admission or
concession with respect to any claims made in the lawsuit and did not have a material adverse
effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position. Distributions will be made to
eligible class members beginning in the first quarter of 2008 and in accordance with the terms
of the settlement agreement.


 

 
 
The Company is a respondent in a number of other legal proceedings, some of which involve
allegations for extra-contractual damages. Although the Company is confident of its position
in these matters, success is not a certainty and it is possible that in any case a judge or
jury could rule against the Company. In the opinion of management, the outcome of such
proceedings is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial position. The Company believes adequate provision has been made in its consolidated
financial statements for all probable and estimable losses for litigation claims against the
Company.



PL-48

CONTINGENCIES — IRS REVENUE RULING


 

 
 
On August 16, 2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2007-54, which provided the IRS’
interpretation of tax law regarding the computation of the Company’s DRD. On September 25,
2007, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2007-61, which suspended Revenue Ruling 2007-54 and
indicated the IRS would address the proper interpretation of tax law in a regulation project
that has been added to the IRS’ 2007/2008 priority guidance plan. If, after public notice and
comment, the IRS regulation project ultimately adopts the IRS’ interpretation contained in
Revenue Ruling 2007-54, the Company could lose a substantial amount of DRD tax benefits, which
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
CONTINGENCIES — OTHER


 

 
 
In connection with the sale of certain broker-dealer subsidiaries (Note 6), certain
indemnifications triggered by breaches of representations, warranties or covenants were
provided by the Company. Also, included in the indemnifications is indemnification for
certain third-party claims arising from the normal operation of these broker-dealers prior to
the closing and within the nine month period following the sale. Management believes that its
exposure to loss, if any, is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
consolidated financial statements.


 

 
 
In the course of its business, the Company provides certain indemnifications related to other
dispositions, acquisitions, investments, lease agreements or other transactions that are
triggered by, among other things, breaches of representations, warranties or covenants
provided by the Company. These obligations are typically subject to time limitations that
vary in duration, including contractual limitations and those that arise by operation of law,
such as applicable statutes of limitation. Because the amounts of these types of
indemnifications often are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation
under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company has not historically
made material payments for these types of indemnifications. The estimated maximum potential
amount of future payments under these obligations is not determinable due to the lack of a
stated maximum liability for certain matters, and therefore, no related liability has been
recorded. Management believes that judgments, if any, against the Company related to such
matters are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated
financial statements.


 

 
 
Most of the jurisdictions in which the Company is admitted to transact business require life
insurance companies to participate in guaranty associations, which are organized to pay
contractual benefits owed pursuant to insurance policies issued by insolvent life insurance
companies. These associations levy assessments, up to prescribed limits, on all member
companies in a particular state based on the proportionate share of premiums written by member
companies in the lines of business in which the insolvent insurer operated. The Company has
not received notification of any insolvency that is expected to result in a material guaranty
fund assessment.


 

 
 
In relation to an asset securitization sponsored by Aviation Capital Group Corp., a wholly
owned subsidiary of Pacific LifeCorp, Pacific Life is contingently obligated to purchase
certain notes from the asset securitization trust to cover shortfalls in amounts due to the
holders of the notes, up to certain levels as specified under the related agreements. As of
December 31, 2007, the maximum potential amount of this future investment commitment was $50
million.


 

 
 
In connection with the operations of PSD, Pacific Life has made commitments to provide for
additional capital funding as may be required.


 

 
 
See Note 9 for discussion of contingencies related to derivative instruments.

This material is not intended to be used, nor can it be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding U.S. federal, state, or local tax penalties. This material is written to support the promotion or marketing of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by this material. Pacific Life, its distributors, and respective representatives do not provide tax, accounting, or legal advice. Any taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer's particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor or attorney.




Investors should carefully consider a variable annuity's risks, charges, limitations, and expenses, as well as the risks, charges, expenses, and investment goals of the underlying investment options. This and other information about Pacific Life are provided in the product and underlying fund prospectuses. These prospectuses should be read carefully before investing.





Pacific Life refers to Pacific Life Insurance Company and its affiliates, including Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Insurance products are issued by Pacific Life Insurance Company in all states except New York and in New York by Pacific Life & Annuity Company. Product availability and features may vary by state. Each company is solely responsible for the financial obligations accruing under the products it issues. Insurance product and rider guarantees, including optional benefits and any fixed subaccount crediting rates or annuity payout rates, are backed by the financial strength and claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company and do not protect the value of the variable investment options. They are not backed by the broker/dealer from which this annuity is purchased, by the insurance agency from which this annuity is purchased, or any affiliates of those entities, and none makes any representations or guarantees regarding the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.




Variable insurance products, as well as shares of Pacific Select Fund, are distributed by Pacific Select Distributors, LLC (member FINRA & SIPC), a subsidiary of Pacific Life Insurance Company and an affiliate of Pacific Life & Annuity Company (Newport Beach, CA), and are available through licensed third-party broker/dealers.
