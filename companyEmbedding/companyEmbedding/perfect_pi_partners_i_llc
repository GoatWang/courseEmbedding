T-shirts are excellent giveaways for events and also great for fundraising for schools, businesses, festivals, and other events.

Perfect Print™ Fingerprint Pads


MODEL: 


SKU: 


PART: 




Perfect Print™ Fingerprint Pads from Identicator®, can be used on any plain paper and produce sharp, black fingerprints. The hard, ceramic surface features micropores which allow ink to quickly rise to the surface of the pad and prevents worn or dry spots from forming on the pad over time. More importantly, however, the unique micropores in the ceramic surface regulate the flow of ink, preventing fingers from becoming overinked, resulting in unacceptable prints. Once ink is applied to the fingerprint card, it dries almost instantly, making it almost impossible to smudge or smear the fingerprint. For clean up, simply rub the fingers together or wipe clean with a cloth.
PI 5 - Rectangular Perfect Print™ Pad (6 pack)
PI 10 - Round Perfect Print™ Pad (6 pack)
PI 20 - Large Round Perfect Print™ Pad (1 pad)
PI 30 - Large Rectangular Perfect Print™ Pad (1 pad)
