Please note: Closed end funds are subject to the risk of their underlying assets and investment strategy. Unlike open end funds, closed end funds trade on an exchange at a price which is often a discount to their net asset value (NAV). The market price may experience periods of increased volatility due to the use of leverage as well as market and fund illiquidity. Important information you should know about investing in closed-end funds.

What does it mean?

							A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.

More about Portfolio Composition








*The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees, if applicable), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)The performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted. Distributions are not guaranteed and the amount of distributions will vary depending on a number of factors. Market prices and investment return will vary, therefore you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. Click on the "Performance & Risk" link to view quarter-end performance. All performance data is for the common shares of the fund. Total distribution rate (at market or NAV) may include unknown combinations of income, capital gains and return of capital.Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated. Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated. ^Premium/Discount to NAV represents the percentage by which the funds market price exceeds or is less than net asset value (NAV). Shares of closed-end funds frequently trade at a market price that is a discount to their NAV.Top holdings are as of the date indicated and may not be representative of the funds current or future investments.

PCI Is PDI And PKO: It Should Trade Like It - PIMCO Dynamic Credit Income Fund (NYSE:PCI) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»PCI Is PDI And PKO: It Should Trade Like ItSep.27.16 | About: PIMCO Dynamic (PCI) Alpha Gen Capital Deep Value, CFA, registered investment advisor, contrarianMarketplaceYield Hunting: Alt Inc OppsSummaryPCI was launched with a different management team and investment policy statement and underperformed early on.PIMCO changed out the manager to the same group that runs PDI, in addition to altering the investment policy to give it more flexibility.The three funds (PCI, PDI, and PKO) are largely composed of the same sectors, primarily non-agency MBS, with strong correlation in NAV performance.There is a large opportunity in PCI for investors to not only generate strong and consistent yield but an arbitrage with PDI and PKO.Subscribers to Yield Hunting received an early look to this article. Investors have long known of one of the best bond funds out there, the PIMCO Dynamic Income Fund (NYSE:PDI). But we see as one of the best opportunities today in its new larger cousin, the PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Income Fund(NYSE:PCI). Let me first preface this by saying that we think PDI is one of the greatest fixed-income funds of all time- spanning across both open and closed-end spaces, despite its short lifespan of under four years. However, we think there is a possible arbitrage opportunity between it, the PIMCO Opportunity Fund (NYSE:PKO) and PCI ongoing. Thesis There is nearly a 10% spread in discounts between the prices of the two funds despite several factors. For one, the portfolios are being positioned almost identically in the non-agency MBS sector, high-yield, and non-USD credit. Secondly, NAV performance of PCI has been better YTD possibly indicating a shift in leadership among the funds. Lastly, as the change in management and investment policy recedes, more institutional ownership are likely to scoop up the shares. In terms of trading, the probability of another decent-sized special distribution is likely to draw in the yield-seekers as we approach year-end. This should help increase the price and reduce the discount of PCI, and press up the premium of PDI, up until the ex-date. A good strategy would be to coattail that run-up through mid-December, then sell and re-buy after the ex-date and the yield-seekers have gotten out.
 Investment Policy Change at PCI  In March, the company made a change to its non-fundamental investment policy while rescinding their previous policy. The new policy is stated below. When a non-fundamental policy is changed, shareholder approval is not required. The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in a portfolio of mortgage-related securities and other debt instruments of varying maturities (the "80% policy").  The previous investment policy statement required the manager's to invest at least 50% of its net assets in corporate income-producing securities of varying maturities. PIMCO believed that the change would provide them much more flexibility in their "go-anywhere" approach giving them greater ability to allocate to non-corporate credit-related assets, which they believe have more attractive relative value. On June 29th, PIMCO then announced they were changing the name of PCI to the PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Income Fund, adding in "and Mortgage" into the fund name. The change gives a greater indication of what the fund actually invests within and is clearly an attempt to close the discount of the fund.  Change In Management and Strategy at PCI  In early 2014, PIMCO announced that they were changing the management team of the fund from Marc Seidner to the same team that manages both PDI and PKO. They include star manager Dan Ivascyn, Alfred Murata, Mark Keisel, Elizabeth MacLean, and Sai Devabhaktuni. The change in management was driven by the poor performance of the fund when it launched in early 2013. At that time, they had significant exposure to emerging market debt and senior loans with just 15% in non-agency MBS. Since then, the portfolio composition has shifted fairly drastically going to over 62% non-agency MBS. This compares to the 70% that is held in PDI and 50% in PKO.  Below is PCIs industry breakdown and sector allocation: 


 (Source: PIMCO) Now compare it to PDIs information: 

 (Source: PIMCO) PIMCO Income Opportunity composition: 

 (Source: PIMCO) The differences among the three portfolios in terms of their composition is fairly negligible. In other words, the risks that PDI and PKO are exposed to, and the tailwinds that have made them perform so well, are now almost identical with PCI. The correlation between the NAVs have tightened in the last year, and are extremely tight YTD. Among the three funds, PCIs NAV has performed the best. 

 On a price basis, PCI is doing better given the discount and better NAV performance. During the mini-tantrum on September 9th and September 13th, the higher premium funds suffered more than the funds at discounts. 

 Earnings Factors and Discounts As we recently highlighted in our monthly update on PIMCO funds in, "Update To PIMCO Closed-End Funds UNII- August 2016," earnings coverage continues to increase. In June, the three funds all benefited from the settlement with Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) /Countrywide that had long been coming. This is certainly not the last settlement that investors in these securities from prior to the financial crisis are likely to receive. US Justice Department officials recently announced that they were seeking more than $14 billion from Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) in mortgage-related violations. In April, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) agreed to pay $5 billion in MBS-related claim settlements.
 These are the toxic waste CMOs that the restricted entities had to dump at the worst possible time. Many hedge funds and credit pools scooped up these left-for-dead securities at in some cases, pennies on the dollar- but in most cases more than that. It was a quality opportunity as these formerly investment-grade rated structures were forced out of pensions, insurance general accounts, and other regulated funds after the NROs de-rated the securities. By 2010-2013, when PDI and PCI were launching, they scooped up these after substantial amounts of due diligence. By this time, if the mortgage payer was going to default, they likely would have. They had taken out the mortgage prior to 2008 and made it through the financial crisis without defaulting on the loan. While defaults obviously still occurred, they came at a much reduced rate compared to prior years. The funds UNII continues to trend higher though earnings have trended lower. Over the first two months of the fiscal year, PCI has generated $0.54 in taxable NII, or $0.27 per month. UNII rose nine cents to $0.79. If we extrapolate that growth for the remainder of the year, UNII should be around $1.15. We assume a $1.05 special distribution at year-end below. NAV is going to contain all the actions of management in the portfolio. In that respect, PCI is starting to catch, and in the shorter-term, pass PDI in terms of performance. Why? Perhaps when they began shifting the portfolio towards non-agency securities, there was a major buying opportunity similar to what was available in 2012 when PDI was launched. PDI, having a full complement of these securities, did not have as much of an opportunity to add to these securities. The Opportunity We See  The current discount on PCI is likely to close, and move to a premium given the change and the strength of the portfolio. When PIMCO made the alteration to their investment policy, the star management team clearly saw an opportunity within the non-agency mortgage space. And that has played out well judging by the performance noted above. In the table below, we attempt to make a valuation between the three funds. Each month's distribution is noted plus what we expect to be a special distribution around year-end. The funds are ranked by our adjusted total return based solely on distributions, essentially assuming a flat NAV over the course of the year. We think the current discount/premium's of the funds will converge to within 200 bps of each other. The adjusted total return formulates that the two funds at premium (PDI, PKO) will decline towards par and that PCI will move up towards par. We would caveat the above that we do not think PDI and PKO are not deserving the premiums at which they trade. In fact, we believe they should be at much larger premiums to NAV given their yields, stability, and management performance. Our base case forecast calls for all three funds to be trading at 4% to 8% premiums over the next year or two. Given that PDI is there and PKO close to it, the main beneficiary of that move, should it occur, will be PCI. The below table shows the relevant information for each of the three funds: 
 

 The variance in the discounts is likely due to the market balancing out the distribution yields. PCIs yield on price (excluding the forecasted special distributions), is above that of PDI. PCIs distribution yield on price is 9.78% versus PDIs 9.34%. PDI certainly has the longer track record and better performance with PCI struggling during their early years, likely accounting for that 44 bps variance in yield. But as the track record of PCI catches PDI, the variance between the two distribution yields should close. If PCIs distribution yield was 9.34% today, its price would be $21.08, or 5.2% above today's price. As PDIs over-earning to the massive extent it has historically comes to an end- and it will eventually- the fund should still generate 9%-10% for some time even if the large specials are gone. The board's objective has been to keep the regular distribution yield around that 9%-10%, store the excess until forced as a RIC to pay out and avoid the excise tax and earn additional income in the process. In a world of very low rates, that yield should come at a premium to NAV. As total yields (including the specials) converge between the three funds, discounts are likely to unite. The Bottom Line PCI continues to be underappreciated. Much of that is likely due to its shorter lifespan, weak early performance, and the changes to management and the investment policy. This is one of the larger closed-end funds of the ~590 or so that exist meaning that it has significant liquidity (680K daily shares traded). Add in the star-power of the financial sponsor and the premier fixed-income investment team and you have the basis for more institutional ownership. But that will take time as those institutional players (mostly pension funds and insurance companies) allow for those changes to move further into the past. Given the sad state that most of these organizations are in and their reach for yield, these products make complete sense.
 Today, the largest risk of these pools of mortgages comes not from default risk (although it is still there) but from prepayments. These structures were launched with coupons in the 5% to 7.5% range but PIMCOs ability to buy them at half off (or more) means that investors in the fund are receiving 10%+ returns on these investments as they recover in price. The fund itself is generating large unrealized capital gains in the process. As always, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.

We encourage investors to utilize the free two-week trial in order to benefit from our yield opportunities within closed-end funds, business development companies, and other niche areas. We attempt to construct a "low-maintenance portfolio" with a yield in excess of 7% on a tax-equivalent basis with capital gain optionality.

Nuveen Covered Call Closed-End Funds 
For income-oriented investors who are seeking the growth and diversification potential of equities, but who desire higher income and reduced volatility, covered call closed-end funds (also known as equity option closed-end funds) can be an attractive diversifying portfolio opportunity.



Covered Call Strategies for Today's Income Investors 
Nuveen's covered call closed-end funds have been designed to meet the income, risk, and diversification needs of income-oriented investors. Combining a traditional equity portfolio strategy of persistently selling covered calls, then monetizing the long-term expected total returns into quarterly cash distributions, results in the strong potential for a diversifying, higher-yielding and more stable investment.

What are covered call strategies?
							Covered call strategy funds invest in a portfolio of stocks, and sell call options on either individual stocks or stock indices, for the purpose of enhancing total return, reducing volatility, and providing a measure of downside protection over time.  The fund receives a premium from the buyer of the call option, and must sell or deliver the underlying stock (or cash, in the case of a stock index call option) if the call option is exercised by the buyer.  The value of the stocks that are linked to call options sold, relative to the value of full stock portfolio, is termed the Option Overwrite percentage.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

What is the HARP Program?

                                        Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance
                                        into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                                        HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
                                        equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies
                                        over the 12 months prior to refinancing.
                                    

                                        Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month),
                                        get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate mortgage.
                                        There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.

No underwater limits

                                        Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value.
                                        Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                    

                                        No appraisals or underwriting
                                    

                                        Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten,
                                        making their refinance process smoother and faster.

                                        Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.
                                    

                                        Less paperwork
                                    

                                        Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification,
                                        and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower
                                        has at least 12 months of mortgage payments in reserve.

How to get Started?

                                If you qualify to refinance your mortgage through HARP, you’ll go through an application,
                                approval and closing process (similar to when you got your original mortgage).
                                A HARP lender will work with you through every step,
                                and will help determine if HARP meets your specific needs.

Step 1.
Verify your HARP eligibility.

                                Verify if you are eligible for HARP refinance, using
                                HARP verification tool online.

Step 2.
Gather your financial information.

                                Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company.
                                You’ll need:
                            

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).

Step 3.
Contact a HARP lender.

What is the HARP Program?

                                        Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance
                                        into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                                        HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
                                        equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies
                                        over the 12 months prior to refinancing.
                                    

                                        Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month),
                                        get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate mortgage.
                                        There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.

No underwater limits

                                        Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value.
                                        Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                    

                                        No appraisals or underwriting
                                    

                                        Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten,
                                        making their refinance process smoother and faster.
                                    

                                        Modified fees
                                    

                                        Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.
                                    

                                        Less paperwork
                                    

                                        Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification,
                                        and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower
                                        has at least 12 months of mortgage payments in reserve.

                                        The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.

                                        If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,
                                        and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                                        That can mean significant savings by:

Why Homeowners choose HARP®?








Lower Monthly Payment

                            By refnancing to a mortgage with a lower interest rate,
                            you could pay less each month and over the life of the loan.
                        





Lower Interest Rate

                            Today’s market rates are more than 30% lower than in 2008
                        





Get a shorter loan term

                            By switching from a 30-year to a 3 15-year loan, you’ll build equity

How to get Started?

                                If you qualify to refinance your mortgage through HARP, you’ll go through an application,
                                approval and closing process (similar to when you got your original mortgage).
                                A HARP lender will work with you through every step,
                                and will help determine if HARP meets your specific needs.
                                Outlined below are the steps to get started.
                            
Step 1.
Verify your HARP eligibility.

                                Verify if you are eligible for HARP refinance, using
                                HARP verification tool online.

Step 2.
Gather your financial information.

                                Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company.
                                You’ll need:
                            

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).

Step 3.
Contact a HARP lender.

Find a list of approved HARP lenders at one of these pages.
                                Tell them you are interested in refinancing, and you want to see if you qualify for.
                            
Step 4.
Go through the application, approval and closing process.

                                If your lender determines that you do qualify for HARP,
                                they will guide you through the application, approval and closing process.
