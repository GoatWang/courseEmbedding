A NOTE ON METHODOLOGY: The Midas List seeks to identify individuals who deploy venture capital to create wealth for their investors. Our ranking formula ignores the original amount invested in a deal (as it is often undisclosed), instead weighing most heavily the market capitalization of a venture-backed company on the close of its first day of trading or the purchase price in an acquisition. A lesser weight is given to the change in value of each investment since going public or being sold. Ranking also depends on a venture capitalist's (or lawyer's, banker's or recruiter's) length of involvement and influence with a startup. Companies must have gone public or been acquired after June 1995 to be considered, and they must be engaged in information technology or life sciences. Our results are based on extensive reporting and surveys sent to 1,000 professionals, including VCs, angels, lawyers, bankers, recruiters and limited partners. Special thanks go to Thomson Financial Venture Economics/National Venture Capital Association, Alternative Investor/Private Equity Analyst/VentureOne.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

                                                    GlobeNewswire – 
                                                    4:01 PM ET 07/20/2017
                                                


Firsthand Technology Value Fund, Inc. (SVVC), a publicly traded venture capital fund that invests in technology and cleantech companies, disclosed today that its top five holdings as of June 30, 2017, were Pivotal Systems, IntraOp Medical, QMAT, Wrightspeed, and Nutanix (NTNX). The Funds preliminary net assets as of June 30, 2017, include cash and cash equivalents of approximately $1.48 per share.

















                                                    Nutanix is a 'once-in-a-decade' opportunity, says Goldman Sachs

(NTNX) closed up 9% Friday after Goldman Sachs added the stock to their conviction list, saying it has an estimated 53% return potential to their $31 price target. Nutanix (NTNX) is poised for growth as the leader in hyperconverged infrastructure, meaning it uses software to combine different storage and computing function on one device, the analysts said.

















                                                    Nutanix shares soar as analyst calls it 'a once-in-a-decade' opportunity
