Arotech and Ephraim Fields of Echo Lake Capital Settle Proxy Contest

Download PDF

ANN ARBOR, Mich., March 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Arotech Corporation (NasdaqGM: ARTX) and Mr. Ephraim Fields of Echo Lake Capital, Arotech's largest stockholder, today announced an agreement (the "Agreement") to settle their pending proxy contest in connection with Arotech's 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Under terms of the Agreement, Mr. Lawrence F. Hagenbuch, a nominee on Mr. Fields's proposed slate of directors, has joined Arotech's Board as a Class II director, and has been appointed to Arotech's Compensation, Nominating, and Executive and Finance Committees. In order to make room for Mr. Hagenbuch, Dr. Jay M. Eastman has stepped down from the Board. As part of the Agreement, Arotech and Admiralty Partners, Inc. will shorten their voting agreement by one year. Additionally, Mr. Fields will withdraw his slate of director nominees and will vote for the election of the slate of directors that will be nominated by Arotech at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. A copy of the Agreement will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
"I'm very pleased to have this issue behind us, as I believe this settlement of the proxy contest is in the best interest of the Company and all of our stockholders. We can now focus our united efforts on continuing to build value for our stockholders," commented Steven Esses, Arotech President and CEO.
"As Arotech's largest shareholder, I am very pleased that we have been able to resolve this situation. Since I began this campaign, the Board has made several changes and significant shareholder value has been created. I believe Larry Hagenbuch can help the Board create even more shareholder value because of his extensive operational experience (having served in senior management positions for AlixPartners, and GE / GE Capital) and his experience as a director of Remy International, Inc. for eight years (until it was sold for approximately $1.2 billion)," said Mr. Fields.
Jon Kutler, Lead Independent Director of Arotech, also endorsed the settlement, noting that "This resolution will enable management to focus on running Arotech's business and pursuing the best interests of Arotech, its stockholders, employees and customers."
THE COMPANY WILL FILE A PROXY STATEMENT IN CONNECTION WITH ITS 2016 ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS AND ADVISES STOCKHOLDERS TO READ THAT PROXY STATEMENT WHEN IT BECOMES AVAILABLE BECAUSE IT WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION. Stockholders will be able to obtain a free copy of that proxy statement and other documents (when available) that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") at the Commission's website at http://www.sec.gov and at the Company's website at http://www.arotech.com.
The Company, its directors and its nominee to stand for election at the Company's 2016 annual meeting of stockholders may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of proxies in connection with that meeting. These persons may have interests in the solicitation by reason of their beneficial ownership of shares of the Company's common stock and by virtue of agreements and arrangements with the Company. Information about the beneficial ownership of the directors is available by accessing the Company's proxy statement filed with the Commission on March 30, 2015, as supplemented by such changes that have been or will be reflected on Forms 3, 4 and 5 filed with the Commission and that will be reflected in the Company's proxy statement for the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The Company's nominee for director, Rear Admiral (Ret.) James J. Quinn, who is not currently a director of the Company has an interest in being nominated and elected as a director of the Company, but as of the date hereof does not beneficially own any securities of the Company.

Ephraim Fields of Echo Lake Capital Criticizes Board's Decision to Increase Senior Management's Compensation at Edgewater Technology, Inc.

		  - Questions what CEO has accomplished to deserve 21% increase in minimum base salary.- Notes compensation of top four executives in 2012 was almost 2x company's total net income.- Asks if Board of Directors will also be receiving pay increases.- Asks if all EDGW employees will be receiving significant pay increases or just senior management.- Questions why 8-K was filed late on a Friday, two days after Agreements were signed.- Questions justification for increased severance and change of control packages.

						 from   Ephraim Fields 











 
















































 

 




















 

















NEW YORK, Dec. 18, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Mr. Ephraim Fields of Echo Lake Capital today announced he had issued the following letter to the Board of Directors of Edgewater Technology, Inc. (EDGW).

December 18, 2013

TO: 
Shirley Singleton Paul Flynn  Paul Guzzi Nancy Leaming Michael Loeb Daniel O'Connell Wayne Wilson 
It appears to us that Christmas once again came early and undeservedly for the senior management of Edgewater Technology, Inc. ("EDGW") as a recent 8-K filing indicates you approved significant compensation increases for them. 
Your decision to continually provide increased compensation for people whom we believe have repeatedly underperformed (based on both qualitative and quantitative measures) raises serious questions about both your motivations and willingness to uphold your fiduciary responsibility to act in the best interests of all shareholders.  
Furthermore, we believe your decision to file the 8-K late in the day on a Friday, two days after signing the Agreements, raises questions about the level of transparency the company is providing its stakeholders.  If the Agreements were approved on December 4th, why was the 8-K not filed until late in the day on Friday December 6th?  Since it does not typically take the company that long to file an 8-K, we wonder if you were attempting to "bury" the filing and minimize attention it would receive from EDGW's various stakeholders. 
We remain concerned that there is an inappropriately "cozy" relationship at EDGW whereby Board Members (whom, as we have discussed in our previous letters, we believe are overpaid, lack appropriate skills and lack appropriate incentives) continue to enrich senior management (including the Chairman of the Board) and, in exchange, the Board Members themselves are also rewarded with increasingly generous compensation.  While such a relationship might be great for you and senior management, it sadly comes at the expense of EDGW's non-management shareholders.
After reading the 8-K we have some questions which we believe would be of interest to EDGW's various stakeholders:   

Considering Ms. Singleton, Mr. Clancey, Ms. Ranzal-Knowles and Mr. Oakes collectively made $2.8 million in 2012 (the last year for which such data is available), which was almost 2x the company's net income for that year, do you really believe these individuals deserve even more compensation? 
What exactly has Ms. Singleton accomplished to deserve a contract extension and a 21% increase in her minimum annual base salary for 2014?  Do you feel she has management skills, technological insights or other attributes that cannot be provided by other, less expensive CEOs?  You can clearly see how EDGW's stock has repeatedly underperformed over the past 10 years under her leadership, so why do you continue to retain her services?  On a related note, have you ever conducted any confidential internal research to determine how Ms. Singleton is viewed by EDGW's employees?  (You can probably guess what our research has concluded).
Now that you have granted senior management significant pay increases for 2014, will you, the Board of Directors also be receiving pay increases?  
Now that you have granted Ms. Singleton and Mr. Clancey increases in their minimum annual base salary for 2014 of 21% and 25%, respectively, can all EDGW employees expect similar pay increases?
What is your justification for approving even more generous change of control packages?  Clearly a potential result of this is to further enrich senior management while harming shareholders by reducing the price a potential acquirer would pay for EDGW's shares.
The 8-K included other compensation increases which we also find distasteful and not in the best interests of EDGW's shareholders.  If you believe you can continue to cover over both your and senior management's long-standing poor performance by burying 8-K filings and by issuing irrelevant and self-serving press releases, we strongly suggest  you refocus your efforts and begin to take steps that are truly in the best interests of all the shareholders. 
Sincerely,
Ephraim Fields
