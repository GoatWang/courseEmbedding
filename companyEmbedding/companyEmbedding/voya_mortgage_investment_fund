4 Metrics presented use pre-determined criteria to measure each individual investment product based on its ability to either A) rank above the median of its peer category; or B) outperform its benchmark index on a gross-of-fees basis. Generally speaking, the results for unconstrained, fully-active investment products were based on relevant peer category rankings while those of "enhanced index", rules-based, risk-constrained, or client-specific investment products were based on benchmark-relative performance. Metrics are calculated on an annualized basis and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only) commercial book of business that remain open as of 6/30/16. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns and peer medians is Voya Investment Management but is based in part on data from Morningstar (mutual funds) and eVestment (institutional composites). Further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.
5 Metrics are based on observations of rolling 3-year annualized returns over the last 30 months, calculated on an annualized, gross-of-fees basis, and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only commercial book of business that remain open as of 06/30/2016. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns is Voya Investment Management, and further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.

Overview+



What is life insurance? 
Life insurance can provide financial protection for your loved ones when you pass away and be an important part of your overall financial strategy. The Voya Life Companies offer all types of customizable policies with tax benefits to help you protect your financial future, provide for your loved ones and possibly even add to your retirement income. 
Why have life insurance 




How to choose
The kind of life insurance you may want depends on where you are in life, how long you want the coverage, and whether you want to use life insurance to help build money (called cash value) inside of your policy tax-free. That’s money you could possibly borrow1 during your lifetime. Whether term or cash value life insurance, the right choice for you depends on your overall financial strategy.   
Compare Life Insurance Types 




Why Voya? 
The Voya Life Companies are highly rated by commercial rating agencies for financial strength and their ability to meet claims and guarantees.

Life insurance products are issued by ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York (Woodbury, NY) and Security Life of Denver Insurance Company (Denver, CO). Variable universal life insurance products are distributed by Voya America Equities, Inc. Within the state of New York, only ReliaStar Life Insurance Company of New York is admitted and it's products issued. All are members of the Voya® family of companies.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its policies. 





Policy loans and partial withdrawals may vary by state, may generate an income tax liability, reduce available surrender value and reduce the death benefit, or cause the policy to lapse.
1Income tax free distributions are usually achieved by withdrawing to the cost basis (usually premiums paid), then using policy loans. This assumes the policy qualifies as life insurance, is not a modified endowment contract, is not lapsed or surrendered with an outstanding loan. Individual tax results may vary. You should consult your attorney or other tax advisor.

Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

As a component of benefits offered to employees, 401k plans are a very popular way to accumulate tax-deferred income and earnings for retirement. 
Employers offer 401k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement. You choose how much pre-tax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the 401k plan. Your retirement savings can continue to grow tax-deferred until you make a withdrawal. You do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan. Generally, if you take the distribution after age 59½ there is no tax penalty.  
One difference from an IRA is that 401k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer.     




Key Features

Because your employer sponsors the 401k plan, there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals. Check your plan carefully. The following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you:

Optional Participation: Although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations, 401k plan participation is still optional. Check with your employer to determine how you can enroll. 
Contribution Rate: You can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established IRS limits. You will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan.
Your 401k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period. (That’s a good thing!) 
Available Investments: You can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer.
Deferred Taxes: Not only do your pre-tax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period, but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred. Note: Some plans offer a Roth 401k, which permit savings on an after tax basis.  
You will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal. 
Optional Employer Match: To provide an extra boost to retirement savings, many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested. 
Accessing Funds During Employment: Loans—As an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified IRS limits. Hardship Withdrawals—Understanding that certain hardships arise, the IRS permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons. 
Portability: If you leave your job, you can remain in the plan or rollover your 401k funds into an IRA or another 401k.
Support: Your 401k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals, measure your progress, and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals.
The 457 and 403b plans are similar to 401k plans, but are typically offered by other types of organizations. The 457 plan is offered to employees of state and local governments. The 403b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified tax-exempt organizations such as higher-education, churches, tax-exempt hospitals, and charities.
Roth accounts: May also be offered by a plan sponsor under 401k, 403b, or governmental 457b plans. Roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income, but qualified distributions may be taken tax-free in retirement.1  



Suitable For




The 401k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement.  








Eligibility
 



You must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a 401k plan to participate. 
If you leave employment, you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan. 
Some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave. 
You can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover IRA or in most cases, into the 401k plan offered by your new employer.
Contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain IRS-defined annual limits. Contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay. The contributions are taken before taxes, lowering your current income tax bill. You will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ are also subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty, unless an IRS exception applies. 








Additional Details




This material is provided for general and educational purposes only; it is not intended to provide legal, tax or investment advice. All investments are subject to risk. We recommend that you consult an independent legal or financial advisor for specific advice about your individual situation.
The information herein is not intended to be used, and cannot be used by any taxpayer, for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Taxpayers should seek advice based on their own particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.
1A qualified distribution of designated Roth contributions is excludable from gross income. A qualified distribution is one that occurs at least five years after the year of the participant’s first designated Roth contribution (counting such first year as part of the five) and is made: - On or after the participant’s attainment of age 59½, - On account of the participant’s disability, or - On or after the participant’s death. 
If the distribution is not a qualified distribution, then the accumulated Roth 401k earnings will be subject to tax, and additional taxes may apply. Roth 401k amounts are subject to the same required minimum distribution rules as other contributions made to the 401k plan.

2 Internal Voya statistics, as of December 31, 2014.
* Important Information:  Voya StabilizerSM is offered through a group annuity contract issued by Voya Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (VRIAC). Stability of principal is the primary objective of this investment option. Voya's StabilizerSM guarantees a minimum rate of interest and may credit a higher interest rate from period to period. The credited interest rate is subject to change, up or down, but will never fall below the guaranteed minimum. The guarantees provided by the contract are based on the claims-paying ability of VRIAC. The assets are held in a separate account and are “insulated” from claims arising out of any other business conducted by VRIAC and can be used only for the benefit of plan participants.  Withdrawals resulting from employer-initiated events, such as withdrawals following mass layoffs, employer bankruptcy or full or partial plan may be restricted. Your stable value account balance is not guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), by any other government agency or by your plan. This portfolio is not a registered investment under the 1940 Act and has not been registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
All guarantees are based on the financial strength and claims paying ability of the individual issuing insurance company, who is solely responsible for all obligations under its policies.

The Morningstar Category is shown next to the Morningstar Style Box which identifies a fund's investment focus, based on the underlying securities in the fund.Morningstar CategoryWhile the investment objective stated in a fund's prospectus may or may not reflect how the fund actually invests, the Morningstar category is assigned based on the underlying securities in each portfolio. Morningstar categories help investors and investment professionals make meaningful comparisons between funds. The categories make it easier to build well-diversified portfolios, assess potential risk, and identify top-performing funds. We place funds in a given category based on their portfolio statistics and compositions over the past three years. If the fund is new and has no portfolio history, we estimate where it will fall before giving it a more permanent category assignment. When necessary, we may change a category assignment based on recent changes to the portfolio.Fund OverviewCategoryIntermediate GovernmentFund FamilyVoyaNet Assets1.19BYTD Return1.18%Yield2.85%Morningstar Rating★★★★★Inception DateDec 16, 2007Fund OperationsLast Dividend0.02Last Cap Gain0.00Holdings Turnover580.00%Average for CategoryN/AFees & ExpensesExpenseIGMWXCategory AverageAnnual Report Expense Ratio (net)0.68%0.84%Prospectus Net Expense Ratio0.68%N/AProspectus Gross Expense Ratio0.68%N/AMax 12b1 FeeN/AN/AMax Front End Sales LoadN/A3.72%Max Deferred Sales LoadN/A2.02%3 Yr Expense Projection218N/A5 Yr Expense Projection379N/A10 Yr Expense Projection847N/AYahoo Small BusinessData DisclaimerHelpSuggestionsPrivacyAbout Our AdsTerms (Updated)
