Price-to-FFO
The price-to-FFO (funds from operations) ratio is used for evaluating real estate investment trusts (or REIT). It carries the same meaning as the PE (price-to-earnings) ratio, which is used for measuring the relative valuations of companies in other industries.

Peer group price-to-FFO
AMT’s current price-to-FFO ratio stands at 20.06x. The company has undertaken several acquisitions and strategic partnerships to boost its presence in high-demand geographies, and it’s elevated its guidance for its FFO and revenue for 2017. These moves have likely triggered the spike in its stock price, pushing its price-to-FFO ratio higher.



Considering AMT’s price-to-FFO ratio, its stock is trading in line with those of its peers. Crown Castle International (CCI), Realty Income Corporation (O), and SBA Communications (SBAC) are trading at price-to-FFO ratios of 19.34x, 18.67x, and 19.89x, respectively.
Peers’ dividend yields
Currently, American Tower offers a next-12-month dividend yield of 1.9%, which is in line with the yields of its close competitors. Crown Castle has a dividend yield of 3.9%, Realty Income has a dividend yield of 4.5%, and Simon Property Group has a dividend yield of 4.8%.
Net asset value also determines the value of an REIT. The ProShares Ultra Real Estate ETF (URE) holds almost 17% in AMT and its peers. The ETF is diverse in terms of both geography and products, so it offers a cushion to investors. URE has a net asset value of $62.92 per share.
AMT has a net asset value growth rate of 2.6%, CCI has a net asset value growth rate of -5.3%, and SBAC has a net asset value growth rate of -0.5% for the next 12 months.

SBA Communications Corporation 

SBA Communications Corporation (SBA) is a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure across North, Central and South America. Founded in 1989 and headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida, SBA is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol: SBAC.

By "Building Better Wireless", SBA generates revenue from two primary businesses - site leasing and site development services.

In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space on our multi-tenant towers and other structures to a variety of wireless service providers under 
                    long-term lease contracts.
Our site development business offers wireless service providers and operators assistance in developing their own networks through site acquisition, zoning, construction and equipment installation.


Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, SBA owns and operates towers in Brazil, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama. Our expansion is driven by:

Consumers’ increased use of mobile applications, particularly data.
Wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks.
Spectrum auctions, which result in new market entrants as well as additional network deployments from existing wireless service providers.


Our size, experience, capabilities and resources make SBA a preferred partner for wireless service providers both domestically and internationally. With anticipated ongoing, dynamic growth in wireless traffic (in particular data and video), SBA will continue to lead the way in providing innovative business strategies and continuous improvement to our network infrastructure.
