Loncor Resources Inc. Key Developments

Loncor Resources Inc. Proposes Amendments to its Articles of Corporation
Jun 9 17
Loncor Resources Inc. at its AGM to be held on June 29, 2017 proposed amendments to its articles of corporation of the company.


Loncor Resources Inc. Announces Randgold Resources (DRC) Limited to Commence Ground Exploration on Priority Targets at Loncor's Ngayu Project
May 19 17
Loncor Resources Inc. announced that exploration ground work has commenced on priority targets resulting from the 'VTEM' geophysical airborne survey undertaken by Randgold Resources (DRC) Limited (Randgold) earlier this year on Loncor's Ngayu project in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Under the joint venture agreement signed in January 2016, Randgold will manage and fund exploration of the exploration permit areas comprising Loncor's Ngayu project until the completion of a pre-feasibility study on any gold discovery meeting the investment criteria of Randgold. Subject to the DRC's free carried interest requirements, Randgold would earn 65% of any discovery with Loncor holding the balance of 35%. Loncor will be required, from that point forward, to fund its pro-rata share in respect of the discovery in order to maintain its 35% interest or be diluted. Processed data and final products from the 10,013 line kilometre helicopter borne electromagnetic 'VTEM' survey completed over the Ngayu belt by Geotech Airborne Limited of Aurora, Canada have been combined with all other geological layers to complete an updated integrated geological map of the belt and to refine and prioritize areas of interest (AOIs). The four preliminary AOIs have several kilometre long mineralised strike potential focused on extension of known mineralized trends as well as areas of geochemical anomalies and structural complexity. The four priority AOIs identified are summarized below: Priority 30 kilometre long Imva Fold structure Extensive geochemical anomalies and several gold occurrences along major structures and complex deformation around intrusions. Yindi/Aguluku trend 20 kilometre long northwest extension of the Yindi/Aguluku mineralised trend with high soil and BLEG geochemical anomalies in the Yindi and Anguluku prospect areas. Younger Lindian cover may be obscuring any geochemical signature further along strike to the northwest. Structural complexity favorable for gold mineralised emplacement where the Banded Ironstone Formations ("BIFs") wrap around the western side of a regional intrusive complex. Adumbi trend 20 kilometre mineralised northwest extension of the Adumbi trend with moderate BLEG anomalism along the entire AOI, in places associated with similar lithological setting as the Adumbi deposit. Northern Ngayu 8 kilometre structural trend located in an area of complex folding of BIFs and carbonaceous shale, a localized area of high BLEG anomalism associated with a northwest trending fold axis, the setting and geochemical anomalism indicate the potential for fold plunging style mineralization. The initial work program will have a two-pronged approach: a geological review of all existing targets; and ground follow-up of remotely and conceptually generated AOIs to generate additional new targets. The belt scale exploration strategy of Randgold is to focus on the discovery of large high quality gold deposits by rapidly identifying and progressing targets that show the potential to meet these filters. Resources of greater than two million ounces of gold have already been identified within the Ngayu greenstone belt in the Makapela and Adumbi deposits and the objective is to further unlock the potential of the Ngayu greenstone belt for a world class discovery using cutting edge geophysics, geochemistry, structural interpretation and driven by an experienced and proven exploration team on the ground. Certain parcels of land within the Ngayu project surrounding and including the Makapela and Yindi prospects have been retained by Loncor and do not form part of the joint venture with Randgold. Randgold shall have certain pre-emptive rights over these two areas. Loncor's Makapela prospect has an Indicated Mineral Resource of 614,200 ounces of gold (2.20 million tonnes grading 8.66 g/t Au) and an Inferred Mineral Resource of 549,600 ounces of gold (3.22 million tonnes grading 5.30 g/t Au).


Loncor Resources Inc. Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017
May 16 17
Loncor Resources Inc. reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported interest income of $59 against $56 a year ago.

North Kivu Project

Loncor owns or controls a contiguous block of 55 exploration permits or PRs covering an area of approximately 17,760 square kilometers to the northwest of Lake Edward in North Kivu province. These PRs are located between the two major gold belt terrains of the DRC - the Twangiza-Namoya gold belt, owned by Banro Corporation, and the Kilo-Moto gold belt, previously controlled by Moto Gold and now by Randgold and Anglogold Ashanti. The main provincial centres within the project area are Butembo and  Lubero.
To date, Loncor had identified ten gold prospects for follow up, the most prospective being the Manguredjipa prospect where 300,000 ounces of alluvial gold was mined during the colonial period. Other gold prospects warranting follow up include Lutunguru, Lubero, Makwasu, Lutela, Bilolo, Manzia, Mohanga and Lundjulu. This is an area that has never been explored using modern exploration techniques.
Geology and History
The Loncor properties are located within the Kibaran Orogenic Belt, consisting of Archean greenstones and Proterozoic meta-sediments which have experienced a protracted history of tectonism, volcanism and metamorphism. The Kibaran Orogenic belt is primarily prospective for gold and platinum minerals, but also has potential to host tin, niobium, tantalum, tungsten, beryllium, copper and cobalt.
The Belgian company Miniere des Grands Lacs (MGL) mined alluvial gold and platinum on Loncor's North Kivu permits between the 1920s and 1960s. In the Manguredipa area alone, over 300,000 oz of alluvial gold and platinum were extracted.
MGL's alluvial operations eventually led to the discovery of numerous primary high-grade quartz veins, stockworks and disseminated gold deposits (see map below). These deposits were tested by MGL during the 1940s and 1950s by trenching, adits and diamond drilling. However, low gold prices and civil unrest caused the cessation of activities in 1960.
Non-Gold Mineral Potential
In addition to gold, there are a number of alluvial platinum occurrences in the project area, including the type locality for the platinum selenide mineral luberoite near Lubero. To date no primary source has been found for the alluvial platinum occurrences.
Although the priority is gold and platinum, the North Kivu Project permits also have a number of niobium, rare earths, tantalum, copper, iron and diamond occurrences. Rock sampling and geological mapping will be undertaken on some of these, including the Bingo carbonatite that contains significant amounts of pyrochlore (niobium/tantalum), to determine whether more detailed follow up is required.
Exploration Program
In 2008, Loncor conducted airborne radiometric and geophysical surveys (14,316 line kilometres) of its PRs. Follow-up interpretation yielded several anomalies, with possible primary gold mineralization.
The program will focus on the most advanced gold prospect within the North Kivu project area, Manguredjipa, where exploration began in 2009 in the vicinity of the known gold occurrences. In addition, regional exploration will be undertaken on the additional nine identified gold prospects found elsewhere within the North Kivu Project area. Follow-up will also be undertaken on the alluvial platinum occurrences in the Lubero area to determine the primary source of this precious metal.

Loncor Resources Inc Sales Preparation

   Loncor Resources owns permits to explore for gold at a handful of properties located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The company had been privately owned until a 2008 transaction in which it sold itself to a more or less dormant public company called Nevada Bob's International and then changed that company's name to Loncor Resources Inc. The former Nevada Bob's International and current Loncor no longer has any relationship with the golf retailer, having sold off those operations to The Forzani Group (the Canadian business) in 2004 and to Golfer's Warehouse (the US operations) in 2005.
