As a component of benefits offered to employees, 401k plans are a very popular way to accumulate tax-deferred income and earnings for retirement. 
Employers offer 401k plans as a way to help their employees save for retirement. You choose how much pre-tax income you wish to contribute and that amount is automatically deducted from your paycheck and placed into your account within the 401k plan. Your retirement savings can continue to grow tax-deferred until you make a withdrawal. You do not pay taxes on your salary deferrals or earnings until you take a withdrawal from the plan. Generally, if you take the distribution after age 59½ there is no tax penalty.  
One difference from an IRA is that 401k plans permit higher contribution limits and are only available through your employer.     




Key Features

Because your employer sponsors the 401k plan, there may be other valuable benefits offered in addition to salary deferrals. Check your plan carefully. The following are key features provide a brief overview to assist you:

Optional Participation: Although some plan sponsors automatically enroll employees to promote plan participations, 401k plan participation is still optional. Check with your employer to determine how you can enroll. 
Contribution Rate: You can choose the amount you want to contribute each payroll up to established IRS limits. You will also be permitted to change your contribution rate once you are in the plan.
Your 401k plan contribution comes out of your paycheck on a pre-tax basis which lowers your taxable income for that pay period. (That’s a good thing!) 
Available Investments: You can choose from a variety of investment choices selected by your employer.
Deferred Taxes: Not only do your pre-tax contributions help lower your taxable income each pay period, but all earnings on your contributions grow tax deferred. Note: Some plans offer a Roth 401k, which permit savings on an after tax basis.  
You will not be taxed on either the contributions or earnings until you make a withdrawal. 
Optional Employer Match: To provide an extra boost to retirement savings, many employers match a percentage of an employee’s contribution which will be given to the employee once she is vested. 
Accessing Funds During Employment: Loans—As an optional feature your employer may permit you to borrow against your plan account up to specified IRS limits. Hardship Withdrawals—Understanding that certain hardships arise, the IRS permits plans to allow distributions for certain hardship reasons. 
Portability: If you leave your job, you can remain in the plan or rollover your 401k funds into an IRA or another 401k.
Support: Your 401k plan provider typically offers many free tools and resources to help you establish savings goals, measure your progress, and to see how financially close you are to meeting your retirement goals.
The 457 and 403b plans are similar to 401k plans, but are typically offered by other types of organizations. The 457 plan is offered to employees of state and local governments. The 403b plan is offered only to the employees of public schools and qualified tax-exempt organizations such as higher-education, churches, tax-exempt hospitals, and charities.
Roth accounts: May also be offered by a plan sponsor under 401k, 403b, or governmental 457b plans. Roth contributions are made after you’ve paid taxes on the income, but qualified distributions may be taken tax-free in retirement.1  



Suitable For




The 401k is a key financial tool for almost anyone trying to save as much as possible for their retirement.  








Eligibility
 



You must be employed by a plan sponsor offering a 401k plan to participate. 
If you leave employment, you will no longer be able to contribute to the plan. 
Some employers will let you keep your savings in their plan after you leave. 
You can always combine all of your old plans into one rollover IRA or in most cases, into the 401k plan offered by your new employer.
Contributions are deducted from your paycheck up to certain IRS-defined annual limits. Contributions can be designated as a specific dollar amount or percentage of your pay. The contributions are taken before taxes, lowering your current income tax bill. You will owe income taxes when you make a withdrawal from the plan. Withdrawals prior to age 59½ are also subject to a 10% IRS early withdrawal penalty, unless an IRS exception applies.

1A qualified distribution of designated Roth contributions is excludable from gross income. A qualified distribution is one that occurs at least five years after the year of the participant’s first designated Roth contribution (counting such first year as part of the five) and is made: - On or after the participant’s attainment of age 59½, - On account of the participant’s disability, or - On or after the participant’s death. 
If the distribution is not a qualified distribution, then the accumulated Roth 401k earnings will be subject to tax, and additional taxes may apply. Roth 401k amounts are subject to the same required minimum distribution rules as other contributions made to the 401k plan.

Overview+



What is an annuity? 
An annuity is an insurance product that pays you periodic income payments in exchange for your premium payment. It can be used as part of your overall retirement strategy. Depending on the type of annuity, it may help you grow your retirement savings, protect your savings from loss, and offer death benefits to protect your beneficiaries. 




How to choose an annuity
Make your choice based on how your needs match up to the features of the annuity. Do you need to grow your retirement savings or are you concerned with losing principal? Or both? Do you need income that starts now or in the future? Do you want to leave a legacy to your heirs? These are some of the questions to ask yourself to determine which annuity might work for you. 




Why Voya?
Voya Financial is ready to help Americans build a secure financial future—one person, one family, one institution at a time. We are ready to make a difference—to deliver financial solutions to help all Americans become retirement ready.

Overview+



What is life insurance? 
Life insurance can provide financial protection for your loved ones when you pass away and be an important part of your overall financial strategy. The Voya Life Companies offer all types of customizable policies with tax benefits to help you protect your financial future, provide for your loved ones and possibly even add to your retirement income. 
Why have life insurance 




How to choose
The kind of life insurance you may want depends on where you are in life, how long you want the coverage, and whether you want to use life insurance to help build money (called cash value) inside of your policy tax-free. That’s money you could possibly borrow1 during your lifetime. Whether term or cash value life insurance, the right choice for you depends on your overall financial strategy.

1Income tax free distributions are usually achieved by withdrawing to the cost basis (usually premiums paid), then using policy loans. This assumes the policy qualifies as life insurance, is not a modified endowment contract, is not lapsed or surrendered with an outstanding loan. Individual tax results may vary. You should consult your attorney or other tax advisor.

1Proceeds from an insurance policy are generally income tax free and if properly structured, may also be free from estate tax.
2Policy loans and partial withdrawals may vary by state, may generate an income tax liability, reduce available surrender value and reduce the death benefit, or cause the policy to lapse.
Income tax free distributions are usually achieved by withdrawing to the cost basis (usually premiums paid), then using policy loans. This assumes the policy qualifies as life insurance, is not a modified endowment contract, is not lapsed or surrendered with an outstanding loan. Individual tax results may vary. You should consult your attorney or other tax advisor.

Benefits



Investment Options+

Your clients can choose from over 100 mutual funds offered by more than 30 well-known fund companies – including American Funds, T. Rowe Price, JP Morgan, BlackRock, PIMCO, Ivy Funds, and Oppenheimer, to name a few – all available within one retirement account. We have well-known funds and over 30 funds with an Overall Morningstar Rating of 4 and 5 stars. Your clients can see the progress of their investments on their quarterly statements or by going online. View Fund Information 

Investable Assets+

Designed to accept initial contributions of $5,000 or more, rollovers or transfers from a qualified plan, including a 401(k), 403(b) and governmental 457(b) plan, as well as from other IRAs. SIMPLE IRAs can only accept rollovers from other SIMPLE IRAs. Will accept direct transfers. Rolling a 457(b) to an IRA before age 59½ should be carefully considered. Any amount rolled from a 457(b) to an IRA will become subject to the IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax. 

Account Types+

Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Traditional Beneficiary Available IRA and Roth Beneficiary IRA. (Beneficiary IRAs are also known as Stretch IRAs or Inherited IRAs.) 

Additional Features+

Dollar Cost Averaging*
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) can help level out the effect of market fluctuation on the cost of an investment when contributions are made to an account on a regular basis. It is a fixed dollar amount that is invested in regular intervals, regardless of price. Available as a 6, 12, or 24-month schedule. DCA does not ensure a profit nor guarantee against loss. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue their purchases through periods of low price levels.
Automatic Asset Rebalancing*
Automatic Asset Rebalancing rebalances your clients’ portfolios back to their original allocation to help them stay in line with their risk tolerance. While rebalancing helps manage your investment allocation, it does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Available quarterly, semi-annually, annually.*Dollar Cost Averaging and Automatic Rebalancing cannot be elected simultaneously.

Additional Details+

Clients should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the mutual funds offered through a retirement plan carefully before investing. The prospectus(es) contain(s) this and other information which clients should be able to obtain by contacting their local representative. Clients should read the prospectus(es) carefully before investing.
Voya Institutional Trust Company is the custodian for mutual fund custodial accounts distributed by Voya Financial Partners LLC (member SIPC) or other broker-dealers with which it has a wholesaling or selling agreement. All named companies are members of the Voya® family of companies.
Mutual funds offered through a retirement plan are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. If withdrawals are taken prior to age 59½, an IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax will apply unless an exception applies.

Insurance News Release








 




ING U.S. Adds ING Global Perspectives Fund to its Insurance Solutions Products

MINNEAPOLIS - 
MONDAY, MAY 6, 2013

ING U.S. announced today that it has introduced a new investment strategy within its Variable Universal Life (VUL) insurance and ING Select Advantage IRA (“Select Advantage”) mutual fund custodial account products.  The ING Global Perspectives Fund (“Global Perspectives Fund”), managed by Douglas Cote, Chief Market Strategist at ING U.S. Investment Management, offers a balanced approach to asset allocation with a focus on broad diversification and tactical allocation changes based on key market drivers.  The Global Perspectives Fund was available to ING U.S. Insurance Solutions VUL and Select Advantage customers starting May 1, 2013.  “Adding the Global Perspectives Fund to our line-up of options sets us apart in the market and brings a compelling investment strategy to our customers and distribution partners,” said Butch Britton, chief executive officer of ING U.S. Insurance Solutions.  “In today’s economic environment, an investment strategy with the ability to adjust based on pre-defined market signals can be very appealing.  We’re thrilled to be leveraging the expertise of ING Investment Management to deliver this popular solution.  This is a great example of   the synergies and distinctive value offered by our compelling mix of businesses.”ING Global Perspectives was introduced in 2011 on the advisory platform of the ING Financial Partners broker-dealer network.  After strong acceptance of the strategy by financial advisors, this expansion to new markets extends its reach and application.In its current investment mix, the Global Perspectives Fund has a standard allocation of 60 percent equity and 40 percent fixed income.  Yet, the tactical element of the strategy allows it to adjust in uncertain times based on market fundamentals.  The strategy utilizes ten broadly diversified underlying holdings that are equally weighted to provide a balance of upside potential and an element of protection in sustained market downswings.“We believe this strategy cuts through the noise of conflicting market signals to offer potential long-term results that life insurance policyholders and their financial advisors are seeking,” commented Cote.  “We are delighted to be part of this new partnership to bring this strategy to new markets.”Within ING U.S. Insurance Solutions VUL products, the Global Perspectives Fund is available for both in-force and new policyholders who can place some or all of the cash value portion of their life insurance policy into the strategy.  This approach may alleviate some of the concerns that market volatility creates and help round out a policyholder’s financial portfolio.Accumulation-focused life insurance products, including VUL, can play a key role in meeting a range of financial needs, including helping clients with their retirement readiness.  A 2012 ING U.S. Insurance Revealed study found that the most common reason to purchase life insurance – cited by half of the survey respondents – is to replace income or pay off debts.  Yet very few highlighted its value to protect retirement savings (4 percent) or build wealth (1 percent).  To build awareness of the accumulation potential of life insurance, the ING U.S. family of companies has a full scope of products, educational programs, resources and tools to help our distribution partners and their clients.Individual employees have more responsibility today to plan and save for their own retirement.  Due to the more transient nature of the job market, there is also a greater likelihood that workers have multiple retirement accounts from various employers.  Select Advantage provides a single product with over 120 mutual fund choices from over 30 well-known managers – including Global Perspectives – to help financial professionals simplify retirement planning and consolidate retirement assets for their clients when appropriate.In gaining access to the Global Perspectives platform, financial advisors also benefit from the availability of diverse education and resource materials that can be shared with clients.  These materials include market commentaries, research, analysis and presentations.  With the expansion of Global Perspectives, ING U.S. brings together its investment and insurance expertise to deliver a solution that helps meet a market need for a balanced and disciplined investment approach with global diversification and tactical allocation.Press inquiries:Maggie Dietrich                                                             ING U.S.

This is a summary only. Please read the contract for complete details. 
1Proceeds from an insurance policy are generally income tax free and if properly structured, may also be free from estate tax.
2Policy loans and partial withdrawals may vary by state, may generate an income tax liability, reduce available surrender value and reduce the death benefit, or cause the policy to lapse.
Income tax free distributions are usually achieved by withdrawing to the cost basis (usually premiums paid), then using policy loans. This assumes the policy qualifies as life insurance, is not a modified endowment contract, is not lapsed or surrendered with an outstanding loan. Individual tax results may vary. You should consult your attorney or other tax advisor.
3Dollar cost averaging does not ensure a profit nor guarantee against loss.
