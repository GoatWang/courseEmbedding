Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)









WD-40® literally stands for Water Displacement, 40th formula. That's the name straight out of the lab book used by the chemist who developed the product back in 1953. The chemist, Norm Larsen, was attempting to concoct a formula to prevent corrosion—a task which is done by displacing water. Norm's persistence paid off when he perfected the formula on his 40th try. Please see Our History for more information.









While the ingredients in WD-40® Multi-Use Product are secret, we can tell you what it does NOT contain. WD-40® Multi-Use Product does not contain silicone, kerosene, water, graphite, or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).













Since product “evacuation” problems – where some of the product may be left inside the can but not able to be sprayed – are common throughout the aerosol industry, they can affect some of the products we produce.  If you are having trouble with an aerosol can not spraying (failure to evacuate), please try this brief troubleshoot:

Twist the nozzle 1/4 turn and try again. Turning the nozzle realigns the dip tube in the can.  
If turning does not work, please try another 1/4 turn.  Continue to move it around a bit until liquid sprays out.

If this still does not work, here are some times to prevent this from happening going forward:

Hold your can in an upright position whenever possible
Take care when handling and transporting cans so as not to drop or aggressively shake

For more information about product evacuation issues and how you can get the entire contents out of the can, please watch our “Failure to Evacuate Video” below or contact TMP at 888-324-7596. We are actively seeking solutions to ensure the products you purchase meet and exceed your expectations on a daily basis, so thank you for your patience.

















While this may vary depending on the application, WD-40® Multi-Use Product remains effective even after it appears to dry. The corrosion and rust protection ingredients remain adhered to the surface. External conditions may, of course, require additional applications of the product for maximum protection.









WD-40® Specialist® is a new line of best-in-class maintenance products specifically formulated to help you get specific tasks done with ease. The line includes: Industrial-Strength Cleaner & Degreaser, Stay and Spray Gel Lubricant, Rust Release Penetrant Spray, Water Resistant Silicone Lubricant, Protective White Lithium Grease, Long-Term Corrosion Inhibitor, Rust Remover Soak, Machine & Engine Degreaser, Dirt & Dust Resistant Dry Lube, Electrical Contact Cleaner Spray and Industrial-Strength Degreaser, Superior Performance True Multi-Purpose Grease, Heavy-Duty High Temperature Grease, Heavy-Duty Extreme Pressure Grease and Marine Grade Water Resistant Grease.

FAQs





What does WD-40® stand for?

WD-40® literally stands for Water Displacement, 40th formula. That's the name straight out of the lab book used by the chemist who developed the product back in 1953.

What does WD-40® Multi-Use Product contain?

While the ingredients in WD-40® Multi-Use Product are secret, we can tell you what it does NOT contain. WD-40® Multi-Use Product does not contain silicone, kerosene, water, graphite, or chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).



What does WD-40® Multi-Use Product do?

WD-40® Multi-Use Product fulfills five basic functions:
                    
LUBRICATES: The product's lubricating ingredients are widely dispersed and tenaciously held to all moving parts.
PENETRATES: WD-40® Multi-Use Product loosens rust-to-metal bonds and frees stuck, frozen or rusted metal parts.
PROTECTS: The product protects metal surfaces with corrosion-resistant ingredients to shield against moisture and other corrosive elements.
REMOVES: WD-40® Multi-Use Product gets under dirt, grime and grease. Use it to remove gunk from tools, equipment and vehicles. WD-40® Multi-Use Product in liquid form (e.g., gallon) also dissolves adhesives, allowing easy removal of excess bonding material.
DISPLACES MOISTURE: Because it displaces moisture, WD-40® Multi-Use Product quickly dries out electrical systems to eliminate moisture-induced short circuits.




How long does WD-40® Multi-Use Product last after application?

While this may vary depending on the application, WD-40® Multi-Use Product remains effective even after it appears to dry. The corrosion and rust protection ingredients remain adhered to the surface. External conditions may, of course, require additional applications of the product for maximum protection.



What is the shelf life of WD-40® Multi-Use Product?

WD-40® is a product of persistent nature which is designed and manufactured to a high degree of specifications. The product should continue to perform as expected for an almost indefinite period of time. However, actual performance is affected by the longevity of mechanical items such as the valve assembly on aerosol cans. As such, the shelf life is considered to be 5 years from the date of production; however, product will often dispense and perform as expected for considerably longer. WD-40® should be stored between 4 degrees centigrade and 54 degrees centigrade, and always shaken before use.



Can the Aerosol be used upside down?

Yes!
An aerosol is composed of a gaseous propellant and a liquid portion.  An aerosol functions when the propellant forces the liquid out of the can.  If there is no propellant, there is nothing to “activate” the aerosol.
When a WD-40® can is held upright, the propellant is at the top, and the liquid at the bottom of the can.  The inner dip tube extends down into the fluid.  There is also a small opening (a tap hole) at the very bottom of the valve.  In the valve is a small ball bearing.  When the can is in the upright position, the ball bearing blocks the path to the small hole in the valve.  This way, the only exit is through the bottom of the dip tube, which lets out only the liquid product.
When the can is held upside down, the positions of the propellant and juice are reversed.  But in this position, the ball bearing blocks the path to the bottom of the dip tube, and the opening at the bottom of the valve, in contact with the juice, is now open.
The worst position to hold a can of WD-40® is sideways.  Here the ball bearing blocks neither hole, and you lose propellant and juice together.  When all the propellant is gone, the aerosol will no longer function.



What is the propellant in WD-40® Multi-Use Product?

A propellant is the stuff that helps pump WD-40® Multi-Use Product out of the can. The propellant used is carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 is an inert gas which helps empty the can. Plus, the addition of CO2 reduced the number of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) in the product, a step toward respecting and conserving the environment.



What surfaces or materials are OK to use WD-40® Multi-Use Product on?

WD-40® Multi-Use Product can be used on just about everything. It is safe to use on metal, rubber, wood and plastic. It can also be applied to painted metal surfaces without harming the paint. Polycarbonate and clear polystyrene plastic are among the few surfaces on which to avoid using a petroleum-based product like WD-40® Multi-Use Product.



What about using WD-40® Multi-Use Product on my sports equipment?

WD-40® Multi-Use Product is safe and effective to use on all types of sporting goods. It is a fantastic all-around maintenance product for bikes, as you can use it on frames to prevent them from rusting, to lubricate pivot points, to prevent mud from sticking and to displace moisture from bike components. Use WD-40® Multi-Use Product on watercraft to drive out moisture and to protect metal surfaces from corrosion.



How do I keep the red straws from getting lost?

Used for thousands of applications, WD-40® Multi-Use Product cans are now able to do something even more useful - hold onto that little red straw that was forever getting lost! The WD-40® Smart Straw® features a high-impact-resistant nozzle, 360-degree valve system and permanently attached straw, so WD-40® Multi-Use Product users will never lose the straw again®. Flipped down for a wide spray or flipped up for a pinpoint stream, the WD-40® Smart Straw® gives consumers a better way to spray! 
For old cans of WD-40® Multi-Use Product, there is the NotchCap, designed to securely hold the straw in place when not in use. Simply snap the straw into the recessed slot on the top of the cap and it will stay there until removed. This is just another small step to keep WD-40® Multi-Use Product users smiling. Be sure to point the spray nozzle toward the dot on the top of the can to ensure that the can fully empties.



Where can I buy WD-40® Multi-Use Product?

WD-40® Multi-Use Product is available almost everywhere. It can be found in many countries in automotive, convenience, discount, drug, grocery, hardware, and home center stores. It's also available from leading distributors all over the world. If your store or distributor doesn't sell WD-40® Multi-Use Product, please ask them to add it.



What are the WD-40® MIL Specs?

WD-40® does not meet any military specifications at this time.



What is the difference between flammable and combustible? Is one safer than the other?

The difference between Flammable and Combustible has to do with the Flashpoint. Flashpoint is the lowest temperature at which a liquid can form an ignitable mixture in air near the surface of the liquid. Flammable liquids have a lower flashpoint, meaning they can ignite at a lower temperature than Combustible liquids. Trigger Pro® is combustible, so it requires a higher temperature to ignite, and is therefore safer than flammable liquids.



Are WD-40® aerosol products flammable?

WD-40® aerosol is considered flammable for other reasons beyond flashpoint. Aerosols must be tested for “flame extension” (how far a spray will carry a flame), and “flashback” (whether the spray carries the flame back toward the user). WD-40® does not have flashback, but can carry a flame forward, so it is categorized as flammable.



Does WD-40 Company offer sponsorship opportunities?

WD-40 Company does not have a formal sponsorship program at this time, but tries to accommodate most product requests from racers and car clubs. We know a little WD-40® Multi-Use Product can go a long way, and wish both new WD-40® brand fans and those who have been sponsored by WD-40 Company in the past best of luck in their endeavors.



Why can’t I empty all the product in my aerosol can?

Since product “evacuation” problems – where some of the product may be left inside the can but not able to be sprayed – are common throughout the aerosol industry, they can affect some of the products we produce.  If you are having trouble with an aerosol can not spraying (failure to evacuate), please try this brief troubleshoot:

Twist the nozzle 1/4 turn and try again. Turning the nozzle realigns the dip tube in the can.
If turning does not work, please try another 1/4 turn.  Continue to move it around a bit until liquid sprays out.

WD-40&reg Trigger Pro® Non-Aerosol FAQs





Product Performance





What makes WD-40® Trigger Pro® different than the other competitors on the market?

WD-40® Trigger Pro® has several unique and superior characteristics that differentiate it from competitors on the market. It has a non-leaking bottle/trigger system with two different spray patterns, plus the control to dispense a few drops at a time. The shaped can is sturdier than competitive plastic bottles that may break when dropped. It also carries the WD-40® brand—the most trusted brand name in the lubricant category.



Is a 20 oz non-aerosol more product than a 20 oz aerosol?

 No, because WD-40® Trigger Pro® is a non-aerosol liquid. Aerosol products are a "net weight" measure that includes the propellant (3%).



Can you put a Smart Straw® on WD-40® Trigger Pro®?

No. WD-40® Trigger Pro® cannot be taken apart once assembled because of the Child Resistant Closure.



What happens if I pull the trigger when it is in the locked position?

No product will be able to evacuate. However, pressure may build in the can and may dispense once you rotate the nozzle to stream or spray.



Does Trigger Pro® spray upside down?

Yes, for a short amount of time.



Is the efficacy the same in WD-40® Trigger Pro® vs. WD-40® Multi-Use Product aerosol cans?

Yes, it is the same great WD-40® Multi-Use Product formula.





Safety



Why can't I refill Trigger Pro® when it is empty?

The product comes equipped with a Child Resistant Closure as required by law and therefore cannot be easily opened once sealed. Removing the trigger can strip the closure and cause the can to leak.



The nozzle doesn't seem to work like other spray nozzles. Why is it so difficult to turn?

The spray trigger system comes equipped with a Child Resistant Nozzle. In order to change between the spray patterns/settings, simply press down on the blue tab near the yellow tip on top of the trigger and turn nozzle to spray or steam.



Why do I care about child resistant closures and nozzles if I work in a factory?

Trigger Pro® may be sold in distributor retail locations, and therefore is required by law to have a child resistant closure on non-aerosol products like WD-40® .



Can I use WD-40® on my Arthritis? 

WD-40 Company makes no medical claims for WD-40® product.  We know no reason why WD-40® should be effective for arthritis/pain relief. WD-40® is formulated to be a light lubricant, penetrating oil, and water displacing corrosion preventative.  It contains petroleum distillates and should be handled with the same precautions for this type of material. It does not contain DMSO.  We have never recommended the use of WD-40® for medical purposes.  Originally, WD-40® was created as a rust-prevention product for use in the aerospace industry, to protect the outer skin of the Atlas Missile from rust and corrosion.  It is also not recommended because of the possibility of skin irritation in people with marginalized skin (i.e., eczema).





Disposal / Environment



Is Trigger Pro® a "green" version of WD-40® Multi-Use Product?

 No. However, since many people believe non-aerosols are better for the environment than aerosols, they may describe WD-40® as "green." Rest assured that all WD-40® Multi-Use Product aerosol cans DO NOT contain CFCs, and have not contained them for over 30 years. WD-40® Multi-Use Product's steel cans, whether aerosol or new non-aerosol Trigger Pro®, have always been recyclable where steel is recycled.



Is there a difference with disposing aerosol products versus non-aerosol products?

Yes, in many areas empty aerosol cans have to be punctured before they can be disposed by a business or factory. WD-40® Trigger Pro® does not need to be punctured. It can simply be recycled or thrown away.



Is WD-40® Trigger Pro® better for the environment than WD-40® aerosol products?

No. It is not different than any of the other items in the WD-40® brand lineup. All WD-40® aerosol products DO NOT contain CFCs, and have not contained them for over 30 years. WD-40® Multi-Use Product's steel cans, whether aerosol or new non-aerosol Trigger Pro®, have always been recyclable where steel is recycled.

Cool Stuff Welcome to the World of the Blue-and-Yellow Can





💥Explore Myths, Legends & Fun Facts of the Blue & Yellow Can






A bus driver in Asia used WD-40® to remove a python, which had coiled itself around the undercarriage of his bus.










Duct Tape & WD-40®: You often hear it said, “You only need two things in life: Duct Tape and WD-40. If it moves and shouldn’t, use Duct Tape, if it doesn’t move and should, use WD-40.” Surely there is a reason for that.












Crayola® Stain Removal Tips recommends using WD-40® Multi-Use Product to remove (regular) crayon marks from a variety of surfaces.











Myth: WD-40® contains fish oil. Fact: Consumers have told us for years that they've caught some of the biggest fish ever after protecting their fish hooks and lures with WD-40. We believe this legend came from folks assuming the product must contain fish oil since it appears to attract fish. Sorry Charlie®, it just ain’t so. Learn more

After 39 unsuccessful attempts three lucky geniuses managed to develop the original secret formula for WD-40 - which stands for Water Displacement perfected on the 40th try. The formula of the original product hasn't changed since then.
WD-40 is a global marketing organization that develops and sells environmentally friendly products for homes, factories and workshops around the world. It is still headquartered in San Diego California, where the first WD-40 product was formulated many years ago. The legendary WD-40 blue and yellow can is recognized worldwide and can be found everywhere – under the sink of a housewife, in the garage of a car fan, or in a toolbox of a mechanic.
The purpose of WD-40 is to deliver easy-to-use solutions to help you accomplish almost any task. The most famous WD-40 Multi-Use product also known as “a can with thousands of uses” has been admired by people for over 60 years. Among its 5 basic applications are protection from rust and corrosion, lubrication, grease removing, penetrating and displacing moisture. In addition to the Multi-Use product, the company offers the WD-40 Specialist, a line of specialty maintenance products, and the WD-40 Bike, a line of bicycle care products made for cyclists and mechanics.

WD-40 is the trademark name of a penetrating oil and water-displacing spray. The spray is manufactured by the San Diego, California–based WD-40 Company.[1]

History[edit]
Different sources credit different men with inventing WD-40 formula in 1953 as part of the Rocket Chemical Company (later renamed to WD-40 Company), in San Diego, California; the formula was kept as a trade secret and was never patented.[2]
According to Iris Engstrand, a historian of San Diego and California history at the University of San Diego, Iver Norman Lawson invented the formula,[3] while the WD-40 company website and other books and newspapers credit Norman Larsen.[4][5][2] "WD-40" is abbreviated from the term "Water Displacement, 40th formula", suggesting it was the result of the 40th attempt to create the product.[1] The spray, composed of various hydrocarbons, was originally designed to be used by Convair to protect the outer skin which comprised the paper-thin balloon tanks of the Atlas missile from rust and corrosion.[6][7] These stainless steel fuel tanks were so fragile that when empty they had to be kept inflated with nitrogen to prevent them from collapsing. WD-40 was later found to have many household uses[1] and was made available to consumers in San Diego in 1958.[6]
It was written up as a new consumer product in 1961.[8] By 1965 it was being used by airlines including Delta and United; United, for example, was using it on fixed and movable joints of their DC-8 and Boeing 720s in maintenance and overhaul.[9] At that time, airlines were using a variant called WD-60 to clean turbines, removing light rust from control lines, and when handling or storing metal parts.[9] By 1969 WD-40 was being marketed to farmers and mechanics in England.[10]
Function[edit]
The long-term active ingredient is a non-volatile viscous oil which remains on the surface to which it is applied, giving lubrication and protection from moisture.[11] This oil is diluted with a volatile hydrocarbon to make a low viscosity fluid which can be aerosolized to penetrate crevices. The volatile hydrocarbon then evaporates, leaving behind the oil. A propellant (originally a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, now carbon dioxide) creates pressure in the can to force the liquid through the can's nozzle before evaporating.[11]
Its properties make it useful in both domestic and commercial settings. Typical uses for WD-40 include removing dirt and extricating jammed screws and bolts. It can also be used to loosen stubborn zippers and displace moisture.
Due to its low viscosity, WD-40 is not always the preferred oil for certain tasks. Applications that require higher viscosity oils may use motor oils. Those requiring a mid-range oil could use honing oil.[12]
Formulation[edit]
WD-40's formula is a trade secret. To avoid disclosing its composition, the product was not patented in 1953, and the window of opportunity for patenting it has long since closed.[7] WD-40's main ingredients as supplied in aerosol cans, according to U.S. Material Safety Data Sheet information, are:

50% "aliphatic hydrocarbons". The manufacturer's website claims this ratio in the current formulation cannot accurately be described as Stoddard solvent, a similar mixture of hydrocarbons.[13]
<25% petroleum base oil. Presumably a mineral oil or light lubricating oil.
12–18% low vapor pressure aliphatic hydrocarbon. Reduces the liquid's viscosity so that it can be used in aerosols. The hydrocarbon evaporates during application.
2–3% carbon dioxide. A propellant which is now used instead of the original liquefied petroleum gas to reduce WD-40's flammability.
<10% inert ingredients.

The German version of the mandatory EU safety sheet lists the following safety-relevant ingredients:

60–80% hydrogen-treated heavy naphtha (a petroleum product used in wick-type cigarette lighters)
1–5% carbon dioxide

It warns of the product's high flammability and the risk of irritation to human skin when repeatedly exposed to WD-40. Nitrile rubber gloves and safety glasses should be worn (ordinary rubber disintegrates if exposed to petroleum products). It also mentions that water is unsuitable for extinguishing burning WD-40.
In 2009, Wired published an article with the results of gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy tests on WD-40, claiming that its ingredients make it resistant to freezing.[14]

WD-40 spray can from Germany


WD-40 is the trademark name of a penetrating oil and water-displacing spray. The spray is manufactured by the San Diego, California–based WD-40 Company.[1]

History[edit]
Different sources credit different men with inventing WD-40 formula in 1953 as part of the Rocket Chemical Company (later renamed to WD-40 Company), in San Diego, California; the formula was kept as a trade secret and was never patented.[2]
According to Iris Engstrand, a historian of San Diego and California history at the University of San Diego, Iver Norman Lawson invented the formula,[3] while the WD-40 company website and other books and newspapers credit Norman Larsen.[4][5][2] "WD-40" is abbreviated from the term "Water Displacement, 40th formula", suggesting it was the result of the 40th attempt to create the product.[1] The spray, composed of various hydrocarbons, was originally designed to be used by Convair to protect the outer skin which comprised the paper-thin balloon tanks of the Atlas missile from rust and corrosion.[6][7] These stainless steel fuel tanks were so fragile that when empty they had to be kept inflated with nitrogen to prevent them from collapsing. WD-40 was later found to have many household uses[1] and was made available to consumers in San Diego in 1958.[6]
It was written up as a new consumer product in 1961.[8] By 1965 it was being used by airlines including Delta and United; United, for example, was using it on fixed and movable joints of their DC-8 and Boeing 720s in maintenance and overhaul.[9] At that time, airlines were using a variant called WD-60 to clean turbines, removing light rust from control lines, and when handling or storing metal parts.[9] By 1969 WD-40 was being marketed to farmers and mechanics in England.[10]
Function[edit]
The long-term active ingredient is a non-volatile viscous oil which remains on the surface to which it is applied, giving lubrication and protection from moisture.[11] This oil is diluted with a volatile hydrocarbon to make a low viscosity fluid which can be aerosolized to penetrate crevices. The volatile hydrocarbon then evaporates, leaving behind the oil. A propellant (originally a low-molecular-weight hydrocarbon, now carbon dioxide) creates pressure in the can to force the liquid through the can's nozzle before evaporating.[11]
Its properties make it useful in both domestic and commercial settings. Typical uses for WD-40 include removing dirt and extricating jammed screws and bolts. It can also be used to loosen stubborn zippers and displace moisture.
Due to its low viscosity, WD-40 is not always the preferred oil for certain tasks. Applications that require higher viscosity oils may use motor oils. Those requiring a mid-range oil could use honing oil.[12]
Formulation[edit]
WD-40's formula is a trade secret. To avoid disclosing its composition, the product was not patented in 1953, and the window of opportunity for patenting it has long since closed.[7] WD-40's main ingredients as supplied in aerosol cans, according to U.S. Material Safety Data Sheet information, are:

50% "aliphatic hydrocarbons". The manufacturer's website claims this ratio in the current formulation cannot accurately be described as Stoddard solvent, a similar mixture of hydrocarbons.[13]
<25% petroleum base oil. Presumably a mineral oil or light lubricating oil.
12–18% low vapor pressure aliphatic hydrocarbon. Reduces the liquid's viscosity so that it can be used in aerosols. The hydrocarbon evaporates during application.
2–3% carbon dioxide. A propellant which is now used instead of the original liquefied petroleum gas to reduce WD-40's flammability.
<10% inert ingredients.

The German version of the mandatory EU safety sheet lists the following safety-relevant ingredients:

60–80% hydrogen-treated heavy naphtha (a petroleum product used in wick-type cigarette lighters)
1–5% carbon dioxide

It warns of the product's high flammability and the risk of irritation to human skin when repeatedly exposed to WD-40. Nitrile rubber gloves and safety glasses should be worn (ordinary rubber disintegrates if exposed to petroleum products). It also mentions that water is unsuitable for extinguishing burning WD-40.
In 2009, Wired published an article with the results of gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy tests on WD-40, claiming that its ingredients make it resistant to freezing.[14]

The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Cartridge Comparison Guide 



Cartridge Types
Ink & Toner Basics
Number of Pages & Shelf Life



Cartridge Type



Genuine or OEM (Original) Cartridges
Remanufactured Cartridges
Compatible Cartridges


Description

OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer, meaning the cartridge was made by the same company that made your printer. Original brand cartridges are very reliable and sometimes the only option if your printer is new to market or uncommon.


Remanufactured ink is a genuine brand cartridge that has gone through one cycle of use. After use, the cartridge is recycled, acquired by a remanufacturing facility and put through a rigorous professional refurbishing process. During the refurbishing process the cartridge is disassembled, thoroughly cleaned and tested for quality. It's then carefully refilled, tested again and brought back to life. Buying remanufactured prevents one less cartridge from ending up in a landfill.


A compatible cartridge is a brand new ink cartridge built by a manufacturer other than your printer. It's like buying the generic version of the genuine brand. Most are uniquely designed to differentiate from genuine cartridges. Despite any structural difference you may notice, the cartridge will still fit in your machine and print a full yield, just like the original brand.



Price Factors

Many printer manufacturers follow the razor-and-blades business model which may result in higher priced genuine cartridges.


Remanufactured ink is much cheaper than the original brand ink. It's far more cost effective to refurbish a previously used cartridge than create a new OEM from scratch.


Compatible ink is much cheaper than the original brand. Compatible suppliers don't have to worry about the additional costs that hinder OEMs like new printers or firmware, which lets them keep prices low.



Quality

Original cartridges work extremely well and are covered under a warranty by the printer manufacturer


High quality remanufactured ink will match the quality of the original, but not all remanufactured ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.


High quality compatible ink will match the quality of the original, but not all compatible ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.





What's the difference between ink and toner cartridges?



Ink Cartridges
Toner Cartridges


Printer Type
Work with inkjet printers
Work with laser printers


Material
Liquid ink
Dry powder


How it works
Inkjet printers use a series of nozzles that spray tiny drops of ink directly on the print suface
Laser toner printers use static electricity and heat to bond dry toner powder to a page


Commonly used by
Casual home users, small business and photographers
Large businesses and schools






Number of Pages You Can Print

A cartridge's page yield is the estimated number of pages you can print. Page yield is based on 5% page coverage. This means that the quoted page yield is based upon printed pages where only 5% of the page has been imprinted with ink. For example, a short memo has approximately 5% coverage. If you have a cartridge that has a yield of 500 pages, it can print 500 pages of that short memo. If you are printing letters, photos or graphics, your coverage will vary greatly and your page yield will drop significantly.



Cartridge Warranty and Shelf Life

Most ink and toner cartridges include a warranty or "best by" date on their box. Remanufactured and compatible ink cartridges can last 12-18 months unopened, and toner cartridges can last up to 3 years.



Cartridge Care and Storage

Only open a cartridge when you need it. Opened cartridges will eventually dry out, especially if the protective tape or clip has been removed. If you have an open ink cartridge around and would like to try and prevent it from drying out, place it nozzle side up in a plastic airtight tub. If your cartridge came with protective tape or a clip reapply both before storing. Place a damp cloth or paper towel in the tub, next to the cartridge and keep it stored in a cool, dark place.

Most are uniquely designed to differentiate from genuine cartridges. Despite any structural difference you may notice, the cartridge will still fit in your machine and print a full yield, just like the original brand.



Price Factors

Many printer manufacturers follow the razor-and-blades business model which may result in higher priced genuine cartridges.


Remanufactured ink is much cheaper than the original brand ink. It's far more cost effective to refurbish a previously used cartridge than create a new OEM from scratch.


Compatible ink is much cheaper than the original brand. Compatible suppliers don't have to worry about the additional costs that hinder OEMs like new printers or firmware, which lets them keep prices low.



Quality

Original cartridges work extremely well and are covered under a warranty by the printer manufacturer


High quality remanufactured ink will match the quality of the original, but not all remanufactured ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.


High quality compatible ink will match the quality of the original, but not all compatible ink is created equal. Make sure you buy from a reputable supplier in order to get the absolute best results.





What's the difference between ink and toner cartridges?



Ink Cartridges
Toner Cartridges


Printer Type
Work with inkjet printers
Work with laser printers


Material
Liquid ink
Dry powder


How it works
Inkjet printers use a series of nozzles that spray tiny drops of ink directly on the print suface
Laser toner printers use static electricity and heat to bond dry toner powder to a page


Commonly used by
Casual home users, small business and photographers
Large businesses and schools






Number of Pages You Can Print

A cartridge's page yield is the estimated number of pages you can print. Page yield is based on 5% page coverage. This means that the quoted page yield is based upon printed pages where only 5% of the page has been imprinted with ink. For example, a short memo has approximately 5% coverage. If you have a cartridge that has a yield of 500 pages, it can print 500 pages of that short memo. If you are printing letters, photos or graphics, your coverage will vary greatly and your page yield will drop significantly.



Cartridge Warranty and Shelf Life

Most ink and toner cartridges include a warranty or "best by" date on their box. Remanufactured and compatible ink cartridges can last 12-18 months unopened, and toner cartridges can last up to 3 years.



Cartridge Care and Storage

Only open a cartridge when you need it. Opened cartridges will eventually dry out, especially if the protective tape or clip has been removed. If you have an open ink cartridge around and would like to try and prevent it from drying out, place it nozzle side up in a plastic airtight tub. If your cartridge came with protective tape or a clip reapply both before storing. Place a damp cloth or paper towel in the tub, next to the cartridge and keep it stored in a cool, dark place.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
