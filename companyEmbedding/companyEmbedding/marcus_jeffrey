Marcus started in the business as Innovations Manager and I have known Marcus for over three years, as a Key Account Manager and more recently as our Supply Chain Director at Hypac. 

The Scunthorpe factory closed on 31st May and Marcus further demonstrated his commitment and continued support to Mondi during these very difficult circumstances as he remained with the business  to successfully manage the transfer of selected business to other sister sites. 

During Marcus employment here, he was an effective manager who was respected by both work colleagues and other management. He was a hardworking, reliable, honest and conscientious individual. He led his team by example doing whatever it took to get the job done and he had the ability to maintain a positive attitude and focus on the tasks required, even through very difficult times. 

Marcus was an active member of our Management team, and was quite creative in finding solutions to issues and able to make difficult decisions when required. He is confident in communicating with people at all levels, both internally and externally and was effective within the Supply Chain Function demonstrating his negotiating skills on numerous occasions. I also find that he deals with people issues consistently, fairly and firmly, taking a balanced view before deciding or implementing actions.. 

 I hope this information provided will be helpful to you and I wish Marcus well in his search for future employment.See moreSee lessMarcus was an excellent SCD at the Hypac site. He is extremely committed, hard working and adaptable. During his time in the business he faced a number of challenges including, unfortunately, site closure.
