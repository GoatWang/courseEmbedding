Renewegy at its roots is a technology company. It has utilized its engineering expertise to design a state of the art and cost effective wind turbine.

VP-20 Wind Turbine
The VP-20’s Variable Pitch (VP) control system, hydraulic tip-up tower, and internet monitoring are unique in the commercial wind turbine market. These designs are engineered to make the VP-20 one of the most technologically advance wind turbines available today. Combine these features with an included 5-year warranty and you get an unparalleled level of reliability and safety. Click here for more information on the VP-20 wind turbine.
