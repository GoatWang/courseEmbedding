As provided in the Issuer’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, each share of Class B Common Stock is convertible at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A Common Stock.                  The Reporting Persons (as defined in this Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D) are party to certain agreements with the Separately Filing Group Members (as defined in the Schedule 13D, filed with the SEC by the Reporting Persons on August 26, 2010), which agreements contain, among other things, certain voting agreements and limitations on the sale of their shares of Common Stock. As a result, the Reporting Persons may be deemed to be members of a “group,” within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Act (as defined in the Schedule 13D, filed with the SEC by the Reporting Persons on August 26, 2010), comprised of the Reporting Persons and the Separately Filing Group Members. Shares listed as beneficially owned by each Reporting Person exclude shares held by any other Reporting Person or by any of the Separately Filing Group Members, in each case as to which the Reporting Person disclaims beneficial ownership.     All references to the number of shares outstanding are as of October 28, 2016, as reported in the Issuer’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 (the “September 2016 10-Q”), as adjusted to account for (i) an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock that were converted into 4,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with sales by the Reporting Person and another Separately Filing Group Member pursuant to Rule 144 on November 10, 2016 and November 30, 2016, and (ii) an aggregate of 10,187,641 shares of Class B Common Stock that were converted into 10,187,641 shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with the election by certain holders of Class B Common Stock party to the 2007 Stockholders’ Agreement to convert such shares on November 4, 2016, as reported in the Issuer’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed November 7, 2016 (items (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Known Conversions”).  The percentage is calculated using the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons and based on 130,858,901 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of October 28, 2016. With respect to matters upon which the Issuer’s stockholders are entitled to vote, the holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock vote together as a single class, and each holder of Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share and each holder of Class B Common Stock is entitled to ten votes per share. The shares of Class B Common Stock owned by the Reporting Persons represent 0.8% of the total voting power of the Common Stock as of October 28, 2016, as adjusted for the Known Conversions. The percentage of total voting power of the Common Stock is calculated based on the total voting power of the Common Stock outstanding as of October 28, 2016, as adjusted for the Known Conversions, which is comprised of  38,299,216  shares of Class A Common Stock and 92,559,685 shares of Class B Common Stock and assumes that no outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock other than as reported in the September 2016 10-Q or in connection with the Known Conversions.                          CUSIP No. 448579102     SCHEDULE 13D     Page 3 of 12

The shares of Class B Common Stock owned by the Reporting Persons represent 1.9% of the total voting power of the Common Stock as of October 28, 2016, as adjusted for the Known Conversions. The percentage of total voting power of the Common Stock is calculated based on the total voting power of the Common Stock outstanding as of October 28, 2016, as adjusted for the Known Conversions, which is comprised of  38,299,216  shares of Class A Common Stock and 92,559,685 shares of Class B Common Stock and assumes that no outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock other than as reported in the September 2016 10-Q or in connection with the Known Conversions.                   CUSIP No. 448579102     SCHEDULE 13D     Page 4 of 12         EXPLANATORY NOTE: This Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D (“Amendment No. 2”) relates to the Class A Common Stock, $0.01 par value per share, of Hyatt Hotels Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the “Issuer”), which has its principal executive office at 71 South Wacker Drive, 12th Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60606. This Amendment No. 2 amends and supplements, as set forth below, the Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Persons with respect to the Issuer on August 26, 2010 (the “Original Schedule 13D”), as amended and supplemented by Amendment No. 1 to Schedule 13D filed by the Reporting Persons on May 16, 2011 (“Amendment No. 1”). The Original Schedule 13D, as amended and supplemented by Amendment No. 1, is referred to as the “Schedule 13D.” All capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meanings ascribed to them in the Schedule 13D. The Schedule 13D is amended and supplemented by adding the information contained herein. Only those items amended are reported herein.     Schedule A attached to the Schedule 13D is replaced in its entirety by Schedule A attached hereto, and all references to “Schedule A” in the Schedule 13D shall be to “Schedule A” attached hereto. Schedule B attached to the Schedule 13D is replaced in its entirety by Schedule B attached hereto, and all references to “Schedule B” in the Schedule 13D shall be to “Schedule B” attached hereto. Appendix A-1 and Appendix A-2 attached to the Schedule 13D are deleted in their entirety.       Item 2.     Identity and Background       Item 2 of the Schedule 13D is amended by deleting the first paragraph thereof and replacing such paragraph with the following:     (a)-(c)  This Schedule 13D is being filed by: Posterity PT Company, not individually, but solely in the capacity as trustee of PG Alma Trust, and the Pritzker Family Foundation (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”).     Item 2 of the Schedule 13D is amended by deleting the second paragraph thereof and replacing such paragraph with the following:     The address of the principal business and principal office of the Reporting Persons is for Posterity PT Company, not individually, but solely in the capacity as trustee of PG Alma Trust, 100 W. Liberty Street, Floor 10, Reno, NV 89501 and for the Pritzker Family Foundation, 111 S Wacker Drive, Suite 4000, Chicago, IL 60606.  The Reporting Persons are principally engaged in the business of investing the assets of the trusts for the benefit of the beneficiaries of such trusts and the Pritzker Family Foundation for its stated purpose.     Item 2 of the Schedule 13D is amended by deleting the third paragraph thereof and replacing such paragraph with the following:     The Reporting Persons have entered into a Joint Filing Agreement, dated as of December 1, 2016, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 7 to this Amendment No. 2.       Item 3.     Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration       Item 3 of the Schedule 13D is amended and supplemented as follows:     On January 1, 2016, Thomas J. Muenster resigned as trustee of PG Alma Trust and Posterity PT Company was appointed as trustee of PG Alma Trust. Because Thomas J. Muenster has resigned as trustee of PG Alma Trust, he is no longer a reporting person for the shares of Class B Common Stock held by such trust. Instead, Posterity PT Company is now a reporting person for the shares of Class B Common Stock held by PG Alma Trust. No consideration was paid in connection with the appointment of Posterity PT Company as trustee of PG Alma Trust and such appointment constitutes a “Permitted Transfer” as defined under the Issuer’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and, accordingly, the shares of Class B Common Stock held by PG Alma Trust remain shares of Class B Common Stock following the appointment of Posterity PT Company as trustee of such trust.     On December 23, 2015, CIBC Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited and Thomas J. Muenster, not individually, but solely in the capacity as co-trustees of the Cheyenne Trust and the Moreau Trust, transferred 1,830,094 shares of Class B Common Stock to the Pritzker Family Foundation (the “12/23/2015 Transfer”). No consideration was paid in connection with the 12/23/2015 Transfer and the 12/23/2015 Transfer constitutes a “Permitted Transfer” as defined in the Issuer’s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and, accordingly, the transferred shares of Class B Common Stock remain shares of Class B Common Stock following the 12/23/2015 Transfer. Because the 12/23/2015 Transfer resulted in the trusts for whom CIBC Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited and Thomas J. Muenster acted as trustee ceasing to own Common Stock, CIBC Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited and Thomas J. Muenster are no longer reporting persons in such capacity. Instead, the Pritzker Family Foundation is now a reporting person.              CUSIP No. 448579102   SCHEDULE 13D   Page 5 of 12          Item 4.   Purpose of Transaction    Item 4 of Schedule 13D is hereby amended by deleting the last paragraph thereof and adding the following:        The 12/23/2015 Transfer was completed on December 23, 2015, as described in Item 3 of this Amendment No. 2.   On November 30, 2016, the Reporting Persons converted 2,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock received by them in the Distribution into Class A Common Stock and then transferred those 2,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock to a third-party purchaser for consideration of $50.80 per share, or $101,600,000.00 in the aggregate.   Except as described in this Item 4, the Reporting Persons currently have no plans or proposals that relate to or would result in any transaction, event or action set forth in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D. The Reporting Persons reserve the right to formulate plans or make proposals, and take such action with respect thereto, including any or all of the items set forth in subsections (a) through (j) of Item 4 of Schedule 13D and any other actions, as they may determine.    Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer    Item 5 of Schedule 13D is hereby amended by deleting the first paragraph thereof and replacing it with the following:       (a)-(b) As of the date hereof, the Reporting Persons in the aggregate may be deemed to be the beneficial owners of 2,610,665 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of 2,610,665 shares of Class B Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons represents 2.8% of the total number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. The number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Reporting Persons represents 2.0% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and 2.7% of the total voting power of the shares of Common Stock outstanding, voting together as a single class, assuming that no outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock other than (i) an aggregate of 4,500,000 shares of Class B Common Stock that were converted into 4,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with sales by the Reporting Person and another Separately Filing Group Member pursuant to Rule 144 on November 10, 2016 and November 30, 2016, and (ii) an aggregate of 10,187,641 shares of Class B Common Stock that were converted into 10,187,641 shares of Class A Common Stock in connection with the election by certain holders of Class B Common Stock party to the 2007 Stockholders’ Agreement to convert such shares on November 4, 2016, as reported in the Issuer’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed November 7, 2016 (items (i) and (ii) collectively, the “Known Conversions”).
      Item 5 of Schedule 13D is hereby amended by deleting the third paragraph thereof and replacing it with the following:       Based solely on the information contained in the Schedule 13Ds, as amended, filed by the Separately Filing Group Members, as set forth in Schedule B described below, as of the date hereof, the Pritzker Family Group in the aggregate may be deemed to be the beneficial owners of 24,530 shares of currently issued Class A Common Stock and 77,635,240 shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of 77,635,240 shares of Class B Common Stock beneficially owned by the Pritzker Family Group. The number of shares of Class A Common Stock beneficially owned by the Pritzker Family Group and currently issued represents 0.1% of the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding, assuming that no outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock other than the Known Conversions. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock beneficially owned by the Pritzker Family Group represents 83.9% of the total number of shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding. The number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Pritzker Family Group represents 59.3% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding and 80.5% of the total voting power of the shares of Common Stock outstanding, voting together as a single class, assuming that no outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock have been converted into shares of Class A Common Stock other than the Known Conversions. 
       Item 5 of Schedule 13D is hereby further amended by deleting the seventh and eighth paragraph thereof and replacing them with the following:   (c) As described in Item 3 above, on August 17, 2010, the co-trustees of the U.S. Situs Trusts allocated or distributed 7,486,499 shares of Class B Common Stock to the Reporting Persons, and certain members of IHE distributed 1,830,094 shares of Class B Common Stock previously held by IHE and its subsidiaries to the Reporting Persons.  As described in Item 4 above, on May 15, 2011, the Reporting Persons agreed to transfer 3,265,110 shares of Class B Common Stock received by them in the Distribution in the aggregate to the Issuer for consideration of $44.03 per share, or $143,762,793.30 in the aggregate.

Eisenberg, not individually, but solely as trustee of certain trusts listed on Appendix A-1 to the Schedule 13D, and the other Reporting Persons named therein, which includes information regarding the filer’s jurisdiction of organization, principal business, and address of principal office.  Thomas J. Pritzker holds 119,707 stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) that are currently exercisable at an exercise price of $40.96, 127,410 SARs that are currently exercisable at an exercise price of $41.74, 140,601 SARs that are currently exercisable at an exercise price of $41.29, 155,535 SARs that are currently exercisable at an exercise price of $43.44, 70,095 SARs that are currently exercisable at an exercise price of $49.39 and 45,088 SARs that are currently exercisable at an exercise price of $56.27.  The number of shares of Class A Common Stock that Mr. Pritzker will receive upon exercise of such SARs is not currently determinable and therefore not included in the table above because each SAR gives the holder the right to receive a number of shares of Class A Common Stock equal to the excess of the value of one share of A Common Stock at the exercise date, which is not determinable until the date of exercise, over the exercise price.           CUSIP No. 448579102     SCHEDULE 13D     Page 10 of 12

The three core areas of functionality for collaborative tools are communication, project & task management, and file sharing & management. Some products stress one feature set over another; these take a best-of-breed approach and often work well if they are highly integratable. Slack, for example, is an online team collaboration app that provides messaging and file sharing, and integrates for everything else. Collaboration tools are closely related to a number of other types of software, including business communications (e.g. email), community platforms, enterprise social, document storage, and project management software. Many of these platforms include built-in collaboration features. Some collaboration tools can replace these more traditional solutions; however it is more common for pure-play collaboration tools to be integrated with a company's existing communication and workflow infrastructure. Online Collaboration ToolsAlthough locally hosted collaboration solutions (like Redbooth Private Cloud) are available, online collaboration tools are more abundant and are often more convenient, especially for disparate teams or team members who work remotely. Online collaboration tools are SaaS or cloud solutions that allow "e-professionals" to work together on common tasks. They come in many forms, from mobile apps to browser extensions. Some are industry and use case-specific; for instance online collaboration tools like Mural.ly and ConceptBoard are optimized for brainstorming sessions among graphic designers. Others, like Microsoft Yammer, are designed to be more like a social network for corporate enterprises. There are numerous other formats for collaboration as well, such as Confluence's internal knowledge base, MindMeister's flowchart mind-maps, and Trello's simple to-do card system. There are many basic free online collaboration options, such as GoVisually, Trello, and Podio, and many paid solutions have free trials or freemium versions available. AdoptionAdoption is key to success with collaboration software. It will only be effective if everyone involved with the project is on board. So, it is important to choose a collaboration tool that's easy to use and that fits with your team's project culture. But, there are a ton of collaboration products on the market right now, and it's a growing space. Here are some considerations to help you drill down and find a good fit for your use case: What types of projects will you collaborate on?What are the steps of a typical project?How do people on your team currently handle communication and workflow?Where do they store project files?How many people will be collaborating, in how many departments?Will project managers or the people doing the project be collaborating, or both?Since integration is so important, what other platforms and apps does your team use?Collaboration Features & CapabilitiesCommunicationSome tools, like Skype, Google Hangouts, and HipChat, have communication capabilities at their core. Other collaboration features are available as well, but their scale (number of collaborators, for example), may be limited or dependent on the level of the subscription. Communication features common across collaboration tools include: Options for integrated messaging, such as a live chat, comments within a file, and private or group messages.Privacy & access settingsConference callingVideo chats with screensharingProject-based conversationsProject & Task ManagementMany online collaboration tools have basic project & task management capabilities, but these are not usually as advanced as the capabilities available from traditional project management vendors. Asana, Microsoft Yammer, Basecamp, Trello, and Huddle are other collaboration tools noted for significant project & task management features. Some of these products skirt the line between collaboration and project management. For example, Wrike has very robust project management capabilities, but its design aims to emulate the ease and engagement of a social network--a quality common among collaboration tools. Project & task management capabilities are often more important to larger teams, teams working between departments, or teams within larger organizations where there are more dependencies and levels of approval. Collaboration features related to project & task management can include:Workflow automationTracking the location of a file, as well as who has opened or changed it and whenBrainstorming tools/pinboardsTask lists and assignments, with due dates, sub-tasks, and file attachment capabilitiesScheduling, with Calendar integration and automated reminders and alertsGantt chartsFile Sharing & ManagementTools like Google Drive, Dropbox, GlassCubes, MediaFire, and Nomadesk focus on file sharing & management but offer significant opportunities for collaboration.

        The company recognizes that the above-noted efforts are necessary in a slow growth environment to grow overall markets and increase its market share.
        The company needs to invest in improved product formulations, packaging, sales coverage, advertising sampling, upstream R&D and consumer and customer value.
        A significant portion of the above-noted investments will be funded by the company’s billions of identified cost saving opportunities across the organization.
        Investors should buy the company’s shares at a value-oriented price for income and to benefit from its incisive and likely effective efforts to drive revenue/earnings growth.
          In recent years Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), has been in the midst of a transformation to drive revenue growth in a depressed global environment while also addressing the adverse effects of a strong U.S. dollar. While we believe that part of PG's struggles related to its large size and the "law of large numbers," we also believe that the company had very real problems that needed to be addressed. Earlier in 2017, according to PG, multiple factors contributed to decelerating sales growth including delayed tax returns, higher gas prices, bad weather, and a likely drawdown of at-home inventory. While the company has acknowledged that it has been facing an "unprecedented" amount of geopolitical disruption and uncertainty, it has emphasized that it is aggressively driving cost savings to mitigate the impacts of such multiple adversities. PG is also protecting its investments in its businesses to maintain and accelerate organic sales growth in a sustainable, market constructive, and value accretive way. The company has also noted that in the near term the external challenges it faces (including slow market growth, geopolitical/economic instability, the strong U.S. dollar, increasing commodity costs and retail trade transformation) will continue.
 Despite the above-noted challenges, PG is in the midst of several strategic objectives that include: 1) enhancing product and package superiority; 2) emphasizing excellence of execution; 3) focusing on cost and cash productivity; and 4) ensuring organizational design, culture and accountability. The company sees such strategic efforts as necessary in a slow growth environment to grow markets and market share. To achieve positive outcomes, category growth, increased household penetration, strong share positions and sales and profit growth in this difficult environment, the company understands that it must combine a foundation of irresistibly superior product and packaging experiences with superior execution in advertising, sampling and in-store fundamentals with winning value equations. To accomplish such higher standards more consistently, the company acknowledges it will need to invest in improved product formulations, packaging, sales coverage, advertising sampling, upstream research and development and consumer and customer value. A significant portion of such investments will be funded by PG's billions of identified cost saving opportunities across the organization. While the company has made progress to date with respect to such strategic efforts, it knows its efforts must continue. Earlier in June 2017, PG participated in the Deutsche Bank Global Consumer Conference and made a presentation in regard to its innovation, marketing and transformational efforts to drive more substantive and consistent revenue/earnings growth. In such presentation PG highlighted the significant changes to the company it had made to create shareholder value. More specifically, the company noted that it has become a simpler and more focused organization by: 1) narrowing its product portfolio to focus on its most profitable core brands; and 2) driving productivity through operational efficiencies. In about two years, PG divested, discontinued, or consolidated 105 brands (which represented about 14 percent of fiscal 2013 sales and only about 6 percent of profit). With such divestitures, the company has a 10 product-category portfolio with more historical revenue/profit growth than the "old PG." With respect to the product categories the company has retained, each category has a leading market position and is used daily where purchase intent and choice are driven more by a specific job to do and product effectiveness in doing such job. A decade earlier, about a third of PG's sales were in categories where purchase decisions were primarily driven by fashion, flavor, or fragrance. Today, almost no company category is driven by fashion, flavor or fragrance.
 PG's retained product categories leverage its core strengths, consumer understanding, branding, product and packaging innovation, and its go-to-market capabilities. Beyond the company's product portfolio rationalization, it has also made significant productivity improvements to maximize the value of its future growth. Over the prior five years, PG achieved its target to save $10 billion. To achieve such cost savings, the company significantly reduced its product/brand categories but also reduced its number of manufacturing sites, mainly in developed markets and moved more of the work closer to consumers and faster growing developing markets. The company: 1) simplified manufacturing platforms; 2) decreased manufacturing enrolment; 3) reduced its number of advertising public relations and other agencies supporting the business; 4) reduced non-working media costs; and 5) decreased the number of its office buildings and research and development centers. PG, net of reinvestments into innovation sales coverage, media, and sampling productivity savings, has been able to deliver constant currency growth and operating profit margin improvement in high single digits to double-digit constant currency core earnings per share growth in each of the last four fiscal years. PG understands that it needs to accelerate revenue growth as it continues to improve its margins. The company understands further that to be a consumer products leader in total shareholder returns they must have balanced revenue growth, margin growth, and high cash efficiency, balance growth and value creation. According to PG, there are three areas of value creating that include: 1) product superiority such as impactful meaningful advantages that earn trial and repurchase, grow markets and build share; 2) productivity such as best-in-class core structures by category to fuel growth and value creation; and 3) organization, culture, and accountability that includes personnel that are experienced, agile, accountable to deliver, and sustain exceptional performance. The company is establishing a higher standard of excellence for itself, for products and packages, communication, execution in stores and online, and consumer and customer value. Delivering on such higher standards is what it needs in the current slow growth environment to grow markets and market share and to prevent commoditization of its categories and minimize deflationary impacts. Such standards are also needed to decrease promotional spending and create strong retail relevance across channels off-line and online.
 PG understands that its new higher standards represent its need to deliver products that have a significant enough advantage to change consumer's affinity for its brands and their expectations of a product category. For example, superior products are ideally delivered in superior packages. Superior packaging attracts the consumer, provides integrity and quality protection and delights consumers during use. Superior packaging creates recognizable brands on shelves, aides the consumer in selecting the best product for their needs, conveys the equity of a brand, and closes the sale. Superior products and superior packages drive market growth and prevent commoditization. With improved product and packaging, PG needs to advertise to communicate such benefits. As such, the company is setting a higher standard of excellence on advertising quality with a focus on brand performance claims that communicates a brand's benefits. In-store execution is another area where PG is setting a higher standard, growing product categories and its brands. For example, the company requires the right trade coverage, right product forms, sizes, and price points and the right in-store shelving and merchandising execution to deliver against key business drivers for each product category in every store across all channels. PG knows that when it executes the above strategies correctly, product category growth accelerates, overall growth accelerates and it is able to deliver trade-spending efficiencies that enable it to reinvest and improve store coverage in additional stores. In addition, the company recognizes that its online shopping experience also demands excellence in execution. For example, strong online execution includes video, strong performance claims, and strong value offerings so that consumers search for and purchase PG products. PG's e-commerce sales are increasing 30 percent in the current fiscal year, significantly outpacing off-line sales. The company's e-commerce sales are $3 billion, larger than its top three competitors combined. As such, the company is committed to winning in such fast-growing selling channel. With this said, the company's last element of superior execution is winning consumer and customer value equations. Price is one element of a winning consumer value equation, but PG is looking at the superior value of the total proposition of products that meets consumer needs in a noticeable and superior way with packages that are convenient to use with compelling communication. To fund PG's investments in the above initiatives, the company continues to improve upon on productivity.
 Given the needs for such investments, PG has plans to save up to another $10 billion from the current fiscal year through fiscal 2021. The company has identified $7 billion of additional cost of goods savings, which comes on top of the $7.3 billion of cost of goods savings it achieved over the previous five years. The largest opportunity within such new goal is about $4.5 billion is raw and packaging materials. Such savings will come from strategic prior partnerships, supplier consolidation and through a simplification of its product lineup and manufacturing platforms. For example, the company has innovated with respect to lower-cost packaging and new packaging for the e-commerce channel. The company is aiming for about $1.5 billion of savings and manufacturing expense. PG is also digitizing its manufacturing operations and automating with robotics. The company also sees an opportunity for an additional $1 billion of savings from transportation, warehousing and other costs of goods sold. Further, the company sees over $2 billion of savings in marketing spending. The company is also estimating it can achieve another $1 billion to $2 billion of additional overhead cost reduction. In total, PG has identified $12 billion to $13 billion of cost savings, but has risk-adjusted such amount down to $10 billion to account for uncertainty that exists. With the majority of PG's transformational efforts behind it, and we believe that the company will benefit from more focused brand spending, and, therefore, an improved ability to more effectively recognize and respond to changing consumer trends. While PG will continue to face competition along many of its product lines from branded and private-label products, the company supports its multiple billion-dollar iconic brands with its expertise of innovation, marketing and promotion to fend off and stand up to such competition. In addition, the company's research and development capabilities enable it to launch new products and to extend product lines so as to adapt to changing consumer tastes. While we recognize the adversities that PG faces, we also recognize that it is an iconic global consumer innovator, manufacturer and marketer of convenient, effective and value-added products that consumers want and trust. A company such as PG has too many levers to pull to achieve more consistent revenue/earnings growth in the intermediate and long term. The only question, then, for a potential PG investor is at what price they should consider buying PG's shares for a long-term hold, and we refer them to our price range noted below for the suggested buying range.
 Our View Every company can lose its way in their efforts to meet Wall Street and investor quarterly expectations. PG is no different than any other company in this respect. The company grew through acquisitions and new product introductions to a point where it became too unwieldy and the "law of large numbers" caught up with it. To PG's credit, it recognized its problems and retrenched towards its strongest most profitable core brands at great cost much to the chagrin of big investors searching for an easy fix. With the company on a course that we believe will drive more consistent revenue/earnings growth, we believe that a stock such as PG (a consumer product company) should serve as a more conservative income-producing cornerstone of any overall portfolio. As noted above, larger scale adversities adversely affecting the company include an environment of global economic uncertainty and a strong U.S. dollar. PG's transformational efforts to adjust its product portfolio have also adversely affected its near-term sales and profits. PG's additional multi-billion dollar cost reduction efforts also allow it to reinvest cost savings in product innovation and advertising, to drive revenue/earnings growth. With its product portfolio adjustment behind it, the company is engaged in several strategic moves: 1) enhancing product and package superiority; 2) emphasizing excellence of execution; 3) focusing on cost and cash productivity; and 4) ensuring organizational design, culture and accountability. (We recommend investors read the transcript from the consumer products conference mentioned above.) The current price-to-earnings ratio for PG is about 16.45, and the shares yield 3.10 percent. The company's forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 23.20 based on fiscal year 2017 earnings estimates of $3.85, and about 21.75 based on fiscal year 2018 earnings estimates of $4.11. We should note that estimates for each year remained relatively steady over the past three months. We believe investors with a long-term horizon should purchase shares in a price range of $76.00 to 80.15 (on a price-to-earnings ratio range of 18.50 to 19.50 based on fiscal 2018 earnings estimates) during the next overall market sell-off, and reinvest the dividend until the company's transformation begins to show improved results.
 As noted in the article's title, we trust in PG's ability turn its "ship" around given that it is a world class innovative product developer, marketer and seller of multiple iconic billion-dollar brands with few peers. We believe the company's strategy to revive revenue/earnings growth will reward shareholders for years to come with share price appreciation, improved dividend increases and share repurchases.

Odours that linger in our homes just before guests arrive, or a persistent stench that never leaves the car, not only adversely affect our mood, but also that of our guests. With this in mind, P&G experts have bottled the fragrance of freshness with the new Ambi Pur range for both homes and cars.

For example, you can add users to a project from within the project, but it doesn't always "take" and you have to go back to the main admin screen to add them.If something goes wrong with the program, it is a decent amount of work (possibly even blowing away the entire user account on the computer) in order to get it back in a working order again.
