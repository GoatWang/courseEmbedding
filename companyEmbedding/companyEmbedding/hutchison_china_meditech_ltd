Style Scores:



F Value | F Growth | A Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Commercial Platform

Chi-Med|  Commercial Platform



We have developed a profitable Commercial Platform, with the key element being our Prescription Drugs business which has a commercial network of approximately 2,200 medical sales representatives covering over 18,700 hospitals in 300 cities and towns in China.

We operate our Prescription Drugs business through our joint ventures Shanghai Hutchison Pharmaceuticals and Hutchison Sinopharm, in which we nominate management and run the day-to-day operations. The other element of our Commercial Platform is our Consumer Health business which focuses primarily on the manufacture, marketing and distribution of over-the-counter pharmaceutical products in China.
We intend to leverage this Commercial Platform, particularly our established Prescription Drugs business, to support the launch of products from our Innovation Platform if they are approved for use in China. Outside of China, we intend to commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States, Europe and other major markets on our own and/or through partnerships with leading biopharmaceutical companies.
 

A profitable & high growth platform to launch our new drug innovations.

 
For more information on recent developments, please refer to the Results Presentation and the 2016 Annual Report.

At an initial offering price of $13.50 per ADS, we estimate that the net
proceeds to us from our issuance and sale of 7,500,000 ADSs in this offering
will be approximately $87.8 million, after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us and
assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional
ADSs.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with the cash
generated by our operations and other cash resources, primarily to further
advance the clinical development of our multiple drug candidates. In particular,
we currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $41.0 million to accelerate and broaden clinical development of
  the drug candidates for which we retain all worldwide rights, specifically:

i. approximately $20.0 million to advance HMPL-523 through Phase I and into 
   proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in Australia, the United
   States and China, in rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and hematological cancer;

ii. approximately $12.0 million to advance sulfatinib toward NDA submission in
    China and through Phase I and into proof-of-concept studies, expected to be
    conducted in the United States, in neuroendocrine tumors, and through Phase
    II and into proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in China, in
    thyroid cancer;

iii. approximately $7.0 million to advance epitinib into a Phase III 
     registration in China and through Phase I and into proof-of-concept 
     studies, expected to be conducted in the United States, in non-small cell
     lung cancer with brain metastasis; and

iv. approximately $2.0 million to advance theliatinib through Phase I and into
    proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in China, in head and 
    neck cancer and esophageal cancer.

• approximately $27.0 million to support our share of the development costs of 
  our partnered clinical drug candidates, including:

i. approximately $12.0 million to advance savolitinib through NDA submission
   globally in papillary renal cell carcinoma and EGFR tyrosine kinase 
   inhibitor-refractory non-small cell lung cancer and through proof-of-concept
   studies in gastric cancer and VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-refractory 
   clear cell renal cell carcinoma;

ii. approximately $10.0 million to advance fruquintinib through NDA submission
    in colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung cancer in China and through 
    proof-of-concept in gastric cancer in China and to advance fruquintinib into
    proof-of-concept studies in non-small cell lung cancer and/or other solid 
    tumor indications in the United States either independently or in 
    partnership with Eli Lilly subject to the exercise of its global option; and

iii. approximately $5.0 million to advance either existing or new-formulations 
     of HMPL-004 into clinical development in mild-to-moderate ulcerative 
     colitis.

• approximately $11.0 million to progress pre-clinical drug candidates, 
  specifically:

i. approximately $4.0 million to advance HMPL-689 through Phase I and into 
   proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in Australia, the United
   States and China, in hematological cancer;

ii. approximately $4.0 million to advance HMPL-453 through Phase I and into 
    proof-of-concept studies, expected to be conducted in Australia, the United
    States and China, in bladder cancer; and

iii. approximately $3.0 million to advance other drug candidates through 
     pre-clinical studies and into Phase I clinical trials.

• approximately $5.0 million to build production facilities to produce both 
  clinical and commercial supply of our drug candidates.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which we could change in
our discretion in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Due to
the many variables inherent to the development of our drug candidates at this
time, such as the timing of patient enrollment and evolving regulatory 
requirements, we cannot currently predict the stage of development we expect to
achieve for our pre-clinical and clinical trial and drug candidates with the net
proceeds of this offering. We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds 
for working capital and other general corporate purposes, such as acquiring the
commercial rights to other drug products and expanding our research organization
and infrastructure. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the results of the 
pre-clinical and clinical trial of our drug candidates, our operating costs and
expenditures and the amount of cash generated by our operations. As a result, 
our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high-quality,
investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments.


Innovation Platform Competition

The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. While we
believe that our highly selective drug candidates, experienced development team
and chemistry-focused scientific approach provide us with competitive 
advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including
major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Any
drug candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with
existing drugs and/or new drugs that may become available in the future.

We compete in the segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other 
related markets that address inhibition of kinases in cancer and immunological
diseases. There are other companies working to develop targeted therapies in the
field of kinase inhibition for cancer and immunological diseases. These
companies include divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology
companies of various sizes. We also compete with pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies that develop and market monoclonal antibodies as
targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer and immunological diseases.

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have
substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and
significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug
candidates, obtaining regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization
of those products. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we
may be in obtaining approval for drugs and achieving widespread market
acceptance. Our competitors' drugs may be more effective, or more effectively
marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our drug
candidates obsolete or non-competitive before we can recover the expenses of
developing and commercializing any of our drug candidates. We anticipate that we
will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and
advanced technologies become available.

Below is a summary of existing therapies and therapies currently under 
development that may become available in the future which may compete with each
of our seven clinical-stage drug candidates.

Savolitinib

While there are currently no approved selective c-Met inhibitors on the market,
there are several c-Met inhibitors currently undergoing clinical trials for the
treatment of renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer
such as capmatinib (c-Met inhibitor in development for renal cell carcinoma and
non-small cell lung cancer), cabozantinib (VEGFR/c-Met/Ret inhibitor in 
development for renal cell carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer), tivantinib
(c-Met inhibitor in development for non-small cell lung cancer and renal cell 
carcinoma), tepotinib (c-Met inhibitor in development for non-small cell lung 
cancer), foretinib (VEGFR2/c-Met inhibitor in development for renal cell 
carcinoma), glesatinib (c-Met and Axl tyrosine kinase inhibitor in development
for non-small cell lung cancer) and AMG 337 (c-Met kinase inhibitor in 
development for stomach cancer). Xalkori (ALK and c-Met inhibitor marketed for 
non-small cell lung cancer) is a multi-kinase inhibitor that less selectively 
inhibits c-Met.

Fruquintinib

Approved VEGF inhibitors on the market for the treatment of colorectal cancer
include Avastin (anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody), Cyramza (anti-VEGFR2 monoclonal
antibody), Stivarga (VEGFR/TIE2 inhibitor) and Zaltrap (ziv-aflibercept) (VEGF 
inhibitor). Cyramza is approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer
and gastric cancer, and Avastin is also approved for non-small cell lung cancer.
In addition, Inlyta and Caprelsa (vandetanib) use a similar mechanism of action
as the VEGF inhibitors on the market and are currently being studied for the 
treatment of colorectal cancer. Other VEGFR inhibitors being developed for the
treatment of non-small cell lung cancer include anlotinib, apatinib, 
cabozantinib, lenvatinib, lucitanib, tesevatinib and vandetanib. VEGFR 
inhibitors being developed for the treatment of gastric cancer include 
dovitinib, telatinib and regorafenib. In China, apatinib has been approved for
the treatment of third-line gastric cancer.

Sulfatinib

Sutent (VEGFR inhibitor) and Afinitor (mTOR inhibitor) have been approved for 
the treatment of pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Lanreotide is a growth 
hormone release inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Both small molecules and
monoclonal antibodies are being developed for the treatment of neuroendocrine
tumors. Compounds undergoing development for neuroendocrine tumors include
Vargatef (nintedanib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), octreotide (growth hormone
and insulin-like growth factor-1 inhibitor, approved for neuroendocrine tumors),
milciclib (tyrosine kinase inhibitor) and Zybrestat (fosbretabulin, a
microtubule/tubulin inhibitor being studied for thyroid cancer). Cometriq
(cabozantinib, a c-Met/VEGFR2/Ret inhibitor) has been marketed for thyroid
cancer and is being studied for neuroendocrine tumors. In addition, bevacizumab
is an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody being studied for neuroendocrine tumors.

HMPL-523

There has been extensive research on oral small-molecule Syk inhibitors due to 
the major unmet medical need in inflammation and oncology. No small molecule
drug candidates targeting Syk specifically have been approved to date due to the
severe off-target toxicity as a result of poor kinase selectivity and possibly
poor pharmacokinetic properties. GS-9876 is a Syk inhibitor currently in
clinical studies for rheumatoid arthritis. Syk inhibitors currently in clinical
studies for hematological cancers include entospletinib, cerdulatinib and
TAK-659. In addition, Janus tyrosine kinase, or JAK, inhibitors such as
tofacitinib (JAK-3 inhibitor, marketed for rheumatoid arthritis and in
development for ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and myelofibrosis),
ruxolitinib (JAK-1/2 inhibitor, marketed for myelofibrosis and in development
for acute myelogenous leukemia), baricitinib (JAK-1/2 inhibitor in development
for rheumatoid arthritis), decernotinib (JAK-3 inhibitor in development for
rheumatoid arthritis) and filgotinib (JAK-1 inhibitor in development for
rheumatoid arthritis) and TNF† inhibitors marketed for rheumatoid arthritis,
such as Enbrel, Remicade, Humira and Cimzia, are also expected to be potential
competitors of HMPL-523 if it is approved.

However, most anti-TNF† monoclonal antibodies are applicable for severe disease
only as these injectables significantly suppress the entire immune system for a
substantial period of time.

Epitinib

Although no EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have been specifically approved for
non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis or primary brain tumor, many
have been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR 
activating mutations, including Gilotrif (EGFR/HER2 inhibitor), Iressa, Tarceva
and Conmana. Moreover, tesevatinib (EGFR/HER2/VEGFR kinase inhibitor) and 
AZD3759 (EFGR tyrosine kinase inhibitor) are in development for the treatment of
non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastasis while Alecensa (alectinib, an
ALK inhibitor) has already been approved.

Theliatinib

Approved EFGR inhibitors on the market include Iressa and Tarceva, although 
these drugs reach insufficient drug concentrations to suppress wild-type EGFR
effectively. In addition, monoclonal antibodies, such as Erbitux, which are
approved for the treatment of certain EGFR over-expression tumor types, are less
effective for EGFR gene amplified patients. Other small molecule therapies
currently being studied for the treatment of esophageal tumors include Gilotrif
and Conmana.

HMPL-689 (PI3K†)

Zydelig is a PI3K† inhibitor that has been approved for the treatment of
refractory/relapsed follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma as a
monotherapy and chronic lymphatic leukemia in combination with Rituxan. In
addition, several drug candidates that inhibit PI3K† are in clinical
development, including duvelisib, copanlisib, gedatolisib, INCB040093, GS-9901,
TGR-1202 and AMG 319.

HMPL-453 (FGFR)

To date, there are no approved therapies that specifically target the FGFR
signaling pathway. Several small molecule FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are in
early clinical trials for solid tumors, including AZD4547, BGJ398, BAY1163877,
BLU-554 and JNJ-42756493.

HMPL-004

The current standard of care for inflammatory bowel disease starts with 
mesalazine, while for the non-responding patients, various forms of
corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs and anti-tumor necrosis factor
agents are prescribed. Several anti-TNF† monoclonal antibody injectables, such
as Cimzia, Humira, Remicade and Simponi (golimumab) (abandoned in Phase I for
Crohn's disease), have been approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease. However, most anti-TNF† monoclonal antibodies are applicable
for severe disease only as these injectables significantly suppress the entire
immune system for a substantial period of time.

Commercial Platform Competition

Our Commercial Platform's Prescription Drugs business competes in the 
pharmaceutical industry in China, which is highly competitive and is
characterized by a number of established, large pharmaceutical companies, as
well as some smaller emerging pharmaceutical companies. The top 10 domestic
pharmaceutical manufacturers only accounted for 18.6% of total pharmaceutical
sales in 2015, according to Frost & Sullivan. Our Prescription Drugs business
faces competition from other pharmaceutical companies in China engaged in the
development, production, marketing or sales of prescription drugs, in particular
cardiovascular drugs. The barrier of entry for the PRC pharmaceutical industry
primarily relates to regulatory requirements in connection with the production
of pharmaceutical products and new product launches.

The identities of the key competitors with respect to our Prescription Drugs
business vary by product, and, in certain cases, different competitors that have
greater financial resources than us may elect to focus these resources on
developing, importing or in-licensing and marketing products in the PRC that are
substitutes for our products and may have broader sales and marketing
infrastructure with which to do so.

We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition, pricing,
sales network, promotion activities, product efficacy, safety and reliability.
We believe our continued success will depend on our Prescription Drugs 
business's capability to: maintain profitability of its core product, She Xiang
Bao Xin pills, successfully market and distribute in-licensed products such as
Seroquel and Concor, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, develop drug 
candidates with market potential, maintain an efficient operational model, apply
technologies to production lines, attract and retain talented personnel, 
maintain high quality standards, and effectively market and promote the products
sold by our Prescription Drugs business. Within the coronary heart disease 
market in China, in 2015 She Xiang Bao Xin pills had approximately 12.1% market
share, and market leadership in Shanghai with approximately 35.3% market share,
among oral Chinese patented drugs. Key competitors for She Xiang Bao Xin pills
include Tasly Holding (Compound Danshen Dropping Pill) and Shijiazhuang Yiling 
Pharmaceutical (Tong Xin Luo Capsule), according to Frost & Sullivan. In 
addition, our Prescription Drugs business's in-licensed drug Seroquel had 
approximately 47.0% market share of the Chinese market for schizophrenia and 
bipolar drugs in 2015, with key competitors including Hunan Dongting Pharma and
Suzhou First Pharma, according to Frost & Sullivan.

Our Commercial Platform's Consumer Health business competes in a highly 
fragmented market in Asia, particularly in our primary market in China. We
believe that our Consumer Health business competes primarily on the basis of
brand recognition, pricing, sales network, promotion activities, product safety
and reliability. We believe our continued success will depend on our Consumer
Health business's capability to: maintain profitability of its core products, Fu
Fang Dan Shen tablets and Banlangen granules, differentiate its products
vis-a-vis those of competitors, successfully market and distribute in-licensed
products such as Earth's Best infant formula, maintain an efficient operational
model, attract and retain talented personnel, maintain high quality standards,
and effectively market and promote the products sold by our Consumer Health
business. In China, Fu Fang Dan Shen tablets and Banlangen granules are generic
over-the-counter drugs marketed by several manufacturers. Hutchison Baiyunshan
is the market leader in these two particular sub-categories, with an estimated
market share of approximately 32.5% for Fu Fang Dan Shen tablets and 51.1% for
Banlangen granules in 2015, according to Frost & Sullivan. Key competitors
include Shanghai LeiYunShang Pharmaceutical, Yunnan Baiyao and Beijing
Tongrentang in the Fu Fang Dan Shen market, and include Beijing Tongrentang and
Guangzhou Xiangxue Pharmaceutical for the Banlangen market.


Company Description
We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company based in China aiming to
become a global leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of
targeted therapies for oncology and immunological diseases.

We have created a broad portfolio of drug candidates targeting eight molecular
targets.


 We have taken a chemistry-focused approach to develop highly selective
small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are intended to have potentially
global best-in-class efficacy and are deliberately engineered to improve drug 
exposure, reduce known class-related toxicities and allow different drug 
therapies to be combinable. Highlights of our pipeline include:

• seven clinical-stage drug candidates, five of which have already achieved 
  proof-of-concept (meaning positive outcome achieved in Phase Ib/II studies),
  with multiple potential global first-in-class or Breakthrough Therapy 
  opportunities, which means that such drug candidates could be eligible for 
  accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA,

• out of these seven drug candidates, four are wholly owned and three are 
  partnered with leading pharmaceutical companies, AstraZeneca AB (publ), or 
  AstraZeneca, Eli Lilly Trading (Shanghai) Company Limited, or Eli Lilly, and
  Nestlé Health Science S.A., or Nestlé Health Science,

• 20 active clinical trials in various countries, with a further five planned to
  start during the first quarter of 2016,

• three Phase III clinical trials currently enrolling, with a fourth expected to
  start during the first quarter of 2016, and

• subject to favorable clinical outcomes, savolitinib has the potential to be 
  submitted for new drug application, or NDA, approval in late 2016 in the 
  United States, and fruquintinib has the potential to be submitted for NDA
  approval in late 2016 or early 2017 in China.

We believe our current drug candidates, such as savolitinib (targeting c-Met) 
and HMPL-523 (targeting Syk), have the potential to be global first-in-class 
therapies, or, as in the cases of fruquintinib (targeting VEGFR1/2/3), 
sulfatinib (targeting VEGFR/FGFR1), epitinib (targeting EGFRm+ with brain 
metastasis) and HMPL-689 (targeting PI3K†), are sufficiently differentiated to
potentially be global best-in-class, next generation therapies with a superior 
profile compared to existing approved drugs that act against the relevant 
kinase targets. Kinases are a class of proteins and enzymes that function in 
many signaling pathways and have been shown to drive several key activities of
cancer cells, including growth, survival and angiogenesis. 
    
Innovation Platform—Our pipeline of drug candidates has been developed and
progressed by our in-house research and development division, known as our
Innovation Platform, which was launched in 2002. Since then, we have assembled a
leading drug research and development team of 290 scientists and staff based in
China, of which 183 have advanced technical degrees including 21 M.D.s and 48 
doctorate degrees as of January 31, 2016. This team has created a large scale 
and fully-integrated drug discovery and development operation covering 
chemistry, biology, pharmacology, toxicology, chemistry and manufacturing 
controls for clinical and commercial supply, clinical and regulatory and other 
functions, which work seamlessly together. We intend to continue to leverage 
this platform to produce investigational new drug, or IND, applications on drug
candidates with global potential.

Commercial Platform—Since 2001, we have also developed a profitable Commercial 
Platform, with the key element being our Prescription Drugs business which had a
commercial network of over 1,900 medical sales representatives covering over 16,
500 hospitals in 300 cities and towns in China as of January 31, 2016. We 
operate our Prescription Drugs business through our joint ventures Shanghai
Hutchison Pharmaceuticals and Hutchison Sinopharm, in which we nominate 
management and run the day-to-day operations. The second element of our 
Commercial Platform is our Consumer Health business which focuses primarily on 
the manufacture, marketing and distribution of over-the-counter pharmaceutical
products in China. Net income attributable to our company from the continuing
operations of our Commercial Platform grew by 25.5% from $18.2 million in 2013
to $22.8 million in 2014 and further grew by 10.1% to $25.2 million in 2015.

We intend to leverage this Commercial Platform, particularly our established
Prescription Drugs business, to support the launch of products from our
Innovation Platform if they are approved for use in China. Outside of China, we
intend to commercialize our products, if approved, in the United States, Europe
and other major markets on our own and/or through partnerships with leading
biopharmaceutical companies.

Our History—Our company was founded in 2000 by Hutchison Whampoa Limited, which
recently became a wholly owned subsidiary of CK Hutchison Holdings Limited, or
CK Hutchison, which is a Hong Kong-based, multinational conglomerate with 
operations in over 50 countries. CK Hutchison is the ultimate parent company of
Hutchison Healthcare Holdings Limited, which as of the date of this prospectus 
owns 64.9% of our total outstanding share capital. We have taken a multi-source
approach to fund our Innovation Platform, including through equity fundraising
such as our initial public offering on the AIM market of the London Stock 
Exchange in 2006, partnering certain of our drug candidates, utilizing cashflow
generated from our Commercial Platform and bank borrowings, some of which have
been guaranteed by Hutchison Whampoa Limited.

A substantial portion of our revenue is generated from our operations in China,
in particular from our Commercial Platform. Under China's existing foreign 
investment and foreign exchange laws and regulations, our PRC subsidiaries and
joint ventures are able to pay dividends without prior approval from the PRC
government by complying with certain procedural requirements. They are, however,
required to make payments to certain statutory funds and reserve accounts which
are not distributable as dividends. Other PRC regulations, including 
restrictions on foreign investment in specified industries, can also affect the
operations of our Commercial Platform and Innovation Platform if we invest or 
are deemed to invest in those specified industries.
