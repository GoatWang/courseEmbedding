THE TEAM
Meet our management crew.






 



In 1999, due to a gap in the market, VPG was founded on the idea that innovation combined with great customer service is key to creating the ultimate retail security company. Over the years, VPG’s founders and senior management team have led innovation and theft prevention strategies at various levels of business and corporate security.
With a growing team and client base, it is crucial that VPG has acquired creative leaders over the years to pave the way to corporate success, not only for our company but for our customers’.

You must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares through Vanguard Brokerage Services (we offer them commission-free) or through another broker (which may charge commissions). See the Vanguard Brokerage Services commission and fee schedules for limits. Vanguard ETF Shares are not redeemable directly with the issuing fund other than in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. ETFs are subject to market volatility. When buying or selling an ETF, you will pay or receive the current market price, which may be more or less than net asset value.

	All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
	Deferred variable annuities are long-term vehicles designed for retirement purposes and contain underlying investment portfolios that are subject to market fluctuation, investment risk, and possible loss of principal. If you take withdrawals from a variable annuity prior to age 59½, you may have to pay ordinary income tax plus a 10% federal penalty tax.
	Advice services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor, or by Vanguard National Trust Company, a federally chartered, limited-purpose trust company.

Investing
 




Account types
 








Open a joint account or an individual account
Saving for something other than retirement or college? You can set up an account with shared ownership or create one in your name alone.
Saving for a big event or your rainy day fund?



Take advantage of opportunities to grow that money until you need it.

Things you should know before you get started



Minimum investment amounts

 


You'll need $3,000 to buy most Vanguard mutual funds, though there are some with lower or higher minimums.*And you can invest in any ETF (exchange-traded fund) for the price of 1 share, which will vary throughout the day.
Find details in each fund's profile 
Other companies' funds may have different minimums, so be sure to check their prospectuses. And like ETFs, minimums for individual stocks, certificates of deposit (CDs), and bonds are based on their current market prices.



Taxes

 


Your investment earnings—the money your money makes—will likely be taxed at the federal, state, and sometimes local levels. The tax rate depends largely on your income and how long you hold the investment.You could shrink that tax bill by choosing tax-efficient investments.
Learn how to become a tax-savvy investor




Expectations for investment returns

 


Trying to find the fastest road to riches could put your hard-earned savings at risk just as quickly.Particularly when making a shorter-term investment—less than 7–10 years, for example—you'll want to choose the combination of bonds and stocks that strikes the right balance between risk and reward.



Other investment costs

 


Some investments have obvious costs—like trading commissions and service fees. But keep a keen eye on expense ratios too. While they don't show up on your statement as a debit, they can take a serious bite out of your savings.At Vanguard, you'll pay nothing to buy and sell our mutual funds and ETFs, our account service fees are easily avoidable,** and our expense ratios are 81% less than the industry average.† Put it all together, and you keep more of your money in your account, where it belongs.
See the difference low costs can make

Give your money a chance to grow



Investing in mutual funds offers benefits you won't get from trading individual stocks and bonds on your own.




Less risk through more diversification
One mutual fund can invest in hundreds—sometimes thousands—of individual securities at once. So if any one security does poorly, the others are there to help offset that risk.
 




Lower costs
With a no-load mutual fund, you pay one (hopefully low) expense ratio—instead of racking up the commissions you'd pay when buying and selling individual securities yourself.
See how low-cost, no-load mutual funds are just the start 

Get details on fees & minimums for Vanguard mutual funds 

 




Professional management
You don't have to keep track of every security your mutual fund owns. The fund is managed by experts who take care of that for you.
 




Convenience
You can buy and sell mutual fund shares online or by phone and set up automatic investments and withdrawals.
 

Consider your mutual fund options








Choosing which Vanguard mutual funds to invest in can be as simple as picking one fund to do the work of an entire portfolio or as customized as building your portfolio from a variety of fund options.

The Vanguard Group is an American investment management company based in Malvern, Pennsylvania with over $4 trillion in assets under management. It is the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.[3] In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services.
Founder and former chairman John C. Bogle is credited with the creation of the first index fund available to individual investors and has been a proponent of and a major enabler of low-cost investing by individuals.[4][5] Vanguard is structured as a mutual company; it is owned by funds managed by the company, and is therefore owned by its customers.[6][7] Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: investor shares and admiral shares. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment.[8]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
In 1951, for his undergraduate thesis at Princeton University, John C. Bogle conducted a study in which he found that most mutual funds did not earn any more money than if they invested in S&P 500 stock market index.[9] Even if the stocks in the funds beat the benchmark index, management fees reduced the returns to investors below the returns of the benchmark.[10]
Immediately after graduating from Princeton University in 1951, Bogle was hired by Wellington Management Company.[11] In 1966, he forged a merger with a fund management group based in Boston.[11] He became President in 1967 and CEO in 1970.[11] However, the merger ended badly and Bogle was therefore fired in 1974.[11] Bogle has said about being fired: "The great thing about that mistake, which was shameful and inexcusable and a reflection of immaturity and confidence beyond what the facts justified, was that I learned a lot. And if I had not been fired then, there would not have been a Vanguard."[12]
Bogle arranged to start a new fund division at Wellington. He named it Vanguard, after Horatio Nelson's flagship at the Battle of the Nile, the HMS Vanguard (1787).[13] Bogle chose this name after a dealer in antique prints left him a book about Great Britain’s naval achievements that featured the HMS Vanguard. Wellington executives initially resisted the name, but narrowly approved it after Bogle mentioned that Vanguard funds would be listed alphabetically next to Wellington funds.[4]
Growth of company[edit]
The Wellington executives prohibited the fund from engaging in advisory or fund management services. Bogle saw this as an opportunity to start a passive fund tied to the performance of the S&P 500.[4][5] Bogle was also inspired by Paul Samuelson, an economist who later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, who wrote in an August 1976 column in Newsweek that retail investors needed an opportunity to invest in stock market indexes such as the S&P 500.[14][15] Competitors, which marketed high-fee funds claiming to beat the market, resisted Vanguard's low cost index approach. Some competitors labeled it Bogle's folly, and some claimed it was un-American to simply try to match the performance of the stock market, rather than to try to beat it.[16][17]
In 1976, after getting approval from the board of directors of Wellington, Bogle established the First Index Investment Trust (now called the Vanguard 500 Index Fund).[18] It raised $11 million in its initial public offering, compared to expectations of raising $150 million.[19] The banks that managed the public offering suggested that Bogle cancel the fund due to the weak reception but Bogle refused.[4][5] At this time, Vanguard had only three employees: Bogle and two analysts. Asset growth in the first years was slow, partially because the fund did not pay commissions to brokers who sold it, which was unusual at the time. Within a year, the fund had only grown to $17 million in assets, but one of the Wellington Funds that Vanguard was administering had to be merged in with another fund, and Bogle convinced Wellington to merge it in with the Index fund.[4][5] This brought assets up to almost $100 million.
Growth in assets accelerated after the beginning of the bull market in 1982, and other mutual fund companies began to copy the indexing model. These copy funds were not successful since they typically charged high fees, which defeated the purpose of index funds. In December 1986, Vanguard launched its second mutual fund, a bond index fund called the Total Bond Fund, which was the first bond index fund ever offered to individual investors.[20] One earlier criticism of the First Index fund was that it was only an index of the S&P 500.[4][5] In December 1987, Vanguard launched its third fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, an index fund of the entire stock market, excluding the S&P 500.[21] Over the next five years, other funds were launched, including a small cap index fund, an international stock index fund, and a total stock market index fund. During the 1990s, more funds were offered, and several Vanguard funds, including the S&P 500 index fund and the total stock market fund, became among the largest funds in the world, and Vanguard became the largest mutual fund company in the world.[22] Noted investor John Neff retired as manager of Vanguard's Windsor Fund in 1995, after a 30 year career in which his fund beat returns of the S&P 500 index by an average of 300 basis points per year.[23]
Recent[edit]
Bogle retired from Vanguard as chairman in 1999 when he reached the company's mandatory retirement age of 70 and he was succeeded by John J. ("Jack") Brennan.[24] In February 2008, F. William McNabb III became President[25] and in August 2008, he became CEO.[26] Both of Bogle's successors expanded Vanguard's offerings beyond the index mutual funds that Bogle preferred, in particular into ETFs and actively-managed funds.[citation needed]
On May 16, 2017, it was reported that Vanguard had launched in the United Kingdom, and would begin "marketing its low-cost funds directly to retail clients." The press reported that UK rivals experienced drops in share value as a result, with an analyst quoted saying "Vanguard’s plan to shake up the UK investment market with online low-cost direct access to its funds could spark a game-changing price war that stings brokers and fund managers alike." At the time, Vanguard had $4.3 trillion of assets under management, and was the world’s second-largest fund company.[27]
In July 2017, Financial Times reported McNabb will be replaced as chief executive officer by chief investment officer Tim Buckley, effective January 1, 2018.[28]
Services[edit]
In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services. Several mutual funds managed by Vanguard are ranked at the top of the list of US mutual funds by assets under management.[citation needed] Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: investor shares and admiral shares. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment, between $10,000 and $100,000 per fund.[8]
Offices[edit]
Vanguard's corporate headquarters is in Malvern, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. It has satellite offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Scottsdale, Arizona. The company also has offices in Australia, Asia, and Europe.

The Vanguard Group is an American investment management company based in Malvern, Pennsylvania with over $4 trillion in assets under management. It is the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.[3] In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services.
Founder and former chairman John C. Bogle is credited with the creation of the first index fund available to individual investors and has been a proponent of and a major enabler of low-cost investing by individuals.[4][5] Vanguard is structured as a mutual company; it is owned by funds managed by the company, and is therefore owned by its customers.[6][7] Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: investor shares and admiral shares. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment.[8]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
In 1951, for his undergraduate thesis at Princeton University, John C. Bogle conducted a study in which he found that most mutual funds did not earn any more money than if they invested in S&P 500 stock market index.[9] Even if the stocks in the funds beat the benchmark index, management fees reduced the returns to investors below the returns of the benchmark.[10]
Immediately after graduating from Princeton University in 1951, Bogle was hired by Wellington Management Company.[11] In 1966, he forged a merger with a fund management group based in Boston.[11] He became President in 1967 and CEO in 1970.[11] However, the merger ended badly and Bogle was therefore fired in 1974.[11] Bogle has said about being fired: "The great thing about that mistake, which was shameful and inexcusable and a reflection of immaturity and confidence beyond what the facts justified, was that I learned a lot. And if I had not been fired then, there would not have been a Vanguard."[12]
Bogle arranged to start a new fund division at Wellington. He named it Vanguard, after Horatio Nelson's flagship at the Battle of the Nile, the HMS Vanguard (1787).[13] Bogle chose this name after a dealer in antique prints left him a book about Great Britain’s naval achievements that featured the HMS Vanguard. Wellington executives initially resisted the name, but narrowly approved it after Bogle mentioned that Vanguard funds would be listed alphabetically next to Wellington funds.[4]
Growth of company[edit]
The Wellington executives prohibited the fund from engaging in advisory or fund management services. Bogle saw this as an opportunity to start a passive fund tied to the performance of the S&P 500.[4][5] Bogle was also inspired by Paul Samuelson, an economist who later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, who wrote in an August 1976 column in Newsweek that retail investors needed an opportunity to invest in stock market indexes such as the S&P 500.[14][15] Competitors, which marketed high-fee funds claiming to beat the market, resisted Vanguard's low cost index approach. Some competitors labeled it Bogle's folly, and some claimed it was un-American to simply try to match the performance of the stock market, rather than to try to beat it.[16][17]
In 1976, after getting approval from the board of directors of Wellington, Bogle established the First Index Investment Trust (now called the Vanguard 500 Index Fund).[18] It raised $11 million in its initial public offering, compared to expectations of raising $150 million.[19] The banks that managed the public offering suggested that Bogle cancel the fund due to the weak reception but Bogle refused.[4][5] At this time, Vanguard had only three employees: Bogle and two analysts. Asset growth in the first years was slow, partially because the fund did not pay commissions to brokers who sold it, which was unusual at the time. Within a year, the fund had only grown to $17 million in assets, but one of the Wellington Funds that Vanguard was administering had to be merged in with another fund, and Bogle convinced Wellington to merge it in with the Index fund.[4][5] This brought assets up to almost $100 million.
Growth in assets accelerated after the beginning of the bull market in 1982, and other mutual fund companies began to copy the indexing model. These copy funds were not successful since they typically charged high fees, which defeated the purpose of index funds. In December 1986, Vanguard launched its second mutual fund, a bond index fund called the Total Bond Fund, which was the first bond index fund ever offered to individual investors.[20] One earlier criticism of the First Index fund was that it was only an index of the S&P 500.[4][5] In December 1987, Vanguard launched its third fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, an index fund of the entire stock market, excluding the S&P 500.[21] Over the next five years, other funds were launched, including a small cap index fund, an international stock index fund, and a total stock market index fund. During the 1990s, more funds were offered, and several Vanguard funds, including the S&P 500 index fund and the total stock market fund, became among the largest funds in the world, and Vanguard became the largest mutual fund company in the world.[22] Noted investor John Neff retired as manager of Vanguard's Windsor Fund in 1995, after a 30 year career in which his fund beat returns of the S&P 500 index by an average of 300 basis points per year.[23]
Recent[edit]
Bogle retired from Vanguard as chairman in 1999 when he reached the company's mandatory retirement age of 70 and he was succeeded by John J. ("Jack") Brennan.[24] In February 2008, F. William McNabb III became President[25] and in August 2008, he became CEO.[26] Both of Bogle's successors expanded Vanguard's offerings beyond the index mutual funds that Bogle preferred, in particular into ETFs and actively-managed funds.[citation needed]
On May 16, 2017, it was reported that Vanguard had launched in the United Kingdom, and would begin "marketing its low-cost funds directly to retail clients." The press reported that UK rivals experienced drops in share value as a result, with an analyst quoted saying "Vanguard’s plan to shake up the UK investment market with online low-cost direct access to its funds could spark a game-changing price war that stings brokers and fund managers alike." At the time, Vanguard had $4.3 trillion of assets under management, and was the world’s second-largest fund company.[27]
In July 2017, Financial Times reported McNabb will be replaced as chief executive officer by chief investment officer Tim Buckley, effective January 1, 2018.[28]
Services[edit]
In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services. Several mutual funds managed by Vanguard are ranked at the top of the list of US mutual funds by assets under management.[citation needed] Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: investor shares and admiral shares. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment, between $10,000 and $100,000 per fund.[8]
Offices[edit]
Vanguard's corporate headquarters is in Malvern, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. It has satellite offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Scottsdale, Arizona. The company also has offices in Australia, Asia, and Europe.

At the time, Vanguard had $4.3 trillion of assets under management, and was the world’s second-largest fund company.[27]
In July 2017, Financial Times reported McNabb will be replaced as chief executive officer by chief investment officer Tim Buckley, effective January 1, 2018.[28]
Services[edit]
In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services. Several mutual funds managed by Vanguard are ranked at the top of the list of US mutual funds by assets under management.[citation needed] Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: investor shares and admiral shares. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment, between $10,000 and $100,000 per fund.[8]
Offices[edit]
Vanguard's corporate headquarters is in Malvern, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. It has satellite offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Scottsdale, Arizona. The company also has offices in Australia, Asia, and Europe.

The Vanguard Group is an American investment management company based in Malvern, Pennsylvania with over $4 trillion in assets under management. It is the largest provider of mutual funds and the second-largest provider of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the world after BlackRock's iShares.[3] In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services.
Founder and former chairman John C. Bogle is credited with the creation of the first index fund available to individual investors and has been a proponent of and a major enabler of low-cost investing by individuals.[4][5] Vanguard is structured as a mutual company; it is owned by funds managed by the company, and is therefore owned by its customers.[6][7] Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: investor shares and admiral shares. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment.[8]

History[edit]
Formation[edit]
In 1951, for his undergraduate thesis at Princeton University, John C. Bogle conducted a study in which he found that most mutual funds did not earn any more money than if they invested in S&P 500 stock market index.[9] Even if the stocks in the funds beat the benchmark index, management fees reduced the returns to investors below the returns of the benchmark.[10]
Immediately after graduating from Princeton University in 1951, Bogle was hired by Wellington Management Company.[11] In 1966, he forged a merger with a fund management group based in Boston.[11] He became President in 1967 and CEO in 1970.[11] However, the merger ended badly and Bogle was therefore fired in 1974.[11] Bogle has said about being fired: "The great thing about that mistake, which was shameful and inexcusable and a reflection of immaturity and confidence beyond what the facts justified, was that I learned a lot. And if I had not been fired then, there would not have been a Vanguard."[12]
Bogle arranged to start a new fund division at Wellington. He named it Vanguard, after Horatio Nelson's flagship at the Battle of the Nile, the HMS Vanguard (1787).[13] Bogle chose this name after a dealer in antique prints left him a book about Great Britain’s naval achievements that featured the HMS Vanguard. Wellington executives initially resisted the name, but narrowly approved it after Bogle mentioned that Vanguard funds would be listed alphabetically next to Wellington funds.[4]
Growth of company[edit]
The Wellington executives prohibited the fund from engaging in advisory or fund management services. Bogle saw this as an opportunity to start a passive fund tied to the performance of the S&P 500.[4][5] Bogle was also inspired by Paul Samuelson, an economist who later won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, who wrote in an August 1976 column in Newsweek that retail investors needed an opportunity to invest in stock market indexes such as the S&P 500.[14][15] Competitors, which marketed high-fee funds claiming to beat the market, resisted Vanguard's low cost index approach. Some competitors labeled it Bogle's folly, and some claimed it was un-American to simply try to match the performance of the stock market, rather than to try to beat it.[16][17]
In 1976, after getting approval from the board of directors of Wellington, Bogle established the First Index Investment Trust (now called the Vanguard 500 Index Fund).[18] It raised $11 million in its initial public offering, compared to expectations of raising $150 million.[19] The banks that managed the public offering suggested that Bogle cancel the fund due to the weak reception but Bogle refused.[4][5] At this time, Vanguard had only three employees: Bogle and two analysts. Asset growth in the first years was slow, partially because the fund did not pay commissions to brokers who sold it, which was unusual at the time. Within a year, the fund had only grown to $17 million in assets, but one of the Wellington Funds that Vanguard was administering had to be merged in with another fund, and Bogle convinced Wellington to merge it in with the Index fund.[4][5] This brought assets up to almost $100 million.
Growth in assets accelerated after the beginning of the bull market in 1982, and other mutual fund companies began to copy the indexing model. These copy funds were not successful since they typically charged high fees, which defeated the purpose of index funds. In December 1986, Vanguard launched its second mutual fund, a bond index fund called the Total Bond Fund, which was the first bond index fund ever offered to individual investors.[20] One earlier criticism of the First Index fund was that it was only an index of the S&P 500.[4][5] In December 1987, Vanguard launched its third fund, the Vanguard Extended Market Index Fund, an index fund of the entire stock market, excluding the S&P 500.[21] Over the next five years, other funds were launched, including a small cap index fund, an international stock index fund, and a total stock market index fund. During the 1990s, more funds were offered, and several Vanguard funds, including the S&P 500 index fund and the total stock market fund, became among the largest funds in the world, and Vanguard became the largest mutual fund company in the world.[22] Noted investor John Neff retired as manager of Vanguard's Windsor Fund in 1995, after a 30 year career in which his fund beat returns of the S&P 500 index by an average of 300 basis points per year.[23]
Recent[edit]
Bogle retired from Vanguard as chairman in 1999 when he reached the company's mandatory retirement age of 70 and he was succeeded by John J. ("Jack") Brennan.[24] In February 2008, F. William McNabb III became President[25] and in August 2008, he became CEO.[26] Both of Bogle's successors expanded Vanguard's offerings beyond the index mutual funds that Bogle preferred, in particular into ETFs and actively-managed funds.[citation needed]
On May 16, 2017, it was reported that Vanguard had launched in the United Kingdom, and would begin "marketing its low-cost funds directly to retail clients." The press reported that UK rivals experienced drops in share value as a result, with an analyst quoted saying "Vanguard’s plan to shake up the UK investment market with online low-cost direct access to its funds could spark a game-changing price war that stings brokers and fund managers alike." At the time, Vanguard had $4.3 trillion of assets under management, and was the world’s second-largest fund company.[27]
In July 2017, Financial Times reported McNabb will be replaced as chief executive officer by chief investment officer Tim Buckley, effective January 1, 2018.[28]
Services[edit]
In addition to mutual funds and ETFs, Vanguard offers brokerage services, variable and fixed annuities, educational account services, financial planning, asset management, and trust services. Several mutual funds managed by Vanguard are ranked at the top of the list of US mutual funds by assets under management.[citation needed] Vanguard offers two classes of most of its funds: investor shares and admiral shares. Admiral shares have slightly lower expense ratios but require a higher minimum investment, between $10,000 and $100,000 per fund.[8]
Offices[edit]
Vanguard's corporate headquarters is in Malvern, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia. It has satellite offices in Charlotte, North Carolina and Scottsdale, Arizona. The company also has offices in Australia, Asia, and Europe.
