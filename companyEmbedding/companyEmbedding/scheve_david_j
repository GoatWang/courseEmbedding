Item 5.02. Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors;

           Appointment of Certain Officers; Compensatory Arrangements of Certain
           Officers.



David J. Scheve became the Controller and Chief Accounting Officer of Valvoline
Inc. (the "Company") effective as of October 10, 2016. Mr. Scheve, age 41,
joined the Company from Southern Graphic Systems, a supplier of design-to-print
brand development products and services, where he started in June 2007 as its
Global Corporate Controller and was most recently its Chief Financial Officer
and Vice President of Finance, responsible for, among other things, overseeing
all finance and accounting staff globally.
In connection with his appointment, Mr. Scheve and the Company entered into a
letter agreement (the "Letter Agreement") describing certain terms of Mr.
Scheve's employment, including his base salary, signing bonus, new hire equity
grant, target annual performance bonus opportunity and long-term incentive
award, all as further described below.
Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, Mr. Scheve will receive an annual salary of
$250,000, a one-time signing bonus of $10,000 and a new hire equity grant of
1,500 Ashland Global Holdings Inc. ("Ashland") restricted stock units, which
vests 25% and 75% on the second and third anniversaries of the grant date,
respectively. Mr. Scheve will also be eligible to participate in Ashland's
Incentive Compensation ("IC") Plan and Long-Term Incentive Plan. Within the
terms of the IC Plan, Mr. Scheve will have an opportunity to earn an annual
incentive award for fiscal year 2017 with a target value equal to 40% of his
annual base salary. Mr. Scheve also will be eligible for an annual long-term
incentive award under the Long-Term Incentive Plan in the form of equity awards
with an aggregate target value of 40% of the market reference point for his
salary band. The Ashland equity received by Mr. Scheve pursuant to his new hire
grant and incentive awards will convert to units, shares and rights, as
applicable, of the Company upon the completion of a spin-off or other
disposition by Ashland of its remaining shares of Company common stock.
Forward-Looking Statements
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section
27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company has identified some of these
forward-looking statements with words such as "anticipates," "believes,"
"expects," "estimates," "is likely," "predicts," "projects," "forecasts,"
"objectives," "may," "will," "should," "plans" and "intends" and the negative of
these words or other comparable terminology. These forward-looking statements
include statements relating to Ashland's spin-off or other disposition of
Company stock. In addition, the Company may from time to time make
forward-looking statements in its annual reports, quarterly reports and other
filings with the SEC, news releases and other written and oral communications.
These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's expectations and
assumptions, as of the date such statements are made, regarding the Company's
future operating performance and financial condition, the separation of
Ashland's specialty chemicals business and Valvoline business (the
"separation"), the expected timetable for completing the separation and the
Company's strategic and competitive advantages and future opportunities, as well
as the economy and other future events or circumstances. These expectations and
assumptions include, without limitation, internal forecasts and analyses of
current and future market conditions and trends, management plans and
strategies, operating efficiencies and economic conditions (such as prices,
supply and demand, cost of raw materials, and the ability to recover
raw-material cost increases through price increases), and risks and
uncertainties associated with the following: the Company's substantial
indebtedness (including the possibility that such indebtedness and related
restrictive covenants may adversely affect its future cash flows, results of
operations, financial condition and its ability to repay debt) and other
liabilities; the strength of the Company's reputation and brand; demand for the
Company's products and services; sales growth in emerging markets; the prices
and margins of the Company's products and services; the Company's ability to
develop and successfully market new products and implement its digital
platforms; the Company's ability to retain its largest customers; potential
product liability claims; achievement of the expected benefits of the Company's
initial public offering or the separation; operating as a standalone public
company; the Company's ongoing relationship with Ashland; failure,
                                       2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
caused by the Company, of Ashland's proposed spin-off of the Company to qualify
for tax-free treatment, which may result in significant tax liabilities to
Ashland for which the Company may be required to indemnify Ashland; and the
impact of acquisitions and/or divestitures the Company has made or may make
(including the possibility that it may not realize the anticipated benefits from
such transactions). Various risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to
differ materially from those stated, projected or implied by any forward-looking
statements, including, without limitation, risks and uncertainties affecting the
Company that are described in the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1,
as amended from time to time, under the caption "Risk Factors," filed with the
SEC and available on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov. The Company
believes its expectations and assumptions are reasonable, but there can be no
assurance that the expectations reflected herein will be achieved. Unless
legally required, the Company undertakes no obligation to update any
forward-looking statements made in this Form 8-K whether as a result of new
information, future event or otherwise. Information on the Company's website is
not incorporated into or a part of this Form 8-K.
Non-solicitation
This Form 8-K shall not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an
offer to buy, any security. No offer, solicitation, or sale will be made in any
jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful.
                                       3
