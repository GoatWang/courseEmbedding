Operations

Executive Summary

American Energy Group, Ltd.’s portfolio comprises interests in a Pakistan producing property and the potential for additional producing interests in two (2) other Pakistan concessions, all of which are non-expense bearing interests, providing a combination of early cash flow and longer term value creation opportunities.

The Company’s core assets consist of the following royalties and  convertible working interests in oil and gas leases:
 

18% royalty in the producing Yasin Block No. 2768-7, Zone III, Sindh Province, Pakistan;
 

2.5% convertible working interest in Zamzama North Block No. 2667-8 under exploration, Zone III, Sindh Province, Pakistan;
 

2.5% convertible working interest in Sanjawi Block No. 3068-2 under exploration, Zone II, Baluchistan Province, Pakistan.


 

The convertible working interest in the Zamzama North Block No. 2667-8 is “carried” (i.e. free of exploration and development costs) as to the initial three wells and the convertible working interest in the Sanjawi Block No. 3068-2 is carried as to the initial two wells.  Additionally, in both the Zamzama North and Sanjawi Blocks, the Company has the option to convert its 2.5% working interest at any time, on a well by well basis, to a 1.5% royalty, free of the costs of exploration and development of theparticular well as to which conversion is elected.


This is an arguably safer alternative to investing in high risk exploration wells.  The Company’s approach provides investors with a lower risk participation in underexplored oil and gas markets in South Asia, with a higher transparency and corporate governance, better liquidity and easier accessibility at a discount valuation.


In addition to its emerging markets core assets, the Company also holds a 3% royalty interest in certain Galveston County, Texas oil and gas leases in the deep zones greater than 10,000 feet, together with a right to operate the leases as to wells drilled to depths greater than 10,000 feet. These leases are held in force by third party production and, therefore, the leases do not require development of these rights by a certain date. This property is not a focus of American Energy Group, and management is exploring the various opportunities to realize value from these deep rights, including potential sale.

The Company is continuously exploring new investment opportunities to further diversify its portfolio of energy resources royalty assets across the South Asia region.

-- 2.5 % carried working interest**in Zamzama North Block No.
2667-8 (557,951 square acres) under exploration, in

convert its 2.5% carried working interests at any time, on a well by
well basis to a 1.5% royalty, free of the costs of
exploration and development of the leases.
