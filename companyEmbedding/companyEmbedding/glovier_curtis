      who until recently served as a Managing Director at Fortress Investment 
      Group, LLC and has served as a director of Opus Bank since the launch of 
      Opus on September 30, 2010, has agreed to join Opus and will be

      PENSCO Trust Company (“PENSCO”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Opus; 
      Senior Executive Vice President, Head of Wealth Services, of Opus; and 
      Senior Managing Director in the Merchant Banking division. Mr. Glovier

      management representative instead of as a board representative of 
      Fortress Investment Group LLC. Opus’ board membership will remain at 
      nine.
    


      Stephen H. Gordon, Founding Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and 
      President of Opus Bank stated, “We are proud to have Curtis take on the 
      leadership of both Opus’ Wealth Services division and our leading 
      alternative asset IRA custodian, PENSCO Trust Company. The depth and 
      breadth of Curtis’ knowledge and expertise has been a tremendous 
      resource throughout his service on Opus’ board of directors since Opus’ 
      recapitalization and launch in September 2010. Having worked closely 
      together for nearly six years, I’m certain that Curtis will achieve 
      continued success as he leads and grows the highly-talented PENSCO 
      team.” Gordon concluded, “Additionally, given Curtis’ decades of success 
      as a private equity and mezzanine investor, as an investment banker, and 
      as an owner and director of numerous companies in a variety of sectors, 
      we look forward to Curtis’ contributions as we expand Opus and its 
      Merchant Banking activities.”
    

      From May 2007 to July 2016, Mr. Glovier served as a Managing Director at 
      Fortress Investment Group LLC, responsible for the origination, 
      execution, and monitoring of private equity, mezzanine, and other

      including the Fortress Credit Opportunities Funds, which invest in 
      mortgage-backed securities, loans, and other credit-related 
      opportunities. From May 2000 to May 2007, Mr. Glovier served as a 
      Managing Director and Co-Head of the Middle Market Buyout group at 
      Perseus, LLC. From June 1995 to May 2000, he served as a Managing 
      Director of Nassau Capital, which managed over $2 billion on behalf of 
      Princeton University. Earlier in his career, Mr. Glovier worked at 
      Goldman, Sachs & Co. in the Mergers & Acquisitions, Structured Finance 
      and Leveraged Buyout groups, and was also a management consultant at The 
      Boston Consulting Group. He has served as a director of companies in the 
      financial services, business services, branded consumer products, 
      intellectual property, pharmaceutical, alternative energy, 
      communications, and manufacturing areas, and as Chairman of the Board of

Having worked closely together for nearly six years, I’m certain that Curtis will achieve continued success as he leads and grows the highly-talented PENSCO team.” Gordon concluded, “Additionally, given Curtis’ decades of success as a private equity and mezzanine investor, as an investment banker, and as an owner and director of numerous companies in a variety of sectors, we look forward to Curtis’ contributions as we expand Opus and its Merchant Banking activities.”
From May 2007 to July 2016, Mr. Glovier served as a Managing Director at Fortress Investment Group LLC, responsible for the origination, execution, and monitoring of private equity, mezzanine, and other investments within Fortress’s credit business. Mr. Glovier also served on the investment committee of a number of Fortress investment funds, including the Fortress Credit Opportunities Funds, which invest in mortgage-backed securities, loans, and other credit-related opportunities.
