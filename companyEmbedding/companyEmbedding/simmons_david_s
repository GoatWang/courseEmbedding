Chairman and CEO, PPD

David Simmons joined PPD in June 2012 to serve as chairman and chief executive officer. In this role, he establishes and supports the strategic direction of PPD and leads its global workforce of more than 19,000 employees in the design, implementation and execution of drug development programs on behalf of its biopharmaceutical clients.
A proven leader, Simmons came to PPD following 15 years with Pfizer Inc. In his most recent position, he was president and general manager of the emerging markets and established products business units. His duties also included responsibility for the company’s biosimilar development program. 
Previously, Simmons served as regional president for Pfizer’s Eastern Europe pharmaceutical division; president of its pharmaceutical division in Greece; and vice president of marketing in Canada. In his early years at Pfizer, he held director-level roles in information technology. Simmons began his career as a software engineer in the steel industry, where he advanced his career to management positions before transitioning to pharmaceuticals. 
He earned a bachelor’s degree in applied mathematics and industrial management from Carnegie-Mellon University.
