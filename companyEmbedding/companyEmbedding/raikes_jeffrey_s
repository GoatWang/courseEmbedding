Early life[edit]
Raikes grew up in Ashland, Nebraska, graduating from Ashland-Greenwood High School in 1976. Raikes prepared to work for the US Department of Agriculture on agricultural policy while earning his Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering-Economics Systems (EES) from Stanford University.[4] It was while at Stanford that Raikes had his first exposure to computing, learning Pascal on a DEC System 20. The first computer he bought was an Apple II, which he used to help his brother, Ron Raikes, manage the family farm.
Career[edit]
He joined Apple Computer as the VisiCalc Engineering Manager in 1980. He worked at Apple for 15 months before being recruited to Microsoft by Steve Ballmer in 1981 as a product manager. He was promoted to director of Applications Marketing in 1984, and was the chief strategist behind Microsoft's investments in graphical applications for the Apple Macintosh and the Microsoft Windows operating system. In this role, he drove the product strategy and design of Microsoft Office. Raikes was promoted to vice president of Office Systems, where he was responsible for development and marketing of word processing, workgroup applications and pen computing.[2]
He later held roles managing North American operations, and worldwide sales, marketing, and services. In 2000, he was appointed to lead Productivity and Business Services, which later became the Information Worker business at Microsoft. He was named a company president in 2005.
Philanthropy[edit]
Raikes has a wide range of philanthropic interests. He and his wife are co-founders of the Raikes Foundation. He is a trustee at the University of Nebraska Foundation, funded a professorship in agronomy, and was a designer of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management. He has been active in United Way for several years. In 2006-2007, he co-chaired the annual campaign of United Way of King County with his wife, setting a national record for funds raised. On 2008-05-12 it was announced that Raikes would replace Patty Stonesifer as the CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation;[5] he stepped down in 2014.[6]
He is a major donor to the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE) at Stanford University where he also established the Jeff and Tricia Raikes Undergraduate Scholarship Fund to ensure that students admitted to Stanford from rural and inner-city schools have an opportunity to attend the university.He was chosen as a trustee of Stanford University in 2012 and in 2017 was elected chair.[4][6]
In 1992 the Pacific Northwest was in danger of losing the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball franchise. Raikes joined with other local business leaders to purchase the team, keeping them “safe at home” for the enjoyment of Northwest baseball fans.[7]
In June, 2008, Raikes donated approximately $10 million to the University of Nebraska's JD Edwards Honors Program, which officially changed its name to the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management shortly thereafter.
Personal life[edit]
Raikes and his wife, Tricia Raikes née McGinnis, have three children; Michaela, Connor, and Gillian.

Early life[edit]
Raikes grew up in Ashland, Nebraska, graduating from Ashland-Greenwood High School in 1976. Raikes prepared to work for the US Department of Agriculture on agricultural policy while earning his Bachelor of Science degree in Engineering-Economics Systems (EES) from Stanford University.[4] It was while at Stanford that Raikes had his first exposure to computing, learning Pascal on a DEC System 20. The first computer he bought was an Apple II, which he used to help his brother, Ron Raikes, manage the family farm.
Career[edit]
He joined Apple Computer as the VisiCalc Engineering Manager in 1980. He worked at Apple for 15 months before being recruited to Microsoft by Steve Ballmer in 1981 as a product manager. He was promoted to director of Applications Marketing in 1984, and was the chief strategist behind Microsoft's investments in graphical applications for the Apple Macintosh and the Microsoft Windows operating system. In this role, he drove the product strategy and design of Microsoft Office. Raikes was promoted to vice president of Office Systems, where he was responsible for development and marketing of word processing, workgroup applications and pen computing.[2]
He later held roles managing North American operations, and worldwide sales, marketing, and services. In 2000, he was appointed to lead Productivity and Business Services, which later became the Information Worker business at Microsoft. He was named a company president in 2005.
Philanthropy[edit]
Raikes has a wide range of philanthropic interests. He and his wife are co-founders of the Raikes Foundation. He is a trustee at the University of Nebraska Foundation, funded a professorship in agronomy, and was a designer of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management. He has been active in United Way for several years. In 2006-2007, he co-chaired the annual campaign of United Way of King County with his wife, setting a national record for funds raised. On 2008-05-12 it was announced that Raikes would replace Patty Stonesifer as the CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation;[5] he stepped down in 2014.[6]
He is a major donor to the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE) at Stanford University where he also established the Jeff and Tricia Raikes Undergraduate Scholarship Fund to ensure that students admitted to Stanford from rural and inner-city schools have an opportunity to attend the university.He was chosen as a trustee of Stanford University in 2012 and in 2017 was elected chair.[4][6]
In 1992 the Pacific Northwest was in danger of losing the Seattle Mariners Major League Baseball franchise. Raikes joined with other local business leaders to purchase the team, keeping them “safe at home” for the enjoyment of Northwest baseball fans.[7]
In June, 2008, Raikes donated approximately $10 million to the University of Nebraska's JD Edwards Honors Program, which officially changed its name to the Jeffrey S. Raikes School of Computer Science and Management shortly thereafter.

The Process 














design studio process

                        insanely smart students working in teams to build insanely great software products
                    







Solution-Oriented Development

            In Design Studio, we integrate agile engineering processes, lean business development, and interdisciplinary design thinking into an iterative process for problem solving and product development. Our iterative development methodologies lead to the development of robust software products that address real problems and provide elegant, human-centered, solutions. Throughout the process, Design Studio teams are mentored by industry professionals from the community, helping teams more effectively communicate, overcome technical challenges, and drive innovation for their partners.
        

            Our process allows us to work with a range of technologies and platforms; in Design Studio it is always about solving the problem and never about using a preferred technology. By focusing on solution-oriented development, our teams are able leverage any technology necessary to provide the right solution for a problem. Design Studio teams have completed projects and are comfortable using:
        

Microsoft .NET (C#, ASP.NET MVC, Entity Framework, and Web API)
Java EE (Glassfish, JAX-RS, JPA/Hibernate, Java Server Faces, and Enterprise Java Beans)
Native mobile development frameworks (iOS, Android, Windows Phone)
Open Web technologies (JQuery, Twitter Boostrap, Backbone, Knockout, Angular, HTML5)
Databases technologies (MySQL, MongoDB, SQL Server)
Cloud platforms (Windows Azure, Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Parse)
Scripting technologies (Python, Ruby on Rails, Node.js)
Various development tools and reporting frameworks









Coordinated Release Schedule


                    Teams in Design Studio focus development efforts around a release schedule that is coordinated across each of the teams; everyone in Design Studio is working towards common and measurable goals and sharing success. During the 2-semester Design Studio project year, teams will delivery results of their work to project sponsors 6 times. By working towards milestones that are aligned with release points, teams are focused on prioritization based on demonstrable progress that is user and not technology focused. At each release point, sponsors have something that they can get in front of stakeholders to actually use, resulting in valuable feedback that the teams can incorporate into subsequent releases.
                



Agile Teams


                    In Design Studio, student teams self select. During the summer, faculty assign a team Product Manager and Development Manager who work with the project sponsor to develop a scope of work. In the first week of September, the team leads will select their team members in a draft-style team selection process; creating buy-in across the entire team. Teams will then begin development sprints leading to 3 product releases each semester; in early October, early November, mid December, early February, mid March, and late April. Final hand off of the product will take place after a +1 iteration in early May. Between releases teams work in 2 week sprints and meet weekly with project stakeholders to make sure that the right people are involved and that there is full transparency to the process. The two the three sprint release-cycle helps to ensure that students are focused, stakeholders are involved, and projects remain on track.
                










            Here’s the bottom line. Software is the magic that’s going to change the world. It’s going to change every single industry. It’s the giant lever. Software is the biggest extension of human thought ever. If you think in terms of improving the productivity and enhancing the equality of life of humans on the planet... software is the biggest extension of human capability ever over anything else.
            
                Doug Burgum Chairman of the Kilbourne Group
