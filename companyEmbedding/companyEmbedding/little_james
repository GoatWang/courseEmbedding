        Robert Parker's Wine Advocate
    


        The non-vintage Little James Basket Press vin de table is a solera system that Louis Barruol has put together over the last 13 years. A pure Grenache, it comes across as a chunky, beefy, bistro-styled red that offers plenty of up-front appeal in a direct, exuberant manner. Enjoy it over the next year.
        
(10/2012)    


        Stephen Tanzer's International Wine Cellar
    


        (all grenache, made from a solera that was started in 1999; 50% of the blend is from the most recent vintage, in this case 2010):  Bright purple.  Precise, aromatic nose of cassis, cherry and lavender.  Tightly wound on the palate, with a firm mineral spine giving clarity and lift to the dark berry and bitter cherry flavors.  Finishes with gentle tannins and good focus.  Quite grown-up for an entry-level wine; I've been seeing quite a bit of this wine in restaurants around the country lately.
        
(5/2012)    

                                K&L Notes
                            

                            Notes from winemaker Louis Barruol: "Little James is at Saint Cosme the wine of freedom. Our Solera is getting more and more complexity year after year. When we add the current vintage, the solera gains a new element without changing the style.This wine recalls the ancient times when the wine merchants would make wines having only one target: simple pleasure. Blending vintages can be a great way to make nice wines, if it's well done. This cuvée shows how the grenache can be a 'chameleon-grape' which has the ability to take many different forms. But it always keeps its sense of softness, fruit and texture. The 2013 bottlings will contain 50% of 2012, blended with the solera which contains all the vintages back to 1999. We were particularly careful with the Little James blends this year because we want that the spirit of grenache comes to you. Cherry, spices from the souk, gingerbread, strawberry compote, coal, tar." Fermented and aged in vat. 100% Grenache. 13.5% abv.

                A lovely French table wine that serves up much more than expected for the price...I love it! Comprised of mostly Grenache and neither fined nor filtered, it bursts with blackberries, tobacco, spice and earthy mineral undertones that lend itself to developing beautifully in the glass throughout the evening. Amazingly complex and delightful to enjoy with or without cuisine. I enjoyed it with fresh foccacia bread drizzeled with organic olive oil, balsamic and black pepper!

                            Country:
                        

France


 - When it comes to wine, France stands alone. No other country can beat it in terms of quality and diversity. And while many of its Region, Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne most obviously, produce wine as rare, as sought-after and nearly as expensive as gold, there are just as many obscurities and values to be had from little known appellations throughout the country. To learn everything there is to know about French wine would take a lifetime. To understand and appreciate French wine, one only has to begin tasting them.  Click for a list of bestselling items from all of France.                        



                            Sub-Region:
                        

Rhone


 - Legendary wine-producing region in southeast France.  Stereotypically speaking, Rhone wines are high in alcohol, and the majority produced is red.  The northern Rhone is best known for outstanding 100% Syrah wines from areas such as Cote Rotie and Hermitage, as well as for fabulous white wines from Condrieu (where Viognier is king).  In the southern Rhone, look for spicy, full-bodied wines that are blends of Grenache, Syrah, and other varietals coming from appellations such as Chateauneuf du Pape, Gigondas, or Rasteau.  Wines labeled as Cote du Rhone or Cotes du Rhone Village (a cut above generic Cotes du Rhone) are frequently found here in the US because they often represent some of the best values on the market.

It is so very important for Christians to know what they believe in this day and age. In an time where truth is a victim, Paul E. Little states that there is only one way to God, and that is through Jesus Christ. Little presents Christian beliefs in a very approachable manner that can be enjoyed by Christians and non-Christians alike. Little has an unapologetic way of presenting the truth of the Gospel that Christians must live by.Paul E. Little and his wife, Marie, worked for twenty-five years with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship. Until his death in 1975, Little was also associate professor of evangelism at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Deerfield, IL.

Publisher's Description▼▲
What does Christianity have to do with anything? What does the Christian faith teach about God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit? What do I need to know about angels, Satan and demons? What place should the Bible or a church have in my life? By exploring these and other core questions, bestselling author Paul E. Little leads you into a greater appreciation of a God who has done great things to bring you into a relationship with him through Jesus Christ. He presents ten bottom-line, non-negotiable truths of Christianity using humorous, anecdotal illustrations gathered from years of experience helping believers share their faith with not-yet Christians. Expanded and updated throughout by Paul's wife Marie, this contemporary edition is packed with illuminating answers to questions and misconceptions about the Christian faith, with study questions for each chapter.

Editorial Reviews▼▲
"This updated classic stands ready to serve a whole new generation. Read it and let Paul help you understand the timeless biblical truths that will prevent you from being 'blown here and there by every wind of teaching.' "
"There are just a few timeless treasures in Christian literature. Know What You Believe is one of them. I am confident that the expanded and updated version of this book will be as important to this generation as it was in the days when I was a student."
"I have deeply admired [Paul Little] as a man of God with extraordinary insights into the work of God and boundless enthusiasm for communicating the Word of God."

            This book helped me in a time in my life that I needed to know more about what I believe.  Not heavy on big doctrine words, written so I can understand it.  A common sense way of explaining what we believe.  I only gave 4 stars to "meets expectations" because a part of me says the real answer to know what we believe is by faith.  It is that simple.

            Paul Little's book still makes us think about the Christian values we take for granted and how we can explain to others what we believe about our faith.

            My Sunday School class of adults is using this book as a study for our class. We are a class of diverse people, married & single, young and older and find this book rewarding and challenging.

            I am taking a class based on this book and it is a great help to me in my studies. Very good book to have and read so that you will truly know what you believe as there are so many false teaching these days. God bless.

5.0 out of 5 starsbut I would recommend the book for family of substance abuse usersByTis the Truthon January 14, 2015I, and both my sons, had read this several years ago.  One of my sons is now reading it again.  He has had substance abuse problems for over 10 years, and says this is an accurate portrayal of what the drug addict experiences.  I know there was a stink about Frey embellishing, but I would recommend the book for family of substance abuse users.  It certainly touched on many aspects of what our family has gone through with this horrific plague.

2.0 out of 5 stars2 1/2. Way over hypedByPatrick A. Kellneron June 2, 2009"A Million Little Pieces" by James FreyJames Frey awakens to find himself on a commercial airliner bound for Chicago. Apparently he has been placed on the plane by a doctor and will be met by his parents when he lands who will deliver him to one of the best addiction treatment centers in the country. Although only 23, James' addiction to alcohol and crack amongst other things has done substantial damage to his body and if he doesn't quit now it isn't likely that he will see 24.As a stand alone "Fiction" book, "A Million Little pieces" isn't too bad. As a factual memoir it isn't too great. Obviously since its release Frey has come out and admitted that many parts of the book were embellished. My only question is how did anyone believe it was true to begin with? There is no point in rehashing all the details, but there is no shortage of things in this book that are not believable in the least and it makes you wonder how Oprah and crew so easily had the wool pulled over their eyes.The Good: The story is somewhat compelling and places the main character in some interesting situations and the character himself while not a likeable person definitely has an interesting history and is probably the only redeeming characteristic of this book.The Bad: Normal punctuation and grammatical rules are completely ignored in this book. This was completely annoying because you are never quite sure when someone is speaking and when they stop. The way the author tries to remedy this was quite annoying as well ala:Leonard speaksThat's it?I don't know if this is supposed to be an extension of the author/character's `rebel, rebel, down with rules' attitude but it just makes for an annoying read.As stated the main character is not likeable so this makes it hard to root for him or care about him in any way. This is compounded by the character's constant chest puffing attitude towards the center's staff and doctors and his constant proclamations that he doesn't need to do it their way. The lack of believability also makes it tough to suspend disbelief (even though it is fiction).Overall: With all the hype surrounding and even Oprah getting behind it I was expecting something solid. What I got was something so so. If this genre interests you give "Futureproof: A Novel (P.S.)" a try.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.2.0 out of 5 stars2 1/2. Way over hypedByPatrick A. Kellneron June 2, 2009Format: Paperback|Verified Purchase"A Million Little Pieces" by James FreyJames Frey awakens to find himself on a commercial airliner bound for Chicago. Apparently he has been placed on the plane by a doctor and will be met by his parents when he lands who will deliver him to one of the best addiction treatment centers in the country. Although only 23, James' addiction to alcohol and crack amongst other things has done substantial damage to his body and if he doesn't quit now it isn't likely that he will see 24.As a stand alone "Fiction" book, "A Million Little pieces" isn't too bad. As a factual memoir it isn't too great. Obviously since its release Frey has come out and admitted that many parts of the book were embellished. My only question is how did anyone believe it was true to begin with? There is no point in rehashing all the details, but there is no shortage of things in this book that are not believable in the least and it makes you wonder how Oprah and crew so easily had the wool pulled over their eyes.The Good: The story is somewhat compelling and places the main character in some interesting situations and the character himself while not a likeable person definitely has an interesting history and is probably the only redeeming characteristic of this book.The Bad: Normal punctuation and grammatical rules are completely ignored in this book. This was completely annoying because you are never quite sure when someone is speaking and when they stop. The way the author tries to remedy this was quite annoying as well ala:Leonard speaksThat's it?I don't know if this is supposed to be an extension of the author/character's `rebel, rebel, down with rules' attitude but it just makes for an annoying read.As stated the main character is not likeable so this makes it hard to root for him or care about him in any way. This is compounded by the character's constant chest puffing attitude towards the center's staff and doctors and his constant proclamations that he doesn't need to do it their way. The lack of believability also makes it tough to suspend disbelief (even though it is fiction).Overall: With all the hype surrounding and even Oprah getting behind it I was expecting something solid. What I got was something so so. If this genre interests you give "Futureproof: A Novel (P.S.)" a try.22 comments|

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsGood story but definitely not true.ByImabananaon June 21, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI used to work at a drug and alcohol rehab for a few years so when I read this book I knew it wasn't true. Legally there is no way that a rehab could get away with some of the things that he claimed. It's a very exciting story but it would have been better if he just told the truth.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsA moving reminder that we are all works in progressByDavid Greenon July 17, 2017Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseNot every author writes in the same style as Wallace, and for this we should be glad - variety being the spice of life and all that jazz. :)I could not stop reading this refreshingly-non-whiny account of one man's struggle with addiction. Parts made me sigh deeply and involuntarily, parts made me squirm, parts made my hair stand on end. I recommend this book to anyone who feels stuck in their life's progress.0Comment|Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuseCommentInsert product linkPaste the product's web address below:Product not found.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsFrom personal experience....ByErika Lynnon September 4, 2013Verified PurchaseI really really liked this book!  At first I found it kind of annoying because of the use of language and the poor writing skills, but having known what its like to be completely drowned out by addiction- having no one, having nothing, not even respect for yourself let alone others- I expect nothing less.  I was later upset when finding out that this book wasn't exactly non-fictional, many of the events that Frey stated in his writings are made up.... that just sucks.  But this review isn't based off of what I heard, its based off of the book.I found myself not being able to close this book easily.  It wasn't until my boyfriend complained of starvation and my thinking that his skinny butt might shrivel up and blow away that I had to make him dinner- lol!  But right after dinner I was right back to reading, and finished this rather lengthy memoir (so to speak) in about a day and a half.  It obviously wasn't the best book I've ever read in my life but I think I enjoyed it so much because I can relate to some of the things Frey says.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsWell written, though contrivedByEmily Greitzeron September 5, 2013Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseI have no real qualms with this book other than the deception of calling it a memoir. Part of the appeal of reading a memoir is trusting that the author is being honest and forthcoming with his account. I knew when I began reading this book that it was exaggerated but while I was reading I found myself unable to believe most of it had even happened. It just smacked of fiction. It seemed unrealistic in parts, and I felt the misuse of the label "memoir" was highly ironic considering how much Frey cites honesty/accountability as being crucial parts of healing from addiction in the book. The eclectic and chaotic writing style was compelling, and I felt easy to read but if you're looking for an accurate, believable memoir of addiction I wouldn't read this book.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsTrue or False It's Still  A Great ReadByBrett BennerVINE VOICEon January 11, 2006Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseHalfway through this book the media explosion happened with The Smoking Gun claiming the book was more a product of great imagination than actual fact. I refused to read the article until I had finished the book so I wouldn't be influenced by any seeds of doubt. First off, regardless of truth or fiction, the book is a powerhouse. Like strapping yourself into the first car of a rollercoaster that combines velocity with hairpin turns, it grabs you from the first paragraph, and doesn't let go. Reading it I was shocked that this was an Oprah selection, and couldn't imagine her viewers digesting this,littered as it is with cursing, and vivid descriptions of bodily functions, fluids, and the most horrific dentist scene since 'Marathon Man'. Frey has since admitted he's embellished elements of the story to heighten the drama, and after finishing it, that seems clear, especially the slightly sappy and melodramatic 'David and Lisa',like fractured souls falling in love in rehab, and an incident with a Priest in Paris. However that's a small blip in what is a great read regardless of if some, all, or none of it really happened.0Comment|

If you struggle with addiction, or know someone who does, this is an enlightening & motivating read. I could care less whether it's 100% factual or not, it took the unknown out of rehab and I checked myself in a week after reading (in 2005). I've never looked back. God bless you James Frey.0Comment|

Winemaker's Notes
Louis Barruol is the 14th generation Barruol to make wine at Saint Cosme. The Chateau was built in the late 16th Century on the site of a former Roman villa, and the remains of a Roman wine cellar, carved into the stone of the hillside, still exist in the chateau's caves. There are 37 acres of vineyards and the vines average 60 years of age. Château St. Cosme is one of the top producers of Cotes du Rhone. Little James' Basket Press is a blend of grenache from new and old vines. Aromas and flavors of Provencal herbs, pepper, cherry, and hint of apricots emerge from this medium bodied wine. It proves that creative thinking, good sourcing, and minimal intervention in winemaking can result in fantastic value. This is a fruit-forward wine but with plenty of structure and old-world earthiness, made in a rustic style. Here is an opportunity to experience the benefits of short-term cellaring. This wine is very enjoyable now, but will really begin to show its stuff in about six to twelve months. Enjoy on it's own or with hearty fair like braised beef or sautéed mushrooms.

Vin de Pays
(vahn duh peh-YEE)
One of the lower levels in the French Classification system, Vin de Pays is an intermediary wine, created for vineyards who were not quite AC, but vastly superior to Vin de Table wine. Vin de Pays has restrictions similar to the AC, but on a lesser scale. Regulations include specified region, minimum alcohol level and grape varieties. The wine also goes through a tasting panel. Some winemakers able to make wine at an AC level, instead choose to create wine at the Vin de Pays level as it allows more flexibility in grape varieties and yields. There are five regional Vin de Pays, with the most popular being Vin Pays d'Oc (from Languedoc & Roussillon). Vin de Pays wines offer wonderful value and good wine finds.
        

About France - Other regions
            When it comes to wine, France is a classic. Classic blends, grapes and styles began in the country and they still remain. Think about it - people ask for a Burgundian style Pinot Noir, they refer to wines as Bordeaux or Rhone blends - Champagne even had to pass a law to stop international wineries from putting their region on the label of all sparkling wine.

The top regions of France are: Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, Languedoc-Roussillon, Loire, Rhone. And these regions are so diverse! It makes sense that wine regions throughout the world try to emulate their style. Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and 
Syrah are no longer French varieties, but international varieties. They may not be the leader of cutting edge technology or value-priced wines, but there is no doubt that they are still producing wines of great quality and diversity.

Alcohol By Volume Guide
Most wine ranges from 10-16% alcohol by volume. Some varietals tend to have higher (for example Zinfandel and Cabernet Sauvignon) or lower alcohol levels (Pinot Noir and many white varietals), but there is always some variation from producer to producer. Some wine falls outside of this range, for instance Port weighs in closer to 20%, while Muscat and Riesling are usually a bit below 10%.


Wine Style Guide

Light & Crisp
Light to medium bodied wines that are high in acid and light to medium fruit. Typically no oak.
Fruity & Smooth
Light to medium bodied wines with lots of juicy fruit, typically medium acid and medium oak.
Rich & Creamy
Full bodied wines that have typically undergone malo-lactic fermentation and/or spent time in oak.

Winemaker's Notes
In the same mold, the Little Basket Press (all Grenache) offers good pepper, spice and herbs in a medium-bodied, easy drinking package. It's a solid, bistro-styled red to drink over the coming couple of years.

SKU #1023560

                            According to Robert Parker: "I enjoyed the non-vintage Little James. A blend of primarily Grenache (from both the Southern Rhone and the Languedoc-Roussillon), some of which is vinified carbonically, it is an excellent, surprisingly substantial, heady, full-flavored bistro red. Consume it over the next several years. Proprietor Louis Barruol is one of the two finest producers of Gigondas (his wines rival those of Yves Gras' Santa Duc), and also has a burgeoning negociant operation dedicated to making tasty wines. Readers should note that the estate wines are bottled under the Chateau Saint-Cosme label, and the negociant wines, made from purchased wines or grapes, are simply called Saint-Cosme." (02/06)  And according to Wine Spectator: "A dark, slightly gamy style, with a beefy edge to the chestnut, currant paste and tobacco leaf notes. Roasted sage cuts through the sinewy finish. Grenache. Drink now." (11/10)

                I drank this with a friend over the weekend and really enjoyed it. The wine is 100% Grenache based on a 10 year Solera with 50% from the 2009 vintage and 50% from vintages back to 1999.

Bright raspberry and spice on the nose and palate. The palate was soft with lush fruit with a nice back-bone of acidity. 

Only $11.99. This wine is going to go quickly.

France


 - When it comes to wine, France stands alone. No other country can beat it in terms of quality and diversity. And while many of its Region, Bordeaux, Burgundy and Champagne most obviously, produce wine as rare, as sought-after and nearly as expensive as gold, there are just as many obscurities and values to be had from little known appellations throughout the country. To learn everything there is to know about French wine would take a lifetime. To understand and appreciate French wine, one only has to begin tasting them.

                            Sub-Region:
                        

Rhone


 - Legendary wine-producing region in southeast France.  Stereotypically speaking, Rhone wines are high in alcohol, and the majority produced is red.  The northern Rhone is best known for outstanding 100% Syrah wines from areas such as Cote Rotie and Hermitage, as well as for fabulous white wines from Condrieu (where Viognier is king).  In the southern Rhone, look for spicy, full-bodied wines that are blends of Grenache, Syrah, and other varietals coming from appellations such as Chateauneuf du Pape, Gigondas, or Rasteau.  Wines labeled as Cote du Rhone or Cotes du Rhone Village (a cut above generic Cotes du Rhone) are frequently found here in the US because they often represent some of the best values on the market.
