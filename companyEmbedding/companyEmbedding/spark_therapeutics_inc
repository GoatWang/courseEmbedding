Spark Therapeutics, Inc. Key Developments

Spark Therapeutics Receives Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for Investigational LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec) from FDA
Jul 20 17
Spark Therapeutics  announced that the Offices of Orphan Products Development and Pediatric Therapeutics of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have designated investigational LUXTURNA (voretigene neparvovec) as a drug for a rare pediatric disease. Under FDA's Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, companies who receive approval for a new drug application or Biologics License Application (BLA) for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible to receive a voucher for a Priority Review of a subsequent marketing application for a different product. The Priority Review Voucher may be used by the company or sold to a third party. FDA’s Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies currently is reviewing the BLA for LUXTURNA for the treatment of patients with vision loss due to confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutation-associated retinal dystrophy under a Priority Review designation with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action date of Jan. 12, 2018. LUXTURNA has the potential to be both the first pharmacologic treatment for an inherited retinal disease (IRD) and the first gene therapy for a genetic disease approved in the United States. A natural history study has shown that people with this IRD eventually progress to complete blindness.


Spark Therapeutics, Inc. Announces U.S. Food and Drug Administration Accepts the Filing of Biologics License Application
Jul 17 17
Spark Therapeutics, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for filing the Biologics License Application (BLA) and granted Priority Review for voretigene neparvovec, an investigational, potential one-time gene therapy candidate for the treatment of patients with vision loss due to confirmed biallelic RPE65-mediated inherited retinal disease (IRD). The investigational gene therapy, which has the proposed trade name LUXTURNA(TM) (voretigene neparvovec), has the potential to be both the first pharmacologic treatment for IRD and the first gene therapy for a genetic disease in the United States. Priority review is granted to therapeutics that would offer major advances over existing therapies or would provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. FDA's goal for taking an action on Priority Review applications is six months. For the review of LUXTURNA, FDA has assigned a PDUFA date of January 12, 2018. Investigational LUXTURNA is intended to be administered one time per eye in patients with vision loss due to biallelic RPE65-mediated IRD. A natural history study has shown that people with this IRD eventually progress to complete blindness. LUXTURNA Clinical Trial Overview The safety and efficacy of LUXTURNA were assessed in two open-label Phase 1 trials, which continue to follow participants who received LUXTURNA between 2007 and 2012, and one open-label, randomized, controlled Phase 3 trial. Following the one-year control period of the Phase 3 study, all control participants elected to cross over and received LUXTURNA; long-term safety and efficacy continue to be assessed in the Phase 3 participants who received LUXTURNA between 2013 and 2015. The clinical trial program included 41 participants with vision loss aged four to 44 at the time of first administration. Confirmed biallelic RPE65 mutations and the presence of sufficient viable retinal cells were established in all participants.
