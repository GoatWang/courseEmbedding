introduction




                Peter Goldstein has been licensed to practice law in California since 1986 and in Nevada since 1999 and is a member of both state bars and maintains offices in both Los Angeles and Las Vegas specializing in Personal Injury Cases, and Police Misconduct.

Education: Juris Doctor (cum laude) Whittier College School of Law, 1985. Bachelors of Arts, USC, 1977.

Peter has obtained multiple six and seven-figure Awards and settlements on behalf of his clients. Recently he obtained a $3,000,000.00. binding arbitration award in a complex business litigation case.

Peter handles claims against government entities, police misconduct and excessive force cases and takes on business cases on a contingency fee basis.

If you retain Peter Goldstein as your lawyer you will deal with Peter personally, you will not be routed to paralegal or secretary to answer important questions. Peter takes on select cases and handles each case personally. This is not a mill practice with hundreds of cases and multple staff members. The goal is to handle all the work competently, carefully and with compassion for the client.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Brain Injury


Free Case Evaluation








We Protect Traumatic Brain Injury Victims
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) cases can be mild, moderate or severe.  They can affect people in ways that maybe only a few friends and family members can discern.  Sometimes you can suffer a traumatic brain injury without losing consciousness.  If you feel that you have suffered from a mild TBI or you lost consciousness during an accident and have problems with headaches, memory loss or concentration you may have serious injuries which require medical work up.
If you have suffered from what some may classify as a mild traumatic brain injury it can be very disabling and have an effect on you for the rest of your life.  In litigating mild traumatic brain injury cases it is very important that you see the proper neuro-psychologist and have the proper imaging done by a neuro-radiologist. These cases must be explored to their full capacity.  If you or a loved one has been injured and you think that the injury has resulted in a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion which has changed that person in a way that may not be obvious to a stranger please Peter Goldstein, a personal injury attornet which handled many of these cases and know the proper experts and medical doctors to evaluate your injuries.
 Call the Law Office of Peter Goldstein today for a FREE consultation (702) 474-6400.

introduction




                Peter Goldstein has been licensed to practice law in California since 1986 and in Nevada since 1999 and is a member of both state bars and maintains offices in both Los Angeles and Las Vegas specializing in Personal Injury Cases, and Police Misconduct.

Education: Juris Doctor (cum laude) Whittier College School of Law, 1985. Bachelors of Arts, USC, 1977.

Peter has obtained multiple six and seven-figure Awards and settlements on behalf of his clients. Recently he obtained a $3,000,000.00. binding arbitration award in a complex business litigation case.

Peter handles claims against government entities, police misconduct and excessive force cases and takes on business cases on a contingency fee basis.

If you retain Peter Goldstein as your lawyer you will deal with Peter personally, you will not be routed to paralegal or secretary to answer important questions. Peter takes on select cases and handles each case personally. This is not a mill practice with hundreds of cases and multple staff members. The goal is to handle all the work competently, carefully and with compassion for the client.

Practice Areas




Trip and Fall Cases
In proving negligence in a trip or slip and fall case, it is essential to prove that the defendant had notice of the danger. For example, if there is spilled liquid on the floor we must prove the store operators were actually or constructively aware that the substance was on the floor. In other words, they should have been aware of the spill due to the amount of time it was there which can discovered through cleaning records and/or video evidence. If an employee spilled the liquid or left an object in the aisle than notice is presumed.I have gone to trial in many trip and fall cases and won. In 2015, I won a trial against Smith's Food and Drugs in Federal Court in Las Vegas, Nevada. Smith's employee left a box in the aisle which was a trip hazard. My client, who was shopping and looking at the aisles, did not notice the low box and she ended up falling and fracturing her arm. I went to trial because Smith's did not make a reasonable settlement offer. I won the trial and my client got paid.Learn more »





Police Misconduct Cases
Police officers have a duty to enforce the law and are authorized to use reasonable force. However, a police officer may not use excessive force, whether from a baton, taser, beanbag shotgun, firearm, hands and fists or a k-9. Police officers may not fire their gun unless they have a reasonable belief that they are in imminent fear of deadly force or great bodily injury.Learn more »








Auto, Truck and Motorcycle Crash Cases
When people are injured in car accidents they are left with questions and uncertainty of what the future holds. It can be a traumatic time and apart from dealing with the physical pain and mental suffering you also have to deal with the financial expenses resulting from the injuries. Further compounding the trauma is worry and anxiety about whether the negligent party has adequate insurance. You may be able to make a claim against your own insurance company or the city for a dangerous condition of public property. You should not make statements to your insurance company and avoid giving a recorded statement to anyone until you call me.Learn more »

Focus on helping accident victims
Personal injury can be a complicated process because our job as lawyers is not only to prove that the other party is at fault but also to prove that all of the injuries you suffered were not only the result of the defendant's negligent act but were legally caused by such actions. Many cases are won on negligence but lost on causation and it is imperative that we establish medical causation clearly and definitively so the jury can understand it.
Personal Injury Law Experience
Personal injury cases can involve both physical and emotional injuries, and if the defendant acted with reckless disregard or with an evil motive then punitive damages can be available as well. My firm has handled thousands of cases crossing a wide range of personal injuries where the clients were injured physically, mentally, and emotionally.Combined with a background in criminal defense my years of personal injury experience allow me to evaluate, understand, and analyze each case quickly and  because I take on select cases and handle each case personally from beginning to end, I know what each client is going through and how the case affects each client's quality of life.

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare Culver City attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

Steve Cron was born in 1948, and raised in the San Fernando Valley. He attended North Hollywood High School, UCLA, and Hastings College of the Law, graduating in 1973. He passed the bar on the first try, and began working as a Deputy Public Defender for Los Angeles County. During his six years in the Public Defender's Office, he handled juvenile cases, misdemeanors and felonies. It was a great place to start, with a high volume of cases ranging from minor misdemeanors to murders, and everything in between.

After six years, in 1980, Steve decided to start his own practice. He...

	Need a lawyer? 


	The Justia Lawyer Directory is a listing of lawyers, legal aid organizations, and pro bono legal service organizations. Whether you were injured, are accused of a crime, or are merely engaging in everyday affairs that affect your legal rights or property, an attorney can help you resolve problems or prevent new ones from arising. 


	Here are just a few situations where you might want to seek the advice of an attorney: 



		You were injured in a car or truck accident 
	

		You have been arrested and charged with a crime, such as DUI or shoplifting 
	

		You are considering separating from your spouse 
	

		You have been subjected to harassment or other discrimination at work 
	


	Use Justia to research and compare attorneys so that you can make an informed decision when you hire your counsel. 


	It is important to research an attorney before hiring him or her. Be sure to evaluate an attorney's experience (types of cases handled, prior results obtained, etc.). Although prior results are not indicative of the likelihood of success in your case, they can help you make an informed decision. 


	Also worth serious consideration is the attorney's location, particularly if you will be traveling to visit him or her for consultations. 


	Finally, research an attorney to see whether he or she has ever been subject to discipline. Although disciplinary actions do not necessarily impact the attorney's competence to handle your case, they may affect your decision whether to hire.

Practice Areas




Trip and Fall Cases
In proving negligence in a trip or slip and fall case, it is essential to prove that the defendant had notice of the danger. For example, if there is spilled liquid on the floor we must prove the store operators were actually or constructively aware that the substance was on the floor. In other words, they should have been aware of the spill due to the amount of time it was there which can discovered through cleaning records and/or video evidence. If an employee spilled the liquid or left an object in the aisle than notice is presumed.I have gone to trial in many trip and fall cases and won. In 2015, I won a trial against Smith's Food and Drugs in Federal Court in Las Vegas, Nevada. Smith's employee left a box in the aisle which was a trip hazard. My client, who was shopping and looking at the aisles, did not notice the low box and she ended up falling and fracturing her arm. I went to trial because Smith's did not make a reasonable settlement offer. I won the trial and my client got paid.Learn more »





Police Misconduct Cases
Police officers have a duty to enforce the law and are authorized to use reasonable force. However, a police officer may not use excessive force, whether from a baton, taser, beanbag shotgun, firearm, hands and fists or a k-9. Police officers may not fire their gun unless they have a reasonable belief that they are in imminent fear of deadly force or great bodily injury.Learn more »








Auto, Truck and Motorcycle Crash Cases
When people are injured in car accidents they are left with questions and uncertainty of what the future holds. It can be a traumatic time and apart from dealing with the physical pain and mental suffering you also have to deal with the financial expenses resulting from the injuries. Further compounding the trauma is worry and anxiety about whether the negligent party has adequate insurance. You may be able to make a claim against your own insurance company or the city for a dangerous condition of public property. You should not make statements to your insurance company and avoid giving a recorded statement to anyone until you call me.Learn more »

Focus on helping accident victims
Personal injury can be a complicated process because our job as lawyers is not only to prove that the other party is at fault but also to prove that all of the injuries you suffered were not only the result of the defendant's negligent act but were legally caused by such actions. Many cases are won on negligence but lost on causation and it is imperative that we establish medical causation clearly and definitively so the jury can understand it.
Personal Injury Law Experience
Personal injury cases can involve both physical and emotional injuries, and if the defendant acted with reckless disregard or with an evil motive then punitive damages can be available as well. My firm has handled thousands of cases crossing a wide range of personal injuries where the clients were injured physically, mentally, and emotionally.Combined with a background in criminal defense my years of personal injury experience allow me to evaluate, understand, and analyze each case quickly and  because I take on select cases and handle each case personally from beginning to end, I know what each client is going through and how the case affects each client's quality of life.
