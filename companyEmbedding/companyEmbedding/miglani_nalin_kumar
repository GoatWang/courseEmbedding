It is an umbrella term that identifies with past occasions and the memory, disclosure, accumulation, association, presentation, and translation of data about these occasions. Researchers who expound on history are called students of history. Occasions happening before composed record are considered ancient times. History can likewise allude to the scholarly train which utilizes an account to inspect and investigate a succession of past occasions, and dispassionately decide the examples of circumstances and end results that decide them. Students of history once in a while talk about the way of history and its handiness by examining the investigation of the order as an end in itself and as a method for giving "point of view" on the issues of the present.
