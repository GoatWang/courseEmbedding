Overview
Called the North Star State as well as the Land of 10,000 Lakes, Minnesota is a scenic state of rolling plains, fertile soil and, not surprisingly, thousands of lakes. Minnesota is home to the largest lake in the world, Lake Superior, as well as the source of the Mississippi River and countless other bodies of water. It's no wonder that water sports are a favorite pastime of residents; fishing, boating, rafting and other watery activities are also popular.
What to Expect

Minnesota is rich in natural resources, producing more than 75% of the nation's iron ore as well as numerous farm products including corn, wheat, butter, eggs, milk, potatoes and livestock. Industry plays a large part in the economy as well, producing nonelectrical machinery, fabricated metals, flour-mill products, plastics, electronic computers, scientific instruments and processed foods. Tourism is also important, with arts, fishing, hunting, water sports and winter sports bringing in millions of tourists each year.
The climate may not be Minnesota's best asset; winters are long and snowy, spring is brief and summers are hot. However, the United Health Foundation has named it the "healthiest state in the country," and it's also been declared the "most livable state" in the nation. So if you like the cold and enjoy spending time in the snow, this could be the place for you!
Where to Explore

The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have a combined population of more than 600,000 residents, or about 15% of the entire state's population. Start your search for apartments here in these thriving cities.
Minneapolis Apartments

A lush, beautiful environment and plenty of urban sophistication combine to make Minneapolis a unique city that its residents love. It earns a seemingly endless parade of titles: third on Esquire Magazine's "Cities That Rock," Money Magazine's "Most Fun City in America," Travel & Leisure's "Cleanest City" and PBS's "Most Walkable Community." Speaking of walking, Minneapolis contains the only scenic byway located entirely within an urban area, allowing you to circumnavigate the city on a winding complex of beautiful trails. Minneapolis is also famous for the Mall of America, more theater seats per capita than any city other than New York and more golfers per capita than any other city in the country. How's that for variety? Residents can find their niche here in this diverse city full of opportunity. More good news: The overall cost of living is 12% below the national average, meaning that apartments are relatively inexpensive. Average apartments for rent go for $800 a month, with average 2-bedroom apartments renting for $1,000.
St. Paul Apartments

The other Twin City has its own fair share of natural beauty and metropolitan delights. Set along the Mississippi River, St. Paul has a large, ethnically diverse population and a rich history of culture, which is reflected in its historic sites, architectural landmarks and Old World neighborhoods. One of the most striking features of the city are its skyways, enclosed pedestrian walkways that connect virtually all of downtown and keep pedestrians comfortable and dry no matter what the weather is outside. The cost of living here is 9% lower than the national average, which is not as favorable as Minneapolis. However, the price of apartment rentals is somewhat cheaper here. Average one-bedroom apartments go for about $650, two-bedroom apartment rentals go for $800 and three-bedroom apartments for rent average $1,000 per month.Rent.com is a free rental site that offers a large selection of trusted apartments and houses for rent.

I feel very safe and comfortable. Most of my maintenance issues have Read More been addressed and/or fixed, and the other people that live in the complex are friendly and usually considerate. My biggest complaint is how expensive it is to live in WBW. I am a single woman in her mid twenties with one income and currently paying $1000 in living expenses. I feel that my apartment is out dated, and should be updated considering how much I'm paying to live there.March 23, 2015Was this helpful?YesReport AbuseSee More ReviewsGet Free Moving QuotesFrom free moving quotes to expert advice, Rent.com has your move covered.Get free moving quotes nowContact Propertyback to the topBy submitting this form, you agree to Rent.com's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.Phone Number(651) 393-9557(651) 393-9556Office HoursOpen NowMonday-Friday: 8:30am-6:00pmSaturday: 10:00am-5:00pmManaged byTimberland PartnersSearch Apartments in Nearby Citiesback to the topCenterville, MNGrant, MNHugo, MNMounds View, MNMoundsview, MNNew Brighton, MNShoreview, MNWest Lakeland, MNSponsored LinksAdvertisementsFull ScreenVirtual TourThis video can't be played with your current setup.Please switch to a browser that provides native H.264 support or install Adobe Flash Player(651) 393-9556 Email3D unfurnished3D furnishedHD floor planContact this propertyOpen NowCall (651) 393-9557(651) 393-9556 or send an emailBy submitting this form, you agree to Rent.com's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.Your message has been sent.

Living in White Bear Lake

From the Dakota and Ojibwe tribes who first inhabited the land, to the families who today search for White Bear Lake apartments for rent, people have loved living in White Bear Lake for centuries. Once a haven for the wildlife and hunting grounds of native peoples, White Bear Lake was incorporated as a township in 1858 around the same time that Minnesota became a state. As the Twin Cities continued to grow during the 19th and 20th centuries, the town was able to maintain the same natural beauty and small-town feel that it exudes today. People living in apartments in White Bear Lake enjoy fishing, exploring, boating and otherwise spending time outdoors on White Bear Lake itself or in one of the city's many parks.
