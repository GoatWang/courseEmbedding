                                    How do I increase my capacity to bid with reducing budget?
                                
Tailoring internal processes to match the pursuit is essential in increasing bid capacity, but insufficient to compete effectively. Firms must also have a clear understanding of the balance between maximizing the probability of win on individual bids and total value of programs pursed to achieve the target ROI for your business.

                                    To what extent do customers’ past buying behaviors influence source selection?
                                
Recent customer buying behaviors are a strong indicator of what they value most when making competitive awards. These behaviors often reflect deep-seated beliefs that are difficult to observe directly. Proposals that resonate with a customer’s narrative can be very powerful.
learn more











                                    Should I bring my commercial offerings to the government market?
                                
Regulation and process have made the government customer historically unattractive to commercial companies. Partnerships with traditional government contractors is one way to navigate the system, and new government efforts to reach out to innovative commercial firms might further facilitate adoption of commercial offerings. There are also occasional opportunities when the government may prefer a commercial offering because it offers better value.
learn more











                                    What can I do to better defend my customer’s award decision during a protest?
                                
It is too late once a protest has been filed. Helping your customer defend an award decision is best done before the final RFP is everreleased—by helping your customer define clear requirements and evaluation criteria. Proposals should be prepared with the evidence needed for a defensible award decision.
learn more











                                    Can program planning & control help to enhance CPARS?
                                
Implementing a PP&C discipline that produces actionable information and early warning to negative trends assists the program team to deliver on time and on cost with quality.
learn more











                                    Can I improve my engineering productivity with effective program planning & controls?
                                
Most PP&C disciplines are implemented for compliance providing little to no value to the technical team. For PP&C to enhance productivity, the information provided must be actionable.
learn more











                                    What is required to implement EVMS in an Agile environment?
                                
Understanding the relationship and integration of sprints, story maps, the IMS, and EVMS is key to implementing EVMS in an Agile environment.
learn more











                                    How can I improve the utility of my IMS/EVMS data?
                                
You know your system is working when the project team and management use the information to make both day-to-day, and milestone decisions, not just keep score. Successful program planning and controls integrates cost and schedule principles with technical and other product components. Getting the level of detail right is one of the biggest challenge to effectively implementing IMS/EVMS for decision support.
learn more











                                    How do I balance risk across cost/schedule/technical?
                                
A resource loaded IMS integrated with the EVMS and Risk Register are key elements of an effective PP&C system that provides early warning to issues and insights into the drivers of the cost/schedule/technical trends.
learn more











                                    How can I control my B&P costs with slipping RFP schedules?
                                
Make effective decisions on what not to do as much as a focusing on what to do. Efficient management of B&P is about having clear investment criteria across the entire portfolio of pursuits and spending smartly on each pursuit.
learn more











                                    Should I consider a third party EVMS validation?
                                
Third party reviews minimize the impact on your customer, reduce the cost of rework, and minimize the impact on the technical team (CAMs and PMs).
learn more











                                    How do I know when I need to change my strategy to win?
                                
Effective strategies anticipate surprises from customers and competitors. Responding to these surprises requires a strategy that monitors specific signposts and that you can test during the pursuit, and that can evolve.

                                    Should I consider a third party EVMS validation?
                                
Third party reviews minimize the impact on your customer, reduce the cost of rework, and minimize the impact on the technical team (CAMs and PMs).

In the last year, we have helped clients win $10bn of international business.

This success is because we:

Have a global perspective. In the last year we have delivered projects in Europe, Asia and the Middle East.
Are independent. We are not captive to existing biases or internal politics. We only want to get the best possible view of what it will take to win new business.
Have a great network. In many countries we have connections at the Head of State or Ministerial level. We also have a deep network of retired U.S. and U.K. Intelligence Officers, Diplomats and Military Officers. We can always find someone who has insight.
Go in person. We send a senior team into the field and use our network to access decision makers and real insiders. We don’t believe you can get real insight from an office inside the Beltway.
Use a proven methodology. Our analytical approach to stakeholder mapping and decision analysis replaces anecdotes with evidence. We are strategic advisors, not “door openers.”





We would like to help you win more international business 
Our comprehensive Deal to Win (DTW) approach includes robust customer and competitor intelligence to tame international procurement opportunities:

SpringCM Acquires The Privia Government Proposal And Contract Management Product From Synchris, Inc.
    Source: SpringCM



SpringCM, the leader in on-demand document management and workflow solutions, recently announced the acquisition of assets of Synchris, Inc., including its Privia line of bid, proposal and contract management software. Privia is the leading bid and proposal life cycle management software for businesses bidding on federal, state and local government contracts. Terms of the transaction were not announced. The Privia staff and business will operate as SpringCM¹s new Government Solutions Division. SpringCM will fully support the Privia product, and all customer contact points will remain the same.
Privia provides complete life cycle management of government requests for proposals, especially those done as Indefinite Delivery, Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) or multiple award schedule contracts. It is estimated that as much as 60 percent of federal spending is awarded through IDIQ contracts.
Contractors face challenges in managing not only the initial bid process but also the subsequent award of hundreds or thousands of task orders governing specific deliverables, each one of which must be responded to within a specific time period. Privia offers unique features to manage this complex process including:
Integration with information services  Through integration with leading information sources such as FedBizOps, Centurion, epipeline, INPUT and FedSources, detailed information on upcoming bids may be identified and automatically downloaded for tracking in Privia.
Comprehensive document management and collaboration  Used to manage the development and re-use of proposal content, basis of estimate and pricing, past performance, marketing collateral, subcontractor teaming agreements and past performance.
Task order management response tracking  Introduced in 2007, Privia now has the ability to manage the capture of task order requests, automate the search for past performance data associated with each company's subcontractors by contract requirement and provide a workflow-based management of the response process. Identification of past performance data is critical in creating timely, accurate and winning responses to task orders.
As part of SpringCM, Privia will be offered as the Government Bid and Proposal Management Solution from SpringCM. SpringCM already provides a comprehensive Contract and Proposal Management Solution for commercial contracts and, as part of the Salesforce.com AppExchange, offers Contract and Proposal Management fully integrated with the leading on-demand CRM platform. With this addition, SpringCM now offers the leading product for managing government proposals and contracts. Privia will continue to be delivered as both an on-demand service and on-premises installed software.
Privia will become part of the new Government Solutions Division of SpringCM, located in Sterling, Va. The charter of this group will be to continue Privia¹s leadership in government contracting while developing opportunities for other content-based applications both within the government contractor community and directly with the government. Steve Maier will serve as vice president and general manager of the Government Solutions Division of SpringCM. Maier joins SpringCM from Novell, where he served as VP of Strategic Partner Development and focused on developing business relationships with top-tier consulting and systems integration organizations. Prior to Novell, Maier worked at Pearson Government Solutions as VP for Homeland Security. In this position, Maier oversaw the Transportation and Safety Administration (TSA) recruiting program that processed more than six million job applications and resulted in the placement of 62,901 screeners in 429 commercial airports in under six months. Before joining Pearson, Maier held senior management positions with several leading technology companies including US Internetworking and Sybase.
Steve Maier stated, I am extremely pleased to join SpringCM on this important occasion. Privia has earned a reputation as the leader in managing complex, multiple-award proposals and contracts. We intend to enhance that reputation as part of SpringCM because we are able to offer comprehensive document and process management that has broad applicability to project management, accounts payable and other contracting functions. We look forward to bringing the full spectrum of SpringCM¹s capabilities to the government contractor and government sectors.
Dan Carmel, CEO for SpringCM, added, With this important acquisition we are in a unique position to address the bid, proposal and contract needs of both commercial and government contractors. We look forward to welcoming Privia users into the SpringCM customer community and are very pleased with the addition of the talented staff from Synchris. As the leader in on-demand ECM, we will continue to look for content-based applications like Privia that can benefit from our platform capabilities.
About SpringCM

Capturing content, collaborating on projects and managing complex business processes are now available with just a Web browser and Internet access. Built and designed by ECM industry veterans, SpringCM delivers award-winning functionality without the software installation, hardware maintenance and prolonged customization cycles associated with installed, on-premises applications.
