Investment Advisors



	Welcome (This section is for professional investment advisors.)

	Fenimore Asset Management, the independent investment advisor to FAM Funds, was established in 1974 with a focus on long-term, value investing. Our genesis came from the astute sale of a quality, successful, family business. We invest in companies that exhibit those same top-notch characteristics.

	While having the upside potential of concentrated small- to mid-cap portfolios, we seek to mitigate risk and preserve capital through our in-depth research process and active management. It is this same steadfast investment approach that has helped us navigate multiple economic and financial market cycles.

	Over the decades, our investors have appreciated our transparency, portfolio managers’ long average tenure, and track record in up and down markets. As an advisor, you have direct access to our Investment Research Team.

We invite you to discover how FAM Funds may differentiate your practice.

	at 1.18%. The Fund has agreed to repay the Advisor for amounts waived or reimbursed by the Advisor pursuant to the Expense Limitation
	Agreement provided that such repayment does not cause the Net Fund Operating Expenses for Investor Shares to exceed the above limit
	and the repayment is made within three years after the year in which the Advisor incurred the expense. This Expense Limitation
	Agreement may only be amended or terminated by the Fund’s Board of Trustees.




	Expense Example:



	This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the


	cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time


	periods


	indicated


	and


	then


	redeem


	all


	of


	your


	shares


	at


	the


	end


	of


	those


	periods.


	The


	Example


	also


	assumes


	that


	your investment has
	a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same.



	Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based
	on these assumptions your costs would be:

	Portfolio Turnover


	The Fund pays transaction costs,
	such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its


	portfolio). A


	higher


	portfolio


	turnover


	rate


	may


	indicate


	higher


	transaction


	costs


	and


	may


	result


	in


	higher


	taxes when


	Fund


	shares


	are


	held


	in


	a


	taxable


	account.


	These


	costs,


	which


	are


	not


	reflected


	in


	annual


	fund


	operating expenses


	or


	in


	the


	Example,


	affect


	the


	Fund’s


	performance.



	During




	the




	most




	recent




	fiscal




	year,




	the




	Fund’s




	portfolio


	turnover




	rate




	was




	8.53%



	of



	the




	average




	value



	of



	its




	portfolio.




	 




	Principal Investment Strategies


	Fenimore Asset Management, Inc.
	(“Fenimore”), the investment advisor to the Fund, employs a “value


	approach”
	in


	making


	its


	common


	stock


	selections.


	This


	approach


	is


	based


	on


	Fenimore’s


	belief


	that


	at


	any


	given


	point


	in time


	the


	stock


	price


	of


	a


	company


	may


	sell


	below


	the


	company’s


	“true


	business


	worth”.


	Factors


	considered


	in evaluating
	the true business worth include the company’s current earnings and Fenimore’s opinion as to its


	future earnings potential. After identifying a company whose securities are determined to have a favorable


	price-to-earnings


	relationship,


	Fenimore


	plans


	to


	invest


	in


	such


	securities


	until


	the


	“true


	business


	worth”


	nears


	the market price of the

	company’s securities.



	 


	Generally,


	the


	Fund


	will


	attempt


	to


	remain


	fully


	invested


	in


	common


	stocks


	and


	securities


	that


	are


	convertible into


	common


	stocks,


	such


	as


	convertible


	bonds


	and


	convertible


	preferred


	stocks.


	The


	Fund


	may


	invest


	in


	the securities


	of


	issuers


	of


	all


	sizes


	and


	market


	capitalizations.


	The


	Fund


	may


	also


	invest


	in


	the


	securities


	of


	both domestic


	and


	foreign


	issuers


	and


	it


	may


	invest


	in


	shares


	of


	other


	investment


	companies,


	including


	exchange- traded funds (“ETFs”).



	 




	Principal Risks







	•





	Stock Market Risk

	- the value of stocks fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and


	general


	stock


	market


	and


	economic


	conditions.


	Stock


	prices


	may


	decline


	over


	short


	or


	extended


	periods


	of


	time. Stocks are more volatile and riskier than some other forms of investments.










	•





	Stock


	Selection


	Risk



	-


	the


	value


	stocks


	chosen


	for


	the


	Fund


	are


	subject


	to


	the


	risk


	that


	the


	market


	may


	never


	realize their intrinsic
	value or their prices may go down.










	•





	Small-Cap Risk

	-
	small capitalization companies may not have the size, resources or other assets of large


	capitalization companies.










	•





	Market Risk

	- the value of your investment
	will go up and down, which means that you could lose


	money.










	•





	Foreign








	Investment








	Risk







	-the


	Fund


	may


	invest


	in


	securities


	of


	foreign


	issuers


	that


	are


	traded


	in


	foreign


	markets


	or may be represented by American Depository Receipts that are traded
	in the United States. Investments in


	non-





	U.S. securities may involve additional risk including
	exchange rate fluctuation, political or economic


	instability, the imposition of exchange
	controls, expropriation, limited disclosure and illiquid markets.

	the


	fees


	and


	expenses


	of


	the


	other investment companies in which the Fund invests. In addition, shareholders will be exposed to the

USA Patriot Act
	In response to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, the U.S. Congress passed the USA Patriot Act. To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, the USA Patriot Act requires all financial institutions, including mutual funds, to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. For all new accounts, this means that the following information must be obtained: Name, Date of Birth, Physical Residential Address (post office boxes are permitted for mailing purposes only), and Taxpayer Identification Number, such as a Social Security Number. We may also ask to see your driver’s license or passport in order to verify your identity.

	Until such verification is made, FAM Funds may be required to not open your account, close your account or take other steps we deem reasonable if we are unable to verify your identity and ensure that the information you supply is correct.

Fenimore Securities, Inc. Business Continuity Planning
	Fenimore Securities, Inc., a broker-dealer and distributor of the FAM Funds, has developed a Business Continuity Plan on how we will respond to events that significantly disrupt our business. Since the timing and impact of disasters and disruptions is unpredictable, we will have to be flexible in responding to actual events as they occur. With that in mind, and in compliance with NASD Rule 3510, we are providing you with this information on our business continuity plan.

Contacting Us
	If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us as you usually do at (800) 932-3271 you should call our alternative number firm emergency number at (518) 355-6340 or go to our web site at www.famfunds.com. FAM Shareholder Services, our service provider, will seek to continue to provide access to your account at FAM Funds.

Our Business Continuity Plan
	We plan to quickly recover and resume business operations after a significant business disruption and respond by safeguarding our employees and property, making a financial and operational assessment, protecting the firm’s books and records, and allowing our customers to transact business. In short, our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption.

	Our business continuity plan addresses: data back up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; regulatory reporting; and assuring our customers prompt access to their funds and securities if we are unable to continue our business.

	Our service provider, FAM Shareholder Services, backs up our important records in a geographically separate area. While every emergency situation poses unique problems based on external factors, such as time of day and the severity of the disruption, we have been advised by FAM Shareholder Services that its objective is to restore its own operations and be able to complete existing transactions and accept new transactions and payments within 24 hours. Your transactions could be delayed during this period.

Varying Disruptions
	Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as the single building housing our firm, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to our firm, our city, or our region, we will seek to transfer our operations to our emergency site when needed and expect to recover and resume business within 24 hours. In each situation, we plan to continue in business and notify you through our web site www.famfunds.com or our customer emergency number, (518) 355-6340 on how to contact us.

FAM Funds
	While Fenimore Securities and FAM Shareholder Services plan to resume business as expeditiously as possible, should a significant business disruption occur such that FAM Funds does not calculate its net asset value (e.g., a disruption that affects trading on the NYSE or Nasdaq), your transaction may be delayed until such time as the net asset value is next calculated.

For More Information

A 100% No-Load Fund                                                             

FAM Value Fund                                                                  

Dear Shareholder:                                                January 1997   

The close of 1996 marked a milestone for the FAM Value Fund - 10 years of       
performance history. As a result, we are providing you with more information    
regarding the Fund's long term performance and investment style. (Please see    
the following and the profile on page 4). 1996 was also a year in which our     
mutual Fund organization added a second Fund to our "Fund family" with the      
opening of the FAM Equity-Income Fund in April.                                 

Over the past ten-year period, we have consistently applied our investment      
philosophy to managing the FAM Value Fund and seen it through some tremendous   
market movements. Since its inception on January 2, 1987, your Fund grew        
from $10/share to $26.53/share through December 31, 1996. In addition,          
distributions totaled $4.38. For the same time period, the Dow Jones            
Industrial Average moved from 1895.95 to 6448.27. Not only did the stock        
market experience the second largest correction of its history in 1987, it      
also soared to record new highs during 1996. It was certainly an exciting       
time period for investors.                                                      

Even with all the changes that have occurred around us, we can assure you that  
we have made NO CHANGES in our investment philosophy or the way that we manage  
your Fund. We continue to focus on achieving long term, conservative            
investment returns by utilizing a value approach. We look for good businesses   
in industry groups that we can understand and evaluate, ones that are run by    
able management teams, and those which are financially strong and selling at    
a reasonable price. Together these elements comprise Fenimore's investment      
philosophy. It is an approach that we have found consistently beneficial over   
long periods of time and one which we will adhere to in the future as well.

1996                                                                            

Performance for 1996 can best be summarized by saying that not everyone         
invited went to the ball. Your Fund increased 11.2% during the 12 months        
ending December 31, 1996 - much less than the 23.0% rise of the S&P 500         
composite index which is weighted with companies considerably larger than       
those in FAM Value Fund. Our return compares more favorably to the 16.6% gain   
of the Russell 2000 index - a composite of companies with smaller market        
capitalizations like ours. While we are not fully satisfied with our short      
term performance, we are confident that our objective of providing you with     
long term superior results will occur.                                          

A review of 1996 also indicates that what may be good in one year may not       
always be helpful in the next. The Fund was negatively impacted in 1996 by      
two outstanding performers for the year 1995. CONMED, which gained 88% in       
1995, dropped back -18.0% in 1996, and Sage Laboratories was off -35.2% after   
being up 92% in 1995. Also, C-COR Electronics, which has been a stellar         
performer in the past, hurt your Fund in 1996, -43.6%. We still hold these      
stocks because the businesses are on track and, we believe, much more           
valuable than what current prices reflect.                                      

On the positive side, your Fund was impacted favorably by Mailboxes Etc.        
(+80.0%), Kaydon (+57.1%), and American Express (+39.8%). Occasionally, we      
will invest in a large company if we feel it is severely undervalued. This      
year those decisions paid off for your Fund. Since it is unusual for the        
investment climate to remain the same year after year, we will stick to our     
long term approach of finding value. Normally, this occurs in the smaller       
company arena.                                                                  

Going forward, we continue to feel very strongly about our investments in the   
financial sector, particularly banks and insurance companies. Banks, which      
represent 12% of the portfolio, were trimmed a bit during the year because of   
takeovers. Fourth Financial was purchased by Boatman's, and Hawkeye by          
Mercantile. Another good performer for us, Transworld Bancorp, will be taken    
over in 1997 for $18.25 per share in cash by Glendale Federal. Transworld is    
a bank that was an original purchase for the Fund in 1987. It has a topnotch    
management team. We didn't see a lot of performance in the early years, but it  
has compounded at 23% for the time we have held it. (With those results, we     
could make a good case for a ten-year holding period!) A lot of people ask us   
how we are going to get out of some of these small company positions. The       
cases mentioned above illustrate that, with patience, value generally flows to  
the top, either by takeover or by market recognition. We still own a lot of     
financials, and feel the consolidation process is going to continue in the      
future.                                                                         

In the insurance area, niche players - whether that's property and casualty     
insurers or life insurers - seem to have the same kind of financial and         
economic fundamentals that you would find in a very good industrial or          
technology company, yet sell at much lower multiples. For example, we have      
held a company in the insurance area, Allied Group, for a long period of time   
and it has performed very well. Allied Group's return on equity has been in     
excess of 16% for many years and its growth rate has been in the double         
digits. It's a well managed niche property and casualty company, yet right now  
it's selling at 9-10x estimated 1997 earnings. Here is a company that in other  
marketplaces would sell at 14-15x earnings at least. We know that earnings are  
strong and that the fundamentals are very positive.                             
1997 and Beyond                                                                 

What gives us confidence about the future is partially based on the past. Our   
long term performance record of 12.9% compounded over ten years is favorable    
when compared to the Russell 2000 index. However, over the past decade we,      
along with many of our competitors, have been bested by the S&P 500 index.      
There is much talk about return today, but few investors seem very concerned    
about risk. This is where your Fund shines! Based on our estimations, the       
median P/E ratio for the companies owned in your Fund is 12x. This is a 28%     
discount from 17x, the median P/E for S&P 500 index based on expected           
earnings for 1997.                                                              

Your Fund owns many good businesses and most sell at a bargain price. All       
share strong financial promise. While there may be some disappointments along   
the way, we assure you that we will keep our focus on our niche -               
understandable, highly profitable businesses managed by extraordinarily able    
people. Eventually, we believe the investment pendulum will swing in our favor  
and reward you handsomely.                                                      

We thank you for your patience and the confidence you have entrusted in us.     
Sincerely,Thomas O. Putnam                              Diane C. Van Buren

Beta. Beta is a measure of a fund's sensitivity to market movements. It         
measures the relationship between a fund's excess return over T-bills and the   
excess return of the benchmark index.                                           

Earnings Growth Rate. The earnings growth rate is the annual average rate of    
growth in earnings over the past five years for the stocks currently in a       
portfolio.                                                                      

Expense Ratio. The expense ratio is the percentage of a portfolio's average     
net assets used to pay its annual administrative and advisory expenses.         

Foreign Holdings. This is the percentage of a portfolio's investments           
represented by stocks or American Depository Receipts (ADRs) of companies       
based outside the United States.                                                

Investment Focus. The grid indicates a portfolio's characteristics in terms     
of market capitalization and relative valuations (growth, value, or a blend).   
For example, if the bottom left box is shaded, this indicates that a            
portfolio's emphasis is on small cap value stocks.                              

Median Market Cap. The median market cap is the midpoint of market              
capitalization (market price times shares outstanding) of stocks in a           
portfolio.                                                                      

Number of Stocks. This is an indication of diversification. The more stocks     
a portfolio holds, the more diversified, and the more likely it is to perform   
in line with the overall stock market.                                          

Price/Book Ratio. The share price of a stock, divided by its net worth, or      
book value, per share. For a portfolio, the weighted average price/book ratio   
of the stocks it holds.                                                         

Price/Earnings Ratio (P/E). The ratio of a stock's current price to its         
per-share earnings over the past year. P/E is an indicator of market            
expectations about corporate prospects. Typically, the higher the P/E, the      
greater the expectations for a company's future growth. For a portfolio, the    
weighted average P/E of the stocks it holds.                                    

Return on Equity. The average rate of return generated by a company during the  
past five years for each dollar of shareholder's equity (net income for the     
year divided by shareholder's equity). For a portfolio, the five-year average   
return on equity for the companies represented in the portfolio.                

R-Squared. R-Squared reflects the percentage of a fund's movements that are     
explained by movements in its benchmark index.                                  

Turnover Rate. Indicates the trading activity during the past year. Portfolios  
with high turnover rates incur higher transaction costs and are more likely to  
realize and distribute capital gains (which are taxable to investors).          

Yield. This is the portfolio's income from interest and dividends. The yield,   
expressed as a percentage of a portfolio's net asset value, is based on income  
earned by the portfolio over the past 30 days and is annualized, or projected   
forward for the coming year.

FAM Value Fund                                                                  
Notes to Financial Statements                                                   

Note 1. Summary of Accounting Policies                                          
FAM Value Fund (the "Fund") is a series of Fenimore Asset Management Trust, a 
no-load, diversified, open-end management investment company registered under 
the Investment Company Act of 1940. The investment objective of the Fund is   
to seek a high long term total return, consisting of appreciation and dividend
income from investments in equity related securities. The following is a      
summary of significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of its 
financial statements.                                                         

a) Valuation of Securities                                                    
Securities traded on a national securities exchange or admitted to      
trading on NASDAQ are valued at the last reported sales price. Common   
stocks for which no sale was reported, and over-the-counter securities, 
are valued at the last reported bid price. Short term securities are    
carried at amortized cost, which approximates market value.             
b) Federal Income Taxes                                                       
It is the Fund's policy to comply with the requirements of the Internal 
Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to        
distribute all of its taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no 
provision for federal income tax is required.                           
c) Use of Estimates                                                           
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally    
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the  
financial statements and the reported amounts of increases and decreases
 in net assets from operations during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.                                      
d) Other                                                                      
Securities transactions are recorded on the trade date basis. Interest  
income is accrued as earned and dividend income is recorded on the      
ex-dividend date. Distributions to shareholders, which are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, are recorded on the ex-dividend 
date.                                                                   

Note 2. Investment Advisory Fees and Other Transactions with Affiliates         
Under the Investment Advisory Contract, the Fund pays an investment advisory  
fee to Fenimore Asset Management, Inc. (the "Advisor") equal, on an annual    
basis, to 1% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Certain officers and     
trustees of the Fund are also officers and directors of the Advisor. The      
Advisor is required to reimburse the Fund for its expenses to the extent that 
such expenses, including the advisory fee, for any fiscal year exceed 2% of   
the average daily net assets. No such reimbursement was required for the      
year ended December 31, 1996. FAM Shareholder Services, Inc. (FSS), a company 
under common control with the Advisor, serves as a shareholder servicing      
agent for which it received a monthly fee of $1.75 per shareholder account.   
Additionally, FSS serves as the fund administrative agent for which it        
received a fee equal, on an annual basis, to .025% of the Fund's average      
daily net assets.                                                             

Note 3. Shares of Beneficial Interest                                           
At December 31, 1996, an unlimited number of $.001 par value shares of        
beneficial interest were authorized. Transactions were as follows:

FAM Value Fund:                                                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the statement of investments, of FAM Value Fund, a series of          
Fenimore Asset Management Trust, as of December 31,
1996, the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the          
statement of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period      
then ended and the selected financial information for each of the five years    
in the period then ended. These financial statements and selected financial     
information are the responsibility of the Fund's management. Our                
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and       
selected financial information based on our audits.                             

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and          
selected financial information are free of material misstatement. An audit      
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and        
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation   
of securities owned as of December 31, 1996, by correspondence with the         
custodian. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used      
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the         
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide    
a reasonable basis for our opinion.                                             

In our opinion, the financial statements and selected financial information     
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial       
position of FAM Value Fund, as of December 31, 1996, the results of its         
operations, the changes in its net assets and the selected financial            
information for the periods indicated, in conformity with generally accepted    
accounting principles.
