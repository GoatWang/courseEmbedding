"The Power of Red is Back expansion campaign continues to deliver strong results.

With additional sites in Medford, NJ and Fairless Hills, PA scheduled to open in the coming weeks the momentum behind our strategy continues to build. The results are a testament to the strength of our model and the unmatched commitment to customer service by every member of the Republic Bank Team."

New stores were recently opened in Cherry Hill and Sicklerville, NJ bringing the total store count to twenty-one.

The Company reported net income of $2.1 million, or $0.04 per share, for the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per share, for the three month period ended June 30, 2016. Net income for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was $3.8 million, or $0.07 per share, compared to net income of $2.1 million, or $0.05 per share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. 
Total revenue increased by $6.1 million, or 37%, to $22.3 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to $16.2 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2016.  This increase is primarily attributable to revenue from the residential mortgage division which was acquired in July 2016. Revenue also increased due to higher interest income as a result of the strong growth in interest-earning assets over the last twelve months driven by the Company's "Power of Red is Back" expansion program.
Non-interest income increased to $5.0 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to $3.0 million for the three month period ended June 30, 2016.  This increase was due to $3.0 million in mortgage banking income, driven primarily by loan sales.  
Non-interest expenses increased by $4.7 million, or 36%, to $17.7 million during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to $13.0 million during the three months ended June 30, 2016. This increase was mainly caused by the addition of expenses related to the residential mortgage division. Salaries and employee benefits were also higher at the Bank as a result of annual merit increases along with increased staffing levels related to our growth strategy of adding and relocating stores. Occupancy and equipment expenses associated with the growth and relocation strategy also contributed to the increase in non-interest expenses.

Core deposits increased to $1.7 billion at June 30, 2017 compared to $1.4 billion at June 30, 2016 as the Company moves forward with its growth strategy to increase the number of stores and expand its customer-centric banking model which drives the gathering of low-cost, core deposits. The Company recognized strongest growth in demand accounts on a year to year basis as a result of the successful execution of its strategy. On a linked quarter basis, a reduction in money market and savings balances in the second quarter of 2017 offset growth in the demand categories.
