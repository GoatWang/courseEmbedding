Analytic U.S. Market Neutral Dynamic Volatility

	The Analytic Investors team has been managing factor-based investments for over 20 years.  The Analytic U.S. Market Neutral strategy takes equal long and short positions, with a net notional exposure target of zero. The strategy primarily adds value by buying stocks with the most attractive factor profiles and shorting stocks with the least attractive factor profiles, within a set of risk constraints. Performance is therefore driven purely by the performance of the valuation model and is only minimally affected by market-wide factors. Risk control is achieved through the use of strict constraints in a non-linear optimization process. It maintains beta, sector, and size neutrality while targeting a 6% to 10 % return over the risk-free rate, with volatility in the 6% to 10% range.

The products enable sophisticated investors to implement volatility strategies without the need to actively trade underlying positions on a daily basis.  All three of the strategies, regardless of the target volatility position, dynamically adjust to daily changes in the volatility market.

ETN Risks
Important information about the VelocityShares ETNs is contained within the current prospectuses. For more complete information regarding the VelocityShares ETNs, download a prospectus from this site, call 1-877-5-VELOCITY or 1-203-992-4301, or write to Prospectus Inquiry, VelocityShares, 17 Old Kings Highway S, Darien, CT, 06820 to request a prospectus. You should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision.
The ETNs are not suitable for all investors. In particular, the ETNs should be purchased only by sophisticated investors who understand the consequences of investing in volatility indices and of seeking inverse or leveraged investment results, who understand the path dependence of the underlying indices and the ETNs, who do not intend to hold the ETNs as a buy and hold investment and who are willing to actively and frequently monitor their investment, even intraday. The ETNs are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives over the short-term, and the effect of non-continuous rebalancing and the resulting path-dependent nature of the exposure of each series of ETNs means that the ETNs may deviate significantly from their target exposure (and may even have exposure that is inverse to their respective intended target exposures) and may therefore fail to achieve their goal, particularly over longer periods of time. Therefore, it is likely that you will suffer significant losses even if the level of the CBOE Volatility Index® (the “VIX Index”) or the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index increases over the long term. In addition, the need to maintain a constant exposure to VIX futures creates the potential for positive or negative returns based on the shape of the VIX futures curve (i.e. whether the market for VIX futures is in contango or in backwardation). These changes are separate from outright movements in VIX futures. As a result, the return on a position in VIX futures may vary significantly from the percentage changes of the VIX Index itself. Typically, though not in all market conditions, this “roll cost” significantly decreases the return for investors who are long VIX futures. As a result of this “roll cost” and other factors that may cause the value of your ETNs to decrease, including the effects of daily and quarterly rebalancing and the combined negative effect of the “Daily Investor Fee” and the “Futures Spread Fee” (each as described in the applicable prospectus supplement), there is a significant possibility that the amount payable on the ETNs at maturity or upon call, early redemption or acceleration will be less than the amount of your initial investment in the ETNs, and that you will lose part or all of your initial investment if you hold the ETNs for a long period of time. UBS does not expect that any investor will hold the ETNs from inception to maturity.
The ETNs do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity and do not pay any interest during their term.
Although we intend to list the ETNs on NYSE Arca, a trading market for your ETNs may not develop. We are not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs on NYSE Arca or any other exchange.
Prior to maturity, you may, subject to certain restrictions described in the prospectus, offer the applicable minimum number of your ETNs to the issuer for redemption on a Redemption Date (as defined in the prospectus). You must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of ETNs (typically 25’000 or 50’000 depending on the product) as set forth in the pricing supplement, or an integral multiple in excess thereof, at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your ETNs on any Early Redemption Date. In addition, the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the stated principal amount of any ETN that is redeemed at the investor’s option, at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement.  Please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the ETNs.
Any payment on the Securities is subject to the ability of UBS AG to satisfy its obligations as they become due.
The risks listed above are not exhaustive. Investors should review the prospectus for each ETN, including all risk factors set forth therein, and consult their independent tax, accounting, legal and financial advisors before investing in any ETN.

              About
            

              Timothy Van Bender, Yale graduate and hedge fund manager in Palo Alto, lives a magical life: his business mints money; he wife, Katherine, is beautiful and charming; his young sexy secretary, Tricia, greets him each morning with a flirtatious smile.

Then, one Tuesday, everything changes. Timothy wakes to learn that his hedge fund has lost $24 million on a bad bet against the Japanese Yen. Timothy decides to double down and bet again. But the Yen keeps climbing, and his business investors start asking questions. With his company on the brink of collapse, he gets a call from his wife, who phones to say goodbye, moments before jumping off a cliff at Big Sur to her death. Timothy can't believe it, and nor, for that matter, can the local police.

And that's when his troubles start. As the police investigate Timothy, he investigates his dead wife's secrets. But when Tricia shows up on Timothy's doorstep, claiming to be his dead wife, and knowing secrets that only Katherine could know, Timothy's not sure what, or whom, to believe. Has he been given a second chance at happiness or is he being played for a fool in an elaborate scam that may cost him his life?

Morningstar Rating

Overall LifePath Dynamic Retirement Fund received a Morningstar Rating of 4 stars for the 3-year period, 4 stars for the 5-year period and - stars for the 10-year period, rated against 137, 114 and 66 Target-Date Retirement Funds, respectively. Performance results represent past performance and are no guarantee of future results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For each U.S.-domiciled fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar RatingTM based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund&#39;s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars and the bottom 10% receive one star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted-average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5- and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morningstar Ratings are for the share classes cited only; other classes may have different ratings.

Important Information

 

* As of 9/30/2016 
 

Carefully consider the Funds' investment objectives, risk factors, and charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the Funds' prospectuses or, if available, the summary prospectuses which may be obtained by visiting the iShares Fund and BlackRock Fund prospectus pages. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


The fund is actively managed and its characteristics will vary.

Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.

Fund of funds are subject to the risks associated with the underlying BlackRock funds in which it invests.

International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.

Fixed income risks include interest-rate and credit risk. Typically, when interest rates rise, there is a corresponding decline in bond values. Credit risk refers to the possibility that the bond issuer will not be able to make principal and interest payments.

Asset allocation strategies do not assure profit and do not protect against loss.

Non-diversification of investments means that more assets are potentially invested in fewer securities than if investments were diversified, so risk is increased because each investment has a greater effect on performance.

The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.

The target date in the funds name is the approximate date an investor plans to start withdrawing money. The principal value is not guaranteed at any time, including at the target date.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).
