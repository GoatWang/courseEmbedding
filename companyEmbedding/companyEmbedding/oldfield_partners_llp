Past events / presentations
 We hold investor days presenting twice a year on global equities (followed by Q&A) and once a year a meeting with Q&A on all equity strategies. These tend to be mid-sized groups of about thirty in the audience. We have occasional single strategy afternoon sessions with between one and twelve attendees in our offices at 4pm. These allow a group of potential or actual investors to dig a little deeper in one area of speciality and benefit both from being a smaller group and from the thoughts of others.Those on our mailing lists will receive invitations to our events. 
If you are not on our mailing lists but would like to attend, please contact us.
