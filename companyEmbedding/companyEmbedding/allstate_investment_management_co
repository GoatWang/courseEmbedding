Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

Vanguard - Target-date strategies                                     
        


























































Your input was invalid






























Enduring. Holistic.Defendable. Vanguard Target Retirement Funds










 



Not all target-date funds are created equal.™ 






Our infographic can help you evaluate your target-date fund (TDF) strategy. It includes three steps that focus on TDF costs, stability, and investor focus.                                 Learn more.






















Target-date strategies
Selecting a target-date fund (TDF) series for your qualified default investment alternative can be a critical step in designing a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan that can stand up to the scrutiny from many quarters, including regulators.

Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer a sophisticated design and a clear, straightforward glide path that's a natural fit for autoenrollment and default investment programs—a TDF strategy that can help lower your fiduciary risk and help improve the odds of your plan participants achieving their retirement goals.



Fiduciaries value not only the sophisticated methodology behind the Vanguard Target Retirement portfolio, but also the clarity of the glide path, index implementation, and high degree of transparency.
John Croke
Target Retirement Fund Product Manager










Enduring investment solution
With Vanguard, you'll have a target-date retirement solution that is implemented with a well-diversified set of market-cap-weighted index funds. The embedded diversification of this approach provides balance against the markets‘ natural ups and downs.





Reaching goals through a holistic approach
Vanguard's target-date funds are designed by investment, plan design, and participant behavior experts. This integrated approach puts participants at the heart of your target-date offering so you can have confidence that your target-date offering can help your participants reach their retirement goals.





Defendable performance year after year
The combination of consistent, prudent product oversight and our history of reducing costs help you deliver defensible performance to investment committees and plan participants year after year.


Sophisticated portfolio construction
The Target Retirement Funds are designed by Vanguard's respected investment managers and asset allocation experts and are grounded in ongoing, cross-disciplinary research. The glide path reflects a long-term, holistic view of retirement investing.



MORE ABOUT TARGET-DATE STRATEGIES
Research & commentary

* Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer the simplicity of an index-oriented, well-diversified portfolio that is strategic and straightforward in its approach. The funds are composed of five underlying index funds and follow an easy-to-understand asset allocation glide path. Underlying this simplicity is Vanguard's deep investment expertise, knowledge of the capital markets, and insights into participant behavior.
Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments (stocks) to more conservative ones (bonds and short-term reserves) based on its
                   target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
              
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.

Your portfolio manager is a key member of your U.S. Trust relationship team and serves as your personal "chief investment officer." He or she will work with you to create an Investment Policy Statement, which serves as a blueprint for your portfolio by documenting your:

Objectives
Risk tolerance
Cash flow needs
 Tax situation
Wealth aspirations

Your portfolio manager's ongoing role is to incorporate our best strategic and tactical thinking, most relevant research analysis, current market insights and appropriate investment solutions into your portfolio. He or she will regularly monitor your portfolio to make sure it conforms to your Investment Policy Statement, which will be updated whenever there are significant changes in your life or goals.
Asset management
A more complete approach to asset allocation1
We analyze a wide range of asset classes, including hedge and private equity funds2 and global investment opportunities, as potential components of an asset allocation. In addition, we believe that true diversification requires managing for cash flows across and within asset classes in various market environments — not simply allocating according to a grid.
Your asset allocation will be based on the long-term expectations established for each asset class by our most senior investment professionals. Over the shorter term, however, your portfolio manager can adjust your portfolio tactically in response to emerging opportunities and risks, and reflecting U.S. Trust insights about trends and themes relevant to you.
How you own your assets — personally or in trusts; in taxable or tax-exempt solutions — can have a material impact on the overall performance of your portfolio. At U.S. Trust we focus on this wealth structuring aspect of your portfolio in conjunction with managing the assets themselves.
Alternative Investments
SOPHISTICATED SOLUTIONS TO MEET YOUR NEEDS2
Alternative investments at U.S. Trust focus on non-traditional assets such as:

Hedge funds
Private equity
Real estate and tangible assets

Because performance is often differentiated from equity and fixed income markets, alternative investments may be an ideal complement to traditional investments. 
Through our access to the industry's premier managers, we are able to offer solutions that provide options for all client segments. And we support you every step of the way with knowledge built on our experience in alternatives, including industry-leading research, rigorous due diligence, and cutting-edge portfolio construction.
Drawing from the experience, resources and expertise of the firm, you and your portfolio manager can explore alternative investments that can help you pursue what matters most to you.
Specialty asset management
Expertise in nonfinancial assets3
Specialty asset management at U.S. Trust focuses on nonfinancial assets such as:

Farm and ranch land
Timberland
Oil and gas properties
Private businesses
Real estate

Our Specialty Asset Management team can work with your portfolio manager and wealth strategist, as appropriate, to integrate these real assets into your overall plan and portfolio.
We can help you realize your objectives with assets you already own, or help you acquire specific assets to take advantage of their capital growth and diversification potential — whether you own these assets outright or they are held in trust.
Our team of specialists can provide complete turnkey services including identifying and purchasing real property and providing ongoing management.
Capital markets
Sophisticated market-linked solutions4
Through our access to the resources of Merrill Lynch, one of the world's leading capital markets participants, we can tailor approaches to risks and opportunities in the foreign exchange, interest rate, commodity and equity markets. Derivative-based transactions target the risks you seek to hedge, and are designed to dovetail with your overall portfolio and wealth management strategies.

1 Asset allocation and diversification do not ensure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.
2 Alternative Investments such as derivatives, hedge funds, private equity funds, and funds of funds can result in higher return potential but also higher loss potential. Changes in economic conditions or other circumstances may adversely affect your investments. Before you invest in alternative investments, you should consider your overall financial situation, how much money you have to invest, your need for liquidity, and your tolerance for risk. Alternative investments are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.
3 Nonfinancial assets, such as closely-held businesses, real estate, oil, gas and mineral properties, and timber, farm and ranch land, are complex in nature and involve risks including total loss of value.  Special risk considerations include natural events (for example, earthquakes or fires), complex tax considerations, and lack of liquidity.  Nonfinancial assets are not suitable for all investors.  Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager, and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax, or estate planning strategy.
4 Brokerage services are provided by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, a registered broker-dealer, Member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation.
Certain U.S. Trust associates are registered representatives with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated ("MLPF&S") and may assist you with investment products and services provided through MLPF&S and other nonbank investment affiliates. MLPF&S is a registered broker-dealer, member SIPC and a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation ("BofA Corp."). U.S. Trust operates through Bank of America, N.A., and other subsidiaries of BofA Corp.

Proud to partner
The External Managers Group collaborates with Portfolio Management, Risk and internal asset class teams to align our areas of focus and contribute to overall investment results. Allstate seeks to partner with external asset managers to implement strategies that complement our internally managed portfolio exposures. In some cases this includes asset classes where we do not have in-house expertise or we have chosen to augment our capabilities through the use of external managers.
We take a disciplined approach to underwriting external partners. In addition to a thorough understanding of specific investment expertise, our due diligence takes into consideration the potential to leverage the relationship beyond the mandate in question. Our most successful partnerships have enabled us to tap into the breadth and depth of resources that our partners possess.
As we implement new relationships, we require strong communication and data-sharing capabilities to ensure that risk and exposures are properly reflected in our internal systems. While the initial start-up process can be time-consuming, we feel the benefits gained are key to building a successful partnership and delivering investment results for Allstate.


      Our External Managers team allows us to augment our existing capabilities in order to generate additional value for Allstate. We are sophisticated investors and work with external managers as partners to help us extend our capabilities and take advantage of market opportunities.

 Strategic allocation, dynamic risk

Our portfolio management begins with our global economic and market outlook, which informs a quantitative modeling process that balances risk and return, factoring in elements such as diversification, duration, liquidity and capital.
We overlay key global themes and trends and invite a variety of diverse perspectives as we make asset allocation decisions. Our portfolio managers then assess fundamentals, valuations and technical factors across markets to generate strong returns through the investment cycle.

Our collective team experience covers a broad array of asset classes, industries, sectors and geographies. We have a proven track record of delivering strong results by taking a client-centered, proactive, innovative and flexible approach to investing.

Beyond who we are, it’s where we are. We believe a global presence sharpens our investment expertise, which is why we’ve established offices beyond our Northbrook headquarters to include London and Hong Kong. With eyes and ears across time zones, we keep a steadfast pulse on the market. We’re also proud to partner with top tier global asset managers and sponsors to extend our investing capabilities.
Mastering the Market
From public to private, our asset management groups perform investment underwriting, trading and portfolio management functions. Informed by global research, we have absolute and relative return strategies with short, intermediate and long duration targets.
Realizing Risk
The Risk and Return Management group analyzes portfolio risks and exposures, performs quantitative research and consults with clients. This includes defining investment portfolios and allocations that meet investment needs.
Backed by the Best
We benefit from the full support and expertise of Allstate’s operations, finance, technology, legal and compliance teams. These groups understand the capital markets and work side-by-side with our investments professionals to help deliver returns.
As crucial counterparts, our internal partners provide important insights into portfolio performance, and help ensure:

State-of-the-art technology platforms
Strong governance and compliance standards
Transparent reporting
Effective planning and analytical tools
Sound legal counsel

Together, we’re proud to support the trusted brand of one of the largest and most well-known publicly held insurance companies.

Socially Responsible Investing
Allstate has roughly $900 million invested in socially responsible strategies, like a low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) portfolio and a Diversity and Emerging Managers program.
We manage these investments to produce solid returns and meet business objectives, while advancing social goals like environmental protection, home ownership, community development and opportunities for diverse talent.

              When we continuously improve our customer experience, our business thrives, and we enable our customers to live a good life.            





Introduction
At its core, insurance represents a collaborative approach to risk, and Allstate is the resource broker for this collaboration. By accurately and efficiently assessing and managing claims, we continue to be a force for good and maintain the trust of our valued customers. By innovating, we ensure our business successfully maneuvers the rapid industry transitions due to advances in information technology. 







Knowledge Management
The world’s workforce is changing and the learning and training preferences of millennials are different from past generations. They prefer digital, centralized media. To support our evolving claims team, in 2016, Allstate began implementing our knowledge management system. We customized and designed the system to provide claims employees with uniform information. This includes centralized training content that is palatable to a wide-range of employees.  Today, our claims process is increasingly streamlined and consistent. This strategy also:
•	Increases employee efficiency, improving customer experience
•	Improves the quality of claims handling
•	Reduces informal training time
•	Reduces redundant resources and effort needed to create, distribute and maintain
We know the customer experience begins and ends with our employees. Our team’s capability to deliver high quality and consistent claims experiences is at the core of driving high customer satisfaction.







Continuous Improvement
Continuous Improvement (CI) is a management system that improves customer experience, agency owner and staff experience and business outcomes by empowering employees to advance their work methodology. The CI deployments have generated excitement and significant impact around employee engagement, customer experience and efficiency dimensions. To date, we have implemented CI in all claims express operations. By year-end 2016, all auto field operations will participate in the CI environment, totaling more than 35 claims offices.
Efforts are underway to deploy a systemic CI model across the remaining claims lines of business. This approach will be piloted at the senior leadership level and include a national deployment strategy and a root-cause problem-solving database. Our goal is to complete the implementation of CI across all claims offices by the end of 2017.







Preventative Home Care
Many of us know of preventative healthcare.  In that same vein, Allstate is helping homeowners consider preventative care of their homes. Our Home Checkup program gives our customers an in-depth assessment of their home to help them better understand their risks and provide recommendations of maintenance measures. We tailor the assessment, conducted onsite by an Allstate inspector, to the interests and home care goals of each customer.







Simplifying the Claims Process
We work hard to ensure our claims process is as simple and stress free as possible. By continuously improving our claims process, we drive customer retention and satisfaction. In 2014, we undertook an assessment of our claims process called End 2 End. The assessment found customers prefer interacting with one claims professional throughout the process rather than multiple people. In response, Allstate now assigns a claim owner to each case. The owner is responsible for the entirety of the claims process, including:
•	Reaching an agreement on liability with the at-fault insurance carrier and expediting the customer deductible upon agreement
•	Informing insureds and claimants when supplemental damage to their vehicles is identified and explaining the impact to repair time and rental car extension
•	Incorporating the explanation of medical payment or personal injury protection coverage and process as part of the initial loss fact-gathering contact rather than having a medical specialist perform the explanation
Results of the trial show the average number of claims professionals our customers encountered dropped from 4.5 to 2.1 in 2014.  In 2015, we began migrating all of our claims processes to this new model, including our property claims. 
Beyond the clear benefits to our customers, we found this process improved our claims handlers’ familiarity with the claims process as a whole. Further, it improves their ability to establish personal relationships with our customers because of their increased interaction. In light of this success, we are committing more resources to continuous improvement in this area. 







Quantitative Research and Analytics
Allstate’s quantitative research and data analytics team works to leverage our data management system, NextGen, to identify and prevent risks to our customers. While this system provides our workforce with actionable tasks, the team maximizes its value by applying their models to create milestones, making our risk identification even more proactive.
We also use data analytics to predict and identify fraudulent claims. To this end, we continuously update sophisticated mathematical models developed by our Special Investigation Unit (SIU). In 2015, we submitted 23 civil actions against fraud perpetrators, seeking damages of nearly $69 million.








 



Improving Access to Information
The accessibility and quality of data continues to improve across the business landscape. In order to capitalize on this megatrend, we created several initiatives that increase our connectivity with customers.
• Connected Home: We offer customer discounts for installing monitoring devices for intruder alarms, smoke detection, carbon monoxide leaks, lighting, temperature level and appliance usage.
• The Allstate Digital Locker®: To expedite claims in the case of an event, Allstate developed The Allstate Digital Locker application, available by phone or internet connection, which allows users to keep a digital list of their personal property.
• Drivewise: Using a mobile app or plug-in device, we can inform our customers when they are demonstrating risky driving behavior. More recently, we modified the program to give cash back to customers with safe driving habits.









 
Technology
Advances in technology continue to open doors to previously unimaginable services. Surveys indicate that our customers are looking for more control of their insurance experience through digital media. By developing the technologies involved in the claims process, we empower our customers to contact us with ease.
Self-service
While Allstate will always maintain options for a personal insurance experience, many of our customers voice a strong interest in self-service options. To meet the rising demand for self-service insurance, Allstate is improving our online claims experience. Already, we are revamping our online presence by streamlining the process of filing and checking the status of claims.
Virtual Interactions
The rise of audio-visual communication presents Allstate with tremendous opportunities to improve the quality and experience of our claims process. We currently utilize several applications to virtually connect with our customers and vendors to collaborate during the claim’s life cycle including the assessment of damage. We are actively testing new drone technology to potentially deploy to better service our customers, for example, in flooded or hurricane impacted areas where access is limited. 
QuickFoto
We have an app for that. QuickFoto allows our customers to upload photos of their auto accidents. Using these photos, we can rapidly assess damages and complete the claims process, often within a few days. 
Fast Mobile e-Payment
Our Fast Mobile e-Payment system, requiring only an email address or mobile phone number, is the new industry standard for quick and stress-free claims payment. This new digital payment process dramatically cuts wait time and paper waste. Fast Mobile e-payment is faster than electronic fund transfers and is available across the U.S. It works with any bank for all Allstate auto and property insurance claims that have a single payee.











              Allstate leverages our resources as an institutional investor to be a force for good.            






 



Introduction
With over $77.8 billion in assets, Allstate’s investment decisions represent a critical part of our corporate footprint. How we choose to invest our assets affects our employees, customers and investors. By investing in high-performance portfolios, our employees enjoy financial stability, we protect our ability to pay the claims of our customers and we attract further investment. 
In 2015, we set aside approximately $772 million of our investments to invest in portfolios that are both high performance and socially responsible. Our socially responsible portfolios not only provide Allstate with strong returns, but also often yield positive externalities, the financial impacts of which are difficult to quantify. We provide the best value to our shareholders by taking a competitive and holistic approach to investing.
Last year, our $772 million in sustainable investments included:
•	$51 million in our Socially Responsible Investments portfolio
•	$491 million in a low-income-housing tax credit (LIHTC) portfolio
•	$230 million in renewable energy







Nurturing Diverse Talent in Asset Management
The number of multicultural and diverse households continues to grow, shifting the United States toward a nation where minorities compose a majority of the population. Despite research showing that diverse investing teams consistently outperform less diverse investing teams, women and minorities are still underrepresented in the private equity and real estate private equity investment sectors. Allstate works to secure the continuity of our workforce through a variety of diversity initiatives (to read more about inclusive diversity at Allstate, click here).  To ensure our investment team demonstrates superior performance and helps bridge the underrepresentation gap, Allstate created the Diversity Emerging Managers program.
The goal of Allstate’s Diversity Emerging Manager program is to identify the next generation of women and minority investment managers. To do this, we collaborate with Grosvenor Capital Management to select women- and minority-owned firms that demonstrate excellence to participate in the program. Of the $100 million allocated to the program, Allstate has committed $65 million toward participating firms. We carefully assess the returns on the funds we commit for investment.
In addition to our financial commitment, the participating firms also receive development training from Grosvenor Capital Management that covers a wide range of topics related to operating an asset management firm, including management, finance and marketing.







Impact Community Capital
Impact Community Capital (ICC) was founded to create a bridge between low-income communities in need of investment and insurance companies with a need to entrust their policyholders’ capital in impactful and profitable investments. Since its inception, the sum of ICC’s socially responsible investments in underserved communities has grown to more than $1 billion. The ICC invests in affordable housing, healthcare and economic development. 
Since 2000, Allstate has helped ICC increase its ability to finance affordable housing by investing in securitized loans packaged by its Impact Community Impact Loan (Impact CIL) affiliate. Impact CIL purchases mortgage loans on newly constructed or rehabilitated affordable multifamily housing properties, most of which are eligible for Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC). When the mortgage pool reaches an optimal size, the loans are securitized. Under the Community Impact Loan Program, Impact CIL has provided more than $800 million of financing on project loans comprising more than 33,000 low-income housing units.







The Perspectives Charter Schools and Allstate Partnership
In 2010, Allstate Investments began hosting students from Perspectives Charter School, a school on the South Side of Chicago, at our Northbrook, IL headquarters. Over the course of the five-day internship, up to 20 high school juniors are exposed to the broad range of professions at Allstate, with a focus on investing, which is a professional field often overlooked by high school students. This program enables Allstate to deepen our relationship with the Chicago community.  
The program introduces the students to investment concepts and what it means to trade for a large institutional investor. Through our Investing Challenge, the students apply these investment concepts by selecting stocks, tracking performance and presenting the results to the Investment Department. The internship also provides the students with opportunities to meet diverse employees from various disciplines across the company, including marketing, legal, technology, agency ownership, communications and human resources.  We emphasize to the students the need to plan for their career through a strong focus on their education and networking, and to plan for retirement at an early age–both of which help to achieve long-term financial health. We are proud of this unique partnership and continue to expand the reach and depth of programming each year. 











              Integrity is central to our business. We believe that doing what’s best for our customers begins and ends with operating by only the highest ethical principles.            





Introduction
Allstate’s success depends on our collective culture of ethics. We are proud of our reputation, which we have built on the sturdiest of foundations: integrity, honesty, caring, accountability and superior performance.
Conducting business with integrity doesn’t just attract new customers and benefit our bottom line—it engages our workforce. We received an 82 percent favorable score (considered “exceptional” performance) on our 2015 VOICE survey for our environment of trust. Allstate’s environment of trust is one of our nine most significant drivers of engagement, retention and satisfaction, according to the survey.







Code of Ethics
Allstate’s Code of Ethics outlines the values that are the core of who we are and what we do. Our values define our culture and our beliefs, and set forth expectations for how we conduct our work. In addition to our Code of Ethics, we have policies for:
• Anticorruption/bribery
• Antitrust/competition
• Confidential information
• Conflicts of interest
• Data privacy (e.g., employees, customers, consumers)
• Diversity/discrimination/equal employment opportunity
• Fair dealing (fair business practices)
• Fair employment
• Gifts and entertainment
• Information security
• Insider trading
• Intellectual property
• Misconduct investigations
• Non-retaliation
• Political contributions, activities and lobbying
• Procurement integrity/dealing with suppliers/supply chain oversight
• Protecting company assets
• Records management and retention
• Social media
• Workplace harassment
• Workplace health and safety







Governance
Allstate has a robust governance structure for ethics and compliance. In 2015, we had approximately 400 Allstaters across the enterprise focusing on ethics and compliance initiatives. Of these, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer is the most senior individual overseeing our ethics and compliance program. In this role, our CECO is responsible for the company’s code of conduct; ethics and compliance budgeting; the hiring of related positions; and, to a lesser extent, procurement practices. The CECO meets with the Board of Directors twice per year and reports on the company’s performance and initiatives.
We also house an Internal Controls Committee that is cross-functional and includes managers and executives. The committee convenes on a quarterly basis and discusses a wide variety of management topics related to ethics and compliance, including performance, education, risk and culture.
Ethics and Compliance Risk Assessment
We conduct a highly collaborative risk assessment on an annual basis. Through this assessment, we assess risks related to:
• Anticorruption/bribery
• Antitrust/competition
• Conflicts of interest
• Data privacy laws and regulations relevant to employee, customer, or consumer data
• Financial integrity and fraud
• Gifts and entertainment
• Information technology security
• Insider trading
• Money laundering
• Political contributions, activities and lobbying
• Procurement integrity/dealing with suppliers/supply chain oversight







Training and Communication
Board of Directors
Allstate’s culture of integrity begins with our most senior leaders. Our Board of Directors receives specialized ethics and decision-making education. In addition, we provide them with training on topics such as insider trading, cyber security, conflicts of interest and regulatory developments.
Employees
We distribute our Code of Ethics to all of our employees along with a formally documented ethics and compliance education curriculum. We conduct ethics and compliance training both as a standard part of the onboarding process and on an annual basis, and monitor its effectiveness through a variety of internal measures. As of 2015, 100 percent of our employees had completed ethics and compliance training—a condition of employment at Allstate.
In addition to Code of Ethics training, select employees undergo risk-specific training that addresses topics such as anticorruption, conflicts of interest, data privacy, equal opportunity, insider trading, procurement, social media, workplace harassment and money laundering.
Managers
All of our managers undergo targeted training with respect to their special responsibilities toward compliance and ethics.
We focus our manager training on creating an environment where employees feel comfortable speaking up when they observe unethical behavior, handling reports, and preventing retaliation. To measure the impact of our training, we:
• Document manager feedback
• Track misconduct
• Record the frequency with which the Code of Ethics is downloaded
• Conduct an employee survey annually to determine the strength of Allstate’s culture of ethics
Our culture of ethics survey is one of the primary drivers of feedback within our ethics and compliance initiatives. After we compile the results, the CECO presents them to each senior leader at a face-to-face meeting. At this meeting, we identify areas of strength and of opportunity, and many of our business areas develop their own customized solutions to address them.







Recognition
Allstate was named as a 2015 and 2016 World’s Most Ethical Company® by the Ethisphere Institute, a global leader in defining and advancing the standards of ethical business practices. The “World’s Most Ethical Companies” designation recognizes those organizations that significantly influence the way business is conducted by fostering a culture of ethics and transparency at every level of the company. To qualify, companies are scored in five categories, including ethics and compliance; corporate citizenship and responsibility; a culture of ethics; governance and leadership; and innovation and reputation.







Reporting Concerns
We encourage our employees to report any activity they observe or experience that causes concern. Should an employee decide to report a concern, they can contact their manager, another manager, or a Human Resources representative. Additionally, they can utilize our companywide reporting process, available 24/7, via phone or web. They also can choose to remain anonymous if the law permits. In 2015, approximately 44 percent of our employees who filed reports chose to do so anonymously.
After an employee files a report, it is tracked within our established case management system. The system records and logs reports and related investigations regardless of how the report was originally made.
Allstate policy and the Code of Ethics prohibit any form of retaliation for reporting a workplace or ethical concern.

Allstate Investments expands team with a hire and a promotion


October 15, 2014
By Iris Dorbian






Allstate Investments has hired Russell K. Mayerfeld as a senior managing director and promoted Peter Keehn to managing director of private equity investing. Mayerfeld is the former managing director of investment banking at UBS and its predecessors while Keehn first joined Allstate in 2003 a director to head the company’s then $450 million alternative assets portfolio.
PRESS RELEASE
NORTHBROOK, Ill., Oct. 14, 2014 /PRNewswire/ — The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) has expanded its senior leadership team in investments. Russell K. Mayerfeld has joined Allstate as a senior managing director, reporting to Judith P. Greffin, chief investment officer. Peter Keehn, CFA, has been promoted to managing director, private equity investing, reporting to Mayerfeld.
“We expect to capture additional higher-returning investment opportunities by leveraging Russ’ leadership, broad expertise and extensive experience,” Greffin said. “We have an excellent track record, and our team is in a strong position to increase the breadth and size of Allstate’s portfolio in these asset classes.”
Russ Mayerfeld
Mayerfeld oversees approximately $10 billion of Allstate’s investments, including private equity, infrastructure and real assets, real estate and commercial mortgage loans. Throughout his career, he has worked extensively with insurance companies and other financial institutions. Recently, Mayerfeld served as an independent consultant to private equity funds and corporations and as a board member for private and public companies. Mayerfeld was managing director, investment banking of UBS LLC and its predecessors from 1997 to 2003, and managing director, investment banking of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. from 1988 to 1997. He holds an MBA from Harvard University and a bachelor’s degree from the University of Illinois. 





“I am delighted to join Allstate Investments,” Mayerfeld said. “I look forward to building on the success of the team to position Allstate as an even more dynamic investor in this evolving sector. We will leverage the skills and experience of our alternative investment professionals, as well as the breadth and scale of the Allstate enterprise, to source attractive opportunities. With our size, flexibility and creativity, we will continue to help our portfolio companies achieve their objectives.”
Allstate will expand its alternative investment portfolio over the next several years, with much of the growth coming from direct investments. “Allstate will continue to be a fund investor while leveraging its relationships to generate additional direct investments. Ultimately, this dual approach is designed to produce more favorable risk-adjusted returns for the benefit of Allstate’s shareholders and policyholders,” Mayerfeld said.
Peter Keehn
Keehn will continue to lead Allstate’s global private equity investing group, which includes the infrastructure and real assets team, managing a portfolio of approximately $3 billion. Recently, he shifted the focus of Allstate’s private equity activities to include more direct investing and co-investments. In 2007, Keehn established Allstate’s London office to enhance the firm’s global perspective and gain greater access to investment opportunities around the world. He joined Allstate in 2003 as a director to head the company’s then $450 million alternative assets portfolio. Earlier in his career, he was a principal at Waud Capital Partners and a director at Northwestern Investment Management Co. Keehn has an MBA from Northwestern University and a bachelor’s degree from Brown University. He is a chartered financial analyst. Keehn serves on several private equity advisory boards and has been a director of numerous private companies and nonprofit organizations. 





“I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to continue expanding Allstate’s private equity investments and further developing the expertise of our portfolio team,” Keehn said. “We see strong opportunities throughout the world in this asset class. It’s an important component in the proactive management of Allstate’s portfolio to achieve attractive returns for the benefit of our policyholders and shareholders.”
The Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL) is the nation’s largest publicly held personal lines insurer, protecting approximately 16 million households from life’s uncertainties through its Allstate, Encompass, Esurance and Answer Financial brand names and Allstate Financial business segment. Allstate is widely known through the slogan “You’re In Good Hands With Allstate®.” The Allstate brand’s network of small businesses offers auto, home, life and retirement products and services to customers in the United States and Canada. In 2013, The Allstate Foundation, Allstate, its employees and agency owners gave $29 million to support local communities. Allstate employees and agency owners donated 200,000 hours of service across the country.

		October 14, 2014					


Allstate Corp. is bringing on some new executives focused on the investment side of its operations.
The largest publicly traded personal lines insurer in the United States said it hired Russell Mayerfeld as a senior managing director. He reports directly to Chief Investment Officer Judith Greffin, and will oversee about $10 billion of Allstate’s investments. That portfolio includes private equity, infrastructure and real assets, real estate and commercial mortgage loans, the Illinois-based company said.
Mayerfeld is a big hire. As Allstate noted, his experience include having served as a managing director, investment banking at UBS LLC and its predecessors. He was also managing director, investment banking at Dean Witter Reynolds. As well, Mayerfeld was an independent consultant to private equity funds and corporations, and also served as a board member for a number of private and public companies. Importantly, he’s worked through his career focused extensively on insurance companies and various financial institutions, Allstate said in the announcement.
Also, Allstate promoted Peter Keehn to managing director, private equity investing, and he’ll report directly to Mayerfeld.
In Keehn’s role, he’ll still lead Allstate’s global private equity investing group (including infrastructure and real assets team members) and manage a $3 billion portfolio, Allstate said. The company credits Keehn with shifting the focus of Allstate’s private equity business to include more direct investing and co-investments. He’s also the guy who launched Allstate’s London office, with a goal of boosting Allstate’s ability to access global investment opportunities.
Keehn’s prior experience includes working as a principal at Waud Capital Partners. As well, he was a director at Northwestern Investment Management Co. and has been a director at a number of private companies and nonprofit groups, Allstate said.
Keehn first joined Allstate in 2003, as a director to head the insurer’s $450 million (at the time) alternative assets portfolio.
Allstate’s products include auto, home and life insurance, retirement products and related services. They’re offered through brands including Allstate, Encompass, Esurance, Answer Financial and Allstate Financial.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Advisory services
Many organizations like yours find it challenging to oversee their portfolio while also managing the day-to-day responsibilities of running their endowment, foundation, or charitable organization. But partnering with a provider who understands your needs can help you better balance these competing priorities.
Partnering with your organization
Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services® (VIAS) offers nonprofits the considerable resources of a large investment firm like Vanguard with the customized service of a specialized boutique. When your organization partners with VIAS, you work with a team of investment professionals that has your objectives and fiduciary responsibilities in mind. VIAS strives to:

Understand your organization's mission, spending needs, and unique situation and offer sophisticated, unbiased advice.
Develop a low-cost portfolio customized to your organization's needs.
Relieve your staff of many of the day-to-day burdens of investment program management.

OCIO: One service, many names


One approach nonprofits are increasingly considering is an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO). An OCIO service—which is a key offering of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services—acts as an extension of the board and investment staff. The OCIO determines an asset allocation strategy, selects investment advisors to implement it, and manages its operation and execution. Investment providers and clients call this service a variety of names, including discretionary management, advisory services, and investment management.





Investing and advising
Optimizing your portfolio to meet your long-term investment objectives requires time and skill. VIAS helps you develop a tailored portfolio that ensures your investments are diversified, risk-appropriate, and aligned with your overall strategy.
Our comprehensive advisory services include:









Portfolio construction 

Asset allocation analysis that uses a distinct, proprietary model to deliver solutions based on your portfolio needs.
Investment policy consulting designed to meet the unique investment goals of your organization.
Customized product selection that focuses on low-cost index and active investments.











Portfolio management

Performance reporting to help keep your investment committee informed.
Investment reviews that provide insights into your portfolio and the broader market and economic environment.
Steadfast commitment to risk management and process excellence through ongoing portfolio monitoring and rebalancing.








Research & expertise

Investment expertise and commentary on financial issues that provide context for your decision-making.
Investment committee best practices that are designed to increase your group's effectiveness.





Notes:

Advice services offered through Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services are provided by Vanguard Advisers, Inc., a registered investment advisor.
All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest. 
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.

Vanguard - Target-date strategies                                     
        


























































Your input was invalid






























Enduring. Holistic.Defendable. Vanguard Target Retirement Funds










 



Not all target-date funds are created equal.™ 






Our infographic can help you evaluate your target-date fund (TDF) strategy. It includes three steps that focus on TDF costs, stability, and investor focus.                                 Learn more.






















Target-date strategies
Selecting a target-date fund (TDF) series for your qualified default investment alternative can be a critical step in designing a defined contribution (DC) retirement plan that can stand up to the scrutiny from many quarters, including regulators.

Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer a sophisticated design and a clear, straightforward glide path that's a natural fit for autoenrollment and default investment programs—a TDF strategy that can help lower your fiduciary risk and help improve the odds of your plan participants achieving their retirement goals.



Fiduciaries value not only the sophisticated methodology behind the Vanguard Target Retirement portfolio, but also the clarity of the glide path, index implementation, and high degree of transparency.
John Croke
Target Retirement Fund Product Manager










Enduring investment solution
With Vanguard, you'll have a target-date retirement solution that is implemented with a well-diversified set of market-cap-weighted index funds. The embedded diversification of this approach provides balance against the markets‘ natural ups and downs.





Reaching goals through a holistic approach
Vanguard's target-date funds are designed by investment, plan design, and participant behavior experts. This integrated approach puts participants at the heart of your target-date offering so you can have confidence that your target-date offering can help your participants reach their retirement goals.





Defendable performance year after year
The combination of consistent, prudent product oversight and our history of reducing costs help you deliver defensible performance to investment committees and plan participants year after year.


Sophisticated portfolio construction
The Target Retirement Funds are designed by Vanguard's respected investment managers and asset allocation experts and are grounded in ongoing, cross-disciplinary research. The glide path reflects a long-term, holistic view of retirement investing.



MORE ABOUT TARGET-DATE STRATEGIES
Research & commentary

* Vanguard Target Retirement Funds offer the simplicity of an index-oriented, well-diversified portfolio that is strategic and straightforward in its approach. The funds are composed of five underlying index funds and follow an easy-to-understand asset allocation glide path. Underlying this simplicity is Vanguard's deep investment expertise, knowledge of the capital markets, and insights into participant behavior.
Investments in Target Retirement Funds are subject to the risks of their underlying funds. The year in the fund name refers to the approximate year (the target date) when an investor in the fund would retire and leave the workforce. The fund will gradually shift its emphasis from more aggressive investments (stocks) to more conservative ones (bonds and short-term reserves) based on its
                   target date. An investment in a Target Retirement Fund is not guaranteed at any time, including on or after the target date.
              
All investing is subject to risk, including the possible loss of the money you invest.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or protect against a loss.
There is no guarantee that any particular asset allocation or mix of funds will meet your investment objectives or provide you with a given level of income.

The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

To date, those donations exceed $2.9 million. Allstate also sponsors branded nets during field goals and extra points at over 20 college bowl games, including the Allstate Sugar Bowl and the BCS National Championship Game.
Additionally, Allstate is a partner of the Southeastern Conference and its 20 sports, including football.[24]

Since 2007, Allstate has been the title sponsor of the Sugar Bowl, one of the four games that make up the Bowl Championship Series. The game is played at the Louisiana Superdome, which is also the home of the New Orleans Saints. Allstate is also a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints.

Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".

The corporate spokesperson is Dennis Haysbert.

History[edit]
In 1925, Sears held a national contest to decide the name of a new brand of car tires. After over two million name submissions, "Allstate" was chosen as the winner; the trademark was adopted the very next year. The tires' success in both the catalog and retail stores prompted Sears Chairman General Robert E. Wood to praise the Allstate tire's contribution to Sears' retail store success.[1]
The idea for Allstate Insurance Company came during a bridge game on a commuter train in 1930, when insurance broker Carl L. Odell proposed to Wood, his neighbor, the idea of selling auto insurance by direct mail. The idea appealed to Wood, and he passed the proposal to the Sears board of directors, which approved it. Allstate Insurance Company, named after Sears’ tire brand, went into business on April 17, 1931, offering auto insurance by direct mail and through the Sears catalog.[7] This was in line with one of the objectives of a company to sell automobile insurance in the same manner as Sears sold its merchandise.[8]
Lessing J. Rosenwald was Allstate's first board chairman, and Odell was named vice president and secretary.[9]
In 1933, at the Century of Progress World’s Fair in Chicago, Allstate’s Richard E. Roskam sold insurance at a booth in the Sears pavilion. In 1934, Allstate opened its first permanent sales office in a Chicago Sears store.[10]
In 1941, only about a quarter of U.S. drivers had auto liability insurance. This led to the state of New York passing a law which established the financial responsibility of drivers for damage or injuries resulting from auto mishaps. That law inspired legislation in other states, and by the mid-1950s nearly every state had some sort of financial responsibility law on its books.[7]
In 1949 the Allstate Headquarters Building was completed at 3245 W. Arthington Street in Chicago.[11] The mid-rise building is currently vacant (as of 2013) and in danger of demolition. The building is noted for its early post-war mid-rise construction. This location was vacated at some point when the company relocated in the post-war years.
The company’s "You're in Good Hands with Allstate" slogan was created in 1950 by Allstate’s general sales manager Davis W. Ellis. At the end of the decade, it was used in the company's first network television advertising campaign, which featured actor Ed Reimers.[9]
Allstate added products throughout the 1950s, including fire insurance in 1954 and homeowners and life insurance in 1957. Allstate began selling insurance to Canadians in 1953. Allstate Insurance Company of Canada was incorporated in 1964.[7] (In 1952 and 1953, Sears also sold an automobile called Allstate.)
In 1967, the company's home office was moved from Skokie to Northbrook, Illinois. Allstate continued to sell additional types of insurance to customers throughout the decade, including worker's compensation insurance in 1964, surety bonds in 1966, inland-marine coverage in 1967 and a business package policy in 1969.[9]
The brand itself expanded in the 1950s and 1960s and could be found on a variety of products like fire extinguishers and motor scooters. In 1952, an Allstate car was produced, but it was a flop; it was pulled from stores by 1953. The Allstate brand was eventually limited to insurance, tires, and car batteries by the late 1960s before becoming insurance-only in the mid-1970s.[1] In 1991, the company went public[4] before becoming completely independent in 1995.[1]
In 1984, Neighborhood Office Agent program was introduced to make agents more accessible to customers
In 1985, Allstate began to move agents out of Sears stores and locate agents in neighborhood offices. In June 1993, 19.8 percent of Allstate became public through a stock offering. Allstate became completely independent in June 1995, when Sears spun off the remaining 80 percent stake in the company, distributing 350.5 million shares of Allstate stock to its stockholders.[7]
In 1993, Allstate went public when Sears sells 19.8% of the company. At the time, it was the largest IPO to date.
In 1996, their website www.allstate.com was launched.
In 1999, Allstate unveiled a new business model that created a single contract for exclusive, independent agents selling Allstate insurance. It also created a network of call centers.
In 1999, Allstate purchased the personal lines division of CNA Financial[12] and subsequently renamed it to Encompass Insurance Company which is written by independent insurance agents, as opposed to the direct writing that constitutes the core part of its business.[13]
In 2003, actor Dennis Haysbert became Allstate’s spokesman, using the tagline "That’s Allstate’s stand."[14]
In 2010 the actor Dean Winters became a part of Allstate’s campaign "Mayhem" “personifying the pitfalls, like collisions and storm damage, that can befall drivers”.
In 2012 Allstate Solutions Private Limited (also called Allstate India) was inaugurated in Bangalore which is a technology and operations centre to provides software development and business process outsourcing services to its US parent. [15] Allstate's Bangalore operation is focused on the areas of business intelligence, analytics, testing and mobility.

Advertising[edit]
"Good hands"[edit]
Allstate's slogan "You're in good hands" was created in the 1950s by Allstate Insurance Company's sales executive, Davis W. Ellis based on a similar phrase he used to reassure his wife about a doctor caring for their child. It has been the slogan ever since 1950. Allstate also referred to themselves as the Good Hands People.
In the 1960s and 1970s, TV, print and radio advertising featured Allstate’s spokesman, Ed Reimers. Reimers was often shown making the cupped-hand gesture. For 22 years, he remained the spokesman.[17]
A study in 2000 by Northwestern University's Medill Graduate Department of Integrated Marketing Communications found that the Allstate slogan "You're in good hands" ranked as the most recognizable in America.[18]
"Allstate’s stand"[edit]
Beginning in 2003, as policy growth slowed, Allstate’s television commercials used spokesman Dennis Haysbert. The ads were intended to carry the message that Allstate's service was superior to that from low-cost providers Geico and Progressive.[19] Haysbert appeared in more than 250 commercials between 2003 and 2016.
Mayhem[edit]
Beginning in 2010, Allstate used Dean Winters as "Mayhem", mean to personify the hazards drivers face. The ads conclude with Haysbert asking "Are You In Good Hands?"[20]
Social media[edit]
In January 2011, Allstate released The Lines,[21] a multi-episode TV drama web series starring actors Teresa Cesario, Kyle Sandgate-Blix, Jackson Schultz, Bridgette Pechman, Chase Maser, and Corey Doyle cast as High-School seniors. The series, filmed in the style of a television drama, depicts the cast in common situations facing teens with respect to driving (Texting while driving in particular). The series appears aimed at promoting interest and support in favor of responsible teen driving and road-safety in general. The Lines spans a total of 8 episodes, each 6–8 minutes in length. Allstate and other large corporations are attracted to the rapid growth of social media for use in their advertising campaigns.

Environmental record[edit]
Allstate has a Sustainability Leadership Team composed of officers and senior staff from all areas of the company. The team focuses on sustainability efforts from a company-wide perspective — including environmental initiatives that embed “green” programs and processes throughout their operations.[29]
Criticism[edit]
In July 2008, the American Association for Justice ranked Allstate No. 1 among nation's worst insurers. This ranking was given because: “While Allstate publicly touts its ‘good hands’ approach, it has instead privately instructed its agents to employ a ‘boxing gloves’ strategy against its policyholders,” said American Association for Justice CEO Jon Haber. They've since revamped their approach.[30] Allstate criticized the report, with a spokesman noting that "The personal injury lawyers behind this report provide no support for their statements other than decade old recycled allegations that have been shown to be without merit in courts of law." [31] In 2009 Allstate successfully fought to obtain Federal government TARP fund eligibility only to decline it once they obtained eligibility.[32]
Auto insurance claims[edit]
An investigative report in February 2007 by CNN found that major car insurance companies, like Allstate, are increasingly fighting auto insurance claims from those who incurred injuries by their insured members.[33] Allstate currently commands 18% of the auto insurance market in the United States.[34]
Homeowners claims[edit]
The PBS television program Now,[35] in conjunction with Bloomberg Markets magazine, did an exposé regarding Allstate and other major insurers' homeowners insurance policies.
Catastrophe exposure management[edit]
Allstate has stated intentions of reducing its exposure in hurricane-prone Florida. In November 2006, Allstate did not renew 120,000 policies that were expiring at that time. Governor Charlie Crist and the Florida Cabinet passed a 90-day emergency order to temporarily prevent insurance companies from nonrenewing policies.[36] On February 20, 2007, Florida Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty clarified the order, stating that insurance companies can nonrenew policies if they satisfy certain conditions, including filing new, lower rates with the state and give customers 100 days’ notice.[37]
From Good Hands to Boxing Gloves[edit]
This is the title of a book written by David Berardinelli, JD;, Michael Freeman, PhD, DC, MPH; and Aaron DeShaw, DC, JD with a foreword by Eugene R. Anderson.[38]
The book relates profit-boosting strategies that consulting firm McKinsey & Company presented to Allstate to maximize profits and diminish the amount of money sent to clients who put in a claim. McKinsey specializes in redesigning product delivery systems for Fortune 100 companies (including controversial clients such as Enron) to maximize profits. McKinsey’s recommendation to Allstate, according to Berardinelli, was to low-ball claims so that desperate customers in dire straits would be more likely to accept a settlement offer while Allstate continued to make a profit and collect interest on the insurance payment. Allstate would offer its "good hands" in the way of a low-ball claim and, if the customer did not accept, to get out "boxing gloves." [39]
The book was reviewed by Business Week magazine.[40] According to that article, Allstate responded to Berardinelli's allegations by claiming that Berardinelli's allegations were "unfounded and unproven." Rather than trying to cheat customers, the company stated that its major goal was to benefit policyholders by identifying "exaggerated and fraudulent claims" and that its "processes are absolutely sound . . . to investigate, evaluate, and promptly resolve each claim fairly, based on the merits."[40]
Court decisions on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, "Courts and regulators in a number of states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do I Need an Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." On the other hand, the article also states that "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.[40]
Use of Colossus[edit]
Many criticisms leveled against Allstate (and other insurers), including Barardinelli's book, involved the use of a software program called "Colossus" to process claims. In 2010, Allstate paid a $10 million fine to settle a lawsuit brought by 41 states concerning inconsistencies in the manner in which Colossus was used. It also agreed to standardize its use of the software. However, “it is important to note that we found no systemic underpayment of bodily injury claims,” New York Insurance Superintendent James J. Wrynn said in a press release.[41]

^ In some cases, Allstate proposed settlement amounts as small as $50, asking claimants to "take it or leave it". The investigative report found that insurance companies often make it so expensive and time consuming to go to court to get full settlement amounts, that it would not be worth the victims time. The claims handled in the matter were very minor collision type losses that did not result in any ($0) damage to the car, and therefore was the insurance company protecting it assets and the premium paying public money, by keeping rates as low as possible."Auto insurers play hardball in minor-crash claims".
