IRVINE, Calif., March 20, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Ubiquity, Inc. (OTCQB: UBIQ) ("Ubiquity" or the "Company"), a technology development and licensing company that holds an extensive portfolio of patents across multiple technology market verticals, announced today that the Company has completed the acquisition of Coversant, Inc. ("Coversant") on March 19, 2015.  Coversant's CEO and board member, Dale Okuno, will join Ubiquity's board of directors, and their management team will be integrated into Ubiquity's existing corporate structure.
Coversant is a developer of an "Internet of Things Service Bus" (IoT-SB) which can securely and efficiently connect devices, sensors, and actuators to users, applications and databases for data analysis and process control. Coversant is one of two software platforms in the world that has passed rigorous Defense Information Systems Agency, and placed on the Unified Capabilities Approved Product List (UCAPL).  Coversant's protocol, based on XMPP, is mandated by the Department of Defense for real time communication for voice, video, chat, messaging and presence. 
"We are excited to complete the acquisition of Coversant and look forward to leveraging Dale Okuno's software development experience and integrating the rest of the Coversant team into Ubiquity. In addition to connecting homes, businesses, automobiles, and other devices, the proliferation of wearable tech products is creating a vast array of potential applications ideally suited to Coversant's highly secure IOT Service Bus," said Ubiquity CEO Chris Carmichael.
"Coversant's technology perfectly complements Ubiquity's patented and patent pending compression technology which enables Ubiquity's software to intelligently discern objects of interest; clean the edges, distinguish vehicles, distinguishing marks and other objects; and continuously track positions for all moving and stationary targets within the video scene all with a high level of accuracy all while being geo-fenced and mapped," said Ubiquity's Co-Chairman Nick Mitsakos.
Mitsakos added, "Coversant's technology along with Ubiquity's Real-time video intelligence software which transforms camera surveillance networks and mobile devices into intelligent and effective detection and alert systems, enabling real-time responses to events as they emerge live or for forensic analysis." 
"Now that the merger is complete we look forward to adding our infrastructure and focus on data security to Ubiquity's already impressive IP and products base. Coversant's technology should create a value added service to what Ubiquity has created as well as create revenue opportunities in other verticals," said Coversant CEO Dale Okuno.

Ubiquity Inc: The Red Flags Are Ubiquitous Around This Dangerously Promoted Stock - Ubiquity Broadcasting Corp (OTCMKTS:UBIQ-OLD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ubiquity Inc: The Red Flags Are Ubiquitous Around This Dangerously Promoted StockDec.18.14 | About: Ubiquity Broadcasting (UBIQ) Investor Protection Association Short onlySummaryWe have received numerous e-mails touting UBIQ from various stock promoters.The timing of the emails promoting UBIQ coincides with what seems to be an abnormal rise in the trading volume of the stock.The recent financials of the company appear to be very bleak due to nearly zero revenue and negative income.We have tried contacting the company via the online form on the company's website; however, it appears to be out of service.Note: This article is about a micro-cap stock (also referred to as a "penny stock"). While all investments are risky, micro-cap stocks are among the most risky. Among micro-cap stocks, the most risky stocks are those which are subject to promotional campaigns, such as Ubiquity (OTCQB:UBIQ). They are also among the most illiquid stocks, usually having a large spread between the bid and offer at any given moment. Quite often, it occurs that the illiquidity of these stocks does not allow a trader to rapidly close or open a position. UBIQ is no exception to that. UBIQ is a micro-cap stock which is traded on the OTCBB and priced well below the $5 mark. The readers of this article should be highly aware of the aforementioned facts prior to undertaking any action based on the content of this article.
Introduction
Trading in Ubiquity Inc has become much more active during the trading sessions in proximity to November 19 (compared to previous activity in the stock). It so happens that beginning on this very same date, we have started receiving a large number of promotional emails from various stock promoters touting the stock. In this article, we will outline the facts that are, in our opinion, related to the increase in the trading volume of this usually thinly traded, low volume stock.
The Promotion
Let us analyze the recent price action and trade volume of UBIQ. The trading volume of UBIQ had increased significantly on the dates nearing November the 19th, the date when the first promotional email was received. The stock had continued trading on an abnormally large volume (compared to before November) on trading sessions following that date. It is quite obvious to us that the emails being sent out throughout the month of November, and the rise in the trading volume of the stock during that same period are interconnected events.

Emails received on UBIQ:

UBIQ Chart:

The Reality: Nearly Zero Revenue, Negative Income, Bright Future?
As often happens with aggressively promoted companies, a glimpse at the balance sheet is often enough to reveal a grim and bleak picture. It seems Ubiquity Inc is no exception to that rule.
In our opinion, it is clear that the price of UBIQ has nothing in common with the stock's true value. If we take a look at UBIQ's income statement, we can see that the company's revenue has remained nearly zero while the company's net income has been negative during the entire year of 2014:

It is based on the aforementioned data that we firmly believe that UBIQ's current line of business involves having its shares promoted and sold at over-inflated prices, rather than delivering or attempting to deliver a true product to the market. But why, you ask?
The Reason
Why would any company need to have its stock ticker advertised? That is the most important question an investor should ask himself prior to buying a promoted stock. The answer for this hides, of course, in the small print. Let us have a look at the disclaimers found in the promotional emails touting UBIQ which we've received:


Or:

Or:

In simple, plain English: someone - maybe the promoter sending out the email message or a third party who might have paid the promoter in cash for sending the message - is holding shares of UBIQ and plans to get rid of them ("dump" them) in the open market. Therefore, our conclusion is that the promotional email's sole purpose was to have unsuspecting investors buy the stock at artificially heightened prices, while the promoters (or third party) unload their shares upon them.
Conclusion
It is based on the aforementioned facts and analysis presented in this article we hold the opinion that UBIQ shares are essentially worthless. We believe that the recent increase in the price of the stock has been a direct result of email messages being sent out by stock promoters in massive quantities and touting investors to buy the stock. This practice is well known (see Pump and Dump) and is done exclusively for one reason only - so the insiders can unload ("dump") their shares (which they had previously acquired for almost free) in the free market onto unsuspecting investors, while taking advantage of the stock's inflated price. In view of that, we hold the opinion that any investor who had purchased shares of the company should consider liquidating his entire position immediately. Even a small weakness in price could mean that the dump is nearing.

Our View
We must rediscover the distinction between hope and expectation. --Ivan Illich
For longs: If you are long the stock, we believe you should consider getting out immediately. It is with full confidence we say that every upward movement in the stock's price is likely to be temporary, as it will never repeat its previous highs. We believe UBIQ has a price target of around $0.01, which it is likely to reach in the upcoming weeks (or months at most).
If you have already accrued losses on the stock, it may be a good idea to sell now so as to avoid additional losses. Do not persuade yourself into thinking the stock price will come back to its previous highs. Do not have hope leaving you holding the bag as it has happened to far too many. We believe UBIQ's stock price will drop 90% or more in the following weeks. It may be the right decision to minimize your losses by selling now.
A man must be big enough to admit his mistakes, smart enough to profit from them, and strong enough to correct them. --John C. Maxwell
For shorts: Bearing the aforementioned facts in mind, we believe sophisticated investors will quickly comprehend the idea that shorting UBIQ may be a lucrative opportunity, as we are convinced that the potential downside for UBIQ is substantial. If you are able to locate borrows, we believe shorting UBIQ may prove to be profitable, as its price may prove to be highly inflated.

The Software was developed solely at private expense and is a “commercial item” consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer software documentation” within the meaning of the applicable civilian and military Federal acquisition regulations and any supplements thereto, as amended from time to time. If the user of the Software is an agency, department, employee or other entity of the United States Government, consistent with 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.702-4 (JUNE 1995), the use, duplication, reproduction, release, modification, disclosure and transfer of the Software, including technical data or manuals, is governed by the terms and conditions contained in this EULA.Severability.

You may not assign any of Your rights or obligations under this EULA without Ubiquiti’s express written consent. Ubiquiti may assign this EULA without Your consent provided that such assignment is to an affiliated company forming part of the Ubiquiti group of companies.Waiver.

The failure of either party to enforce the provisions hereof, at any time or for any period of time, or the failure of either party to exercise any option herein, shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision or option and shall in no way affect that party’s right to enforce such provisions or exercise such option.Third Party Beneficiary. Licensors and suppliers of Ubiquiti and its affiliates are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, and thus this EULA is directly enforceable by such licensors and suppliers and their affiliates.Statute of Limitations. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action You may have arising out of or related to use of the Software or this EULA must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.Interpretation. As used herein, unless the context requires otherwise, the word “or” is not exclusive and the words “will,” “will not,” “shall,” and “shall not” are expressions of command and not merely expressions of future intent or expectation. Whenever the words “include,” “includes” or “including” are used in this EULA, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words “without limitation.” The section headings in this EULA are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect.Copyright © July 2017 Ubiquiti Networks, Inc.
