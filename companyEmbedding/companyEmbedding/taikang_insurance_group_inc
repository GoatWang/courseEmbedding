History[edit]
Taikang Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was founded in August 22, 1996, after approval from the People's Bank of China, as a national corporation headquartered in Beijing. Under the guidance of chairman and CEO Chen Dongsheng, Taikang Life Insurance has experienced steady growth from its inception.
From 2006 to 2007, Taikang created the two subsidiaries Taikang Asset Management Co. Ltd. and Taikang Pension Co. Ltd., the former being one of the largest investment corporations in Mainland China (winning the "21st century Gold Shell Prize" in investment performance for four consecutive years) and the latter being one of the first corporations to obtain government approval for the development of a retirement community. Taikang Property Investment Co. Ltd., which focuses on higher risk, opportunistic investments especially in conjunction with real estate and retirement community projects, was created in March 2010. Taikang Life's premium revenue in 2010 totaled 86.8 billion yuan, representing a year-on-year increase of 29%, and after-tax profits totaled 2.1 billion yuan.
In 2011, Goldman Sachs acquired a 12.02% stake (102.48 million shares) in Taikang Life Insurance from AXA Life Ltd.[2] Taikang Life is preparing for an initial public offering on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges.[3]
Operations[edit]
Taikang Life had end-of-year total assets totaling 350 billion yuan and net company assets totaling 12.5 billion yuan in 2011. Taikang has 35 branches throughout China.[4]

History[edit]
Taikang Life Insurance Co. Ltd. was founded in August 22, 1996, after approval from the People's Bank of China, as a national corporation headquartered in Beijing. Under the guidance of chairman and CEO Chen Dongsheng, Taikang Life Insurance has experienced steady growth from its inception.
From 2006 to 2007, Taikang created the two subsidiaries Taikang Asset Management Co. Ltd. and Taikang Pension Co. Ltd., the former being one of the largest investment corporations in Mainland China (winning the "21st century Gold Shell Prize" in investment performance for four consecutive years) and the latter being one of the first corporations to obtain government approval for the development of a retirement community. Taikang Property Investment Co. Ltd., which focuses on higher risk, opportunistic investments especially in conjunction with real estate and retirement community projects, was created in March 2010. Taikang Life's premium revenue in 2010 totaled 86.8 billion yuan, representing a year-on-year increase of 29%, and after-tax profits totaled 2.1 billion yuan.
In 2011, Goldman Sachs acquired a 12.02% stake (102.48 million shares) in Taikang Life Insurance from AXA Life Ltd.[2] Taikang Life is preparing for an initial public offering on both the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges.[3]
Operations[edit]
Taikang Life had end-of-year total assets totaling 350 billion yuan and net company assets totaling 12.5 billion yuan in 2011. Taikang has 35 branches throughout China.[4]

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

     IHH Healthcare Forms Strategic Partnership With Taikang Insurance Group To Accelerate China Growth                                                                    Home  Categories Suppliers Directory  Suppliers A-Z Featured Suppliers   Products Gallery  Videos Catalogues    Industry updates  Knowledge bank  Articles Interviews    News Press Releases Events Projects White Papers Reports   Our Partners Clientele Advertise  e-Newsletters Events Newsletters Direct Email Blast   Blog                                   NEWS      IHH Healthcare Forms Strategic Partnership With Taikang Insurance Group To Accelerate China Growth  Saturday, Nov 12, 2016    IHH Healthcare Berhad, a leading premium healthcare provider globally, today announced a strategic partnership with Taikang Insurance Group Inc. (“Taikang” or “TIG”). TIG (previously named as Taikang Life Insurance Co., Ltd.) is a renowned leading insurance and financial group in China. This partnership will leverage on the strengths of IHH and TIG in the respective areas of healthcare and insurance, placing the Group on a stronger growth path in China. IHH, through its wholly-owned Parkway Group Healthcare subsidiary (“PGH”), has entered into a Share Purchase and Subscription Agreements with TK Healthcare Investment Limited to divest a 29.9% equity stake in PCH Holding Pte. Ltd. (“PCH”), the holding entity for IHH’s Mainland China portfolio of primary care clinics and greenfield hospital projects, for a total cash consideration of approximately RMB1.1 billion (equivalent to RM689.6 million). The proceeds from the agreements will be used to effect a combination of a primary subscription of PCH’s shares and a secondary purchase of PGH’s share in PCH. The primary proceeds will be mainly deployed as growth and working capital for PCH. The transaction is subject to both parties fulfilling the necessary conditions for completion, including regulatory approvals. Following the transaction, PCH will become an indirect 70.1% subsidiary of IHH. IHH is the second largest private healthcare group in the world by market capitalisation. The Group has operated in its key growth market of China for more than a decade and currently has a network of primary care clinics and hospital projects across China. IHH and TIG will be jointly funding future projects in proportion to their shareholding. TIG is a leading insurance and financial services provider in China with over RMB1 trillion of assets under management currently. Through its three core business lines: insurance, asset management, and health and elderly care, it serves more than 170 million customers through 4,200 branches across the country. This strategic partnership will allow PCH to leverage on the complementary strengths of both parties, realising business and healthcare operational synergies, to drive further growth in China. Potential areas of collaboration include referrals and coverage at PCH’s primary care clinics and hospitals for TIG’s clients. Dr Tan See Leng, Managing Director and CEO of IHH, said: “We are excited to welcome Taikang as our strategic partner in China, a key growth market for IHH. Its insurance coverage base and deep local expertise in China, together with IHH’s track record in medical care will allow us to significantly accelerate our plans to grow the clinic networks and hospital portfolio in China. This partnership builds on our shared belief in the long-term growth prospects and demand for private healthcare in the country.” Mr Chen Dongsheng, Chairman and CEO of TIG, said: “As a leading insurer and healthcare management services provider, Taikang believes in a long-term but focused approach to growth. By combining IHH’s strong track record in delivering best-in-class clinical care with our deep local knowledge and experience in the fields of insurance and healthcare, we will further enable PCH to meet the healthcare needs of Chinese citizens and foreign nationals residing within the country.” The transaction will not have any effect on IHH’s issued and paid-up share capital and substantial shareholders’ shareholdings. There will not be any material effect on the earnings, net assets or gearing of IHH for the financial year ending 31 December 2016.   Source : ihh.irplc.com
