Dear Limited Partner:

Notice to Limited Partners of Charter Graham                                    

In a continuing effort to provide increased diversification among trading       
strategies within Charter Graham, the General Partner has determined to         
reallocate the assets of Charter Graham among certain trading programs offered  
by the trading advisor to the Fund, Graham Capital Management, L.P.  Through    
December 31, 2000, 100% of the assets of Charter Graham were traded pursuant to 
the Global Diversified Program at 1.5 times standard leverage.  As of January 1,
2001, the assets of Charter Graham are traded as follows: approximately 60% of  
the assets are traded pursuant to the Global Diversified Program at 1.5 times   
standard leverage, approximately 20% of the assets are traded pursuant to the K4
Program at 1.5 times standard leverage, and approximately 20% of the assets are 
traded pursuant to the Non-Trend Based Program at 1.5 times standard leverage.  
Furthermore, all subscriptions, redemptions, and exchanges into or out of       
Charter Graham are allocated in the same proportion described above.  See       
Special Notice to Limited Partners of Charter Graham which follows this letter. 

Charter DWFCM                                                                   

Charter DWFCM increased in value during March primarily due to gains recorded in
the currency markets from short positions in the Japanese yen as its value      
weakened versus the U.S. dollar. Yen weakness was attributed to Japan's return  
to its zero interest rate policy as well as comments by the Japanese Economics  
Minister that Japanese officials would weaken their currency further which would
serve to stimulate exports.  Additional currency gains were recorded from short 
positions in the Australian dollar as its value weakened relative to the U.S.   
dollar on evidence of a weak Australian economy.  Smaller currency gains were   
recorded from short position in the Swedish krona and Swiss franc as the value  
of these currencies declined versus the U.S. dollar.  Gains were also recorded  
in the global interest rate futures markets from long positions in Japanese     
government bonds futures as prices rallied after the Bank of Japan surprisingly 
cut both the official discount rate and the key policy rate.  Gains were also   
recorded from long positions in European interest rate futures as investors     
sought the safe-haven of fixed income amid a sell-off in equity prices and      
positive inflation data.  Additional profits were recorded from short positions 
in aluminum futures as aluminum prices moved lower pressured by the decline in  
the U.S. equities market and concerns over demand.  A portion of these gains was
offset by losses recorded in the energy markets during the third week of the    
month from short natural gas futures positions as prices rose on renewed        
concerns over possible tight summer natural gas supplies and comments by both   
President Bush and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham of a looming U.S. energy    
crisis.  Additional losses were recorded from short crude oil futures positions 
as supply concerns pushed the price of crude oil and its related products       
higher.                                                                         

Charter Graham                                                                  

Charter Graham increased in value during March primarily due to gains recorded  
in the currency markets from short positions in the Australian and Canadian     
dollar, as well as the Korean won, as the value of these currencies declined    
relative to the U.S. dollar due to growing concerns over the impact the global  
economic slowdown will have on those country's economies.  Gains were also      
recorded in the global interest rate futures markets from long positions in     
European interest rate futures as prices rose during mid-month as investors     
sought the safe-haven of fixed income amid a sell-off in equity prices and      
positive inflation data.  Trading in the agricultural markets was also          
profitable as short corn futures positions recorded gains when prices dropped   
sharply during mid-month.  A small portion of these gains was

President Bush and Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham of a looming U.S. energy

Charter Millburn                                                                

Charter Millburn increased in value during March primarily due to gains recorded
in the currency markets from short positions in the Japanese yen as the value of
the yen weakened relative to the U.S. dollar as Japan's economic outlook        
remained gloomy and on the Bank of Japan's decision to reinstate its zero       
interest rate policy.  Additional currency gains were experienced from short    
positions in the Thai baht and Singapore dollar as the value of these currencies
moved in sympathy with the declining Japanese yen.  In the global interets rate 
futures markets, gains were recorded during mid-month from long positions in    
European and U.S. interests rate futures as prices rose as investors sought the 
safe-haven of fixed income amid a sell-off in equity prices and positive        
inflation data.  Gains were also recorded in the soft commodities markets from  
short positions in sugar futures as prices moved lower in response to global    
economic weakness.  A small portion of these gains was offset by losses recorded
in the energy markets late in the month from long positions in natural gas      
futures as prices moved lower.                                                  

Charter Welton                                                                  

Charter Welton increased in value during March primarily due to gains recorded  
in the currency markets from short positions in the Japanese yen as the value of
the yen weakened relative to the U.S. dollar as Japan's economic outlook        
remained gloomy.  The Bank of Japan's decision to reinstate its zero interest   
rate policy also weighed on the yen.  Smaller gains were recorded from short    
positions in the Swiss franc and the euro as their values weakened versus the   
U.S. dollar amid fresh concerns of eroding growth in the European region.       
Additional gains were recorded in the global interets rate futures markets from 
long positions in European and U.S. interest rate futures when as prices rose as
investors sought the safe-haven of fixed income amid a sell-off in equity prices
and positive inflation data.  A portion of these gains was offset by losses     
recorded in the energy markets from long natural gas futures positions as prices
moved lower.

Notes to Financial Statements                                                   
(Unaudited)                                                                     

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                                  

Organization - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter DWFCM L.P. ("Charter DWFCM"), 
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Graham L.P. ("Charter Graham"), Morgan       
Stanley Dean Witter Charter Millburn L.P. ("Charter Millburn"), and Morgan      
Stanley Dean Witter Charter Welton L.P. ("Charter Welton"), (individually, a    
"Partnership", or collectively, the "Partnerships") are limited partnerships    
organized to engage primarily in the speculative trading of futures and forward 
contracts, options on futures contracts and on physical commodities and other   
commodity interests, including foreign currencies, financial instruments,       
metals, energy and agricultural products (collectively, "futures interests").   

The general partner of each Partnership is Demeter Management Corporation       
("Demeter").  The non-clearing commodity broker is Morgan Stanley DW Inc.       
("Morgan Stanley DW").  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. changed its name to Morgan    
Stanley DW Inc., effective April 2, 2001.  The clearing commodity brokers for   
the Partnerships are Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. ("MS & Co.") and Morgan Stanley &
Co. International Limited ("MSIL") which provide clearing and execution         
services.  The trading advisor for Charter DWFCM is Dean Witter Futures &       
Currency Management Inc. ("DWFCM").  Demeter, Morgan Stanley DW, DWFCM, MS & Co.
and MSIL  are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co..    

Demeter is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the equity of each     
Partnership and income (losses) are shared by Demeter and Limited Partners based
on their proportional ownership interests.                                      

Use of Estimates - The financial statements are prepared in accordance with     
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which 
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported   
amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures.  Management        
believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of the financial        
statements are prudent and reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those  
estimates.                                                                      

Revenue Recognition - Futures interests are open commitments until settlement   
date.  They are valued at market on a daily basis and the resulting net change  
in unrealized gains and losses is reflected in the change in unrealized profit  
(loss) on open contracts from one period to the next in the statements of       
operations.  Monthly, Morgan Stanley DW credits each Partnership with interest  
income on 100% of its average daily funds held at Morgan Stanley DW.  In        
addition, Morgan Stanley DW will credit each Partnership with 100% of the       
interest income Morgan Stanley DW receives from MS & Co. and MSIL with respect  
to such Partnership's assets deposited as margin.  The interest rates used are  
equal to that earned by Morgan Stanley DW on its U.S. Treasury bill investments.
For purposes of such interest payments Net Assets do not include monies due the 
Partnerships on forward contracts and other futures interests, but not actually 
received.                                                                       

Net Income (Loss) per Unit - Net income (loss) per unit of limited partnership  
interest ("Unit(s)") is computed using the weighted average number of Units     
outstanding during the period.                                                  

Brokerage and Related Transaction Fees and Costs - Each Partnership pays a flat-
rate monthly brokerage fee of 1/12 of 7% of the Partnership's Net Assets as of  
the first day of each month (a 7% annual rate).  Such fees currently cover all  
brokerage commissions, transaction fees and costs and ordinary administrative   
and offering expenses.                                                          

Operating Expenses - Each Partnership incurs monthly management fees and may    
incur incentive fees.  Demeter bears all other operating expenses.              

Income Taxes - No provision for income taxes has been made in the accompanying  
financial statements, as partners are individually responsible for reporting    
income or loss based upon their respective share of each Partnership's revenues 
and expenses for income tax purposes.                                           

Distributions - Distributions, other than redemptions of Units, are made on a   
pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of Demeter.  No distributions have been   
made to date.

(Continued)                                                                     

Continuing Offering - Units of each Partnership are offered at a price equal to 
100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit at monthly closings held as of the last day
of each month.                                                                  

Redemptions - Limited partners may redeem some or all of their Units as of the  
last day of the sixth month following the closing at which each first becomes a 
Limited Partner.  Redemptions may only be made in whole Units, with a minimum of
100 Units required for each redemption, unless a Limited Partner is redeeming   
his entire interest in the Partnership.  Units redeemed on or prior to the last 
day of the twelfth month from the date of purchase will be subject to a         
redemption charge equal to 2% of the Net Asset Value of a Unit on the           

Redemption Date.  Units redeemed after the last day of the twelfth month and on 
or prior to the last day of the twenty-fourth month from the date of purchase   
will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 1% of the Net Asset Value of a  
Unit on the Redemption Date.  Units redeemed after the last day of the twenty-  
fourth month from the date of purchase will not be subject to a redemption      
charge.                                                                         

Exchanges - On the last day of the first month which occurs more than 180 days  
after a person first becomes a Limited Partner in any of the Partnerships, and  
at the end of each month thereafter, Limited Partners may transfer their        
investment among the Partnerships (subject to certain restrictions outlined in  
the Limited Partnership Agreements) without paying additional charges.          

Dissolution of the Partnership - Charter DWFCM will terminate on December 31,
2025 and Charter Graham, Charter Millburn and Charter Welton will terminate on  
December 31, 2035 or at an earlier date if certain conditions occur as defined  
in each Partnership's Limited Partnership Agreement.                            

2.  Related Party Transactions                                                  

Each Partnership pays brokerage fees to Morgan Stanley DW as described  in Note 
1. Each Partnership's cash is on deposit with Morgan Stanley DW, MS & Co., and  
MSIL in futures interests trading accounts to meet margin requirements as       
needed.  Morgan Stanley DW pays interest on these funds as described in Note 1. 

Demeter, on behalf of Charter DWFCM and itself, entered into a management       
agreement with DWFCM to make all trading decisions for the Partnership. Charter 
DWFCM pays management and incentive fees (if any) to DWFCM.                     

3.  Trading Advisors                                                            

Demeter, on behalf of Charter DWFCM, Charter Graham, Charter Millburn and       
Charter Welton retains certain commodity trading advisors to make all trading   
decisions for the Partnerships.  The trading advisors are as follows:           

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter DWFCM L.P.                                   
Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management Inc.                              

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Graham L.P.                                  
Graham Capital Management L.P.                                              

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Millburn L.P.                                
Millburn Ridgefield Corporation                                             

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Welton L.P.                                  
Welton Investment Corporation                                               

Compensation to the trading advisors by the Partnerships consists of a          
management fee and an incentive fee as follows:                                 

Management Fee - Each Partnership pays a flat-rate monthly fee of 1/12 of 2% of 
the Net Assets under management by each trading advisor as of the first day of  
each month (a 2% annual rate).                                                  

Incentive Fee - Each Partnership's incentive fee is equal to 20% of the trading 
profits, which is paid on a quarterly basis for Charter DWFCM, and paid on a    
monthly basis for Charter Graham, Charter Millburn and Charter Welton.

Notes to Financial Statements                                                   
(Concluded)                                                                     

Trading profits represent the amount by which profits from futures, forwards and
options trading exceed losses after brokerage and management fees are deducted. 
When a trading advisor experiences losses with respect to Net Assets as of the  
end of a calendar month, or calendar quarter with respect to Charter DWFCM, the 
trading advisor must earn back such losses before that trading advisor is       
eligible for an incentive fee in the future.

Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Series                                       
Monthly Report                                                                  
May 2001                                                                        

Dear Limited Partner:                                                           

The Net Asset Value per Unit for each of the four Morgan Stanley Dean Witter    
Charter Funds as of May 31, 2001 was as follows:                                

Funds   N.A.V.   % change for month                                             
Charter DWFCM   $17.61     5.95%                                                
Charter Graham  $12.42     0.75%                                                
Charter Millburn        $10.63     1.58%                                        
Charter Welton  $  6.92   -3.40%                                                

Charter DWFCM                                                                   

The Fund increased in value during May due primarily to gains recorded in the   
currency and  energy markets.  In the currency markets, short positions in the
 euro profited as its value  weakened relative to the U.S. dollar, British pound
and Japanese yen, amid pessimism about  European growth prospects.            
Additional gains were recorded from short positions in the Swiss            
franc and Swedish krona as the value of these currencies                        
weakened in line with the euro.  In the                                       
energy markets, short natural gas futures positions                             
recorded gains as prices fell when the                                          
American Gas Association reported growing inventories                           
and lack of demand throughout most of                                         
the United States.  A portion of these gains was                                
offset by losses experienced in the metals                                    
markets.  Losses were incurred from short                                       
copper futures positions as prices moved higher on                              
hopes that domestic stock markets, and the U.S                                  
. economy overall, may have bottomed out                                      
leading to an increase in demand.  Additional                                   
losses were recorded from newly established long                              
gold futures positions as gold prices sharply                                   
reversed lower, after spiking higher earlier in the                             
month after reports that Russian President                                      
Vladimir Putin was willing to sell part of Russia's                             
gold reserves to help flood victims in eastern Siberia.                         

Charter Graham                                                                  

Charter Graham increased in value during May primarily                          
due to gains recorded in the agricultural                                       
markets from short corn and wheat futures                                       
positions as prices dropped on forecasts for wet, cool                        
weather conditions in the U.S. Midwest and on                                   
reports of declining demand.  In the energy                                     
markets, gains were recorded from short positions                               
in natural gas futures as prices declined on                                  
continued concerns regarding rising U.S.                                        
natural gas inventories and mild weather across the                           
United States.  A portion of these gains was                                    
offset by losses recorded in the metals markets later                           
in the month from long positions in gold and                                    
copper futures as prices dropped following the                                  
return of more bearish sentiment regarding                                      
the outlook for the U.S. economy.  Smaller losses                             
were experienced in the soft commodities                                        
markets from trading sugar futures as prices moved                              
without consistent direction throughout the month.                              

On June 14, 2001, the General Partner, after                                    
consultation with Graham Capital Management                                   
("Graham Capital"), the Trading Advisor to                                      
Charter Graham (the "Fund"), stopped using                                      
Graham's Non Trend Based Program                                                
("NTB") to trade Fund assets on the basis that NTB was                          
not performing up to expectations.  The                                         
General Partner instructed Graham Capital to liquidate                          
all positions in NTB and to reallocate all                                      
assets from those positions to Graham Capital's K-4                             
Program, one of the other two Graham Capital                                    
programs used in the Fund.  (The other is the                                 
Global Diversified Program.)  With this                                         
reallocation, approximately 60% of the Fund's assets                            
will be traded pursuant to the Global Diversified                               
Program and 40% pursuant to K-4.  Starting                                    
with the June closing, as well, the allocations                                 
of subscriptions, redemptions and exchanges will                                
be similarly changed, with 60% allocated to                                     
the Global Diversified Program and 40% to the K-4                             
Program.

Charter Millburn                                                                

Charter Millburn increased in value during May                                  
primarily due to gains recorded in the currency                                 
markets during the second half of the month                                     
from short positions in the euro and Swiss franc as                           
the value of these European currencies                                          
weakened relative to the U.S. dollar following reports of                     
weak European economic data.  In the global                                     
interest rate futures markets, profits were recorded                            
from long positions in short-term U.S. interest                                 
rate futures as prices increased after a host of                                
economic data kept alive hopes for a deeper                                     
U.S. Federal Reserve interest-rate cut.  Smaller gains                        
were recorded from long positions in Japanese                                   
government bond futures as prices rose due to                                 
strength caused by the Japanese government's                                    
pledge for fiscal reform.  In energies, gains                                 
recorded from short natural gas futures positions                               
were offset by losses experienced in crude oil                                
futures and its related products.  A portion of overall                         
gains was offset by losses recorded in the                                      
global stock index futures markets as prices                                    
generally moved in an erratic, directionless pattern                            
on conflicting economic information and investor                                
sentiment.  Smaller losses were experienced                                     
from trading sugar futures as prices moved without                              
consistent direction throughout the month.                                    

Charter Welton                                                                  

Charter Welton decreased in value during May primarily                          
due to losses recorded in the metals                                          
markets late in the month from long positions in                                
gold futures as gold prices sharply reversed                                  
lower, after spiking higher earlier in the month,                               
following the return of more bearish sentiment                                  
regarding the outlook for the U.S. economy.  In the                             
currency markets, losses were recorded from                                   
short positions in the Japanese yen as the value                                
of the yen reversed its previous downward trend                                 
and strengthened versus the U.S. dollar as                                      
Japanese investors sold euros for yen, which                                    
subsequently weighed heavily on the U.S. dollar.                                
The yen was boosted further on news that the                                    
minutes from the Bank of Japan's April 13th meeting                             
stated that members voted against increasing                                    
outright purchases of JGB's in order to limit the rise in                       
long-term interest rates.  Losses were                                        
experienced in the global stock index futures markets

directionless pattern on conflicting economic information                       
and investor sentiment.  A portion of                                         
these losses was offset by gains recorded in the global                         
interest rate futures markets from long                                       
positions in Japanese government bond futures as                                
prices rose due to strength caused by the                                     
Japanese government's pledge for fiscal reform.

U.S. Federal Reserve interest-rate cut.  Smaller

1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies                                  

Organization - Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter DWFCM L.P. ("Charter
DWFCM"), Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Graham L.P. ("Charter Graham"),     
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Millburn L.P. ("Charter Millburn"), and      
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Charter Welton L.P. ("Charter Welton"),              
(individually, a "Partnership", or collectively, the "Partnerships") are        
limited partnerships organized to engage primarily in the speculative           
trading of futures, forward, and options contracts on physical commodities      
and other commodity interests, including foreign currencies, financial          
instruments, metals, energy and agricultural products (collectively,            
"futures interests").                                                           

The general partner of each Partnership is Demeter Management Corporation       
("Demeter").  The non-clearing commodity broker is Morgan Stanley DW Inc.       
("Morgan Stanley DW").  The clearing commodity brokers for the Partnerships     
are Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. ("MS & Co.") and Morgan Stanley & Co.             
International Limited ("MSIL").  The trading advisor for Charter DWFCM is       
Dean Witter Futures & Currency Management Inc. ("DWFCM").  Demeter, Morgan      
Stanley DW, DWFCM, MS & Co. and MSIL  are wholly-owned subsidiaries of          
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co..                                               

Demeter is required to maintain a 1% minimum interest in the equity of each     
Partnership and income (losses) are shared by Demeter and Limited Partners      
based on their proportional ownership interests.                                

Use of Estimates - The financial statements are prepared in accordance with     
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America,       
which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the      
reported amounts in the financial statements and related disclosures.           
Management believes that the estimates utilized in the preparation of the       
financial statements are prudent and reasonable.  Actual results could          
differ from those estimates.                                                    

Revenue Recognition - Futures interests are open commitments until              
settlement date.  They are valued at market on a daily basis and the            
resulting net change in unrealized gains and losses is reflected in the         
change in unrealized profit (loss) on open contracts from one period to the     
next in the statements of operations.  Monthly, Morgan Stanley DW credits       
each Partnership with interest income on 100% of its average daily funds        
held at Morgan Stanley DW.  In addition, Morgan Stanley DW will credit each     
Partnership with 100% of the interest income Morgan Stanley DW receives from    
MS & Co. and MSIL with respect to such Partnership's assets deposited as        
margin.  The interest rates used are equal to that earned by Morgan Stanley     
DW on its U.S. Treasury bill investments.  For purposes of such interest        
payments Net Assets do not include monies due the Partnerships on forward       
contracts and other futures interests, but not actually received.               

Net Income (Loss) per Unit - Net income (loss) per unit of limited              
partnership interest ("Unit(s)") is computed using the weighted average         
number of Units outstanding during the period.                                  

Brokerage and Related Transaction Fees and Costs - Each Partnership pays a      
flat-rate monthly brokerage fee of 1/12 of 7% of the Partnership's Net          
Assets as of the first day of each month (a 7% annual rate).  Such fees         
currently cover all brokerage commissions, transaction fees and costs and       
ordinary administrative and offering expenses.                                  

Operating Expenses - Each Partnership incurs monthly management fees and may    
incur incentive fees.  Demeter bears all other operating expenses.              

Income Taxes - No provision for income taxes has been made in the               
accompanying financial statements, as partners are individually responsible

for reporting income or loss based upon their respective share of each          
Partnership's revenues and expenses for income tax purposes.                    

Distributions - Distributions, other than redemptions of Units, are made on     
a pro-rata basis at the sole discretion of Demeter.  No distributions have      
been made to date.                                                              

Continuing Offering - Units of each Partnership are offered at a price equal    
to 100% of the Net Asset Value per Unit at monthly closings held as of the      
last day of each month.                                                         

Redemptions - Limited partners may redeem some or all of their Units as of      
the last day of the sixth month following the closing at which each first       
becomes a Limited Partner.  Redemptions may only be made in whole Units,        
with a minimum of 100 Units required for each redemption, unless a Limited      
Partner is redeeming his entire interest in the Partnership.  Units redeemed    
on or prior to the last day of the twelfth month from the date of purchase      
will be subject to a redemption charge equal to 2% of the Net Asset Value of    
a Unit on the                                                                   
Redemption Date.  Units redeemed after the last day of the twelfth month and

Welton Investment Corporation                                               

Compensation to the trading advisors by the Partnerships consists of a          
management fee and an incentive fee as follows:                                 

Management Fee - Each Partnership pays a flat-rate monthly fee of 1/12 of 2%    
of the Net Assets under management by each trading advisor as of the first      
day of each month (a 2% annual rate).                                           

Incentive Fee - Each Partnership's incentive fee is equal to 20% of the         
trading profits, which is paid on a quarterly basis for Charter DWFCM, and      
paid on a monthly basis for Charter Graham, Charter Millburn and Charter        
Welton.                                                                         

Trading profits represent the amount by which profits from futures, forwards    
and options trading exceed losses after brokerage and management fees are       
deducted.  When a trading advisor experiences losses with respect to Net        
Assets as of the end of a calendar month, or calendar quarter with respect      
to Charter DWFCM, the trading advisor must earn back such losses before that    
trading advisor is eligible for an incentive fee in the future.
