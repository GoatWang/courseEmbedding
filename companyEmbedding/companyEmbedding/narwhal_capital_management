EQUITY

 
 
 
 




					 At Narwhal, equity investing is all about value. Or perhaps more appropriately, equity investing is about identifying under-valued stocks with understandable stories. 
				
 


We firmly believe that bottom-up individual equity selection is both a science and an art.

 
 

					 We consider losses to be more mathematically damaging than gains are psychologically joyful, and as such we invest prudently by focusing closely on stock valuations relative to components such as free cash flow, balance sheet strength, earnings potential and dividend distributions.
While we tend to begin our stock screening process with more measured analysis, we firmly believe that bottom-up individual equity selection is both a science and an art. In the light of that, we do place an emphasis on less tangible items such as company management, barriers to entry and economic moats.

Asset Allocation - Narwhal Capital


























































Select Page


  
 



 



 









ASSET ALLOCATION

 
 
 
 




While every Narwhal portfolio is customized to each client’s risk tolerance, income needs, time horizon and investment objectives, very few are one-dimensional and focused solely on stocks or entirely on bonds.

 


Most of our portfolios are balanced across all asset classes, but every single account is customized to each individual client.

 
 

					 To the contrary, the overwhelming majority of our accounts are balanced—across equity (stocks), fixed income (bonds), cash and commodities—to some extent. To be sure, this customization yields a wide array of portfolio profiles. Some are aggressive; some are conservative. Some are geared toward growth; others are focused on maximizing current income. But a wide-ranging collection of clients mandates an eclectic mix of asset allocations.
We believe we add as much value to clients in our allocation analysis and implementation as we do with our individual stock or bond selection. Accordingly, we take great pride in this element of our stewardship.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.
