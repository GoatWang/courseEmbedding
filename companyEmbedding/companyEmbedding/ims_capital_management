We help investors
realize their goals seeking superior, risk-adjusted returns









































In 1988, Carl Marker turned his passion for investing and his dream of helping clients into a reality when he founded Investment Management Services (later changed to IMS Capital Management). IMS Capital Management built its name on value investing primarily in mid and large-cap stocks.
Over the past two decades, IMS Capital Management has expanded beyond that core strategy to provide a wide range of investment strategies and wealth management services. IMS Capital Management has locations in Portland, Oregon and Rathdrum, Idaho.
Our mission is: “To deliver exceptional client service, outstanding investment counsel and superior investment returns”.
Each client has a dedicated relationship manager who is focused on understanding and meeting our client’s unique needs. Our highly focused and skilled investment team, with significant experience in both up and down markets, works with each client to provide a privately managed customized solution that effectively preserves and manages our client’s wealth over time.
We strive to earn our client’s trust and confidence by adding significant value in the wealth management process.
We like to call it “Building Wealth Wisely”.
Building Wealth Wisely ® – The disciplined integrated process of planning, investing, monitoring, protecting, and growing one’s assets over time.

An unbiased approach









































At IMS Capital Management we work with each client to construct a highly customized, privately managed and broadly diversified portfolio based on each individual’s unique set of circumstances. Our experienced investment management team and vast resources available us to integrate both internally and externally managed investment solutions where appropriate.
Philosophically:
We believe that managing risk and preserving wealth is more important than short-term performance.
We provide our clients with investment solutions that make objective sense and are situationally appropriate.
We neither view our proprietary strategies nor external investment solutions as preferable. We make use of either or both when appropriate.
Strategically:
We use asset allocation as the foundation of our approach and utilize a fully diversified portfolio of assets classes to include:
Stocks, Bonds, Cash, Real Assets and Alternative Investments.
Tactically:
We take an unbiased approach to the way we use portfolio instruments and have the unique ability to customize a portfolio utilizing a mixture of the following:

Exchanged traded funds, where low cost and tax efficiency is the priority.
Mutual fund managers where both market inefficiency and proven manager skill is identified.
Individual Stocks and Bonds where an additional level of screening and customization is desired.
