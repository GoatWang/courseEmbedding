CommLoan Raises $2.25 Million to Provide Consumers with Access to 
      First, Only, Marketplace for Commercial Real Estate Financing






December 13, 2016 07:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CommLoan, a Scottsdale-based, early stage commercial mortgage lending 
      technology company, today announced it has received $2.25 million in 
      seed funding from Social Leverage and ViaWest Group. This financing will 
      secure business development resources to accelerate sales and further 
      strengthen CommLoan’s leadership position in the marketplace.
    


      “CommLoan has built a distinctive platform designed specifically for the 
      commercial real estate finance setting, improving the overall 
      lender-borrower experience,” said Tom Peterson, founder and general 
      partner of Social Leverage.
    

      Steven Schwarz, Founding Partner of ViaWest Group, added: “Being in the 
      commercial real estate business, we recognize the opportunity that 
      CommLoan has identified, to change the way commercial mortgage real 
      estate financing currently works, which will result in a win-win for 
      both borrowers and lenders who use their platform.”
    

      CommLoan is the first company to create a marketplace platform capable 
      of sorting through thousands of lenders and potentially tens of 
      thousands of loan programs, matching commercial mortgage borrowers with 
      the perfect loan product. In addition to its state-of-the-art technology 
      platform, CommLoan provides borrowers with complete support throughout 
      the loan process through its experienced loan processing and 
      underwriting departments. CommLoan provides loans to borrowers directly 
      and also through its partnerships with commercial real estate brokerage 
      firms and other commercial mortgage brokerage firms.
    

      “The commercial real estate lending process is highly inefficient and 
      borrowers are limited as it relates to their access to lenders and loan 
      programs,” said Mitch Ginsberg, co-founder and CEO of CommLoan. 
      “CommLoan aims to make the process efficient for both lenders and 
      borrowers. For lenders on our platform, we offer access to a new source 
      of potential borrowers, together with consistent, pre-processed packages 
      underwritten to their specific guidelines. For borrowers, CommLoan gives 
      access to the best available pricing, while providing white glove 
      service throughout the lending process.”
    

      “Thanks to Social Leverage and ViaWest Group, we have found the ideal 
      partners who will help us take CommLoan to the next level,” said Marc 
      Mirbod, co-founder of CommLoan.

	 to compare how recession-proof CommLoan is relative to the industry. While a new recession may strike a particular industry, measuring the
	 industry and company's robustness during the last recession estimates its ability to weather future recessions.

	
Market Share of Competition: CommLoan vs. Largest Competitors
		A competitive analysis shows these companies are in the same general field as CommLoan, even though they may not compete head-to-head. 
		These are the largest companies by revenue. However, they may not have the largest market share in this industry if they have diversified into other business lines. 
		The "Competition" section of a business plan or investment memorandum would start by analyzing the information about these companies.
		Competitive advantage comes from offering better pricing or superior products/service.
