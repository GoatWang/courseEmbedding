(NYSE:GNC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»GNC: Did Goldman Sachs Really Just Reiterate Its $5 Price Target?Jul.28.17 | About: GNC Holdings, (GNC) Courage & Conviction Investing Long/short equity, bonds, special situations, growth at reasonable priceMarketplaceMarket AdventuresSummaryI share my thoughts on GNC's Q2 results and conference call.GNC is lapping very easy Q3 and Q4 same-store sales comparisons for the second half of 2017.I reiterate my $15 to $20 price target.I wasn't planning on writing a public site piece on GNC Holdings Inc. (GNC) as I have been focusing more of my time and energy on the interacting with my more engaged Marketplace readers. However, my new portfolio manager friend, the guy who is a PM for a multi-billion dollar European equity fund, for whom I helped make a lot of money in his "PA" in shares of GNC, pinged me this morning that the "great" Goldman Sachs issued an analyst note where Mr. Stephen Tanal reiterated his $5 price target. I almost fell off my chair when I read it. I view this as a call to action, and this has caused me to share some of my key GNC insights, as I have actively been on the GNC trail since January 2017. I took an inordinate risk to my reputation by going way out on a limb and pounding the table when I reiterated my GNC recommendation in the low $7 and mid $8s. Keep in mind that I was the sole voice in the analyst wilderness championing the GNC turnaround when the entire sell side had either "sell" or "neutral" price targets. It is during our darkest hours that we face what we want to be when we grow up, and I would argue that I answered the call and earned my "mettle". Keep in mind the well-coordinated bear raid by the Masters of the Universe (MOTU), an assault that included nearly 18 million shares (at the peak) being sold short from January 14, 2017 - May 31, 2017. Despite this tremendous selling pressing and repeated negative commentary from the risk-averse sell side, GNC was the little engine that could.


 So, despite the fact that I am going to probably lose a few Marketplace subscribers for sharing my work to the public site, I am compelled to do so, given the Goldman Sachs $5 price target. This article appeared on my Marketplace service this morning at 6 AM.  Sorry for the delay in writing this, as I was stuck in traffic during the live Q2 2017 GNC earnings call. After reading it, I thought it was excellent! The only element of the call that caught me slightly off guard was the "My Man" Robert Moran didn't appear to have this usual spunk. Perhaps he too wanted to deliver a "knockout punch" to the Master of the Universe shorts. Although Q2 results were encouraging and are vectoring in the right direction (from a 2nd derivative perspective), we needed another $15 million of revenue to have had the MOTU running for hills. Before I delve into the report, I want to reiterate what I said yesterday at 7:15 AM and then again at 9:25 AM. The short-term future trajectory of GNC's stock price will be determined by the tug of war between the MOTU and the buy side. We know that, as of July 14th, GNC had 27.28 million shares short. We also know that as of March 31st (the 6/30/17 institutional holders list will be available on August 15th) that GNC has had weak buy side support. 

 My point is that if the MOTU are concerned enough to cover and the buy side is intrigued enough to accumulate some shares, then GNC will rise from yesterday's close of $10.95 to $15 to $20 and in short order. If, on the other hand, the MOTU remain stubborn and triple down on their bad short bet, and the buy side waits for one more good quarter, then GNC will remain range bound between $9 and $12. Said differently, on the buy side, there are the Big 5 Movers and Shakers: Fidelity, Capital Group (owner of American Funds), Wellington Management, Franklin Templeton, and T. Rowe Price. They are the biggest and some of the best active money managers in the United States.
 My swag estimate is that these five shops control upwards of $3 trillion in AUM and probably, collectively, control $750 billion to $1 trillion of equity capital with an active money management mandate. My long-winded point is that if some major PMs at one of these shops (Fido is already invested) decide to enter the fray, they will be buying at least a few million shares (if not more). Think about that for a second. If the PMs want to get in, then their traders will get an order ticket to buy $25 million to $50 million (absolute dollars' worth) of GNC. That said: A) I have no idea if the MOTU are concerned enough to cover B) I have no idea if the buy side is brave enough to get long GNC for a turnaround Next, let's discuss Q2. Highlight from Robert Moran's introductory remarks: 7.8 million myGNC Rewards members and 325,000 Pro Access members. The Pro Access number is a little light.  

 GNC's private label brands picked up 300 basis points since March (as they have higher margins) and they signed an exclusive deal with Performix. 

 Highlight from Tricia Tolivar's introductory remarks: Best comps in six quarters 


 Better franchise-owned store comps and strength in China 

 Better than feared gross margins 

 Gained more clarity on its $250 million free cash flow target and stated the revolver will be paid down by the end of 2017. 

Conference call Q&A highlights: (see link to SA transcript) Reiterated the positive second half comps. 

By the way, let's dust off my model from my Baking the Cake Piece. And, for new readers, I posted the model to subscribers a few days earlier. Focus on Q1 and Q2 Company Owned Revenue (in other words the baseline that we are comping against). In Q1 2016, the baseline revenue per company owned stores was $138,421 in revenue, per average store for the quarter. In Q2 2016, the baseline revenue per company owned stores was $138,105 in revenue, per average store for the quarter. Q1 and Q2 


 In Q3 2016, the baseline revenue per company owned stores was $125,259 in revenue, per average store for the quarter. In Q4 2016, the baseline revenue per company owned stores was $111,846 in revenue, per average store for the quarter. It is crystal clear that GNC should EASILY be able to post positive same-store sales during the 2nd half of 2017, as it is lapping a very low bar. This should keep the shorts up at night!  Q3 and Q4 

 Next, GNC has already closed 75 company-owned stores during the first half of 2017, and it guided for an additional 125 to 175 more closings. This will free up lots of working capital in the form of inventory dollars and should improve overall margins.  See here: 

 See here: 

 Also, note that GNC's average lease is only 2.5 years, so this gives it lots of flexibility and is a major advantage compared to other retailers with long lease commitments.  


 JPMorgan's analyst tried to pin down Tricia Tolivar on BOGO, and she wasn't having it! 

 Let's look at some numbers. Gross margin of 33.2% was better than feared. Note that SG&A was up $15 million, hence EPS was lower for the QoQ period.  

 Cash flow from operations was solid despite a big decrease in payables and accused liabilities.  

 Some store closures, but in line with expectations. The International closure rate was a little higher than I would have liked but, all in all, nothing to be concerned about.  

 Takeaway As I promised, I didn't and have no plans of selling any of my 3,000 GNC shares. I was very encouraged by the Q2 2017 conference call. My sense is that we will see $15 (if not more) for GNC's stock within the next few months. The late day big leg up into the last 20 minutes of yesterday's trading session came on a surge of massive volume, which kind of tips the MOTU hands that they are looking for weaker prey to eat. GNC has been proven as a rugged lion that is strong enough to fight off a packing of weasley hyenas. Also, Tricia Tolivar seemed very impressive on the conference call.
 

 Here is the late day surge chart (from Fidelity).

                Case Study: The Collapse of Lehman Brothers

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. With $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in debt, Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in history, as its assets far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide.
Lehman's demise also made it the largest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage-induced financial crisis that swept through global financial markets in 2008. Lehman's collapse was a seminal event that greatly intensified the 2008 crisis and contributed to the erosion of close to $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets in October 2008, the biggest monthly decline on record at the time.
The History of Lehman Brothers
Lehman Brothers had humble origins, tracing its roots back to a small general store that was founded by German immigrant Henry Lehman in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. In 1850, Henry Lehman and his brothers, Emanuel and Mayer, founded Lehman Brothers.
While the firm prospered over the following decades as the U.S. economy grew into an international powerhouse, Lehman had to contend with plenty of challenges over the years. Lehman survived them all – the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, two world wars, a capital shortage when it was spun off by American Express Co. (AXP) in 1994, and the Long Term Capital Management collapse and Russian debt default of 1998. However, despite its ability to survive past disasters, the collapse of the U.S. housing market ultimately brought Lehman Brothers to its knees, as its headlong rush into the subprime mortgage market proved to be a disastrous step.
The Prime Culprit
In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing boom (read, bubble) well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders, including subprime lender BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans (made to borrowers without full documentation). Lehman's acquisitions at first seemed prescient; record revenues from Lehman's real estate businesses enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006, a faster rate of growth than other businesses in investment banking or asset management. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006, a 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, the firm reported net income of a record $4.2 billion on revenue of $19.3 billion.
Lehman's Colossal Miscalculation
In February 2007, the stock reached a record $86.18, giving Lehman a market capitalization of close to $60 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent as defaults on subprime mortgages rose to a seven-year high. On March 14, 2007, a day after the stock had its biggest one-day drop in five years on concerns that rising defaults would affect Lehman's profitability, the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. In the post-earnings conference call, Lehman's chief financial officer (CFO) said that the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings. He also said that he did not foresee problems in the subprime market spreading to the rest of the housing market or hurting the U.S. economy.
The Beginning of the End
As the credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, Lehman's stock fell sharply. During that month, the company eliminated 2,500 mortgage-related jobs and shut down its BNC unit. In addition, it also closed offices of Alt-A lender Aurora in three states. Even as the correction in the U.S. housing market gained momentum, Lehman continued to be a major player in the mortgage market. In 2007, Lehman underwrote more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85 billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lehman's stock rebounded, as global equity markets reached new highs and prices for fixed-income assets staged a temporary rebound. However, the firm did not take the opportunity to trim its massive mortgage portfolio, which in retrospect, would turn out to be its last chance.
Hurtling Toward Failure
Lehman's high degree of leverage – the ratio of total assets to shareholders equity – was 31 in 2007, and its huge portfolio of mortgage securities made it increasingly vulnerable to deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, following the near-collapse of Bear Stearns – the second-largest underwriter of mortgage-backed securities – Lehman shares fell as much as 48% on concern it would be the next Wall Street firm to fail. Confidence in the company returned to some extent in April, after it raised $4 billion through an issue of preferred stock that was convertible into Lehman shares at a 32% premium to its price at the time. However, the stock resumed its decline as hedge fund managers began questioning the valuation of Lehman's mortgage portfolio.
On June 9, Lehman announced a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, its first loss since being spun off by American Express, and reported that it had raised another $6 billion from investors. The firm also said that it had boosted its liquidity pool to an estimated $45 billion, decreased gross assets by $147 billion, reduced its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages by 20%, and cut down leverage from a factor of 32 to about 25.
Too Little, Too Late
However, these measures were perceived as being too little, too late. Over the summer, Lehman's management made unsuccessful overtures to a number of potential partners. The stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent by selling part of its asset management unit and spinning off commercial real estate assets. Hopes that the Korea Development Bank would take a stake in Lehman were dashed on September 9, as the state-owned South Korean bank put talks on hold.
The news was a deathblow to Lehman, leading to a 45% plunge in the stock and a 66% spike in credit-default swaps on the company's debt. The company's hedge fund clients began pulling out, while its short-term creditors cut credit lines. On September 10, Lehman pre-announced dismal fiscal third-quarter results that underscored the fragility of its financial position. The firm reported a loss of $3.9 billion, including a write-down of $5.6 billion, and also announced a sweeping strategic restructuring of its businesses. The same day, Moody's Investor Service announced that it was reviewing Lehman's credit ratings, and also said that Lehman would have to sell a majority stake to a strategic partner in order to avoid a ratings downgrade. These developments led to a 42% plunge in the stock on September 11.
With only $1 billion left in cash by the end of that week, Lehman was quickly running out of time. Last-ditch efforts over the weekend of September 13 between Lehman, Barclays PLC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), aimed at facilitating a takeover of Lehman, were unsuccessful. On Monday September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.
The Bottom Line
Lehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given the size of the company and its status as a major player in the U.S. and internationally. Many questioned the U.S. government's decision to let Lehman fail, as compared to its tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) in March 2008. Lehman's bankruptcy led to more than $46 billion of its market value being wiped out. Its collapse also served as the catalyst for the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America in an emergency deal that was also announced on September 15.

                Case Study: The Collapse of Lehman Brothers

On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy. With $639 billion in assets and $619 billion in debt, Lehman's bankruptcy filing was the largest in history, as its assets far surpassed those of previous bankrupt giants such as WorldCom and Enron. Lehman was the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank at the time of its collapse, with 25,000 employees worldwide.
Lehman's demise also made it the largest victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage-induced financial crisis that swept through global financial markets in 2008. Lehman's collapse was a seminal event that greatly intensified the 2008 crisis and contributed to the erosion of close to $10 trillion in market capitalization from global equity markets in October 2008, the biggest monthly decline on record at the time.
The History of Lehman Brothers
Lehman Brothers had humble origins, tracing its roots back to a small general store that was founded by German immigrant Henry Lehman in Montgomery, Alabama in 1844. In 1850, Henry Lehman and his brothers, Emanuel and Mayer, founded Lehman Brothers.
While the firm prospered over the following decades as the U.S. economy grew into an international powerhouse, Lehman had to contend with plenty of challenges over the years. Lehman survived them all – the railroad bankruptcies of the 1800s, the Great Depression of the 1930s, two world wars, a capital shortage when it was spun off by American Express Co. (AXP) in 1994, and the Long Term Capital Management collapse and Russian debt default of 1998. However, despite its ability to survive past disasters, the collapse of the U.S. housing market ultimately brought Lehman Brothers to its knees, as its headlong rush into the subprime mortgage market proved to be a disastrous step.
The Prime Culprit
In 2003 and 2004, with the U.S. housing boom (read, bubble) well under way, Lehman acquired five mortgage lenders, including subprime lender BNC Mortgage and Aurora Loan Services, which specialized in Alt-A loans (made to borrowers without full documentation). Lehman's acquisitions at first seemed prescient; record revenues from Lehman's real estate businesses enabled revenues in the capital markets unit to surge 56% from 2004 to 2006, a faster rate of growth than other businesses in investment banking or asset management. The firm securitized $146 billion of mortgages in 2006, a 10% increase from 2005. Lehman reported record profits every year from 2005 to 2007. In 2007, the firm reported net income of a record $4.2 billion on revenue of $19.3 billion.
Lehman's Colossal Miscalculation
In February 2007, the stock reached a record $86.18, giving Lehman a market capitalization of close to $60 billion. However, by the first quarter of 2007, cracks in the U.S. housing market were already becoming apparent as defaults on subprime mortgages rose to a seven-year high. On March 14, 2007, a day after the stock had its biggest one-day drop in five years on concerns that rising defaults would affect Lehman's profitability, the firm reported record revenues and profit for its fiscal first quarter. In the post-earnings conference call, Lehman's chief financial officer (CFO) said that the risks posed by rising home delinquencies were well contained and would have little impact on the firm's earnings. He also said that he did not foresee problems in the subprime market spreading to the rest of the housing market or hurting the U.S. economy.
The Beginning of the End
As the credit crisis erupted in August 2007 with the failure of two Bear Stearns hedge funds, Lehman's stock fell sharply. During that month, the company eliminated 2,500 mortgage-related jobs and shut down its BNC unit. In addition, it also closed offices of Alt-A lender Aurora in three states. Even as the correction in the U.S. housing market gained momentum, Lehman continued to be a major player in the mortgage market. In 2007, Lehman underwrote more mortgage-backed securities than any other firm, accumulating an $85 billion portfolio, or four times its shareholders' equity. In the fourth quarter of 2007, Lehman's stock rebounded, as global equity markets reached new highs and prices for fixed-income assets staged a temporary rebound. However, the firm did not take the opportunity to trim its massive mortgage portfolio, which in retrospect, would turn out to be its last chance.
Hurtling Toward Failure
Lehman's high degree of leverage – the ratio of total assets to shareholders equity – was 31 in 2007, and its huge portfolio of mortgage securities made it increasingly vulnerable to deteriorating market conditions. On March 17, 2008, following the near-collapse of Bear Stearns – the second-largest underwriter of mortgage-backed securities – Lehman shares fell as much as 48% on concern it would be the next Wall Street firm to fail. Confidence in the company returned to some extent in April, after it raised $4 billion through an issue of preferred stock that was convertible into Lehman shares at a 32% premium to its price at the time. However, the stock resumed its decline as hedge fund managers began questioning the valuation of Lehman's mortgage portfolio.
On June 9, Lehman announced a second-quarter loss of $2.8 billion, its first loss since being spun off by American Express, and reported that it had raised another $6 billion from investors. The firm also said that it had boosted its liquidity pool to an estimated $45 billion, decreased gross assets by $147 billion, reduced its exposure to residential and commercial mortgages by 20%, and cut down leverage from a factor of 32 to about 25.
Too Little, Too Late
However, these measures were perceived as being too little, too late. Over the summer, Lehman's management made unsuccessful overtures to a number of potential partners. The stock plunged 77% in the first week of September 2008, amid plummeting equity markets worldwide, as investors questioned CEO Richard Fuld's plan to keep the firm independent by selling part of its asset management unit and spinning off commercial real estate assets. Hopes that the Korea Development Bank would take a stake in Lehman were dashed on September 9, as the state-owned South Korean bank put talks on hold.
The news was a deathblow to Lehman, leading to a 45% plunge in the stock and a 66% spike in credit-default swaps on the company's debt. The company's hedge fund clients began pulling out, while its short-term creditors cut credit lines. On September 10, Lehman pre-announced dismal fiscal third-quarter results that underscored the fragility of its financial position. The firm reported a loss of $3.9 billion, including a write-down of $5.6 billion, and also announced a sweeping strategic restructuring of its businesses. The same day, Moody's Investor Service announced that it was reviewing Lehman's credit ratings, and also said that Lehman would have to sell a majority stake to a strategic partner in order to avoid a ratings downgrade. These developments led to a 42% plunge in the stock on September 11.
With only $1 billion left in cash by the end of that week, Lehman was quickly running out of time. Last-ditch efforts over the weekend of September 13 between Lehman, Barclays PLC and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), aimed at facilitating a takeover of Lehman, were unsuccessful. On Monday September 15, Lehman declared bankruptcy, resulting in the stock plunging 93% from its previous close on September 12.
The Bottom Line
Lehman's collapse roiled global financial markets for weeks, given the size of the company and its status as a major player in the U.S. and internationally. Many questioned the U.S. government's decision to let Lehman fail, as compared to its tacit support for Bear Stearns, which was acquired by JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) in March 2008. Lehman's bankruptcy led to more than $46 billion of its market value being wiped out. Its collapse also served as the catalyst for the purchase of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America in an emergency deal that was also announced on September 15.

Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GC6 Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Affirms GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GC6 Commercial Mortgage 
      Pass-Through Certificates
    





December 14, 2016 05:22 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed all 10 rated classes of Goldman Sachs 
      Mortgage Company GS Mortgage Securities Trust (GSMS) commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates series 2012-GC6. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on overall stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool. As of the November 2016 distribution date, 
      the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 12.7% to 
      $1.007 billion from $1.154 billion at issuance. One loan (1.9%) was 
      previously in special servicing and modified due to a violation of the 
      loan covenants but was returned to master servicer in February 2014 
      after approval of a transfer of ownership. There are currently no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans. Six loans (4.6%) are fully 
      defeased.
    

      Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the 
      pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 
      4.8% increase since the previous year and an 11.9% increase since 
      issuance for those loans reporting financials.
    

      Loans of Concern: Fitch has designated three top 15 loans (12%), 
      SunTrust International Center, Audubon Crossing and Audubon Commons, and 
      Chase Tower, as Fitch Loans of Concern. Each property has seen declines 
      in occupancy. Secondary Markets: Several of the largest loans within the 
      pool are backed by properties located in secondary markets. Locations 
      such as Reno, NV, Rochester, NY, Lancaster, PA, and North Olmsted, OH 
      are all represented by top 15 loans.
    

      Hotel Concentration: Loans backed by hotel properties represent 15.1% of 
      the pool, including two within the top 15. The average Fitch LTV for 
      hotels in the pool is 97.3%.
    

      Retail Concentration: Loans backed by retail properties represent 41% of 
      the pool.
    

      Minimal Subordinate Debt: Only one loan, representing 0.7% of the pool, 
      has additional debt. 13 loans, 25.3% of the pool, allow for future debt.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes
    

      --$0.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$570.5 
      million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$89.9 million class 
      A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$903.2 million class X-A at 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$119.8 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$63.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$44.7 
      million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$49.1 million class D 
      at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$21.6 million class E at 'BBsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$11.5 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Classes A-1 has repaid in full. Fitch does not rate the class G and 
      class X-B certificates.

Goldman Sachs: 'Cautiously optimistic' on oil prices as supply-demand rebalancing


 Goldman Sachs said it remained cautiously optimistic on oil prices, despite the rebound over the past month Supportive factors included stock drawdown, falling U.S. rig count and robust demand, it said But too large a price recovery will increase downside risk as shale production can ramp up rapidly, it added

Oil pumpjacks in the Permian Basin oil field are getting to work as crude oil prices gain.


The rebalancing in the oil market is accelerating, said Goldman Sachs in a note on Thursday.
"While OPEC's production path remains uncertain, recent fundamental oil data have come in even better than we had expected," Goldman said. "If sustained, these trends would help achieve the normalization in inventories by early next year." 
Oil prices have rebounded over the past month due to large inventory draws, falling U.S. rig count and strong demand demand data, with prices rising above Goldman's September 2017 forecast of $50 a barrel Brent, the investment bank noted.

Data out of the U.S., Europe, Singapore and Japan point to overall inventory declines of 83 million barrels since March, according to Goldman's data.

Robust demand in particular has sent spot prices outperforming two-year forward West Texas intermediate prices by $2.40 barrel over the past month, Goldman analyst Damien Courvalin wrote in the note. 
Europe, the U.S., India and China were driving up consumption and Goldman expected this strong demand growth to remain in place through the second half of the year.  Its forecasts pointed to sustained draws through the third quarter of the year.

This would cause near-term tightness in the physical oil market, which will push prices into a backwardation pattern this year, which means cargoes for near-term delivery would be priced higher than those for later shipment, the house added.
The investment bank, however, said it remains "cautiously optimistic" on prices from the current level as improvements in supply-demand fundamentals need to be sustained for the market to rally further.
Too large a price recovery now would only increase downside risk to its year-end $55 a barrel forecast as shale production can ramp up rapidly in response to price gains, it said.

Oil futures were flat Friday morning in Asia trade, with U.S. crude moving around $49 a barrel, while Brent crude was trading around $51.45 a barrel.

                File-storage company is working with bank to prepare filing
            



                JPMorgan is also said to be in talks for role on the listing
            



Dropbox Inc. is expected to hire Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as lead adviser on its potential initial public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.The file-sharing company is working with Goldman Sachs to prepare documents for an IPO that could be filed as soon as this year, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details aren’t public. Dropbox has also held talks with JPMorgan Chase & Co. about a role on the listing, though no banks have yet been officially mandated, the people said.No final decisions have been made and Dropbox may choose not to go forward with the IPO process. Goldman Sachs has previously advised the company on a credit line as well as earlier funding rounds, the people said.








Representatives for Dropbox, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment.After its founding in 2007, Dropbox gained a loyal following from people looking to store photos and other files in the cloud, making them available from any computer or mobile device. It rode this wave to a $10 billion valuation in early 2014, making it one of Silicon Valley’s most valuable unicorn startups.The company’s chief executive officer and co-founder, Drew Houston, said in April that the company is now generating a profit excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a key metric that investors will watch as the software maker moves closer to becoming a public company."It’s rare for software companies to be operating at our scale with our level of profitability and to be growing at the rate that we are," Houston said in an interview with Bloomberg Television at the time.

Is Low-Single-Digit Revenue Growth The Best Goldman Sachs Can Do? - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Is Low-Single-Digit Revenue Growth The Best Goldman Sachs Can Do?Jul.27.17 | About: Goldman Sachs (GS) Brian Gilmartin, CFA Long only, value, Growth, large-capwww.trinityasset.comSummarySecond quarter in a row of very poor FICC results against easier comps from 2016.Goldman, one of few left with the 1990s proprietary trading model.ROE of 8.7% in Q2 '17 was a metric that stood out.With Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) reporting its second-quarter financial results on July 18, 2017, the actual earnings per share of $3.95 beat the estimate of $3.39 by 17% and the actual revenue of $7.9 billion beat the estimate of $7.5 billion by 6%. In the post-2008 world, with the death and destruction of many of the old Wall Street trading and investment banking firms, the old proprietary traders that made big bets with shareholder capital, the new "model" that has emerged is the asset-gathering model, or asset management, which has been around for decades, but is lower risk (for sure) and also lower return. Eyeballing the numbers, asset management revenue is still less than 20% of total net revenue, and the pre-tax asset management earnings (per the 10-Q) have varied from 11% to 13% of total pre-tax for the last 8-12 quarters. When we wrote our Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) earnings preview on July 14th, it was discussed at that time how the old discount brokers are the new "model" for Wall Street, with no proprietary trading, continually lower costs to trade and invest, with the primary focus on asset-gathering activity, i.e. a stable and consistent revenue stream that is much less volatile than making big bets with the balance sheet. Of the two traditional "white-shoe" investment banks remaining, Goldman and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Morgan Stanley has outperformed Goldman, thanks to a slightly better return on equity (ROE), but when compared with Schwab (granted, not an apples-to-apples comparison), Schwab's ROE is north of 13% with a 40% operating margin.

 Weekly chart 

Goldman's daily chart shows the stock holding the key level near $220. The stock does look like it wants to trade higher. A trade below the second quarter's low near $209 would not be good. The second chart might worry investors a little more - it shows Goldman's "double top" with the $250 high tick at $250 in 2007 and then again at $250 during the first week of March, 2017. Analysis/conclusion Goldman remains one of the heaviest Financial sector positions across client accounts, second to only Schwab, the largest Financial sector position. The poor FICC results the last two quarters against very easy comps for the first half of 2016 are worrisome, although some of the commodities like crude oil, copper and steel look to be bottoming. That being said, the fact is that with the SP 500 up 8% YTD as of June 30, and the credit markets and interest rates being fairly well behaved (this doesn't even mention or discuss the recovery in Emerging Markets or Europe), typically Goldman Sachs prints money in this type of Wall Street environment, and yet it's not done well for two solid quarters for the capital markets.
 Morgan Stanley made a solid commitment to the money management or advisor segment right after 2008, and it has paid off in the stock price as Morgan Stanley reported decent results for Q2 '17 and the stock price rallied post earnings. Goldman's valuation is hardly excessive, like most financials, but revenue growth is expected to remain tepid for the next few years. The bottom line is that even with the Republicans possibly making headway on tax reform and financial reform, the US financial system isn't returning to the kind of proprietary trading that was the hallmark of the 1990s. From a practical shareholder perspective, clients could get a similar business model with the benefit of corporate lending from JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) or Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and more earnings stability. Am I giving up that much potential upside in an environment of stable capital markets owning JPMorgan versus a Goldman Sachs? Hard to say, but I don't think so. The goal is to stay with Goldman Sachs for now, but I worry that the iconic, white-shoe investment banker has the business model more suited for the last bull market rather than the bull market of the post-2008 world.

      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 11 classes of Goldman Sachs Mortgage 
      Company's GS Mortgage Securities Trust (GSMS) commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates series 2012-GC6 due to stable performance 
      since issuance. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral pool. As of the December distribution, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been paid down by 2.13% to $1.13 billion from 
      $1.15 billion at issuance. All of the loans reported partial year 2013 
      financials. Based on the annualized 2013 NOIs, the pool's overall net 
      operating income (NOI) has been stable with a 4.9% NOI increase over the 
      portfolio NOI at issuance.
    

      There is currently one asset in special servicing (0.44% of the pool), 
      which was transferred from the master servicer in February 2013. While 
      Fitch is modeling losses on this asset, the expected losses are not 
      anticipated to significantly impact credit enhancement.
    

      RATINGS SENSITIVITY
    

      The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable. Additional 
      information on rating sensitivity is available in the report 'GS 
      Mortgage Securities Trust 2012-GC6'(Feb. 29, 2012), available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.
    

      The asset in special servicing is the real estate owned (REO), Lockaway 
      Self Storage, an 82,875-sf storage facility located in Killeen, TX. The 
      facility is located close to the military base of Fort Hood and 
      experienced a significant drop in occupancy during the first quarter of 
      2013 when soldier's stationed at the base returned after an overseas 
      deployment. The property has experienced a rebound in occupancy and the 
      special servicer is currently evaluating disposition options.
    

      The largest contributor to Fitch's modeled losses is Audubon Crossing 
      and Audubon Commons (4.01% of the pool). The loan is collateralized by a 
      449,170-sf anchored retail center located in Audubon, NJ. The retail 
      center experienced a significant drop in net operating income during the 
      2013 calendar year although occupancy remains relatively stable. 
      Additionally, the sponsor is attempting to secure a significant 
      reimbursement for repairs undertaken which were the responsibility of a 
      tenant.
    

      The second largest contributor to modeled losses is the Mansards 
      Apartments (4.41%). The loan is secured by a multifamily complex 
      consisting of 1,337 units, located in Griffith, IN. The property is 
      located in a submarket of the Gary-Hammond, IN and it continues to 
      struggle from the effects of the last recession. The property's NOI 
      decreased 14% during 2012 and was attributable to a drop in the 
      occupancy rate during the second half of the year. The borrower is 
      working to improve occupancy, with the latest reported occupancy at 81%.
    

      Fitch affirms the following classes:
    

      --$40.9 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$82.2 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$570.5 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$89.9 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$903.2 million class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$119.8 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$63.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44.7 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$49.1 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21.6 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$11.5 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Fitch does not rate the class G and class X-B certificates.

      Fitch Ratings has affirmed all 10 rated classes of Goldman Sachs 
      Mortgage Company GS Mortgage Securities Trust (GSMS) commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates series 2012-GC6. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows at the end of this release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are based on overall stable performance of the 
      underlying collateral pool. As of the November 2016 distribution date, 
      the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 12.7% to 
      $1.007 billion from $1.154 billion at issuance. One loan (1.9%) was 
      previously in special servicing and modified due to a violation of the 
      loan covenants but was returned to master servicer in February 2014 
      after approval of a transfer of ownership. There are currently no 
      delinquent or specially serviced loans. Six loans (4.6%) are fully 
      defeased.
    

      Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the 
      pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 
      4.8% increase since the previous year and an 11.9% increase since 
      issuance for those loans reporting financials.
    

      Loans of Concern: Fitch has designated three top 15 loans (12%), 
      SunTrust International Center, Audubon Crossing and Audubon Commons, and 
      Chase Tower, as Fitch Loans of Concern. Each property has seen declines 
      in occupancy. Secondary Markets: Several of the largest loans within the 
      pool are backed by properties located in secondary markets. Locations 
      such as Reno, NV, Rochester, NY, Lancaster, PA, and North Olmsted, OH 
      are all represented by top 15 loans.
    

      Hotel Concentration: Loans backed by hotel properties represent 15.1% of 
      the pool, including two within the top 15. The average Fitch LTV for 
      hotels in the pool is 97.3%.
    

      Retail Concentration: Loans backed by retail properties represent 41% of 
      the pool.
    

      Minimal Subordinate Debt: Only one loan, representing 0.7% of the pool, 
      has additional debt. 13 loans, 25.3% of the pool, allow for future debt.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following classes
    

      --$0.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$570.5 
      million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$89.9 million class 
      A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$903.2 million class X-A at 
      'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$119.8 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$63.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$44.7 
      million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$49.1 million class D 
      at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$21.6 million class E at 'BBsf'; 
      Outlook Stable;--$11.5 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Classes A-1 has repaid in full. Fitch does not rate the class G and 
      class X-B certificates.

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided “as is” without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001.

(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is launching a new digital platform where customers of other wealth management firms and brokerages can apply for loans, the bank said on Thursday.The platform, called GS Select, will make loans of $75,000 to $25 million using borrowers' investment portfolios as collateral.To find customers, Goldman is partnering with Fidelity Investment's clearing and custody business, which caters to small brokerages and wealth management firms. Those firms, in turn, have investors who may need loans."It's a relatively lower risk marketplace but a very big market," Andy Kaiser, head of Goldman's private bank, said in an interview.

Goldman is turning to third parties because as a Wall Street bank that deals with ultra wealthy investors and corporations, it does not have direct relationships with so-called "mass affluent" borrowers who have less than $10 million in investable assets. Its own wealth clients typically have at least $50 million.Reuters first reported on the plan in May 2016.The bank says GS Select will be able to approve and process loans in just one day, and eliminate loads of paperwork that typically accompany applications.

In recent years, Goldman has been trying to grow traditional banking businesses it has little experience with as businesses like bond trading have slowed down.Last year, it purchased $17 billion worth of online retail deposits from GE Capital Bank. It also launched Marcus, its first major foray into consumer lending, and acquired Honest Dollar, an online retirement savings platform for small businesses and startups.Goldman has nearly tripled its funded loans over the last four years, but its $64 billion loan portfolio at the end of 2016 is only a fraction of those of bigger consumer banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co.Goldman's chief rival Morgan Stanley has also been trying to lend more to its own wealth clients, primarily through securities-based loans.(Reporting by Olivia Oran in New York; Editing by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Richard Chang) Continue reading the main story

Jul 27, 2:29 PM EDT
Goldman Sachs is entering a growing market where it plans to lend money to wealthy investors who want to use their stocks and bonds as collateral


By KEN SWEET
AP Business Writer










 

































         NEW YORK        (AP) -- Goldman Sachs is looking to lend wealthy investors up to $25 million, using their stocks and bonds as collateral. The investment bank announced a partnership Thursday with Fidelity Investments under which it will offer investors loans starting at $75,000. The loans will be backed by the stocks and bonds the investors hold in Fidelity-held brokerage accounts. US Bank is also participating as a lender. A number of Wall Street brokerage houses offer these kinds of loans, which can be a way for investors to get cash without selling investments. For example, a wealthy customer looking to buy a house may use his or her assets to make an all-cash offer on a house in order to be more competitive, and then later refinance the loan with a mortgage. It's become a growing business for Wall Street firms, as trading revenue has declined due to the rise of discount brokerage houses and other cheaper forms of investing. Morgan Stanley said last week that lending in its wealth management division grew 6 percent from a year earlier. The Goldman and US Bank loans will be through a network of 3,500 wealth management firms that use Fidelity as a clearinghouse for their clients' assets, not through Fidelity's retail branches. These are not 401(k) loans, and are largely aimed at wealthy customers. While the loans may start with a wealth adviser, and are using the assets held by Fidelity, the money for the loan is ultimately coming from Goldman Sachs and US Bank. © 2017 The Associated Press.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are based on overall stable performance of the underlying collateral pool. As of the November 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 12.7% to $1.007 billion from $1.154 billion at issuance. One loan (1.9%) was previously in special servicing and modified due to a violation of the loan covenants but was returned to master servicer in February 2014 after approval of a transfer of ownership. There are currently no delinquent or specially serviced loans. Six loans (4.6%) are fully defeased.Stable Performance: Based on full-year 2015 financial statements, the pool's overall net operating income has been relatively stable with a 4.8% increase since the previous year and an 11.9% increase since issuance for those loans reporting financials.Loans of Concern: Fitch has designated three top 15 loans (12%), SunTrust International Center, Audubon Crossing and Audubon Commons, and Chase Tower, as Fitch Loans of Concern. Each property has seen declines in occupancy. Secondary Markets: Several of the largest loans within the pool are backed by properties located in secondary markets. Locations such as Reno, NV, Rochester, NY, Lancaster, PA, and North Olmsted, OH are all represented by top 15 loans.Hotel Concentration: Loans backed by hotel properties represent 15.1% of the pool, including two within the top 15. The average Fitch LTV for hotels in the pool is 97.3%.Retail Concentration: Loans backed by retail properties represent 41% of the pool.Minimal Subordinate Debt: Only one loan, representing 0.7% of the pool, has additional debt. 13 loans, 25.3% of the pool, allow for future debt.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following classes--$0.7 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$570.5 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$89.9 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$903.2 million class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$119.8 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$63.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$44.7 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$49.1 million class D at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$21.6 million class E at 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$11.5 million class F at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable.Classes A-1 has repaid in full.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch’s ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided “as is” without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
