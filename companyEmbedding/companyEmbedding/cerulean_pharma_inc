(GlobeNewswire) - Dar Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:DARE) (formerly known as Cerulean Pharma Inc., and formerly traded under NASDAQ:CERU) announced today the outcomes of three important transactions: (i) approval by Cerulean stockholders of the purchase of all of the outstanding common shares and options of Dar Bioscience (which has been renamed Dar Bioscience Operations, Inc. to avoid confusion with the renamed Cerulean), (ii) approval by Cerulean stockholders of the sale of all rights related to the Dynamic Tumor Targeting Platform to Novartis for $6 million in cash, and (iii) approval by Cerulean stockholders and authorization by the Cerulean board of directors of a 10 to 1 reverse stock split. As a result of these transactions, the stockholders of pre-closing Dar have become owners of approximately 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company, while the stockholders of pre-closing Cerulean will continue to own approximately 49% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company, which represents the maximum ownership possible for the pre-closing Cerulean stockholders under the stock purchase agreement entered into between the companies on March 19, 2017.
Following the closing of the transaction, Sabrina Martucci Johnson, President and CEO of Dar, became the President and CEO of Cerulean and joined its board of directors and Lisa Walters-Hoffert, CFO of Dar, became Ceruleans CFO. The operations of Dar and Cerulean are being combined, with the combined company operating under the name Dar Bioscience, Inc. and led solely by Dars management team.
Dar`s transition to the public market represents a significant milestone for us, stated Sabrina Martucci Johnson, President and CEO of Dar. We are grateful for the support of the Cerulean stockholders. Dar is committed to building a strong company in womens reproductive health, beginning with our first clinical candidate, Ovaprene. We believe Dar represents an attractive business with considerable product candidate opportunities and market potential.
Conference Call and WebcastDar will hold a conference call on Monday, July 24, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time to provide an overview and business update.Interested parties may access the conference call by dialing (844) 831-3031 from the U.S. and (443) 637-1284 from outside the U.S. and should request the Dar Call, conference ID 58451998. The conference call also will be webcast live over the Internet and can be accessed at http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/mmj5wibt.
About Dar Bioscience, Inc. (formerly Cerulean Pharma Inc.)
Dar is a healthcare company committed to the development and commercialization of innovative products in womens reproductive health. We have identified areas within this market segment that remain underserved and believe they offer opportunities to generate value for both investors and women.
The problem isnt early innovation. The global donor community of foundations and governments has invested tens of millions of dollars in early-stage and clinical-stage research to expand options, improve outcomes and advance global womens reproductive health. In addition, independent private innovators have developed new approaches to address unmet needs. Yet, promising candidates often fail to advance for reasons unrelated to results, but rather because of shifting strategic priorities or a lack of dedicated funding.
The problem isnt commercialization. Large and medium-size pharmaceutical companies with established sales and marketing franchises in womens health exist. However, many of these companies prefer to get involved in later stages of development, e.g., in pivotal trials or following an application for regulatory approval.
The problem is the gap. We believe that this gap between innovation and commercialization in womens reproductive health creates an opportunity for Dar. Our business model is to license the rights to promising product candidates (many with clinical proof-of-concept data), advance their clinical development, and if successful, implement a comprehensive global commercialization strategy in combination with established pharmaceutical partners and regional distributors. We believe this approach is efficient in both its use of time and financial resources.
The contraceptive market in particular represents an interesting segment for Dar. Since the approval of the birth control pill by the FDA in 1960, most contraception innovation has focused on the use of hormones. Little innovation has occurred to create new non-hormonal options, leaving a void in the method mix and creating a potential opportunity. Todays non-hormonal alternatives include condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides, all of which require intervention at the time of intercourse and most of which have marginal efficacy. There is a need for something better.
First product candidate, Ovaprene
Ovaprene is a clinical stage, non-hormonal contraceptive ring intended to provide protection over multiple weeks of use, require no intervention at the time of intercourse, and fill a void in todays contraception method mix.
Research has shown that as many as 40% of women using contraception say they are not satisfied with their current method, reporting difficulty of use, problems with side effects, and concerns about effectiveness and reduced sexual pleasure.
A convenient, easy-to-use and effective non-hormonal option could appeal to a portion of the 22% of women currently using one of todays non-hormonal methods.
Ovaprenewould represent a new category of birth control and expand options.
A contraceptive ring, whose use is initiated and controlled by a woman, has numerous attributes that women find appealing. Published surveys revealed the following:
A vaginal ring has most of the features they deemed extremely important,
85% of women surveyed reported they would prefer a monthly option with a lower hormone dose than the pill, and
80% currently use a non-coital dependent method, meaning there is no intervention at the time of intercourse.
The only contraceptive ring on the market today is NuvaRing, a hormonal contraceptive ring with 2016 sales of $777 million. Our goal for Ovaprene is to provide similar monthly convenience and protection but without the use of hormones.
Ovaprenehas a custom intravaginal ring design, with a permeable mesh in the center of the ring that creates a partial barrier to sperm, and a mechanism to release locally acting spermiostatic agents through the ring. The unique combination of these two complementary approaches seeks to produce attractive contraceptive efficacy outcomes that are consistent with the most effective barrier option, the diaphragm, and short-acting hormonal options (oral pill, patches and vaginal ring) that provide88-91%effectiveness in typical use. Typical use refers to effectiveness experienced among all couples who use the method, including inconsistent and incorrect use.
In a pilot postcoital test (PCT) clinical trial conducted in 21 women and published in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine in 2009, Ovaprenedemonstrated the following:
Ability to immobilize sperm and prevent their progression into the cervical mucus,
Acceptability of the device to both partners, and
No serious adverse events were reported.
While the original pilot PCT clinical trial was not designed to be utilized as part of a regulatory submission, its data provide preliminary proof-of-concept contraceptive efficacy. PCT clinical trials have been used to assess the preliminary efficacy of other contraception methods that work by preventing or blocking the progression of sperm into the cervical mucus.
Our stockholders can expect the following benefits from the combination of Dar (formerly Cerulean) and Dar Operations:
Dar intends to commence a PCT clinical trial of Ovaprenewith CONRAD, a non-profit organization that oversaw the successful development and FDA approval of the Cayadiaphragm, the most recently approved barrier contraceptive device in combination with a locally-acting spermiostatic agent.
Based on our current projections and the cash from the transaction, we believe Dar will be adequately funded to advance Ovaprene through the completion of the PCT clinical trial within the next two years. A successful PCT clinical trial outcome would represent a meaningful milestone and should allow Dar to proceed directly to a pivotal contraceptive efficacy trial in the United States.
Dar is currently in discussions regarding other product candidates that meet our selection criteria. We are also exploring co-development opportunities with non-profit partners and foundations as a way to leverage their tremendous investment capacity and breadth of product candidates.
In addition to contraception, womens reproductive health encompasses a broad spectrum of categories, including vaginal health, fertility and pain, among others. Dar is committed to identifying, licensing and developing candidates that expand options, improve outcomes, and enhance safety for women across the broad spectrum. We look forward to advancing the Ovaprene development program while evaluating other clinical stage opportunities that meet our objectives.
Forward Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements regarding matters that are not historical facts, including statements relating to Dars expectations regarding the timing and availability of results from its clinical trials, the timing of commencement of manufacturing its products, the safety and effectiveness of its products and the continued ability of Dar to develop and market Ovaprene under its license with ADVA-Tec.

(GlobeNewswire) - Dar Bioscience, Inc. (NASDAQ:DARE) (formerly known as Cerulean Pharma Inc., and formerly traded under NASDAQ:CERU) announced today the outcomes of three important transactions: (i) approval by Cerulean stockholders of the purchase of all of the outstanding common shares and options of Dar Bioscience (which has been renamed Dar Bioscience Operations, Inc. to avoid confusion with the renamed Cerulean), (ii) approval by Cerulean stockholders of the sale of all rights related to the Dynamic Tumor Targeting Platform to Novartis for $6 million in cash, and (iii) approval by Cerulean stockholders and authorization by the Cerulean board of directors of a 10 to 1 reverse stock split. As a result of these transactions, the stockholders of pre-closing Dar have become owners of approximately 51% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company, while the stockholders of pre-closing Cerulean will continue to own approximately 49% of the issued and outstanding shares of the combined company, which represents the maximum ownership possible for the pre-closing Cerulean stockholders under the stock purchase agreement entered into between the companies on March 19, 2017.
Following the closing of the transaction, Sabrina Martucci Johnson, President and CEO of Dar, became the President and CEO of Cerulean and joined its board of directors and Lisa Walters-Hoffert, CFO of Dar, became Ceruleans CFO. The operations of Dar and Cerulean are being combined, with the combined company operating under the name Dar Bioscience, Inc. and led solely by Dars management team.
Dar`s transition to the public market represents a significant milestone for us, stated Sabrina Martucci Johnson, President and CEO of Dar. We are grateful for the support of the Cerulean stockholders. Dar is committed to building a strong company in womens reproductive health, beginning with our first clinical candidate, Ovaprene. We believe Dar represents an attractive business with considerable product candidate opportunities and market potential.
Conference Call and WebcastDar will hold a conference call on Monday, July 24, 2017, at 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time / 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time to provide an overview and business update.Interested parties may access the conference call by dialing (844) 831-3031 from the U.S. and (443) 637-1284 from outside the U.S. and should request the Dar Call, conference ID 58451998. The conference call also will be webcast live over the Internet and can be accessed at http://edge.media-server.com/m/p/mmj5wibt.
About Dar Bioscience, Inc. (formerly Cerulean Pharma Inc.)
Dar is a healthcare company committed to the development and commercialization of innovative products in womens reproductive health. We have identified areas within this market segment that remain underserved and believe they offer opportunities to generate value for both investors and women.
The problem isnt early innovation. The global donor community of foundations and governments has invested tens of millions of dollars in early-stage and clinical-stage research to expand options, improve outcomes and advance global womens reproductive health. In addition, independent private innovators have developed new approaches to address unmet needs. Yet, promising candidates often fail to advance for reasons unrelated to results, but rather because of shifting strategic priorities or a lack of dedicated funding.
The problem isnt commercialization. Large and medium-size pharmaceutical companies with established sales and marketing franchises in womens health exist. However, many of these companies prefer to get involved in later stages of development, e.g., in pivotal trials or following an application for regulatory approval.
The problem is the gap. We believe that this gap between innovation and commercialization in womens reproductive health creates an opportunity for Dar. Our business model is to license the rights to promising product candidates (many with clinical proof-of-concept data), advance their clinical development, and if successful, implement a comprehensive global commercialization strategy in combination with established pharmaceutical partners and regional distributors. We believe this approach is efficient in both its use of time and financial resources.
The contraceptive market in particular represents an interesting segment for Dar. Since the approval of the birth control pill by the FDA in 1960, most contraception innovation has focused on the use of hormones. Little innovation has occurred to create new non-hormonal options, leaving a void in the method mix and creating a potential opportunity. Todays non-hormonal alternatives include condoms, diaphragms, and spermicides, all of which require intervention at the time of intercourse and most of which have marginal efficacy. There is a need for something better.
First product candidate, Ovaprene
Ovaprene is a clinical stage, non-hormonal contraceptive ring intended to provide protection over multiple weeks of use, require no intervention at the time of intercourse, and fill a void in todays contraception method mix.
Research has shown that as many as 40% of women using contraception say they are not satisfied with their current method, reporting difficulty of use, problems with side effects, and concerns about effectiveness and reduced sexual pleasure.
A convenient, easy-to-use and effective non-hormonal option could appeal to a portion of the 22% of women currently using one of todays non-hormonal methods.
Ovaprenewould represent a new category of birth control and expand options.
A contraceptive ring, whose use is initiated and controlled by a woman, has numerous attributes that women find appealing. Published surveys revealed the following:
A vaginal ring has most of the features they deemed extremely important,
85% of women surveyed reported they would prefer a monthly option with a lower hormone dose than the pill, and
80% currently use a non-coital dependent method, meaning there is no intervention at the time of intercourse.
The only contraceptive ring on the market today is NuvaRing, a hormonal contraceptive ring with 2016 sales of $777 million. Our goal for Ovaprene is to provide similar monthly convenience and protection but without the use of hormones.
Ovaprenehas a custom intravaginal ring design, with a permeable mesh in the center of the ring that creates a partial barrier to sperm, and a mechanism to release locally acting spermiostatic agents through the ring. The unique combination of these two complementary approaches seeks to produce attractive contraceptive efficacy outcomes that are consistent with the most effective barrier option, the diaphragm, and short-acting hormonal options (oral pill, patches and vaginal ring) that provide88-91%effectiveness in typical use. Typical use refers to effectiveness experienced among all couples who use the method, including inconsistent and incorrect use.
In a pilot postcoital test (PCT) clinical trial conducted in 21 women and published in the Journal of Reproductive Medicine in 2009, Ovaprenedemonstrated the following:
Ability to immobilize sperm and prevent their progression into the cervical mucus,
Acceptability of the device to both partners, and
No serious adverse events were reported.

PCT clinical trials have been used to assess the preliminary efficacy of other contraception methods that work by preventing or blocking the progression of sperm into the cervical mucus.
Our stockholders can expect the following benefits from the combination of Dar (formerly Cerulean) and Dar Operations:

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
