Disclaimer:

The above company statistics are based on Accutrac Capital's collection of data and is not from any 3rd party credit source or credit companies.  If you feel there is an error in the above data or if you have any questions please feel free to contact Accutrac Capital Solutions at 1-866-531-2615.






Definitions
 

 Credit Limit

The amount of credit that Accutrac provides to this company. This does not mean to suggest that Accutrac would not extend more credit to this company. 
When a suggested credit amount is a low dollar limited the meaning is as follow:  

1 – Poor payment history or credit score 
2 – Need additional credit information to score 
3 – Will not pay a factoring company 
4 – Out of business (per our records)




 Credit Score

Ranking of companies categorizing them from A (best) to F (worst) based on their days to pay.

A – pays within 30 days; 
B – pays between 31 and 45 days; 
C – pays between 46 and 60 days; 
D – pays between 61 and 75 days ; 
E –  pays between 76-80 days ; 
F –  takes over 80 day to pay (if at all).




 Days To Pay

This is the average days to pay for all reporting periods. This means over the total amount of time that Accutrac has been dealing with this company, on average, this is the length of time it takes to pay the invoice. 

This number should be used in conjunction with the payment trend chart.



 Payment Trends

This chart illustrates the average number of days it takes a company to pay.

The first bar indicates the average days to pay for all reporting
    periods. This means over the total amount of time that Accutrac has been
    dealing with this company, on average, this is the length of time it
    took them to pay; 
The second bar indicates the average days to pay over the last 90 days; 
The third bar indicates the average days to pay over the last 60 days.




 Risk Level

The risk level is a proprietary measure of Accutrac's assessment of the risk associated with non-payment. This measure takes into account previous payment history, trade references, banking information and public records. This measure ranks a company from low risk (the best) to high risk (the worst).

It should be noted that the risk measure is a delayed measure and is reviewed less frequently than the payment trend, which would be considered a leading indicator of financial stress.

Watch a video about Inception MiningAbout InceptionInception Mining Inc. (the Company) is engaged in the identification, exploration, acquisition and development of mineral properties. Our initial focus has been directed towards precious metals, after recognizing the state of the industry and the multiple opportunities that have surfaced due to the economic upheaval in the sector. The Company will capitalize on the availability of a surplus of resources in all segments, including geological, mining, equipment, and processing. While others are suffering at current prices with all-in costs close to spot prices, Inception expects to realize significant net profits due to high ore values, coupled with tight cost control measures and availability of mining resources.
