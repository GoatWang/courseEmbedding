Why Diversity Matters

As our nation turns increasingly rich in diversity, so must our workforce. Today's employers are embracing the hiring of candidates that bring to the workforce layers of unique perspective and experiences. Employers are fully aware that differences create pillars of strength in any worthwhile business, and the best employers proactively seek it.
As job seekers, it is important to have a good understanding that you bring qualities and skills that employers are looking for. Veterans and candidates with disabilities add unique context and skill sets to a company's repertoire. Our government also encourages this kind of hiring to diversify the workforce.
We encourage you to explore our Diversity Exchanges and find a wealth of resources to assist with your job search. Best Wishes!



Veterans
Dear Heroes, welcome to our Veterans Exchange. Here you will find many tools specific for your unique background to help with your job search. The skills translator, resume builder and interview tips are some of the resources we provide. We have had many successes in getting veterans employed. We are here for you.
Veterans Exchange »




Disability
Many companies are looking to hire candidates who have some degree of intellectual and/or physical challenges but are able, in every way, to be a productive member of the workplace. In our Disability Exchange, you can browse jobs and benefit from a gallery of tools to customize your job search experience.

AJE’s President, Bill Fanning commented, “This brings a whole new twist to the current ‘generic push,’ of job postings to the same core sites. Diversity Recruitment now becomes audience-focused, not site-focused.”
“Organizations understand that you cannot continue to fish for talent in the same pond and at the same time complain about a lack of talent,” commented Torin Ellis, Principal, the torin ellis brand and leading diversity and inclusion advocate, “You have to reach outside of your traditional areas of recruitment so that you can continue building better teams.”
To achieve the best diversity recruitment results, companies must try different approaches and use new, innovative solutions.  AJE is uniquely positioned to maximize job distribution channels via our AJE Diversity Network to reach candidates with a diversity of skills, experiences, cultures, backgrounds and abilities. With this solution, AJE customers have already experienced almost a 400% aggregate increase in customer views and conversions.
Contact our Diversity Recruitment Team to learn more.
America’s Job Exchange is on a mission to redefine how diversity recruitment and OFCCP compliance programs are delivered. AJE has supported thousands of employers in these two key areas for over the past decade, and prior to this was a government-initiated platform to bring employment opportunities to candidates in need. For the past decade, AJE has been the first choice for employers and job seekers looking for valuable resources and a trusted partner in diversity recruitment solutions.

Compliance 2.0: It’s Time for a Change

Posted on May 30, 2017  by  Tracy Cole | Marketing Manager 


“It’s time for a change,” was the theme of this month’s webinar. Newly appointed President of America’s Job Exchange (AJE), Bill Fanning, was excited to present his very first webinar at the helm of AJE. Bill wasted no time addressing the “elephant in the room” with the majority of our federal contractor customers… today’s compliance is broken. And the only way to affect change is by identifying the frustrations today’s recruiters have with what’s become a “check the box” obligation, and providing them with a solution that redefines their expectations of diversity recruitment and Office of Federal Contractor Compliance Programs (OFCCP) compliance. The time to disrupt is now.
Bill first discussed the current challenges most employers face regarding OFCCP regulations. There are numerous job posting and job distribution sites that make meeting required expectations a “set it and forget it” experience for federal contractors. But while their compliance obligations may be met, diversity candidate flow from these solutions is rarely adequate.  This is because the “generic job push,” a common tool in the recruitment space, doesn’t target diversity candidates where they are online.
Next, Bill explained AJE’s Diversity Recruitment solution, which leverages data to intelligently target the diversity community on the sites they engage with most.  By posting and promoting jobs on relevant sites, then shifting budget based on the most effective efforts, AJE can optimize the return on our customers’ investments.
AJE has developed the AJE Diversity Network as a solution to simplify the process and intelligently engage and deliver the RIGHT candidates…and the early results are jaw dropping.
Is your organization experiencing the same frustrations? Interested in more details? Want to learn about the 3 digit percentage increase our beta customers have had already? If you missed our last webinar, please check out the recording of Compliance 2.0: It’s Time For A Change -Redefining Diversity Recruitment & OFCCP Compliance or call us at 866.926.6284.





When Things Aren’t as They Seem (Non-Obvious Disability and Employment)

Posted on January 24, 2017  by  Tracy Cole | Marketing Manager 


Katie, a potential employee, interviews with your company.  She is well qualified to perform the essential functions of the job for which she has applied.  The new employee is a wheelchair user; therefore, you recognize that some reasonable accommodations should made to ensure equality in the work environment.  You gladly work with the new employee, as you would any employee, because you want her to be successful in her position.  What about employees or potential employees who may have a non-obvious disability?  According to the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, only 26% of people who have a significant disability that limits one or more major life areas use a mobility device, a common indicator of disability.  Use of mobility equipment alone cannot be a predictor of disability.
As Employers, we must be mindful of the employee who may have a non-obvious disability.  According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, one in five people in the United States will experience mental illness.  Depression is the most commonly experienced mental illness and is the leading cause of disability worldwide.  Additionally, 18% of the US population live with anxiety disorders.  Moreover, arthritis continues to be the leading cause of disability in the US.  Nearly 23% of our population cope with arthritis and the serious impact it has on their quality of life.  According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), nearly 66% of working age adults have arthritis and 8 million working age adults report that their ability to work is compromised by arthritis.  The CDC reports nearly half of our population experience chronic illness.  These include cancer, stroke, heart disease, and diabetes.  As the population of the US ages and medical advances allow people with non-obvious disabilities to live longer, the need for workplace accommodations will grow.

Posted on December 22, 2016  by  Tracy Cole | Marketing Manager

How Will a Trump Presidency Impact Pay Equity?

Posted on December 6, 2016  by  America's Job Exchange 


As the dust settles from the 2016 election, predictions abound regarding what a Trump presidency will mean for employers.  Predicting what policy changes an administration will make is difficult after a typical election year . . . and Donald Trump’s successful campaign was anything but typical.  One issue employers may be concerned about is what is going to happen to the new EEO-1 reporting rule that requires employers with 100 or more employees to annually submit detailed pay data and work hours—in addition to race and gender data—for all employees beginning in 2018.
Unfortunately, it’s not clear.  President-elect Trump campaigned on a promise to (among other things) relieve businesses of unduly burdensome regulations enacted during President Obama’s Administration.  Therefore, the EEO-1 pay data reporting requirements may be one of the rules on the chopping block.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
