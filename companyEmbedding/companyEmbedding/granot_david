We hypothesized that the AQPs of the vascular bundle sheath (BS) cells regulate K(leaf). To examine this hypothesis, AQP genes were silenced using artificial microRNAs that were expressed constitutively or specifically targeted to the BS. MicroRNA sequences were designed to target all five AQP genes from the PLASMA MEMBRANE-INTRINSIC PROTEIN1 (PIP1) subfamily. Our results show that the constitutively silenced PIP1 (35S promoter) plants had decreased PIP1 transcript and protein levels and decreased mesophyll and BS osmotic water permeability (P(f)), mesophyll conductance of CO2, photosynthesis, K(leaf), transpiration, and shoot biomass. Plants in which the PIP1 subfamily was silenced only in the BS (SCARECROW:microRNA plants) exhibited decreased mesophyll and BS Pf and decreased K(leaf) but no decreases in the rest of the parameters listed above, with the net result of increased shoot biomass. We excluded the possibility of SCARECROW promoter activity in the mesophyll. Hence, the fact that SCARECROW:microRNA mesophyll exhibited reduced P(f), but not reduced mesophyll conductance of CO2, suggests that the BS-mesophyll hydraulic continuum acts as a feed-forward control signal. The role of AQPs in the hierarchy of the hydraulic signal pathway controlling leaf water status under normal and limited-water conditions is discussed.

Increased guard-cell osmolarity leads to the opening of the stomata and decreased osmolarity causes the stomata to close. The role of sugars in the regulation of stomata is not yet clear. In this study, we examined the role of hexokinase (HXK), a sugar-phosphorylating enzyme involved in sugar-sensing, in guard cells and its effect on stomatal aperture. We show here that increased expression of HXK in guard cells accelerates stomatal closure. We further show that this closure is induced by sugar and is mediated by abscisic acid. These findings support the existence of a feedback-inhibition mechanism that is mediated by a product of photosynthesis, namely sucrose. When the rate of sucrose production exceeds the rate at which sucrose is loaded into the phloem, the surplus sucrose is carried toward the stomata by the transpiration stream and stimulates stomatal closure via HXK, thereby preventing the loss of precious water.

In mitotic S. pombe cells, the nucleolus appears to trail the bulk of the DNA. In wild-type cells of S. cerevisiae, the nucleolus segregates alongside the bulk of the genomic DNA. Based on its distance from the centromere, we would expect the rDNA in both organisms to segregate behind the majority of the genomic DNA, if telomeric regions trail centromeric regions as in other eukaryotes. We therefore suggest that in S. cerevisiae the nucleolus is attached to other parts of the nucleus which enable it to segregate along with the bulk of the DNA. The segregation of the nucleolus in topoisomerase mutants and nuclear division mutants of S. cerevisiae was also investigated. In cdc14 mutants which arrest at late anaphase, the vast majority of the DNA is separated, but the ...

However, our understanding of the mechanism by which the sugar supply is controlled in the stamen is still in its infancy. We previously reported on the stamen-specific expression of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) sugar metabolic gene, fructokinase 4 (SlFRK4). Here, we present the cloning and the characterization of the SlFRK4 promoter and show its differential activation during anther development. We also show that the tissue-specific expression of SlFRK4 promoter is maintained in Arabidopsis thaliana. By histochemical analyses of the GUS reporter gene and DTA toxin driven by the SlFRK4 promoter, we show that the SlFRK4 promoter is gradually activated in pollen grains throughout the later stages of anther development and upon pollen germination. In addition, we analyzed the expression profile of SlFRK4 and other sugar metabolic genes and found that SlFRK4 and the invertase LIN7 are co-expressed in mature and germinated pollen. These findings point to the existence of a specialized mechanism in which carbohydrates are provided to the male gametophyte during the later stages of its development and suggest a valuable tool for manipulating the development of male gametophytes in crop species.

In mitotic S. pombe cells, the nucleolus appears to trail the bulk of the DNA. In wild-type cells of S. cerevisiae, the nucleolus segregates alongside the bulk of the genomic DNA. Based on its distance from the centromere, we would expect the rDNA in both organisms to segregate behind the majority of the genomic DNA, if telomeric regions trail centromeric regions as in other eukaryotes. We therefore suggest that in S. cerevisiae the nucleolus is attached to other parts of the nucleus which enable it to segregate along with the bulk of the DNA. The segregation of the nucleolus in topoisomerase mutants and nuclear division mutants of S. cerevisiae was also investigated. In cdc14 mutants which arrest at late anaphase, the vast majority of the DNA is separated, but the ...

However, our understanding of the mechanism by which the sugar supply is controlled in the stamen is still in its infancy. We previously reported on the stamen-specific expression of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) sugar metabolic gene, fructokinase 4 (SlFRK4). Here, we present the cloning and the characterization of the SlFRK4 promoter and show its differential activation during anther development. We also show that the tissue-specific expression of SlFRK4 promoter is maintained in Arabidopsis thaliana. By histochemical analyses of the GUS reporter gene and DTA toxin driven by the SlFRK4 promoter, we show that the SlFRK4 promoter is gradually activated in pollen grains throughout the later stages of anther development and upon pollen germination. In addition, we analyzed the expression profile of SlFRK4 and other sugar metabolic genes and found that SlFRK4 and the invertase LIN7 are co-expressed in mature and germinated pollen. These findings point to the existence of a specialized mechanism in which carbohydrates are provided to the male gametophyte during the later stages of its development and suggest a valuable tool for manipulating the development of male gametophytes in crop species.

Research Interests / Job description


•	Sugar metabolism and sensing in plants •	The effect of sugars on stomata and plant water management•	The connection between sugar sensing and regulation of stomata, photosynthesis and transpiration. •	Xylem development and water transport









Brief description of research activitiesSugars are the primary products of plants and affect almost every aspect of plant development. The lab is studying how sugars affect plant development and physiology. We focus on the initial central sugar metabolism genes hexokinases (HXKs) and fructokinases (FRKs).We isolated HXK and FRK genes and determined their biochemical characteristics and intracellular localizationThe role of each of the HXK and FRK isozymes is explored by the use of sense and antisense transgenic plants.In contrast to a 100 years old hypothesis that sugars open stomata, we discovered recently that sugars close stomata, and they do it via HXK. Based on this discovery we developed a method (registered as a patent) to create plants that save water.Another major topic in the lab is the connection between sugar metabolism and vascular development. We found that specific FRKs play major roles in xylem and phloem development.More recently, we discovered a new connection between sugar levels and plant water management. Publication listPublications1.        Kassir Y., Granot D. and Simchen G.
