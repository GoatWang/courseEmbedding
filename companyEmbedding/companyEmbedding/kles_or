September 25, 2015  by digitalbuyersguide Leave a Comment Plumber System
The PLUMBER, which is an integrated management system for piping stabilization, is designed to carry out real-time monitoring the 3-D behavior of plant pipes in operation under high temperature and pressure, including the temperature of pipelines and the state of piping support devices by installing it on the parts from a boiler or a turbine. And it is the best solution for plumbing integrity evaluation for generating units and securing the safety, by managing and monitoring the system remotely after constructing the relevant data base including the drawings and history management of plumbing and piping support devices. 
  The Plumber is necessary for several reasons. First, Due to the operating condition of base load unit, which is operated under a severe service condition with high temperature and pressure for a long time, the material degradation, mechanical degradation and deformation may take place at pipelines connecting a turbine of generating unit with a boiler. And the thermal expansion and shrinkage due to frequent vibration and repetition of start and stop may cause interference on piping and stress concentration, which may lead to turbine vibration or damage to the joint of super heater. Second, the hangers installed at power plants enables to measure only one dimensional (Y-axis direction) displacement. Currently, piping management at each power plant is limited to recording related to hanger guidelines before and after O/H, so that the 3-D displacement occurring at pipelines during operation may not be detected, which leads to impracticability of preparing basic preventive measures and depending of short-term maintenance. Third, even though large amount of piping support devices, such as hangers and snubbers, are installed at each power plant in order to support the self-load and thermal expansion load in operation, proper management is not carried out due to absence of recognition and lack of management for piping support devices. Also, most of pipelines are installed in geometric 3-D structure. In case pipelines fail to expand according to the design, or they are expanded excessively due to false operation of piping support devices, interference of structures or design fault of plumbing, huge economic damage may take place due to shut down and accidental maintenance caused by unexpected damage to pipelines including cracks and ruptures.

HTML title tags appear in browser tabs, bookmarks and in search results. It looks like your title tag is a little outside the ideal length. Since they are one of the most important on-page SEO elements you should make your title tags between 50 and 60 characters. Make sure each page has a unique title and use your most important keywords. For internal pages start your title tags with your most important keyword(s).

Check the title of your website

?

The meta description for kles.kr is missing.Meta descriptions allow you to influence how your web pages are described and displayed in search results. A good description acts as a potential organic advertisement and encourages the viewer to click through to your site.Keep it short and to the point; the ideal meta description should be between 70 and 160 characters (spaces included).Ensure that each of your web pages have a unique meta description that is explicit and contains your most important keywords for each page. These keywords are especially important because they appear in bold when they match the user’s search query (See the Google Preview below).Check your Google Search Console (Search Appearance > HTML Improvements) for any warning messages to identify meta descriptions that are too long/short or duplicated across more than one page.

Great, your website is structured using HTML headings (<H1> to <H6>).Use your keywords in the headings and make sure the first level (<H1>) includes your most important keywords. Never duplicate your title tag content in your header tag.While it is important to ensure every page has an <H1> tag, only include more than one per page if you're using HTML5. Instead, use multiple <H2> - <H6> tags.

Add the important keywords in <H> headings

Alternative text allows you to add a description to an image. Since search engine crawlers cannot see images, they rely on alternative text attributes to determine relevance to a search query. Alternative text also helps makes an image more likely to appear in a Google image search and is used by screen readers to provide context for visually impaired users.It looks like you're missing alt text for several images on your page. Check the images on your website to make sure accurate and relevant alternative text is specified for each image on the page.Try to minimize the number of alt text characters to 150 or less (including spaces!) to optimize page load times.

Links pass value from one page to another. This value is called 'link juice'.A page's link juice is split between all the links on that page so lots of unnecessary links on a page will dilute the value attributed to each link. There's no exact number of links to include on a page but best practice is to keep it under 200.Using the Nofollow attribute in your links prevents some link juice, but these links are still taken into account when calculating the value that is passed through each link, so using lots of NoFollow links can still dilute PageRank.

Missing



?

We checked kles.kr but couldn't find an XML sitemap.XML sitemaps contain the list of your URLs that are available to index and allows the search engines to read your pages more intelligently. They can also include information like your site’s latest updates, frequency of changes and the importance of URLs.Your site is currently missing an XML sitemap. We recommend you generate one for your site and submit it through both Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Normally, your XML sitemap would be found at kles.kr/sitemap.Make sure to only include the pages you want search engines to crawl, so leave out any that have been blocked in a robots.txt file. Avoid using any URLs that cause redirects or error codes and be consistent in using your preferred URLs (with or without www.), correct protocols (http vs. https) and trailing slashes. You should also use your robots.txt file to point search engine crawlers to the location of your sitemap.

                                    URL parameters are used to track user behaviors on site (session IDs), traffic sources (referrer IDs) or to give users control over the content on the page (sorting and filtering). The issue with URL parameters is that Google sees each unique parameter value as a new URL hosting the same thing - meaning you could have a duplicate content problem. Sometimes, it’s able to recognize these URLs and group them together. It then algorithmically decides which URL is the best representation of the group and uses it to consolidate ranking signals and display in search results. You can help Google recognize the best URL by using the rel=”canonical” tag.Use the URL Parameters Tool in Google Search Console to tell Google how your URL parameters affect page content and how to to crawl URLs with parameters. Use this tool very carefully - you can easily prevent Google from crawling pages you want indexed through overly restrictive crawling settings, especially if you have URLs with multiple parameters.

?

Great, you aren't using ‪underscores (these_are_underscores) in your URLs. Google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores aren't recognized. So the search engine sees www.example.com/green_dress as www.example.com/greendress. The bots will have a hard time determining this URL's relevance to a keyword.

Maximize your SEO efforts by avoiding Flash.Search engines also have problems with frames because they can't crawl or index the content within them. Avoid them if you can and use a NoFrames tag when you can't.

Keep your URLs short and clean and avoid long domain names when possible.A descriptive URL is better recognized by search engines. A user should be able to look at the address bar and make an accurate guess about the content of the page before reaching it (e.g., http://www.mysite.com/en/products).Keep in mind that URLs are also an important part of a comprehensive SEO strategy. Use clean URLs to make your site more "crawlable" by Google™.Resource: Search for a good domain name. If no good names are available, consider a second hand domain. To prevent brand theft, you might consider trademarking your domain name.

404 error pages are displayed when the page you are trying to open can't be found on the site's server for a variety of reasons.It looks like kles.kr doesn't have a 404 error page. This damages your site's usability. Generic 404 error pages strand users on a page with no links or suggestions of what to do next.Use a custom 404 page to reduce customer frustration and link to other pages on your site. Make sure it returns the 404 http status code.

                                    Using an SSL certificate creates an encrypted connection between your visitor's browser and your website's server adding an extra layer of security. In 2014, Google announced that HTTPS would become part of their ranking algorithm and since your website is not HTTPS, it will likely rank below your HTTPS competitors. When moving to HTTPS, follow these best practices for a smooth transition:Use a serious issuer to purchase your SSL certificateRedirect all of your HTTP pages to the HTTPS version of your websiteUse HTTP Strict Transport Security in your headersRenew your SSL certificate every year, before it expiresMake sure that all of your content (CSS, etc.) is linked to HTTPSUpdate your XML sitemap to ensure the URLs include HTTPS and update the robots.txt file to reference this versionRegister the HTTPS website in Google & Bing Search Console/Webmaster Tools

End User License Agreement

Intel Security License AgreementThank you for using Intel Security software (“Software”) and services (each such service is a “Service”) provided by the applicable entity identified in Section 19 (“Intel Security”, “we” or “us”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel Corporation.  This is a legal agreement between you and us—installing or accessing our Software, or using a Service, means you are agreeing to these terms, so please read them carefully.
This Intel Security License Agreement (“Agreement”) sets forth the terms and conditions that govern your rights to use the Software and Services, including restrictions on that use, our right to automatically renew and charge you for paid versions or features of the Software or Service, and your agreement to arbitrate any dispute that may arise between you and us.  Software includes free versions of the Software, including (i) any features included in a paid subscription for which we no longer charge or which we offer to you at no charge in our sole discretion, and (ii) any feature that we give you on a trial, courtesy or evaluation basis or that is labeled as “Pre-Release,” “Limited Release,” “Beta” or otherwise described as experimental, untested, or not fully  functional (each “Free Software”); and Services include any services that we provide without charge to you as a courtesy and in our sole discretion, which may be labeled similar to Free Software and may be experimental, untested or not fully functional (each a “Courtesy Service”). We have included links to additional terms, such as our Privacy Notice, which are important and together create this legal agreement that applies to you.  Country-specific terms are located in the Sections 4, 9, 19 and 21 of the Agreement.
If you are under the age of 18, you are not permitted to use the Software or Service, or provide your personal information to us without the consent of your parent or guardian who must first accept this Agreement and administer the Software on your behalf.  If you have accepted multiple versions of the Intel Security License Agreement, the most recent version that you have accepted is the Agreement between us and supersedes and replaces all prior versions.
Accepting this Agreement and Modifications – By clicking an acceptance button and/or installing or accessing the Software and/or Service, you agree unconditionally to be bound by the Agreement and acknowledge that it is enforceable as a written contract signed by you.  If you do not unconditionally agree to all of these terms, do not install, use or access the Software or Service.  To the extent any translated version of this Agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. 
					
					WE MAY MODIFY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION AND DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION BELOW, FROM TIME TO TIME. 
					
					For example, we may need to modify the Agreement to reflect changes in the law or to the Software.  It is very important that you keep your account information current, including your email address and other contact information.  If we make material changes to this Agreement, we will update the Intel Security License Agreement posted on our website, and at the time of renewal communicate the updated Agreement to you via the contact information you provided (or through other means, for example by providing a current link to the effective Agreement) so that you have an opportunity to review the updated Agreement and to accept or reject the updated Agreement as set out below.  
For paid subscriptions, you accept change(s) to this Agreement by renewing the subscription, and the updated Agreement with the change(s) will be effective upon such renewal of your subscription.  If you do not agree to the Agreement as amended, then you must reject the changes by turning off auto renewal and uninstalling the Software and ceasing all use of any Service at the end of the subscription term. 
For Free Software and Courtesy Services you accept change(s) to this Agreement by continuing to use the Free Software or Courtesy Service after the notice described in this section.  If you reject the updated Agreement, your license to the Free Software or Courtesy Service is terminated and you must cease all access to and use of the Courtesy Service or Free Software and uninstall the Free Software.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any changes to the Privacy Notice will be made in accordance with the process specified in the Privacy Notice.
License to Use – We are pleased to grant you a nonexclusive limited license: (i) to install and use any Software for which you have purchased a subscription for personal use only for the number of devices and users specified in your License Entitlement, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to the System Requirements; and (ii) to use any Service for which you have purchased a subscription, for personal use only, as permitted under your Service Entitlement, in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and subject to the System Requirements.  This license (“License”) is nontransferable and is revocable by us as provided in this Agreement.  This License terminates as set forth in Section 3.  You must immediately cease all use of Software and Services upon such termination.
“License Entitlement” means the number and type of devices and users that are permitted to use the Software, as specified on transaction documents associated with your purchased subscription, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the purchase, the package if purchased at a retail store, or another transactional document made available to you.  If no licensed device count and/or user count is specified on any of the foregoing, the License Entitlement is one device and one user.
“Service Entitlement” means the scope and duration of the services that you have purchased, as specified on transaction documents associated with your purchased subscription, which (depending upon the channel from which you purchased the license) may include: the checkout payment page, a product description page on our website, the email confirmation that we send for the purchase, the package if purchased at a retail store, or another transactional document made available to you.  If no scope or duration is specified on any of the foregoing, the Service Entitlement is to one device, for one user, for one year.
“System Requirements” means the requirements set forth on our website.  Your use of the Software and Services is limited to devices and operating systems we support, as specified in the System Requirements, and may be affected by the performance and compatibility of your hardware, software and Internet access.  Meeting system requirements is your responsibility and you are responsible for the cost of your equipment, which may include obtaining updates or upgrades from time to time in order to continue using the Software.
We, along with our suppliers and partners, retain ownership of our respective Software and Services and all rights related to the Software and Services, including all intellectual property rights.  The only rights we grant you are those rights expressly stated in this Agreement.  Also, if you provide us any comments, information, opinions, or suggestions on the Software or Services, which we consider “Feedback,” you agree to allow us to use your Feedback without restriction, for any purpose and without compensation to you. 
Term of License  – For paid subscriptions, the License is effective for the subscription term you purchased and each subsequent term that you renew, unless terminated earlier or later as permitted below; and if no term was specified, the default term is one year from the date you first acquired the subscription.  Your renewal (or continued use after the subscription term) constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to the Agreement then in effect at such renewal or continued use period.  For Free Software and Courtesy Services, the License is effective for as long as the Free Software is installed or we otherwise make the Free Software or Courtesy Services available to you and will remain subject to any limitations in the License Entitlement or Service Entitlement, as applicable.  We may choose to provide you Free Software or a Courtesy Service prior to, during, or after your paid subscription and any use is subject to the terms of the Agreement then in effect for as long as the Free Software is installed or the Free Software or Courtesy Services are used.  We may terminate the License and/or the Agreement then in effect at our option if you fail to comply with or violate these terms and conditions.  You may also terminate the License prior to the expiration of the term by permanently erasing the Software from your devices and canceling your account with us.  If the License is terminated, you must stop using the Software and, if you have not done so, you must permanently erase all copies of the Software.  Unless terminated in accordance with this provision, the Agreement shall remain in effect for so long as you use or retain possession or control of any Software or Service.
If the License and/or Agreement terminates for any reason or expires, you will no longer be authorized to use or access the Software or Services, including any online storage or backup services, and we may cancel and/or close your account at our sole discretion.  After the termination or expiration date, we will follow our standard policies to delete any of your online stored or backed-up information, text, files, links, images or other materials provided to us (“Content”).  It is your responsibility to store or backup your Content elsewhere before the License and/or this Agreement expires or is terminated.  We are not responsible for giving you a copy of your Content.  Use of Software and Services, at all times, is governed by the terms of the Agreement then in effect.

PAYMENT, AUTOMATIC RENEWAL, CANCELLATION AND REFUND – Payment: 
				
				YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY CHARGE THE CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ACCOUNT OR OTHER PAYMENT DEVICE YOU PROVIDED FOR ALL AMOUNTS YOU OWE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY RENEWALS.  YOU AGREE TO NOTIFY US PROMPTLY OF ANY CHANGE IN YOUR CARD ACCOUNT NUMBER OR EXPIRATION DATE OR OTHER PAYMENT INFORMATION.  FOR CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT WE MAY ALSO UPDATE SUCH INFORMATION WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF YOUR CARD ISSUER AND THE RELEVANT CARD NETWORK AND WE MAY USE THE UPDATED CARD INFORMATION TO CHARGE AMOUNTS YOU OWE US.  UNLESS YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, THIS WILL SERVE AS YOUR CONSENT FOR YOUR CARD OR PAYMENT DEVICE TO BE CHARGED. 
You are responsible for any charges incurred with your data- or mobile-service provider in connection with your use of the Software, including any overage and penalties assessed for exceeding your data or minute allowance, or use of domestic or international short message service.
Automatic Renewal:  YOU AGREE TO ALLOW US TO AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR PAID SUBSCRIPTION.  BEFORE YOUR TERM EXPIRES, WE WILL SEND A NOTICE TO THE E-MAIL ADDRESS IDENTIFIED IN YOUR ACCOUNT PROFILE, INFORMING YOU OF THE UPCOMING RENEWAL.  YOU WILL BE CHARGED THE UNDISCOUNTED SUBSCRIPTION PRICE FOR THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE AS LISTED ON OUR WEBSITE AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL, EXCLUDING ANY PROMOTIONAL OR DISCOUNT PRICING (“UNDISCOUNTED SUBSCRIPTION PRICE”).  SUCH UNDISCOUNTED PRICING MAY BE FOUND ON OUR WEBSITE.  THIS PRICE MAY CHANGE DURING A SUBSCRIPTION TERM, AND MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE PRICE PAID FOR AN INITIAL SUBSCRIPTION OR MANUAL RENEWAL AND HIGHER THAN PROMOTIONAL OR DISCOUNTED PRICES THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE AS OF THE DATE OF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL.  WE WILL SEND YOU VIA EMAIL A RECEIPT CONFIRMING THE RENEWAL DATE, PRICE, TERM AND ANY APPLICABLE TAXES.  IF, AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL, THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE HAS BEEN RENAMED, UPGRADED OR REPLACED BY A NEW OFFERING WITH REASONABLY COMPARABLE FEATURES (“REPLACEMENT”), WE MAY, AT OUR DISCRETION, AUTOMATICALLY RENEW YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WITH THE REPLACEMENT FOR NO MORE THAN THE UNDISCOUNTED SUBSCRIPTION PRICE OF THE REPLACEMENT.
UPON RENEWAL, THE NEW TERM WILL BE THE SAME LENGTH AS THE EXPIRED TERM UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED BY US AT THE TIME OF RENEWAL.  FOR SUBSCRIPTIONS OF ONE YEAR OR MORE, THE RENEWAL AND YOUR PAYMENT WILL BE PROCESSED WITHIN 30 DAYS OF THE CURRENT TERM EXPIRATION DATE AND EACH ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER.  WE WILL INFORM YOU OF YOUR ACCOUNT STATUS AND COMMUNICATE TO YOU THE AGREEMENT THEN IN EFFECT (FOR EXAMPLE BY PROVIDING A LINK TO THE AGREEMENT).
ANY TIME AFTER PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION, YOU MAY TURN OFF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL BY ACCESSING YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNT PAGE OR CONTACTING CUSTOMER SERVICE.  IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE AUTOMATICALLY RENEWED, YOU MUST TURN OFF AUTO-RENEWAL AT LEAST THIRTY DAYS BEFORE YOUR SUBSCRIPTION EXPIRES.  IF YOU DO NOT TURN OFF AUTO-RENEWAL, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL CONTINUE FOR THE RENEWAL TERM UNDER THE AGREEMENT IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF EACH RENEWAL UNLESS IT IS CANCELED BY YOU (OR TERMINATED BY US PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT).
TURNING OFF AUTOMATIC RENEWAL WILL DISCONTINUE ANY PREMIUM FEATURES AND/OR SERVICES THAT WE OFFER EXCLUSIVELY TO SUBSCRIPTION CUSTOMERS WHO HAVE SIGNED UP FOR AUTOMATIC RENEWAL AND HAVE PROVIDED A VALID CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD ACCOUNT OR OTHER PAYMENT DEVICE.
Cancellation:
If you have a monthly subscription, cancelling will not result in a retroactive refund of subscription payments, and previously charged subscription fees will not be pro-rated based on cancellation date.  Cancelling a monthly subscription will stop the recurring fee going forward, and you will have access to your subscription until the end of the month in which you notified us of your cancellation.
Refund:
We offer a money-back guarantee on most Software and Services if you are not satisfied with your product for any reason.  However, eligibility for a refund depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the type of product, subscription term, duration since purchase, and where it was purchased.  Shipping, handling, and any applicable tax are not refundable except in certain states and countries where these items are refundable.  If you receive a refund for your purchase, you are obligated to uninstall the software.  In addition the Software might, at our sole discretion, be disabled to prevent further use.
If you purchased an annual subscription to Software or a Service you must request a refund within 30 days of the subscription purchase.  We do not provide partial refunds.  The 30-day money back guarantee is not available for monthly subscribers.
If your annual subscription has been automatically renewed, we will provide you a full refund if your request is made within 60 days of being charged.
Any refund offered specifically in connection with a virus removal service does not apply in the event we successfully remove the malware or virus but the data that was deleted, encrypted or modified by such malware or virus could not be restored. Please refer to Section 11: Attacks on Data.
Please see our refund policy available on our website for additional information and instructions to obtain a refund.

Not all subscriptions qualify for technical support.  Consult your License Entitlement, Service Entitlement or Terms of Service for information regarding technical support and additional options.  Our standard-support offerings, policies, and procedures may change from time to time at our sole discretion and may vary by country.  Any obligation we may have to support the previous version of the Software ends when an upgrade, modified or later version, or other update to the Software (“Update”) becomes available.  For your convenience and to ensure that the Software on your devices includes new features that we develop, by agreeing to this Agreement you give us permission to install Updates and (at your request or with your consent) new Software on your devices automatically when available, to the extent that it is possible for us to run such background installations.

Any Updates or end-user technical support provided for Free Software that may be provided are provided at our sole discretion and may be discontinued at any time.
From time to time, at our sole discretion, we may elect to discontinue certain Software or particular features of the Software.  “End of Support” refers to the date when we no longer provide automatic fixes, updates or technical assistance for particular Software.

WebAdvisor:  McAfee WebAdvisor is a software program (with a corresponding website) that provides users with information to guide users about certain risks that may be associated with a website.

The ratings are primarily derived using automated methods; the software cannot detect or examine every possible aspect of website design, nor can it determine the intent of the site owner.  We do not control or assume responsibility for the content of the third-party sites, and some of the third-party sites may have content that you find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive.

Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver 
For all non-European Union customers—
Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes:  Any claim, dispute or controversy of any kind, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory or remedy (“Claim”) by either you or us against the other arising from, relating to or in any way concerning the Agreement, the Software, or any equipment, products, or services you receive from us (or from any advertising for any such products or services) shall, at the demand of either party, be resolved by confidential binding arbitration.  
				
				This agreement to arbitrate also includes: (i)  claims relating to the enforceability or interpretation of any of these arbitration provisions; (ii)  Claims by you, and also Claims made on your behalf or connected with you, such as an employee, representative, agent, predecessor, successor, heir, assignee, or trustee in bankruptcy; (iii)  Claims that relate directly to us, and/or to our parent, affiliates, successors, assignees, employees, and agents; and (iv)  Claims asserted as part of a class action, private attorney general or other representative action, it being expressly understood and agreed to that the arbitration of such claims must proceed on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis and the arbitrator may award relief only on an individual (non-class and non-representative) basis.
				YOU AND WE AGREE THAT NO CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE CLAIMS MAY BE PURSUED IN ARBITRATION, NOR MAY SUCH ACTIONS BE PURSUED IN COURT.  BY ACCEPTING THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO INITIATE OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED ARBITRATION IN ANY MATTER ENCOMPASSED BY THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION.


Notice of Dispute:  The party seeking arbitration must first notify the other party of the dispute in writing at least 60 days in advance of initiating arbitration.  Notice should be sent to Intel Security, 5000 Headquarters Drive, Plano, TX 75024, Attention: Legal Department.  The notice must include your name, address, and contact information, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested.  You and we will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within 60 days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent.  After 60 days, you or we may commence arbitration.
Administration of Arbitration: If any dispute is not resolved by informal negotiation, any claim, dispute, or controversy will be, at the demand of either party, conducted exclusively by binding arbitration governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not state law.  
				
				YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO LITIGATE (OR PARTICIPATE IN AS A PARTY OR CLASS MEMBER) ALL DISPUTES IN COURT BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
				
				 Instead, all disputes will be resolved on an individual basis before a single, neutral arbitrator and the proceeding shall be confidential.  The arbitrator will be either a lawyer admitted to practice law in his or her jurisdiction and with at least ten years’ experience or a retired or former judge selected in accordance with the rules of the AAA.  The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and the arbitration shall be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes of the AAA, as modified by this Agreement (the “Arbitration Rules”).  For more information, see adr.org or call 1-800-778-7879.
				  
				  
Except with respect to any claims or counterclaims seeking less than $25,000, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned, written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.  All arbitration proceedings shall be conducted in English, and the United States FAA shall govern the interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the binding arbitration clause in this Agreement.  The award shall be confidential and only disclosed as is necessary to obtain judgment or as otherwise required by law.  You and we further agree that a judgment may be entered upon the award by any court having jurisdiction.  The arbitration award shall determine the rights and obligations between the named parties only, and only in respect to the claims in arbitration, and shall not have any bearing on the rights and obligations of any other dispute.

Costs:  The party initiating the arbitration shall pay the initial filing fee.  If you file the arbitration and an award is rendered in your favor, we will reimburse your filing fee.  We will pay the fees and costs for the first day of any hearing.  All other fees and costs will be allocated in accordance with the arbitration rules.  However, we will advance or reimburse filing and other fees if the arbitrator rules that you cannot afford to pay them or if you ask us and we determine there is a good reason for doing so.  Each party shall bear the expense of their respective attorneys, experts, and witnesses and other expenses, regardless of who prevails, but a party may recover any or all expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.
Right to Resort to Provisional Remedies Preserved:  Nothing herein shall be deemed to limit or constrain our right to resort to self-help remedies or to comply with legal process, or to obtain provisional remedies such as injunctive relief, attachment, or garnishment by a court having appropriate jurisdiction; provided, however, that you or we may elect to arbitrate any dispute related to such provisional remedies.
Conflicting Terms: In the event of a conflict between the Arbitration Rules and this arbitration agreement, this arbitration agreement shall govern.  If any portion of this arbitration agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it shall not invalidate the other provisions of the arbitration agreement; provided, however, that (a) if the prohibition on classwide arbitration is deemed invalid, then this entire arbitration agreement shall be null and void; and (b) if the prohibition on arbitration of representative claims brought in a private attorney general capacity is deemed invalid, then the arbitration agreement shall be null and void as to such claims only.  This arbitration agreement shall survive the termination or cancellation of this Agreement.  In the event of a conflict between this arbitration agreement and any other applicable arbitration provision, this arbitration agreement shall control.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL: IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN THROUGH ARBITRATION, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE A JURY TRIAL.  YOU AND WE UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY DISPUTE THAT IN ANY WAY RELATES TO OR ARISES OUT OF THE AGREEMENT OR FROM ANY EQUIPMENT, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES YOU RECEIVE FROM US (OR FROM ANY ADVERTISING FOR ANY SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES).  IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE FILED TO SHOW A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.
For European Union customers – Online Dispute Resolution Service (ODR) & Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR):
We are required by law to provide a link from our website to the EU ODR Platform  https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/index_en.htm.

Law Covering This Agreement  – Except as provided in Section 21 below, this Agreement, the use of the Software, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.  If for any reason, the laws of the State of New York are found not to apply, then, except as provided in Section 21 below, this Agreement, the use of the Software, the relationship of the parties, and any disputes arising out of, concerning, or relating to the Agreement, including any disputes between you and us, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, excluding its conflict of law principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act do not apply to the Software.
Attacks on Data  – You acknowledge that some security breaches involve attacks on data.  For example, there are viruses and other malware that: (i) delete or destroy your data (sometimes individual files, but sometimes even an entire disk by corrupting a master boot record or other key element); (ii) modify your files (such as parasitic malware that attaches itself to a file and modifies the file to enable its own execution and/or propagation); and (iii) encrypt files on your drive (such as ransomware that uses asymmetric encryption).  The best way for you to protect yourself from these types of attacks is frequent back-ups of your data to another device/location.  That way, you have another copy of the data that the attacking software has deleted, modified, or destroyed.  While we will use commercially reasonable efforts to remove the attacking malware or virus, it is your sole and exclusive responsibility to back-up all data and files on your device so that they can be restored in the event of an attack on your data.  Without such a back-up, it may not be possible to restore the deleted/destroyed/modified data.  We will have no liability for loss of or recovery of data, or files or loss of use of systems or networks arising from attacks on data.
Limited Warranties; Disclaimer of Other Warranties – For 30 days after the purchase date, for paid versions of the Software only, we warrant that the Software licensed under this Agreement (including updates provided during the warranty period but only until the warranty lapses) will perform substantially in accordance with the documentation provided by us in connection with that Software at the time of purchase, and that any tangible medium (such as a CD-ROM, but excluding devices manufactured by other companies) on which the Software is contained and provided to you will be free from defects in materials and workmanship.  We do not warrant or guarantee that any particular mobile device or computer will be compatible with or function with the Software or Service, nor do we warrant or accept any liability for the operation of your personal equipment that is used to access the Software or Service.  Your sole remedy, and our and our suppliers’ entire liability, in case of any breach of this limited warranty is that we will, at our option, refund the price you paid for the license, replace the defective medium that contains the Software, re-perform the Service, or provide an alternative remedy as required by local consumer law in your jurisdiction.  These remedies may not be available in some countries to the extent that we are subject to restrictions under applicable export-control laws and regulations.  If the tangible medium is defective, you must return it at your expense to the place where you bought it and provide a copy of your receipt.  Any replacement medium will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period.  
				
				THE ABOVE WARRANTIES ARE YOUR EXCLUSIVE WARRANTIES.  THEY REPLACE ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS, TERMS OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, PERFORMANCE, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Limitation of Liability – UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES ARE WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS, LICENSORS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS LIABLE TO YOU FOR ANY: (A) INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (B) THEFT OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OR COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, AND (C) DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF PERSONNEL SALARIES, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR NEGLIGENCE OF ANY KIND, OR FOR ANY OTHER NONDIRECT DAMAGE OR LOSS.  IN NO EVENT WILL OUR, OUR AFFILIATES’ OR OUR SUPPLIERS’, LICENSORS’ OR OTHER THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR DIRECT DAMAGES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE PRICE YOU PAID FOR THE APPLICABLE SOFTWARE, OR US$ 100 (OR THE EQUIVALENT AMOUNT IN NATIONAL CURRENCY) IF YOU USED FREE SOFTWARE.

If an Open Source Software license requires us to distribute any source code related to the Software or Service or any modifications to the Software or Service, we will make the source code available on request. 
No Waiver – We do not waive any provision of this Agreement unless we waive it in a signed writing.

About the Virus
Back to Overview


 
 



 
 

What is Klez?
The Klez virus is a worm that can spoof the "From" field in an e-mail (often set to an address found on the victim's machine). The worm attempts to unload several processes (anti-virus programs) from memory. The worm spreads by copying itself to network shares, if sufficient permissions exist.
The worm mails itself to e-mail addresses in the Windows Address Book, and to addresses extracted from files on the victim's machine. It arrives in an e-mail message whose subject and body is composed from a pool of strings carried within the virus (the virus can also add other strings obtained from the local machine).
