                Harvey S. Katz, Mario Ferro, and Robert Harrington | 07/28/2017

The U.S. equity markets opened lower on Friday as traders weighed a disappointing earnings update in the tech sector with an encouraging advance in the initial second-quarter GDP reading. With roughly even market breadth as a backdrop, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ extended their Thursday losses early in the day. Though the afternoon saw each pare their respective losses intermittently, with a final-hour push from the bulls, the rallies lacked the staying power to instill a change in direction at the end of the day.

Investment Objective and Strategy


The Fund seeks to achieve capital preservation while producing positive returns with low volatility regardless of broad equity and debt market directions.
The Adviser seeks to achieve the Fund’s investment objective by investing the Fund’s assets in multiple exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and open-end mutual funds (collectively, the “underlying funds”) that pursue a number of traditional and non-traditional or “alternative” investment strategies. As such, the Fund is a “fund of funds.” The underlying funds also have the ability to pursue their own sector exposures and may invest in a broad range of securities, commodities and other financial instruments. The Fund’s multiple strategies and sectors approach seeks to provide greater overall returns with similar volatility when compared to the HFRX Global Hedge Fund Index (“HFRX”).






	Learn more about the Value Line Defensive Strategies Fund, a fund-of-funds alternative solution that seeks to achieve positive absolute returns regardless of the market's direction.

 Our History 


 


*The Adviser, the Manager and EULAV Securities LLC, the Fund’s principal underwriter (the “Distributor”), have agreed to waive a portion of their management, advisory and, in the case of the Investor Class, Rule 12b-1 fees, and the Manager has further agreed to reimburse certain expenses of the Fund, to the extent necessary to limit the total annual operating expenses of each class (other than those attributable to Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, interest, taxes, brokerage commissions, and extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Fund’s business) to a specified percentage of such class’s average daily net assets (the “Expense Limitation”). Pursuant to the Expense Limitation, the total annual operating expenses (subject to the specified exclusions) will be limited to the annualized rate of 1.45% and 1.20% of the average daily net assets attributable to Investor Class shares and Institutional Class shares, respectively. The Adviser, the Manager and the Distributor may subsequently recover the reimbursed expenses and/or waived fees from a particular class (within three years after the fiscal year end in which the waiver/reimbursement occurred) to the extent that such class’s expense ratio is less than the Expense Limitation. The Expense Limitation can be terminated or modified before June 30, 2017 only with the agreement of the Board of Trustees of the Value Line Funds Investment Trust (the “Trust”). The Fund's performance would be lower in the absence of such waivers.
†Morningstar™ Categories based on Institutional class shares.

The performance data quoted herein represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Market volatility can dramatically impact the fund's short term performance. Current performance may be lower or higher than figures shown. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. Past performance data through the most recent month end is available at vlfunds.com or by calling 1-800-243-2729.

You should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of Value Line Funds before investing. This and other information can be found in the fund's prospectus and summary prospectus, which can be obtained free of charge from your investment representative, by calling 800.243.2729, or by clicking on the applicable fund at www.vlfunds.com. Please read it carefully before you invest or send money. The inception dates of Value Line Mutual Funds range from 1950 to 2016. Value Line Funds are distributed by EULAV Securities LLC. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Portfolio holdings are subject to change and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell securities. Current and future portfolio holdings are subject to risk.

The average annual returns shown above are historical and reflect changes in share price, reinvested dividends and are net of expenses. Investment results and the principal value of an investment will vary.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three- year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

	Value Line Funds Approach

	We recognize that great mutual funds are the ones that have the ability to outperform, whether in bull or bear markets. To give our investment professionals the information edge they need, the Funds’ investment manager — EULAV Asset Management — supports its portfolio managers with advanced analytics that include FactSet, Bloomberg and Thomson One as well as the venerable Value Line research and Ranking Systems.

	Proprietary Value Line research includes the predictive Ranking Systems for both Timeliness™ and Safety™. The Timeliness ranking system represents an “at-a-glance” forecast of the near-term (6-12 months) relative price movements for a far-reaching universe of U.S. stocks. These stocks are rated on a scale of 1(highest) to 5 (lowest).

	Timeliness rankings are further refined by the dependable Safety and Technical rankings, which are designed to measure volatility and short-term statistical signals, respectively.

	Along with our deep affinity for sophisticated analytics, we recognize that ours is a craft practiced by expertly trained professionals. Each of our Funds follows a disciplined investment process, while allowing our veteran portfolio managers to exercise their keen judgment within the scope of the investment objectives.

	To gain a better understanding of the methodology behind the proprietary Value Line Ranking Systems, explore the sections below.

	Value Line Timeliness Ranks

	The Value Line Timeliness rank measures probable relative price performance of approximately 1,700 stocks during the next six to 12 months on an easy-to-understand scale from 1 (Highest) to 5 (Lowest). The components of the Timeliness Ranking System are the 10-year trend of relative earnings and prices, recent earnings and price changes, and earnings surprises. All data are actual and known. A computer program combines these elements into a forecast of the price change of each stock, relative to all of the approximately 1,700 stocks for the six to 12 months ahead.


Rank
Quality
Stock qualities, as a group


1
Highest
Expected to be the best performers relative to the Value Line universe during the next six to 12 months (100 stocks)


2
Above Average
Expected to have better-than-average relative price performance (300 stocks)


3
Average
Expected to have relative price performance in line with the Value Line universe (approximately 900 stocks)


4
Below Average
Expected to have below-average relative price performance (approximately 300 stocks)


5
Lowest
Expected to have the poorest relative price performance (100 stocks)



	Changes in the Timeliness ranks can be caused by, but are not limited to:


		New earnings reports

		Changes in the price movement of one stock relative to the approximately 1,700 other stocks in the publication

		Shifts in the relative positions of other stocks


	Value Line Safety Ranks

	A second investment criterion is the safety rank assigned by Value Line to each of the approximately 1,700 stocks. This rank measures the total risk of a stock relative to the approximately 1,700 other stocks. It is derived from a stock's Price Stability rank and from the Financial Strength rating of a company. Safety ranks are also given on a scale from 1 (Safest) to 5 (Riskiest) as follows:




					Rank

					Quality

					Stock qualities, as a group



					1

Highest

					the safest, most stable, and least risky investments relative to the Value Line universe, which accounts for about 95% of the market capitalization of all stocks in the U.S.



					2

Above Average

					Are safer and less risky than most



					3

Average

					Are of average risk and safety



					4

Below Average

					Are riskier and less safe than most

					Are the riskiest and least safe




	Stocks with high Safety ranks are often associated with large, financially sound companies; these same companies also often have somewhat less-than-average growth prospects because their primary markets tend to be growing slowly or not at all. Stocks with low Safety ranks are often associated with companies that are smaller and/or have weaker-than-average finances; on the other hand, these smaller companies sometimes have above-average growth prospects because they start with a lower revenue and earnings base.

	Value Line's Safety Rank Record

	Safety becomes particularly important in periods of stock market downswings, when many investors want to try to limit their losses. We believe that if you think the market is headed lower, but prefer to maintain a fully invested position in stocks, concentrate on stocks ranked 1 or 2 for Safety. Also, at the same time, try to keep your portfolio ranked as high as possible for Timeliness.

	The Penalty and Reward of Risk

	A risky stock is one which has low Price Stability and whose price fluctuates widely around its own long-term trend. It may also be a stock of a company with a low Financial Strength rating. One may reasonably assume that the price of a risky stock will go up more than that of a safe stock in a generally strong market. Yet, if in the interim it went down more sharply and you had to sell at an inopportune time, you could suffer a heavier penalty for having bought the high-risk stock instead of the safer one.

More Details









Asset Allocation FundVLAAX (Inv) | VLAIX (Inst)



Investment Objective
The Adviser attempts to achieve the Fund’s investment objective by following an asset allocation strategy that enables the Adviser to periodically shift the assets of the Fund among three types of securities: (a) common stocks, (b) debt securities with maturities of more than one year that are principally rated investment grade (i.e., within the four highest categories of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization) and (c) money market instruments (debt securities with maturities of less than one year). There are no limits on the percentage of the Fund’s assets that can be invested in common stocks, debt or money market securities.

Income and Growth FundVALIX (Inv) | VLIIX (Inst)



Investment Objective
To achieve the Fund’s goals, the Adviser invests not less than 50% of the Fund’s net assets in common or preferred stocks or securities convertible into common stock which may or may not pay dividends. The balance of the Fund’s net assets are primarily invested in U.S. government securities, money market securities and investment grade debt securities rated at the time of purchase from the highest (AAA) to medium (BBB) quality. Although the Fund can invest in companies of any size, it generally invests in U.S. securities issued by larger, more established companies (those with a market capitalization of more than $5 billion).
