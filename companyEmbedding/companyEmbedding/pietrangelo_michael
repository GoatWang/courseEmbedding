               Company: The Theraplex Company LLC
Job Details
               Theraplex is a small Memphis based manufacturer and distributor of over-the-counter moisturizers and facial chemical peels, which have been recommended by dermatologists for more than 20 years, to patients suffering from various dry skin conditions. Now, the company's expanded global reach presents a milestone for success of its skincare products in the Chinese market. Techwise International, Inc., a Las Vegas Based company, that develops senior housing facilities in the United States and China, is also involved in the import and export of various products to and from China. Mr. Jun Yang, President of Techwise, said, "I am very optimistic about the opportunity for Theraplex products in China and other markets in the Far East as well." Mr. Yang first became aware of Theraplex skincare products a few years ago when his wife's dermatologist recommended that she use one of the brand's moisturizers to remedy a persistent dry skin condition. The product was effective and worked quickly, and his wife has been using the entire product line ever since. "I recognized the products' potential in a huge market like China, and contacted Theraplex. After several discussions and negotiations, we entered into the agreement," said Mr. Yang. Mike Pietrangelo, Managing Partner of Theraplex, said he too is excited about the opportunity to work together. The Theraplex product line was developed in the late 1980s as the result of a Swiss researcher's patented process of extracting heavy oils and grease from petrolatum. Scientists later combined this technique with a unique delivery system to create the Theraplex line of non-irritating, non-comedogenic and fragrance-free moisturizers. Theraplex moisturizers have superior hydrating and skin protection properties without feeling greasy and are suitable for all skin types.
