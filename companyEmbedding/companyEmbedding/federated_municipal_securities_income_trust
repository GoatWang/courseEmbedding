Shareholder
Expense Example
(unaudited)


As a shareholder
of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase or redemption
payments; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees
and to the extent applicable, distribution (12b-1) fees
and/or shareholder services fees and other Fund
expenses. This Example is intended to help you to understand your
ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare
these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.
It is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period from March 1,
2010 to August 31,
2010.




ACTUAL
EXPENSES


The first section of the table
below provides information about actual account values and actual
expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with
the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you
incurred over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000
(for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then
multiply the result by the number in the first section under the
heading entitled “Expenses Paid During Period” to
estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during
this
period.




HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE
FOR COMPARISON
PURPOSES


The second section of
the table below provides information about hypothetical account values
and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and
an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses,
which is not the Fund's actual return. Thus, you should not
use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual
ending account balance or your expenses for the period. Rather, these
figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the
ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with other funds. To do so,
compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples
that appear in the shareholder reports of the other
funds.

Please note that the
expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs
only and do not reflect any transaction costs, such as sales charges
(loads) on purchase or redemption payments. Therefore, the second
section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and
will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning
different funds. In addition, if these transaction costs were included,
your costs would have been
higher. BeginningAccount

Management's
Discussion of Fund Performance
(unaudited)


The Fund's total
returns, based on net asset value, for the 12-month reporting period
ended August 31, 2010 were 17.42% for
Class A Shares and Class F
Shares, and 16.69% for Class B Shares and
Class C Shares.1The total
return of the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond Index (Main
Index),2 a broad-based securities market index, was 10.19%
and the total return for the Morningstar High Yield Municipal Funds
Category (MSTARHYM),3 a competitive benchmark for the Fund,
was 17.12% during the same period. At the end of the reporting period,
the Fund's 12-month yield for Class A Shares was
5.66% versus 5.11% for the
MSTARHYM.

As
of the close of business on November 10, 2006,
the Federated Municipal High Yield Advantage Fund, Inc.
(“Predecessor Fund”) was reorganized into the Fund.
The Fund is a series of Federated Municipal Securities Income Trust,
and is the successor to the Predecessor Fund. Prior to the
reorganization, the Fund had no investment operations. Performance,
expense and other information presented in the Annual Shareholder
Report for periods prior to the close of business on
November 10, 2006, refers to performance,
expenses and other information of the Predecessor Fund, which are the
performance, expenses, and other information of the Fund for the
relevant period as a result of the
reorganization.

The
Fund's investment advsier has elected to change the Fund's broad-based
securities market index to the Main Index from the Barclays Capital
Municipal Bond Index (BCMB). The Main Index is more representative of
the securities in which the Fund invests. The Main Index is a broad,
comprehensive, market value-weighted index following approximately
55,000 bond issues that are exempt from
U.S. federal income taxes or subject to the
alternative minimum tax (AMT). Eligibility criteria for inclusion in
the Main Index include, but are not limited to: the bond issuer must be
a state (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and U.S.
territories) or a local government or agency where interest
on the bond is exempt from U.S. federal income
taxes or subject to the AMT; the bond must be held by a mutual fund for
which Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides prices; it must be denominated in
U.S. dollars and have a minimum par amount of
$2 million; and the bond must have a minimum term
to maturity and/or call date greater than or
equal to one calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced monthly. The
total return of the BCMB was 9.78% for the 12-month reporting period.
The BCMB is an unmanaged market value-weighted index for the long-term,
tax-exempt bond market. To be included in the BCMB, bonds must have a
minimum credit rating of Baa, an outstanding par value of at least
$7 million and be issued as part of a transaction
of at least $75 million. The bonds must be fixed
rate, have an issue date after December 31, 1990,
and must be at least one year from their maturity date. The BCMB
includes both zero coupon bonds and bond subject to the AMT. Neither
the Main Index nor BCMB are adjusted to reflect sales charges, expenses
and other fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
requires to be reflected in the Fund's performance. It is not possible
to invest directly in an
index.

Morningstar
figures represent the average of the total returns reported by all the
mutual funds designated by Morningstar as falling into the respective
category indicated. Funds designated within the MSTARHYM include those
that invest at least 50% of assets in high-income municipal securities
that are not rated or that are rated by a major agency such as
Standard & Poor's or
Moody's Investor Service at the level of BBB (considered part of the
high yield universe within the municipal industry) and below. They do
not reflect sales
charges.

During the reporting
period, the most significant factors affecting the Fund's performance
relative to the Main Index were: (a) selection of lower-quality,
investment-grade and noninvestment-grade securities; these securities
typically have higher yields than high quality, investment-grade
securities available in the market;4 (b) security selection,
particularly of inverse floaters; these securities typically have
higher yields due to the leverage of the security; (c) selection of
intermediate to long-term, tax-exempt municipal bonds that typically
yield more than short-term, tax-exempt municipal bonds due to the
upward sloping yield curve; (d) active adjustment of the Fund's
duration (which indicates the portfolio sensitivity to changes in
interest rates);5,6 and (e) allocation of the Fund's
portfolio among securities of similar issuers (referred to
as
sectors).

The following
discussion focuses on the performance of the Fund's Class
A Shares. The 17.42% total return of the Class
A Shares for the reporting period consisted of 6.72% of
tax-exempt dividends and reinvestments and 10.70% of price appreciation
in the net asset value of the
shares.7

Investment-grade
securities are securities that are rated at least
“BBB” or unrated securities of a comparable quality.
Noninvestment-grade securities are securities that are not rated at
least “BBB” or unrated securities of a comparable
quality. Credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security
will default. They do not protect a security from credit risk.
Lower-rated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate
investors for the increased risk associated with them. Among these
risks are lower creditworthiness, greater price volatility, more risk
to principal and income than with higher-rated securities and increased
possibilities of
default.

Bond
prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in
interest rates can cause a decline in their
prices.


6
Duration
is a measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes
in interest rates than securities with shorter
durations.

MARKET
OVERVIEW
 During the 12-month reporting
period, the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight
credit, modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major
contributors to this economic environment. Yields on nominal Treasury
coupon securities fell noticeably during the period, and Treasury
auctions were generally well received. The pace of economic recovery
was more modest than had been anticipated and inflation remained
subdued. To help support economic recovery the Federal Reserve Board
(the “Fed”) kept constant its holdings of securities
at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency
debt and mortgage-backed securities in longer term Treasury securities
and rolling over its holdings of Treasury debt as it matured. The Fed
maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between 0.00%
and 0.25% during the entire
period.

The combined
fiscal and monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the
valuation of risky assets. Tax-exempt municipal credit spreads declined
significantly as the spread between 20 year
BBB-rated and AAA-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds declined by
57 basis points during the reporting period. This
extensive normalization of the tax-exempt municipal market from the
market disruptions in 2008 resulted from several
positive technical factors. Significant federal financial support
programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local
economies and boost confidence. The Build America Bonds program reduced
the supply of tax-exempt municipal bonds issued helping to create a
shortage of tax-exempt bonds available in the market. Ongoing strong
demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very
low, the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual
fund flows led to solid demand for tax-exempt debt. These factors
helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that enabled the
tax-exempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns
during the
period.


The credit
fundamentals of the tax-exempt municipal bond market have shown
continued deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding
requirements, real estate values and revenue
growth.


Although credit
remained relatively weak, tax-exempt municipal high yield bonds
performed well during the period as liquidity returned to
the market.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

Credit
Quality8

During the 12-month
reporting period, lower investment-grade and noninvestment-grade
tax-exempt municipal debt outperformed due to tightening of credit
spreads. This helped the Fund's performance because of the Fund's
holdings in lower investment-grade, tax-exempt municipal bonds (bonds
rated BBB or unrated bonds of comparable quality), and
noninvestmentgrade, tax-exempt municipal bonds, which averaged nearly
73% of the Fund's portfolio. Over the course of the reporting period
the Fund increased its allocation to BBB-rated and non-investment-grade
bonds in order to take advantage of credit spreads which were wider
than historic averages. The Fund's exposure to non-rated bonds
decreased, as a number of non-rated pre-refunded bonds were sold;
although these pre-refunded bonds were non-rated, they were actually
high-quality bonds, so their sale benefitted the
Fund.


Security
Selection


On an historical basis,
inverse floating rate securities typically have higher yields due to
the leverage of the security. These securities, however, typically are
more sensitive to changes in interest rates and credit spreads.
Individual securities saw both positive and negative price movement for
idiosyncratic reasons. As a result, the Fund's allocation to inverse
floating rate securities during the 12-month reporting period had a
positive contribution to the Fund's
performance.


Maturity and
Yield Curve


During
the 12-month reporting period, the Fund primarily purchased securities
on the longer end of the tax-exempt municipal bond yield curve (20-30
year maturity bonds), but also made selective purchases in the short
and intermediate areas of the yield curve. The Fund's heavy position in
bonds maturing in 15 years or more helped the
Fund's absolute returns as interest rates fell along the yield curve
and longer bonds outperformed shorter
bonds.


Duration


As
determined at the end of the 12-month reporting period, the Fund's
dollar-weighted average duration was 7.70 years. Duration management
remained a significant component of the Fund's investment strategy. The
shorter a fund's duration is, relative to an index, the less its net
asset value will react as interest rates change. As rates fell, the
Fund's longer duration relative to the Main Index contributed to
positive relative Fund
performance.


Sector


During
the 12-month reporting period, the Fund was overweight, as compared to
the Main Index, in hospitals, senior care and industrial development
bonds, all of which outperformed and helped the Fund's performance. In
general, the Fund's allocation to riskier sectors contributed
positively to its performance during the reporting
period.

Municipal High Yield Advantage Fund, Inc. (“Predecessor

Advantage Fund (“Fund”), a series of Federated
Municipal Securities Income Trust, as of the close of business on
November 10, 2006. Prior to the reorganization, the Fund had no
investment operations. The Fund is the successor to the Predecessor
Fund. The information presented for periods prior to the close of
business on November 10, 2006, refers to the performance of the
predecessor Fund, which after the reorganization is the Fund's
performance as a result of the
reorganization.3The
Fund's investment adviser has elected to change the Fund's broad-based
securities market index to the Main Index from the BCMB. The Main Index
is more representative of the securities in which the Fund invests. The
Main Index is a broad, comprehensive, market value-weighted index
composed of approximately 55,000 bond issues that are exempt from
U.S. federal income taxes or subject to AMT.
Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Main Index include, but are
not limited to: the bond issuer must be a state (including the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and U.S. territories)
or a local government or a state or local government entity where
interest on the bond is exempt from U.S. federal
income taxes or subject to the AMT; the bond must be held by a mutual
fund for which Standard &
Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides
prices; it must be denominated in U.S. dollars
and have a minimum par amount of $2 million; and the bond must have a
minimum term to maturity and/or call date greater
than or equal to one calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced
monthly. The BCMB is an unmanaged market value-weighted index for the
long-term, tax-exempt bond market. To be included in the BCMB, bonds
must have a minimum credit rating of Baa, an outstanding par value of
at least $7 million and be issued as part of a transaction of at least
$75 million. The bonds must be fixed rate, have an issue date after
December 31, 1990, and must be at least one year from their maturity
date. The BCMB includes both zero coupon bonds and bonds subject to the
AMT. The Blended Index is a custom blended index that represents, by
market weighting, 25% of the A-rated and higher component of the Main
Index, 25% of the BBB-rated component of the Main Index and 50% of the
below investment grade (bonds with ratings of less than BBB-/Baa3)
component of the Main Index, all with remaining maturities of three
years or more. Neither the Main Index, BCMB nor Blended Index are
adjusted to reflect sales charges, expenses and other fees that the SEC
requires to be reflected in the Fund's performance. The Main Index,

1.
Organization


Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust (the “Trust”) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “Act”), as an open-end management
investment company. The Trust consists of five portfolios. The
financial statements included herein are only those of Federated
Municipal High Yield Advantage Fund (the “Fund”), a
non-diversified portfolio. The financial statements of the other
portfolios are presented separately. The assets of each portfolio are
segregated and a shareholder's interest is limited to the portfolio in
which shares are held. Each portfolio pays its own expenses. The Fund
offers four classes of shares: Class A Shares,
Class B Shares, Class C
Shares and Class F Shares. All shares of the Fund
have equal rights with respect to voting, except on class-specific
matters. The investment objective of the Fund is to provide a high
level of current income which is generally exempt from federal regular
income tax. Interest income from the Fund's investments may be subject
to the federal AMT for individuals and corporations and state and
local taxes.




2.
Significant Accounting
Policies


The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles
(GAAP).


Investment
Valuation


In calculating its net asset
value (NAV), the Fund generally values investments as
follows:


Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities greater than
60 days are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees (the
“Trustees”).
Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities of 60
days or less are valued at their cost (adjusted for the
accretion of any discount or amortization of any
premium).
Shares of other
mutual funds are valued based upon their reported
NAVs.
Derivative contracts
listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement or
closing
price.
Over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the
Trustees.


If the Fund cannot
obtain a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an
investment, the Fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the
mean of bid and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on
price evaluations, from one or more dealers. If any price, quotation,
price evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when
the NAV is calculated, the Fund uses the fair value of the investment
determined in accordance with the procedures described below. There can
be no assurance that the Fund could purchase or sell an investment at
the price used to calculate the Fund's
NAV.


Fair Valuation and
Significant Events
Procedures

The Trustees have
authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the
current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating
the NAV. Factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an
investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, call rights and other potential prepayments,
terms and type, reported transactions, indications as to values from
dealers and general market conditions. Some pricing services provide a
single price evaluation reflecting the bid-side of Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  46
the market for an investment (a
“bid” evaluation). Other pricing services offer both
bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of a price between the
prices bid and asked for the investment (a “mid”
evaluation). The Fund normally uses bid evaluations for
U.S. Treasury and Agency securities,
mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The Fund normally
uses mid evaluations for other types of fixed-income securities and OTC
derivative contracts. In the event that market quotations and price
evaluations are not available for an investment, the fair value of the
investment is determined in accordance with procedures adopted by
the
Trustees.

The Trustees
also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at
its fair value whenever the Adviser determines that a significant event
affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as
of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and
the time as of which the NAV is computed. An event is considered
significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the
investment's value will change in response to the event and a
reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value.
Examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the
principal market on which a security is traded, or after the time of a
price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer,
include:


With respect to
price evaluations of fixed-income securities determined before the
close of regular trading on the NYSE, actions by the Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee and other significant trends in U.S.
fixed-income
markets;
Political or other
developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer
conducts its operations or its securities are traded;
and
Announcements concerning matters
such as acquisitions, recapitalizations, litigation developments, a
natural disaster affecting the issuer's operations or regulatory
changes or market developments affecting the issuer's
industry.


The Fund may seek
to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative
pricing sources. If a reliable alternative pricing source is not
available, the Fund will determine the fair value of the investment
using another method approved by the
Trustees.


Investment Income,
Gains and Losses, Expenses and
Distributions


Investment
transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains
and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an
identified-cost basis. Interest income and expenses are accrued daily.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions of net investment income are declared and paid monthly.
Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are recorded at
fair value. Investment income, realized and unrealized gains and
losses, and certain fund-level expenses are allocated to each class
based on relative average daily net assets, except that each class may
bear certain expenses unique to that class such as account
administration, distribution services and shareholder services fees.
Dividends are declared separately for each class. No class has
preferential dividend rights; differences in per share dividend rates
are generally due to differences in separate class
expenses.


Premium and
Discount
Amortization


All premiums and
discounts on fixed-income securities are amortized/accreted for
financial statement
purposes.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

  47
Federal
Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to comply
with the Subchapter M provision of the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders each year substantially all of its income.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is necessary. As of
and during the year ended August 31, 2010, the
Fund did not have a liability for any uncertain tax positions. The Fund
recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities
as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. As of
August 31, 2010, tax years 2007
through 2010 remain subject to
examination by the Fund's major tax jurisdictions, which include the
United States of America and the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.


When-Issued
and Delayed Delivery
Transactions


The Fund may
engage in when-issued or delayed delivery transactions. The Fund
records when-issued securities on the trade date and maintains security
positions such that sufficient liquid assets will be available to make
payment for the securities purchased. Securities purchased on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis are marked to market daily and
begin earning interest on the settlement date. Losses may occur on
these transactions due to changes in market conditions or the failure
of counterparties to perform under the
contract.


Restricted
Securities


The Fund may purchase
securities which are considered restricted. Restricted securities are
securities that either: (a) cannot be offered for public sale without
first being registered, or being able to take advantage of an exemption
from registration, under the Securities Act of 1933; or (b) are subject
to contractual restrictions on public sales. In some cases, when a
security cannot be offered for public sale without first being
registered, the issuer of the restricted security has agreed to
register such securities for resale, at the issuer's expense, either
upon demand by the Fund or in connection with another registered
offering of the securities. Many such restricted securities may be
resold in the secondary market in transactions exempt from
registration. Restricted securities may be determined to be liquid
under criteria established by the Trustees. The Fund will not incur any
registration costs upon such resales. The Fund's restricted securities
are valued at the price provided by dealers in the secondary market or,
if no market prices are available, at the fair value as determined in
accordance with procedures established by and under the general
supervision of the
Trustees.

Federal Tax
InformationThe timing and
character of income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
These differences are due in part to the expiration of capital loss
carryforwards, differing treatments for partnership income and gains
and discount accretion/premium amortization on debt
securities.For the year
ended August 31, 2010, permanent differences identified and
reclassified among the components of net assets were as

As of August 31, 2010, the
components of distributable earnings on a tax basis were as
follows: Undistributed
tax-exempt income$1,270,542 Net
unrealized depreciation$(24,847,727)
Capital loss carryforwards and
deferrals$(57,716,181)The
difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized
appreciation/depreciationis attributable to differing
treatments for the deferral of losses on wash sales,
discountaccretion/premium amortization on debt securities,
open defaulted securities and partnership
adjustments.At
August 31, 2010, the cost of investments for
federal tax purposes was $532,828,328. The net unrealized depreciation
of investments for federal tax purposes was $24,847,727. This consists
of net unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost of $20,948,178 and net unrealized
depreciation from investments for those securities having an excess of
cost over value of
$45,795,905.At
August 31, 2010, the Fund had a capital loss
carryforward of $57,262,300 which will reduce the Fund's taxable income
arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the
extent permitted by the Code and thus will reduce the amount of
distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to
relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income tax. Pursuant to
the Code, such capital loss carryforward will expire as
follows: Expiration

2018$19,483,511Capital
loss carryforwards of $3,907,651 expired during the year ended
August 31,
2010.Under current tax
regulations, capital losses on securities transactions realized after
October 31 may be deferred and treated as
occurring on the first day of the following fiscal year. As of August
31, 2010, for federal income tax purposes, post-October losses of
$453,881 were deferred to September 1,
2010.5. Investment Adviser
Fee and Other Transactions with
AffiliatesInvestment
Adviser
FeeFederated Investment
Management Company is the Fund's investment adviser (the
“Adviser”). The advisory agreement between the Fund
and the Adviser provides for an annual fee equal to 0.60% of the Fund's
average daily net assets. Subject to the terms described in the Expense
Limitation note, the Adviser may voluntarily choose to waive any
portion of its fee. For the year ended August 31, 2010, the Adviser
waived $1,302,074 of its
fee.Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  51
Pursuant to a
settlement with the New York Attorney General, the Adviser has agreed
to waive investment adviser fees in compliance with an Assurance of
Discontinuance dated November 17, 2005. The net adviser fee was reduced
to 0.3233% effective January 1, 2006 and may not
be increased until after December 31, 2010. The Adviser fee waived as a
result of this settlement is included in the $1,302,074 mentioned in
the previous
paragraph.Administrative
FeeFederated Administrative Services
(FAS), under the Administrative Services Agreement, provides the Fund
with administrative personnel and services. The fee paid to FAS is
based on the average aggregate daily net assets of certain Federated
funds as specified
below: Administrative

fee received during any fiscal year shall be at least $150,000 per
portfolio and $40,000 per each additional class of Shares. Subject to
the terms described in the Expense Limitation note, FAS may voluntarily
choose to waive any portion of its fee. For the year ended August 31,
2010, the net fee paid to FAS was 0.076% of average daily net assets of
the Fund. FAS waived $8,721 of its
fee.Distribution
Services FeeThe
Fund has adopted a Distribution Plan (the “Plan”)
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act. Under the terms of the Plan, the
Fund will compensate Federated Securities Corp. (FSC), the principal
distributor, from the daily net assets of the Fund's Class
A Shares, Class B Shares,
Class C Shares and Class F
Shares to finance activities intended to result in the sale of these
shares. The Plan provides that the Fund may incur distribution expenses
at the following percentages of average daily net assets annually, to

customers purchase shares. For the year ended August 31, 2010, FSC
retained $79,530 of fees paid by the Fund. For the year ended August
31, 2010, the Fund's Class A Shares and
Class F Shares did not incur a distribution
services fee; however, they may begin to incur this fee upon approval
of the Trustees.Annual

Sales
ChargesFront-end sales charges and
contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC) do not represent expenses of
the Fund. They are deducted from the proceeds of sales of Fund shares
prior to investment or from redemption proceeds prior to remittance, as
applicable. For the year ended August 31, 2010, FSC retained $319,673
in sales charges from the sale of Class A Shares.
FSC also retained $39 of CDSC relating to redemptions of
Class A Shares, $513 related to redemptions of
Class C Shares, and $4,667 relating to
redemptions of Class F
Shares.Shareholder
Services FeeThe
Fund may pay fees (Service Fees) up to 0.25% of the average daily net
assets of the Fund's Class A Shares,
Class B Shares, Class C
Shares and Class F Shares to financial
intermediaries or to Federated Shareholder Services Company (FSSC) for
providing services to shareholders and maintaining shareholder
accounts. Subject to the terms described in the Expense Limitation
note, FSSC may voluntarily reimburse the Fund for Service Fees. For the
year ended August 31, 2010, FSSC received $1,871 of fees paid by
the
Fund.Interfund
TransactionsDuring the year ended
August 31, 2010, the Fund engaged in purchase and sale transactions
with funds that have a common investment adviser (or affiliated
investment advisers),common Directors/Trustees,
and/or common Officers. These purchase and sale
transactions complied with Rule 17a-7 under the Act and amounted to
$187,765,000 and $185,415,000,
respectively.Expense
LimitationThe Adviser and its
affiliates (which may include FSC, FAS and FSSC) have voluntarily
agreed to waive their fees and/or reimburse
expenses so that the total annual fund operating expenses (as shown in
the financial highlights) paid by the Fund's Class
A Shares, Class B Shares,
Class C Shares and Class F
Shares (after the voluntary waivers and reimbursements) will not exceed
0.89%, 1.64%, 1.64% and 0.89% (the “Fee Limit”),
respectively, through the later of (the “Termination
Date”): (a) October 31, 2011; or (b) the date of the Fund's
next effective Prospectus. While the Adviser and its affiliates
currently do not anticipate terminating or increasing these
arrangements prior to the Termination Date, these arrangements may only
be terminated or the Fee Limit increased prior to the Termination Date
with the agreement of the Fund's Trustees. As part of the foregoing
commitment, for the period through December 31, 2010, the Fee Limit
will be 0.79% for Class A Shares, 1.54% for
Class B Shares, 1.54% for Class
C Shares and 0.79% for Class F Shares.
The Adviser previously agreed to maintain the management fee at 0.3233%
for the period ending December 31, 2010, and this obligation will
expire on that date. Accordingly, the management fee waivers will be
reduced, and the management fee for the Fund will increase, after
December 31, 2010, subject to the Fee Limit for each class of Shares
reflected
above.GeneralCertain

6. Investment
RiskAlthough the Fund has a
diversified portfolio, the Fund has 41.1% of its portfolio invested in
lower rated and comparable quality unrated high-yield securities.
Investments in higher yield securities may be subject to a greater
degree of credit risk and the risk tends to be more sensitive to
economic conditions than higher rated securities. The risk of loss due
to default by the issuer may be significantly greater for the holders
of high yielding securities because such securities are generally
unsecured and often subordinated to other creditors of the
issuer.7.

Sales$82,837,7048.
Line of
CreditThe Fund participates
in a $100,000,000 unsecured, uncommitted revolving line of credit (LOC)
agreement with PNC Bank. The LOC was made available for extraordinary
or emergency purposes, primarily for financing redemption payments.
Borrowings are charged interest at a rate offered to the Fund by PNC
Bank at the time of the borrowing. As of August 31, 2010, there were no
outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did
not utilize the
LOC.9.
Interfund
LendingPursuant to an
Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Fund, along with other funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated
Investors, Inc., may participate in an interfund lending program. This
program provides an alternative credit facility allowing the funds to
borrow from other participating affiliated funds. As of August 31,
2010, there were no outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31,
2010, the program was not
utilized.10.
Legal
ProceedingsSince October
2003, Federated Investors, Inc. and related entities (collectively,
“Federated”), and various Federated sponsored mutual
funds (“Federated Funds”) have been named as
defendants in several class action lawsuits now pending in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were
purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned
and/or redeemed shares of certain Federated Funds
during specified periods beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are
generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal and
improper trading practices including market timing and late trading in
concert with certain institutional traders, which allegedly caused
financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders. Federated without
admitting the validity of any claim has reached a preliminary
settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases. Any settlement would
have to be approved by the Court. Federated entities have also been
named as defendants in several additional lawsuits that are now pending
in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania. These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single
action alleging excessive advisory fees involving one of the Federated
Funds. The Board of the Federated Funds retained the law firm of
Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the Federated Funds in these
lawsuits. Federated and the Federated Funds, and their respective
counsel, have been defending this litigation, and none of the Federated
Funds remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits. Additional lawsuits
based upon similar allegations may be filed in the future. The
Annual
Shareholder
Report

potential impact of these lawsuits, all of
which seek monetary damages, attorneys' fees and expenses, and future
potential similar suits is uncertain. Although we do not believe that
these lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Federated
Funds, there can be no assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse
publicity and/or other developments resulting
from the allegations in these matters will not result in increased
redemptions, or reduced sales of shares of the Federated Funds, or
other adverse consequences for the Federated
Funds.11. Change in
Independent Registered Public Accounting
FirmOn May 14, 2010, the
Fund's Trustees, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee,
appointed KPMG LLP (KPMG) as the Fund's independent registered public
accounting firm. On the same date, the Fund's previous independent
registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y)
resigned. The previous reports issued by E&Y on the Fund's
financial statements for the fiscal years ended August 31,
2008 and August 31, 2009, contained no adverse
opinion or disclaimer of opinion nor were they qualified or modified as
to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles. During the Fund's
fiscal years August 31, 2008 and August 31,
2009 and the interim period commencing September
1, 2009 and ending May 14, 2010,: (i)
there were no disagreements with E&Y on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of E&Y, would have caused it to make reference to the
subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports on
the financial statements for such years; and (ii) there were
no reportable events of the kind described in Item 304(a)
(1) (v) of Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended.As indicated
above, the Fund has appointed KPMG as the independent registered public
accounting firm to audit the Fund's financial statements for the fiscal
year ending August 31, 2010. During the Fund's
fiscal years ended August 31, 2008 and
August 31, 2009, and the interim period
commencing September 1, 2009 and ending May 14,
2010, neither the Fund nor anyone on its behalf has consulted KPMG on
items which: (i) concerned the application of
accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or
proposed, or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the
Fund's financial statements or (ii) concerned the
subject of a disagreement (as defined in paragraph (a) (1)
(iv) of Item 304 of Regulation S-K) or
reportable events (as described in paragraph (a) (1) (v) of
said Item
304).12.
Subsequent
EventsManagement has
evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements
were issued, and determined that no events have occurred that require
additional
disclosure.13. Federal Tax

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm




TO THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF federated municipal securities income trust AND
SHAREHOLDERS OF federated municipal high yield advantage
fund:


We have audited the
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the
portfolio of investments, of Federated Municipal High Yield Advantage
Fund (the “Fund”), a portfolio of Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust, as of August 31, 2010,
and the related statement of operations, the statements of changes in
net assets, and the financial highlights for the year then ended. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial highlights based on our audit.
The statement of changes in net assets for the year ended
August 31, 2009 and the financial highlights for
the periods presented prior to September 1, 2009,
were audited by other independent registered public accountants whose
report thereon dated October 20, 2009, expressed
an unqualified opinion on those
statements.


We conducted our
audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements and financial highlights are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our
procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of
August 31, 2010 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the
financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Federated
Municipal High Yield Advantage Fund as of August 31,
2010, and the results of its operations, the changes in its
net assets, and the financial highlights for the year then ended, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting
principles.

Evaluation
and Approval of Advisory Contract - May
2010




Federated Municipal High Yield
Advantage Fund (the
“Fund”)


The
Fund's Board reviewed the Fund's investment advisory contract at
meetings held in May 2010. The Board's decision regarding the contract
reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue
the existing
arrangements.


In this connection,
the Federated funds' Board had previously appointed a Senior Officer,
whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process
by which advisory fees are to be charged to a Federated fund. The
Senior Officer has the authority to retain consultants, experts, or
staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of
his duties, reports directly to the Board, and may be terminated only
with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the
Board. The Senior Officer prepared and furnished to the Board an
independent, written evaluation that covered topics discussed below.
The Board considered that evaluation, along with other information, in
deciding to approve the advisory
contract.


During its
review of the contract, the Board considered compensation and benefits
received by the Adviser. This included the fees received for services
provided to the Fund by other entities in the Federated organization
and research services (if any) received by the Adviser from brokers
that execute Federated fund trades, as well as advisory fees. The Board
is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning
allegedly excessive investment advisory fees, which have indicated that
the following factors may be relevant to an Adviser's fiduciary duty
with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund: the nature and
quality of the services provided by the Adviser, including the
performance of the fund; the Adviser's cost of providing the services;
the extent to which the Adviser may realize “economies of
scale” as a fund grows larger; any indirect benefits that may
accrue to the Adviser and its affiliates as a result of the Adviser's
relationship with a fund; performance and expenses of comparable funds;
and the extent to which the independent Board members are fully
informed about all facts the Board deems relevant bearing on the
Adviser's services and fees. The Board further considered management
fees (including any components thereof) charged to institutional and
other clients of the Adviser for what might be viewed as like services,
and the cost to the Adviser and its affiliates of supplying services
pursuant to the management fee agreements, excluding any
intra-corporate profit and profit margins of the Adviser and its
affiliates for supplying such services. The Board was aware of these
factors and was guided by them in its review of the Fund's advisory
contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and
relevant, as discussed further
below.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

  62
The Board considered
and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated
experience in governing the Fund and working with Federated on matters
relating to the Federated funds, and was assisted in its deliberations
by independent legal counsel. Throughout the year, the Board has
requested and received substantial and detailed information about the
Fund and the Federated organization that was in addition to the
extensive materials that comprise and accompany the Senior Officer's
evaluation. Federated provided much of this information at each regular
meeting of the Board, and furnished additional reports in connection
with the particular meeting at which the Board's formal review of the
advisory contract occurred. Between regularly scheduled meetings, the
Board also received information on particular matters as the need
arose. Thus, the Board's consideration of the advisory contract
included review of the Senior Officer's evaluation, accompanying data
and additional reports covering such matters as: the Adviser's
investment philosophy, revenue, profitability, personnel and processes;
investment and operating strategies; the Fund's short- and long-term
performance (in absolute terms, both on a gross basis and net of
expenses, as well as in relationship to its particular investment
program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds
and/or other benchmarks, as appropriate), and
comments on the reasons for performance; the Fund's investment
objectives; the Fund's expenses (including the advisory fee itself and
the overall expense structure of the Fund, both in absolute terms and
relative to similar and/or competing funds, with
due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations); the use
and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the Fund's
portfolio securities (if any); and the nature, quality and extent of
the advisory and other services provided to the Fund by the Adviser and
its affiliates. The Board also considered the preferences and
expectations of Fund shareholders and their relative sophistication;
the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and
market practices; the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the
mutual fund industry; the Fund's relationship to the Federated family
of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different
investment objectives, policies and strategies which are available for
exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges; compliance
and audit reports concerning the Federated funds and the Federated
companies that service them (including communications from regulatory
agencies), as well as Federated's responses to any issues raised
therein; and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how
the Federated funds and/or Federated are
responding to them. The Board's evaluation process is evolutionary. The
criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change
in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund
marketplace.
With respect to the
Fund's performance and expenses in particular, the Board has found the
use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment
programs to be relevant, given the high degree of competition in the
mutual fund business. The Board focused on comparisons with other
similar Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  63
mutual funds more heavily than non-mutual
fund products or services because it is believed that they are more
relevant. For example, other mutual funds are the products most like
the Fund, they are readily available to Fund shareholders as
alternative investment vehicles, and they are the type of investment
vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the Fund's investors. The
range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally
reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in
the precise marketplace in which the Fund competes. The Fund's ability
to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was
a useful indicator of how the Adviser is executing the Fund's
investment program, which in turn assisted the Board in reaching a
conclusion that the nature, extent, and quality of the Adviser's
investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of
the advisory contract. In this regard, the Senior Officer has reviewed
Federated's fees for providing advisory services to products outside
the Federated family of funds (e.g., institutional and separate
accounts). He concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts
are inherently different products. Those differences include, but are
not limited to, different types of targeted investors; being subject to
different laws and regulations; different legal structures; different
average account sizes; different associated costs; different portfolio
management techniques made necessary by different cash flows; and
portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing. The
Senior Officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative
in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory
contracts.

The Senior Officer
reviewed reports compiled by Federated, using data supplied by
independent fund ranking organizations, regarding the performance of,
and fees charged by, other mutual funds, noting his view that
comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the
reasonableness of proposed
fees.


The Fund's performance fell
below the median of the relevant peer group for the one-year,
three-year and five-year periods covered by the report. The Board
discussed the Fund's performance with the Adviser and recognized the
efforts being undertaken by the Adviser. The Board will continue to
monitor these efforts and the performance of the
Fund.

The Board also
received financial information about Federated, including reports on
the compensation and benefits Federated derived from its relationships
with the Federated funds. These reports covered not only the fees under
the advisory contracts, but also fees received by Federated's
subsidiaries for providing other services to the Federated funds under
separate contracts (e.g., for serving as the Federated funds'
administrator). The reports also discussed any indirect benefit
Federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers
who execute Federated fund trades. In addition, the Board considered
the fact that, in order for a fund to be competitive in the
marketplace, Federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees
and/or reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to
fund investors and/or indicated to Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  64
the Board their intention to do so in the
future, where appropriate. Moreover, the Board receives regular reports
regarding the institution or elimination of these voluntary waivers. In
this regard, it was noted that the Adviser has agreed to a reduction of
0.2767% in the Fund's advisory fee at least through December
31, 2010.

Federated
furnished reports, requested by the Senior Officer, that reported
revenues on a fund-by-fund basis and made estimates of the allocation
of expenses on a fund-by-fund basis, using allocation methodologies
specified by the Senior Officer. The Senior Officer noted that,
although they may apply consistent allocation processes, the inherent
difficulties in allocating costs (and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects
of that exercise) and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those
costs may render such allocation reports unreliable. The allocation
reports were considered in the analysis by the Board but were
determined to be of limited
use.


The Board and the Senior
Officer also reviewed a report compiled by Federated comparing
profitability information for Federated to other publicly held fund
management companies. In this regard, the Senior Officer noted the
limited availability of such information, but nonetheless concluded
that Federated's profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the
Board agreed.


The Senior
Officer's evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization
of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger. The
Board considered in this regard that the Adviser has made significant
and long-term investments in areas that support all of the Federated
funds, such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management,
compliance, and risk management functions; and systems technology; and
that the benefits of these efforts (as well as any economies, should
they exist) were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole.
Finally, the Board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory
or industry guidelines on this subject, which (as discussed in the
Senior Officer's evaluation) is compounded by the lack of any common
industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund
advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce
the fee as the fund attains a certain size. The Senior Officer did not
recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing Federated's fund
advisory services at this
time.


It was noted in the materials
for the Board meeting that for the period covered by the report, the
Fund's investment advisory fee, after waivers and expense
reimbursements, if any, was below the median of the relevant peer
group. The Board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the Fund with
the Adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the
Fund remained
competitive.

The Senior Officer's
evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations
contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed
management fees are reasonable, and that Federated appeared to provide
appropriate administrative services to the Fund for the fees paid.

circumstances, no changes were recommended
to, and no objection was raised to, the continuation of the Fund's
advisory contract. The Board concluded that the nature, quality and
scope of services provided the Fund by the Adviser and its affiliates
were satisfactory.

In its
decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract, the
Board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the Fund's operations
and various risks, uncertainties and other effects that could occur as
a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract.
In particular, the Board recognized that many shareholders have
invested in the Fund on the strength of the Adviser's industry standing
and reputation and with the expectation that the Adviser will have a
continuing role in providing advisory services to the Fund. Thus, the
Board's approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is
the shareholders who have effectively selected the Adviser by virtue of
having invested in the
Fund.


The Board based its decision
to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances
and relevant factors and with a view to past and future long-term
considerations. Not all of the factors and considerations identified
above were necessarily relevant to the Fund, nor did the Board consider
any one of them to be determinative. With respect to the factors that
were relevant, the Board's decision to approve the contract reflects
its determination that Federated's performance and actions provided a
satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the
existing
arrangements.

Shareholder
Expense Example
(unaudited)


As a shareholder
of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (“loads”) on purchase
or redemption payments; and (2) ongoing costs, including
management fees and to the extent applicable, distribution (12b-1) fees
and/or shareholder services fees and other Fund
expenses. This Example is intended to help you to understand your
ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare
these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.
It is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period from March 1,
2010 to August 31,
2010.




ACTUAL
EXPENSES


The first section of the table
below provides information about actual account values and actual
expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with
the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you
incurred over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000
(for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then
multiply the result by the number in the first section under the
heading entitled “Expenses Paid During Period” to
estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during
this
period.




HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE
FOR COMPARISON
PURPOSES


The second section of
the table below provides information about hypothetical account values
and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and
an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses,
which is not the Fund's actual return. Thus, you should not
use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual
ending account balance or your expenses for the period. Rather, these
figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the
ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with other funds. To do so,
compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples
that appear in the shareholder reports of the other
funds.

Please note that the
expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs
only and do not reflect any transaction costs, such as sales charges
(loads) on purchase or redemption payments. Therefore, the second
section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and
will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning
different funds. In addition, if these transaction costs were included,
your costs would have been
higher.

Management's
Discussion of Fund Performance
(unaudited)


The Fund's total return,
based on net asset value, for the 12-month reporting period ended
August 31, 2010, was 8.25%. The total return of
the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond Intermediate Index
(“Intermediate Index”),1 a broad-based
securities market index, was 9.87% for the same period. The Fund's
total return reflected actual cash flows, transaction costs and other
expenses which were not reflected in the total return of the
Intermediate
Index.



1 
The
Fund's investment adviser has elected to change the fund's broad-based
securities market index to the Intermediate Index from the Barclays
Capital 7-Year Municipal Bond Index (BC7MB). The Intermediate Index is
more representative of the securities in which the Fund invests. The
Intermediate Index consists of bonds in the S&P/Investortools
Municipal Bond Index (“Main Index”) with a minimum
maturity of 3 years and a maximum maturity of up
to, but not including, 15 years as measured from
the monthly rebalancing date of the Main Index. The Main Index is a
broad, comprehensive, market value-weighted index composed of
approximately 55,000 bond issues that are exempt
from U.S. federal income taxes or subject to the
alternative minimum tax (AMT). Eligibility criteria for inclusion in
the Main Index include, but are not limited to: the bond issuer must be
a state (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and U.S.
territories) or a local government or a state or local
government entity where interest on the bond is exempt from
U.S. federal income taxes or subject to the AMT;
the bond must be held by a mutual fund for which
Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides prices; it must be denominated in
U.S. dollars and have a minimum par amount of
$2 million; and the bond must have a minimum term
to maturity and/or call date greater than or
equal to one calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced monthly. The
total return of the BC7MB was 9.44% for the
12-month reporting period. The BC7MB is an
unmanaged market value-weighted index for the long-term, tax-exempt
bond market. To be included in the index, bonds must have a minimum
credit rating of at Baa3, an outstanding par value of at least
$7 million and be issued as part of a transaction
of at least $75 million. The bonds must have an
issue date after December 31, 1990 and a maturity
range of six to eight years. The BC7MB includes both zero coupon bonds
and bonds subject to the alternative minimum tax. Neither the
Intermediate Index nor the BC7MB are adjusted to reflect sales charges,
expenses and other fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) requires to be reflected in the Fund's performance. It is not
possible to invest directly in an
index.

During the reporting
period, the most significant factors affecting the Fund's performance
relative to the Intermediate Index were: (a) the effective duration of
the portfolio (which indicates the portfolio's sensitivity to changes
in interest rates);2,3 (b) the selection of securities with
different maturities (expressed by a yield curve showing the relative
yield of similar securities with different maturities); (c)
the allocation of the fund's portfolio among securities of
similar issuers (referred to as sectors); and (d) the credit quality of
portfolio securities (which indicates the risk that the securities
may
default).

The 8.25% total
return for the reporting period consisted of 3.90% of tax-exempt
dividends and 4.35% of price appreciation in the net asset value of the
shares.4




MARKET
OVERVIEW


During the 12-month reporting
period, the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight
credit, modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major
contributors to this economic environment. Yields on nominal Treasury
coupon securities fell noticeably during the period, and Treasury
auctions were generally well received. The pace of economic recovery
was more modest than had been anticipated and inflation remained
subdued. To help support economic recovery the Federal Reserve Board
(the “Fed”) kept constant its holdings of securities
at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency
debt and mortgage backed securities in longer term Treasury securities
and rolling over its holdings of Treasury debt as it matured. The Fed
maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between 0.00%
and 0.25% during the entire
period.



2
Duration
is a measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes
in interest rates than securities with shorter
durations.


3

Bond prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a
rise in interest rates can cause a decline in their
prices.

Income
may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax for individuals
or
corporations.

The combined fiscal and
monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky
assets. Tax-exempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as
the spread between 20 year BBB-rated and
AAA-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds declined by 57
basis points during the reporting period. This extensive
normalization of the tax-exempt municipal market from the market
disruptions in 2008 resulted from several
positive technical factors. Significant federal financial support
programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local
economies and boost confidence. The Build America Bonds (BAB) program
reduced the supply of tax-exempt municipal bonds issued helping to
create a shortage of tax-exempt bonds available in the market. Ongoing
strong demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained
very low, the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong
mutual fund flows led to solid demand for tax-exempt debt. These
factors helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that has
enabled the tax-exempt municipal market to recover and provide positive
returns during the
period.

During the 12-month
reporting period, the Michigan tax-exempt municipal market reflected
the national market. According to Municipal Market Data, yields on
Michigan bonds fell over the course of the period, as the overall yield
curve fell and spreads on Michigan credits tightened. The Bond Buyer
reported that issuance of Michigan municipal bonds for the first eight
months of 2010 was in line with the same period
in 2009, however a significant portion of these
were taxable BABs, resulting in a net decline in the issuance of
tax-exempt
bonds.


The economic and
fiscal situations in Michigan remained weak as the state continued to
be particularly hard hit by the recession, but Michigan's economy began
to improve with the natural economy during the period. The state
grappled with the fallout of the bankruptcies of GM and Chrysler and
other large declines in the manufacturing sector. The state's
unemployment rate at the end of July stood at 13.1%, second only to
Nevada, but with the domestic auto industry starting to regain its
footing during the period, Michigan payrolls began to expand again in
2010. Home prices remained weak. Both the state and local governments
have had to confront declining revenues and budget
deficits.


Despite the weak
economic and fiscal situation in Michigan, the state saw its rating
raised by two of the ratings agencies as a result of recalibrations of
their ratings systems. In April, Moody's Investors Service revised the
rating on the state's general obligation debt from Aa3 to Aa2 and Fitch
Ratings revised its rating from A+ to AA-. S&P's rating of AA-
remained unchanged. All three ratings carried stable
outlooks.

DURATION

As
determined at the end of the 12-month reporting period, the Fund's
dollar-weighted average duration was 4.7 years. Duration management was
a significant component of the Fund's investment strategy. The Fund's
duration was maintained short of the duration of the Intermediate Index
during the 12-month reporting period. With falling rates, the Fund's
relatively short duration had a slight negative impact on the Fund's
performance relative to the Intermediate
Index.




YIELD
CURVE/MATURITY


Throughout the yield
curve, bonds with longer maturities outperformed bonds with shorter
maturities during the reporting period. Since the Fund had a larger
concentration of bonds in shorter maturities relative to the
Intermediate Index, yield curve positioning was a net detractor to the
Fund's
performance.




SECTOR


During
the 12-month reporting period, the Fund was overweight, as compared to
the Intermediate Index, in hospital and industrial revenue bonds, which
were among the best-performing sectors. Likewise, the Fund was
underweight pre-refunded and water and sewer bonds, which
underperformed. Thus, sector selection was positive contributor to the
Fund's performance versus the Intermediate
Index.




CREDIT
QUALITY


The Fund maintained a
high-quality portfolio, with over 90% of the portfolio rated in one of
the three highest rating categories (AAA, AA and A) throughout the
12-month reporting period.5 High-quality, tax-exempt
municipal bonds underperformed lower quality bonds, as spreads
tightened on the latter, driving their prices down. Consequently,
credit quality contributed to the Fund's underperformance versus the
Intermediate
Index.6



5
Credit
ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not
protect the Fund shares against market
risk.


6

Investment-grade securities are securities that are rated at
least BBB (i.e., in one of the four highest rating categories) or
unrated securities of a comparable quality. Noninvestment-grade
securities are securities that are not rated at least BBB or unrated
securities of a comparable quality. Credit ratings are an indication of
the risk that a security will default. They do not protect a security
from credit risk. Lower-rated bonds typically offer higher yields to
help compensate investors for the increased risk associated with them.
Among these risks are lower creditworthiness, greater price volatility,
more risk to principal and income than with higher-rated securities and
increased possibilities of
default.

composed solely of bonds issued by the State of Michigan or local
governments or state or local government entities within Michigan that
are rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher with remaining maturities of between

1.
Organization


Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust (the “Trust”) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “Act”), as an open-end management
investment company. The Trust consists of five portfolios. The
financial statements included herein are only those of Federated
Michigan Intermediate Municipal Trust (the “Fund”), a
non-diversified portfolio. The financial statements of the other
portfolios are presented separately. The assets of each portfolio are
segregated and a shareholder's interest is limited to the portfolio in
which shares are held. Each portfolio pays its own expenses. The Fund
offers one class of shares: Class A Shares. The
investment objective of the Fund is to provide current income exempt
from federal regular income tax and the personal income taxes imposed
by the state of Michigan and Michigan municipalities. Interest income
from the Fund's investments may be subject to the federal alternative
minimum tax (AMT) for individuals and
corporations.


On
November 21, 2008, the Fund received assets from
Fifth Third Michigan Municipal Bond Fund as the result of a tax-free
reorganization, as
follows:

Accounting
PoliciesThe following is a
summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles
(GAAP).Investment
ValuationIn calculating its net asset
value (NAV), the Fund generally values investments as
follows:Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities greater than
60 days are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees (the
“Trustees”).Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities of
60 days or less are valued at their cost
(adjusted for the accretion of any discount or amortization of
any
premium).Derivative
contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement
or closing
price.Over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the
Trustees.Shares of other
mutual funds are valued based upon their reported
NAVs.Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  22
If the Fund cannot obtain
a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an investment,
the Fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the mean of bid
and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on price
evaluations, from one or more dealers. If any price, quotation, price
evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when the
NAV is calculated, the Fund uses the fair value of the investment
determined in accordance with the procedures described below. There can
be no assurance that the Fund could purchase or sell an investment at
the price used to calculate the Fund's
NAV.Fair Valuation and
Significant Events
ProceduresThe Trustees have
authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the
current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating
the NAV. Factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an
investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, call rights and other potential prepayments,
terms and type, reported transactions, indications as to values from
dealers and general market conditions. Some pricing services provide a
single price evaluation reflecting the bid-side of the market for an
investment (a “bid” evaluation). Other pricing
services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of
a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment (a
“mid” evaluation). The Fund normally uses bid
evaluations for U.S. Treasury and Agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The
Fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixed-income
securities and OTC derivative contracts. In the event that market
quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment,
the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with
procedures adopted by the
Trustees.The Trustees
also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at
its fair value whenever the Adviser determines that a significant event
affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as
of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and
the time as of which the NAV is computed. An event is considered
significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the
investment's value will change in response to the event and a
reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value.
Examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the
principal market on which a security is traded, or after the time of a
price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer,
include:With respect to
price evaluations of fixed-income securities determined before the
close of regular trading on the NYSE, actions by the Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee and other significant trends in U.S.
fixed-income
markets;Political or other
developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer
conducts its operations or its securities are traded;
andAnnouncements concerning matters
such as acquisitions, recapitalizations, litigation developments, a
natural disaster affecting the issuer's operations or regulatory
changes or market developments affecting the issuer's
industry.The Fund may seek
to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative
pricing sources. If a reliable alternative pricing source is not
available, the Fund will determine the fair value of the investment
using another method approved by the
Trustees.Annual

Investment Income, Gains
and Losses, Expenses and
DistributionsInvestment
transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains
and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an
identified-cost basis. Interest income and expenses are accrued daily.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions of net investment income are declared daily and paid
monthly. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are
recorded at fair
value.Premium and
Discount
AmortizationAll premiums and
discounts on fixed-income securities are amortized/accreted for
financial statement
purposes.Federal
TaxesIt is the Fund's policy to comply
with the Subchapter M provision of the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders each year substantially all of its income.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is necessary. As of
and during the year ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did not have a
liability for any uncertain tax positions. The Fund recognizes interest
and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income tax expense
in the Statement of Operations. As of August 31, 2010, tax years
2007 through 2010 remain
subject to examination by the Fund's major tax jurisdictions, which
include the United States of America and the Commonwealth
of
Massachusetts.When-Issued
and Delayed Delivery
TransactionsThe Fund may
engage in when-issued or delayed delivery transactions. The Fund
records when-issued securities on the trade date and maintains security
positions such that sufficient liquid assets will be available to make
payment for the securities purchased. Securities purchased on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis are marked to market daily and
begin earning interest on the settlement date. Losses may occur on
these transactions due to changes in market conditions or the failure
of counterparties to perform under the
contract.OtherThe
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of
assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues reported in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimated.3. Shares of

of August 31, 2010, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as
follows: Undistributed

appreciation$8,693,700 Capital loss carry
forwards and
deferrals$(1,102,146)The
difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized
appreciation/depreciation is attributable to differing treatments for
discount accretion/premium amortization on debt
securities.At
August 31, 2010, the cost of investments for
federal tax purposes was $150,146,772. The net unrealized appreciation
of investments for federal tax purposes was $8,693,700. This consists
of net unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost of $8,745,246 and net unrealized
depreciation from investments for those securities having an excess of
cost over value of
$51,546.At
August 31, 2010, the Fund had a capital loss
carry forward of $1,102,146 which will reduce the Fund's taxable income
arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the
extent permitted by the Code and thus will reduce the amount of
distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to
relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income tax. Pursuant to
the Code, such capital loss carry forward will expire as
follows: Expiration

5. Investment Adviser Fee
and Other Transactions with
AffiliatesInvestment
Adviser
FeeFederated Investment
Management Company is the Fund's investment adviser (the
“Adviser”). The advisory agreement between the Fund
and the Adviser provides for an annual fee equal to 0.40% of the Fund's
average daily net assets. Subject to the terms described in the Expense
Limitation note, the Adviser may voluntarily choose to waive any
portion of its fee. For the year ended August 31, 2010, the Adviser
voluntarily waived $538,833 of its
fee.Administrative
FeeFederated Administrative Services
(FAS), under the Administrative Services Agreement, provides the Fund
with administrative personnel and services. The fee paid to FAS is
based on the average aggregate daily net assets of certain Federated
funds as specified
below: Administrative
FeeAverage Aggregate Daily Net
Assetsof the Federated
Funds0.150%on the first $5 billion
0.125%on the next $5 billion
0.100%on the next $10 billion
0.075%on assets in excess of $20
billionThe
administrative fee received during any fiscal year shall be at least
$150,000 per portfolio and $40,000 per each additional class of Shares.
Subject to the terms described in the Expense Limitation note, FAS may
voluntarily choose to waive any portion of its fee. For the year ended
August 31, 2010, FAS waived $23,371 of its fee. The net fee paid to FAS
was 0.078% of average daily net assets of the
Fund.Shareholder
Services FeeThe
Fund may pay fees (“Service Fees”) up to 0.25% of the
average daily net assets of the Fund's Class A
Shares to financial intermediaries or to Federated Shareholder Services
Company (FSSC) for providing services to shareholders and maintaining
shareholder accounts. Subject to the terms described in the Expense
Limitation note, FSSC may reimburse the Fund for Service Fees. For the
year ended August 31, 2010, FSSC received $2,137 of fees paid by
the
Fund.Interfund
TransactionsDuring the year ended
August 31, 2010, the Fund engaged in purchase and sale transactions
with funds that have a common investment adviser (or affiliated
investment advisers), common Directors/Trustees
and/or common Officers. These purchase and sale
transactions complied with Rule 17a-7 under the Act and amounted to
$40,509,353 and $41,630,000,
respectively.Expense
LimitationThe Adviser and its
affiliates (which may include FAS and FSSC) have voluntarily agreed to
waive their fees and/or reimburse expenses so
that the total annual fund operating expenses (as shown in the
financial highlights) (excluding Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses, if
any) paid by the Fund's Class A Shares (after the
voluntary waivers and reimbursements) will not exceed 0.54% (the
“Fee Limit”) through the later of (the
“Termination Date”): (a) October 31, Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  26
2011; or (b) the date of the Fund's next
effective Prospectus. While the Adviser and its affiliates currently do
not anticipate terminating or increasing these arrangements prior to
the Termination Date, these arrangements may only be terminated or the
Fee Limit increased prior to the Termination date with the agreement of
the
Trustees.GeneralCertain
Officers and Trustees of the Fund are Officers and Directors or
Trustees of the above
companies.6.
Investment
TransactionsPurchases and
sales of investments, excluding long-term U.S.
government securities and short-term obligations, for the
year ended August 31, 2010, were as
follows: Purchases$33,102,930
Sales$44,890,5717.
Concentration of
RiskSince the Fund invests a
substantial portion of its assets in issuers located in one state, it
will be more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of that
state than would be a comparable tax-exempt mutual fund that invests
nationally. In order to reduce the credit risk associated with such
factors, at August 31, 2010, 50.4% of the securities in the Portfolio
of Investments were backed by letters of credit or bond insurance of
various financial institutions and financial guaranty assurance
agencies. The largest percentage of investments insured by or supported
(backed) by a letter of credit from any one institution or agency was
19.2% of total
investments.8. Line
of CreditThe
Fund participates in a $100,000,000 unsecured, uncommitted revolving
line of credit (LOC) agreement with PNC Bank. The LOC was made
available for extraordinary or emergency purposes, primarily for
financing redemption payments. Borrowings are charged interest at a
rate offered to the Fund by PNC Bank at the time of the borrowing. As
of August 31, 2010, there were no outstanding loans. During the year
ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did not utilize the
LOC.9.
Interfund
LendingPursuant to an
Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Fund, along with other funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated
Investors, Inc., may participate in an interfund lending program. This
program provides an alternative credit facility allowing the funds to
borrow from other participating affiliated funds. As of August 31,
2010, there were no outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31,
2010, the program was not
utilized.10.
Legal
ProceedingsSince October
2003, Federated Investors, Inc. and related entities (collectively,
“Federated”), and various Federated sponsored mutual
funds (“Federated Funds”) have been named as
defendants in several class action lawsuits now pending in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were
purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned
and/or redeemed shares of certain Federated Funds
during specified periods beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are
generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal and
improper trading practices including market timing and late trading in
Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  27
concert with certain institutional traders,
which allegedly caused financial injury to the mutual fund
shareholders. Federated without admitting the validity of any claim has
reached a preliminary settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases.
Any settlement would have to be approved by the Court. Federated
entities have also been named as defendants in several additional
lawsuits that are now pending in the United States District Court for
the Western District of Pennsylvania. These lawsuits have been
consolidated into a single action alleging excessive advisory fees
involving one of the Federated Funds. The Board of the Federated Funds
retained the law firm of Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the
Federated Funds in these lawsuits. Federated and the Federated Funds,
and their respective counsel, have been defending this litigation, and
none of the Federated Funds remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits.
Additional lawsuits based upon similar allegations may be filed in the
future. The potential impact of these lawsuits, all of which seek
monetary damages, attorneys' fees and expenses, and future potential
similar suits is uncertain. Although we do not believe that these
lawsuits will have a material adverse effect on the Federated Funds,
there can be no assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity
and/or other developments resulting from the
allegations in these matters will not result in increased redemptions,
or reduced sales, of shares of the Federated Funds or other adverse
consequences for the Federated
Funds.11.
Subsequent
EventsManagement has
evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements
were issued, and determined that no events have occurred that require
additional
disclosure.12. Federal Tax
Information (unaudited)For the year
ended August 31, 2010, 100% of the distributions from net investment
income is exempt from federal income tax, other than the

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm




TO THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF federated municipal securities income trust AND
SHAREHOLDERS OF federated michigan intermediate municipal
TRUST:


We have audited the
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the
portfolio of investments, of Federated Michigan Intermediate Municipal
Trust (the “Fund”), a portfolio of Federated
Municipal Securities Income Trust, as of August 31,
2010, and the related statement of operations for the year
then ended, the statements of changes in net assets for each of the
years in the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights
for each of the years in the five-year period then ended. These
financial statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of
the Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements and financial highlights based on
our audits.


We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements and financial
highlights are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included
confirmation of securities owned as of August 31,
2010, by correspondence with the custodian and brokers or by
other appropriate auditing procedures. An audit also includes assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.


In
our opinion, the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Federated Michigan Intermediate Municipal Trust as of
August 31, 2010, and the results of its
operations for the year then ended, the changes in its net assets for
each of the years in the two-year period then ended, and the financial
highlights for each of the years in the five-year period then ended, in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting
principles.

Evaluation
and Approval of Advisory Contract - May
2010




Federated Michigan Intermediate
Municipal Trust (the
“Fund”)


The
Fund's Board reviewed the Fund's investment advisory contract at
meetings held in May 2010. The Board's decision regarding the contract
reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue
the existing
arrangements.


In this connection,
the Federated funds' Board had previously appointed a Senior Officer,
whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process
by which advisory fees are to be charged to a Federated fund. The
Senior Officer has the authority to retain consultants, experts, or
staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of
his duties, reports directly to the Board, and may be terminated only
with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the
Board. The Senior Officer prepared and furnished to the Board an
independent, written evaluation that covered topics discussed below.
The Board considered that evaluation, along with other information, in
deciding to approve the advisory
contract.


During its
review of the contract, the Board considered compensation and benefits
received by the Adviser. This included the fees received for services
provided to the Fund by other entities in the Federated organization
and research services (if any) received by the Adviser from brokers
that execute Federated fund trades, as well as advisory fees. The Board
is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning
allegedly excessive investment advisory fees, which have indicated that
the following factors may be relevant to an Adviser's fiduciary duty
with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund: the nature and
quality of the services provided by the Adviser, including the
performance of the fund; the Adviser's cost of providing the services;
the extent to which the Adviser may realize “economies of
scale” as a fund grows larger; any indirect benefits that may
accrue to the Adviser and its affiliates as a result of the Adviser's
relationship with a fund; performance and expenses of comparable funds;
and the extent to which the independent Board members are fully
informed about all facts the Board deems relevant bearing on the
Adviser's services and fees. The Board further considered management
fees (including any components thereof) charged to institutional and
other clients of the Adviser for what might be viewed as like services,
and the cost to the Adviser and its affiliates of supplying services
pursuant to the management fee agreements, excluding any
intra-corporate profit and profit margins of the Adviser and its
affiliates for supplying such services. The Board was aware of these
factors and was guided by them in its review of the Fund's advisory
contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and
relevant, as discussed further
below.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

  36
The Board considered
and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated
experience in governing the Fund and working with Federated on matters
relating to the Federated funds, and was assisted in its deliberations
by independent legal counsel. Throughout the year, the Board has
requested and received substantial and detailed information about the
Fund and the Federated organization that was in addition to the
extensive materials that comprise and accompany the Senior Officer's
evaluation. Federated provided much of this information at each regular
meeting of the Board, and furnished additional reports in connection
with the particular meeting at which the Board's formal review of the
advisory contract occurred. Between regularly scheduled meetings, the
Board also received information on particular matters as the need
arose. Thus, the Board's consideration of the advisory contract
included review of the Senior Officer's evaluation, accompanying data
and additional reports covering such matters as: the Adviser's
investment philosophy, revenue, profitability, personnel and processes;
investment and operating strategies; the Fund's short- and long-term
performance (in absolute terms, both on a gross basis and net of
expenses, as well as in relationship to its particular investment
program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds
and/or other benchmarks, as appropriate), and
comments on the reasons for performance; the Fund's investment
objectives; the Fund's expenses (including the advisory fee itself and
the overall expense structure of the Fund, both in absolute terms and
relative to similar and/or competing funds, with
due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations); the use
and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the Fund's
portfolio securities (if any); and the nature, quality and extent of
the advisory and other services provided to the Fund by the Adviser and
its affiliates. The Board also considered the preferences and
expectations of Fund shareholders and their relative sophistication;
the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and
market practices; the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the
mutual fund industry; the Fund's relationship to the Federated family
of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different
investment objectives, policies and strategies which are available for
exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges; compliance
and audit reports concerning the Federated funds and the Federated
companies that service them (including communications from regulatory
agencies), as well as Federated's responses to any issues raised
therein; and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how
the Federated funds and/or Federated are
responding to them. The Board's evaluation process is evolutionary. The
criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change
in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund
marketplace.
With respect to the
Fund's performance and expenses in particular, the Board has found the
use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment
programs to be relevant, given the high degree of competition in the
mutual fund business. The Board focused on comparisons with other
similar Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  37
mutual funds more heavily than non-mutual
fund products or services because it is believed that they are more
relevant. For example, other mutual funds are the products most like
the Fund, they are readily available to Fund shareholders as
alternative investment vehicles, and they are the type of investment
vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the Fund's investors. The
range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally
reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in
the precise marketplace in which the Fund competes. The Fund's ability
to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was
a useful indicator of how the Adviser is executing the Fund's
investment program, which in turn assisted the Board in reaching a
conclusion that the nature, extent, and quality of the Adviser's
investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of
the advisory contract. In this regard, the Senior Officer has reviewed
Federated's fees for providing advisory services to products outside
the Federated family of funds (e.g., institutional and separate
accounts). He concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts
are inherently different products. Those differences include, but are
not limited to, different types of targeted investors; being subject to
different laws and regulations; different legal structures; different
average account sizes; different associated costs; different portfolio
management techniques made necessary by different cash flows; and
portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing. The
Senior Officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative
in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory
contracts.

The Senior Officer
reviewed reports compiled by Federated, using data supplied by
independent fund ranking organizations, regarding the performance of,
and fees charged by, other mutual funds, noting his view that
comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the
reasonableness of proposed
fees.


The Fund's performance fell
below the median of the relevant peer group for the one-year,
three-year and five-year periods covered by the report. The Board
discussed the Fund's performance with the Adviser and recognized the
efforts being undertaken by the Adviser. The Board will continue to
monitor these efforts and the performance of the
Fund.

The Board also
received financial information about Federated, including reports on
the compensation and benefits Federated derived from its relationships
with the Federated funds. These reports covered not only the fees under
the advisory contracts, but also fees received by Federated's
subsidiaries for providing other services to the Federated funds under
separate contracts (e.g., for serving as the Federated funds'
administrator). The reports also discussed any indirect benefit
Federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers
who execute Federated fund trades. In addition, the Board considered
the fact that, in order for a fund to be competitive in the
marketplace, Federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees
and/or Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  38
reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to
fund investors and/or indicated to the Board
their intention to do so in the future, where appropriate. Moreover,
the Board receives regular reports regarding the institution or
elimination of these voluntary
waivers.

Federated
furnished reports, requested by the Senior Officer, that reported
revenues on a fund-by-fund basis and made estimates of the allocation
of expenses on a fund-by-fund basis, using allocation methodologies
specified by the Senior Officer. The Senior Officer noted that,
although they may apply consistent allocation processes, the inherent
difficulties in allocating costs (and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects
of that exercise) and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those
costs may render such allocation reports unreliable. The allocation
reports were considered in the analysis by the Board but were
determined to be of limited
use.


The Board and the Senior
Officer also reviewed a report compiled by Federated comparing
profitability information for Federated to other publicly held fund
management companies. In this regard, the Senior Officer noted the
limited availability of such information, but nonetheless concluded
that Federated's profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the
Board agreed.


The Senior
Officer's evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization
of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger. The
Board considered in this regard that the Adviser has made significant
and long-term investments in areas that support all of the Federated
funds, such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management,
compliance, and risk management functions; and systems technology; and
that the benefits of these efforts (as well as any economies, should
they exist) were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole.
Finally, the Board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory
or industry guidelines on this subject, which (as discussed in the
Senior Officer's evaluation) is compounded by the lack of any common
industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund
advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce
the fee as the fund attains a certain size. The Senior Officer did not
recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing Federated's fund
advisory services at this
time.


It was noted in the materials
for the Board meeting that for the period covered by the report, the
Fund's investment advisory fee, after waivers and expense
reimbursements, if any, was below the median of the relevant peer
group. The Board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the Fund with
the Adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the
Fund remained
competitive.

The Senior Officer's
evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations
contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed
management fees are reasonable, and that Federated appeared to provide
appropriate administrative services to the Fund for the fees paid.
Under these Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  39
circumstances, no changes were recommended
to, and no objection was raised to, the continuation of the Fund's
advisory contract. The Board concluded that the nature, quality and
scope of services provided the Fund by the Adviser and its affiliates
were satisfactory.

In its
decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract, the
Board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the Fund's operations
and various risks, uncertainties and other effects that could occur as
a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract.
In particular, the Board recognized that many shareholders have
invested in the Fund on the strength of the Adviser's industry standing
and reputation and with the expectation that the Adviser will have a
continuing role in providing advisory services to the Fund. Thus, the
Board's approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is
the shareholders who have effectively selected the Adviser by virtue of
having invested in the
Fund.


The Board based its decision
to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances
and relevant factors and with a view to past and future long-term
considerations. Not all of the factors and considerations identified
above were necessarily relevant to the Fund, nor did the Board consider
any one of them to be determinative. With respect to the factors that
were relevant, the Board's decision to approve the contract reflects
its determination that Federated's performance and actions provided a
satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the
existing
arrangements.

Expense Example
(unaudited)


As a shareholder
of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase or redemption
payments; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees
and to the extent applicable, distribution (12b-1) fees
and/or shareholder services fees and other Fund
expenses. This Example is intended to help you to understand your
ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare
these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.
It is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period from March 1,
2010 to August 31,
2010.




ACTUAL
EXPENSES


The first section of the table
below provides information about actual account values and actual
expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with

PURPOSES


The second section of
the table below provides information about hypothetical account values
and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and
an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses,
which is not the Fund's actual return. Thus, you should not
use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual
ending account balance or your expenses for the period. Rather, these
figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the
ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with other funds. To do so,
compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples
that appear in the shareholder reports of the other

Management's
Discussion of Fund Performance
(unaudited)


The Fund's total return,
based on net asset value, for the 12-month reporting period ended
August 31, 2010, was 10.41% for Class
A Shares and 9.58% for Class B Shares.
The total return of the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond New York
Index (“NY Index”),1 a broad-based
securities market index, was 9.63% during the same period. The Fund's
total return for the most recently completed fiscal year reflected
actual cash flows, transaction costs and other expenses, which were not
reflected in the total return of the NY
Index.

The
Fund's investment adviser has elected to change the Fund's broad-based
securities market index to the NY Index from the Barclay's Capital New
York Municipal Bond Index (BCNYMB). The NY Index is more representative
of the securities in which the Fund invests. The NY Index consists of
bonds in the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond Index (“Main
Index”) that have been issued by the state of New York or
local governments or state or local government entities within New
York. The Main Index is a broad, comprehensive, market value-weighted
index composed of approximately 55,000 bond
issues that are exempt from U.S. federal income
taxes or subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Eligibility
criteria for inclusion in the Main Index include, but are not limited
to: the bond issuer must be a state (including the Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico and U.S. territories) or a local
government or a state or local government entity where interest on the
bond is exempt from U.S. federal income taxes or
subject to the AMT; the bond must be held by a mutual fund for which
Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides prices; it must be denominated in
U.S. dollars and have a minimum par amount of
$2 million; and the bond must have a minimum term
to maturity and/or call date greater than or
equal to one calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced monthly. The
total return of the BCNYMB was 9.48% for the 12-month reporting period.
The BCNYMB is an unmanaged market value-weighted index for the
long-term, tax-exempt bond market comprising investment-grade,
tax-exempt and fixed-rate bonds issued in the state of New York. To be
included in the index, bonds must have a minimum credit rating of Baa,
an outstanding par value of at least $7 million
and be issued as part of a transaction of at least $75
million. The bonds must be fixed-rate, have an issue date
after December 31, 1990, and must be at least one
year from their maturity date, as well as have been issued in the
particular state. The BCNYMB includes both zero coupon bonds and bonds
subject to the alternative minimum tax. Neither the NY
Index nor the BCNYMB are adjusted to reflect sales charges,
expenses and other fees that the Securi­ties and Exchange
Commission (SEC) requires to be reflected in the Fund's performance. It
is not possible to invest directly in an
index.

During the reporting
period, the most significant factors affecting the Fund's performance
relative to the NY Index were: (a) the effective duration of its
portfolio (which indicates the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in
interest rates);2,3 (b) the allocation of the Fund's
portfolio among securities of similar issuers (referred to as sectors);
and (c) the credit rating of portfolio securities (which indicates the
risk that the securities may
default).

The following discussion
will focus on the performance of the Fund's Class
A Shares. The 10.41% total return of the Class
A Shares consisted of 4.13% of tax-exempt dividends and 6.28%
appreciation in the net asset value of the
shares.4




MARKET
OVERVIEW


During the 12-month reporting
period ended August 31, 2010, the pace of
recovery in output and employment slowed, with tight credit, modest
income growth and lower housing wealth being major contributors to this
economic environment. Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities fell
noticeably during the period, and Treasury auctions were generally well
received. The pace of economic recovery was more modest than had been
anticipated and inflation remained subdued. To help support economic
recovery, the Federal Reserve Board (the “Fed”) kept
constant its holdings of securities at the current levels by
reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed
securities in longer term Treasury securities and rolling over its
holdings of Treasury debt as it matured. The Fed maintained the target
range for the federal funds rate between 0.00% and 0.25% during the
entire
period.


The state of New
York continued to have a broad and wealthy economy that continued to
attract a highly educated work force. The state of New York's pension
system continued to be well funded, and it continued to have a wealthy
tax base and a long history of raising revenue and adjusting spending
to maintain fiscal solvency. However, the state continued to maintain
an above average debt burden relative to other states due in part to
significant additional issuance for capital spending needs. The state's
economy has been highly cyclical which reflects its dependence on New
York City and the financial services industry. The state fiscal
situation has also been volatile due to its above average dependence on
income taxes and the large recurring expenditure demands from very
generous social service
programs.

Duration
is a measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes
in interest rates than securities with shorter
durations.

Bond
prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in
interest rates can cause a decline in their

The combined fiscal and
monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky
assets. Tax-exempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as
the spread between 20 year BBB-rated and
AAA-rated, tax-exempt municipal bonds declined by 57
basis points during the reporting period. This extensive
normalization of the tax-exempt municipal market from the market
disruptions in 2008 resulted from several
positive technical factors. Significant federal financial support
programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local
economies and boost confidence. The Build America Bonds program reduced
the supply of tax-exempt municipal bonds issued, helping to create a
shortage of tax-exempt bonds available in the market. Ongoing strong
demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very
low, the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual
fund flows led to solid demand for tax-exempt debt. These factors
helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that enabled the
tax-exempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns
during the
period.

The credit
fundamentals of the municipal bond market showed continued
deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding requirements,
real estate values and revenue
growth.




DURATION


As
determined at the end of the 12-month reporting period, the Fund's
dollar-weighted average duration was 5.99 years. Duration management
continued to be a significant component of the Fund's investment
strategy. The shorter a fund's duration relative to an index, the less
its net asset value will react as interest rates change. The Fund
adjusted duration relative to the NY Index several times during the
reporting period. Tax-exempt municipal bond yields declined
significantly during the period as the market stabilized and then
recovered from a near crisis environment to one of improved liquidity,
a near zero federal funds rate and increased investment activity. As a
result, the Fund's duration overweight (110%) relative to the NY Index
resulted in a positive contribution to the Fund's
performance.




SECTOR


During
the 12-month reporting period, relative to the NY Index, the Fund
maintained a higher portfolio allocation to securities issued by public
utilities and industrial development revenue bonds. These allocations
helped the Fund's performance due to the narrowing of credit spreads
within these sectors. The Fund had a higher allocation to pre-refunded
bonds, higher education debt and healthcare than the NY Index. These
sectors underperformed the NY Index during the period and detracted
from performance. Overall the Fund experienced a negative excess return
contribution from its sector
allocations.

CREDIT
QUALITY

Risk-aversion by investors
subsided as the financial markets stabilized and a preference for yield
resulted in the outperformance of bonds rated A and BBB (and unrated
bonds of similar quality) relative to bonds rated in the higher rating
categories (or unrated bonds of similar quality).5 With the
decrease in credit spreads during the period and the narrowing of
credit spreads to a greater extent for A and BBB-rated (or comparable
quality) debt, the Fund's overweight, relative to the NY Index, in
BBB-rated debt during the reporting period minimally helped the Fund's
performance as the yield on BBB-rated debt decreased to a greater
extent than for other investment-grade securities.6 Also,
the Fund's weighting in BB-rated debt relative to NY Index's zero
weighting in that rating category detracted from Fund performance
despite the contraction of credit spreads during the period due to
security
selection.



5
Credit
ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not
protect Fund shares against market
risk.


6
Investment-grade
securities are securities that are rated at least
“BBB” or unrated securities of a comparable quality.
Noninvestment-grade securities are securities that are not rated at
least “BBB” or unrated securities of a comparable
quality. Credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security
will default. They do not protect a security from credit risk.
Lower-rated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate
investors for the increased risk associated with them. Among these
risks are lower creditworthiness, greater price volatility, more risk
to principal and income than with higher-rated securities and increased
possibilities of default.

1.
Organization


Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust (the “Trust”) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “Act”), as an open-end management
investment company. The Trust consists of five portfolios. The
financial statements included herein are only those of Federated New
York Municipal Income Fund (the “Fund”), a
non-diversified portfolio. The financial statements of the other
portfolios are presented separately. The assets of each portfolio are
segregated and a shareholder's interest is limited to the portfolio in
which shares are held. Each portfolio pays its own expenses. The Fund
offers two classes of shares: Class A Shares and
Class B Shares. All shares of the Fund have equal
rights with respect to voting, except on class-specific matters. The
investment objective of the Fund is to provide current income exempt
from federal regular income tax (federal regular income tax does not
include the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT)) and the personal
income taxes imposed by the state of New York and New York
municipalities. Interest income from the Fund's investments may be
subject to the federal AMT for individuals and
corporations.




2. Significant
Accounting
Policies


The following is a
summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles
(GAAP).


Investment
Valuation


In calculating its net asset
value (NAV), the Fund generally values investments as
follows:


Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities greater than
60 days are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees (the
“Trustees”).
Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities of 60
days or less are valued at their cost (adjusted for the
accretion of any discount or amortization of any
premium).
Derivative
contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement
or closing
price.
Over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the
Trustees.
Shares of other
mutual funds are valued based upon their reported
NAVs.


If the Fund cannot
obtain a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an
investment, the Fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the
mean of bid and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on
price evaluations, from one or more dealers. If any price, quotation,
price evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when
the NAV is calculated, the Fund uses the fair value of the investment
determined in accordance with the procedures described below. There can
be no assurance that the Fund could purchase or sell an investment at
the price used to calculate the Fund's
NAV.


Fair Valuation and
Significant Events
Procedures

The Trustees have
authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the
current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating
the NAV. Factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an
investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, call rights and other potential prepayments,
terms and type, reported transactions, indications as to values from
dealers, and general market Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  23
conditions. Some pricing services provide a
single price evaluation reflecting the bid-side of the market for an
investment (a “bid” evaluation). Other pricing
services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of
a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment (a
“mid” evaluation). The Fund normally uses bid
evaluations for U.S. Treasury and Agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The
Fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixed-income
securities and OTC derivative contracts. In the event that market
quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment,
the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with
procedures adopted by the
Trustees.

The Trustees
also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at
its fair value whenever the Adviser determines that a significant event
affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as
of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and
the time as of which the NAV is computed. An event is considered
significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the
investment's value will change in response to the event and a
reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value.
Examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the
principal market on which a security is traded, or after the time of a
price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer,
include:


With respect to
price evaluations of fixed-income securities determined before the
close of regular trading on the NYSE, actions by the Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee and other significant trends in U.S.
fixed-income
markets;
Political or other
developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer
conducts its operations or its securities are traded;
and
Announcements concerning matters
such as acquisitions, recapitalizations, litigation developments, a
natural disaster affecting the issuer's operations or regulatory
changes or market developments affecting the issuer's
industry.


The Fund may seek
to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative
pricing sources. If a reliable alternative pricing source is not
available, the Fund will determine the fair value of the investment
using another method approved by the
Trustees.


Investment Income,
Gains and Losses, Expenses and
Distributions


Investment
transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains
and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an
identified-cost basis. Interest income and expenses are accrued daily.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions of net investment income are declared daily and paid
monthly. Non-cash dividends included in dividend income, if any, are
recorded at fair value. Investment income, realized and unrealized
gains and losses, and certain fund-level expenses are allocated to each
class based on relative average daily net assets, except that each
class may bear certain expenses unique to that class such as
distribution services, shareholder services and account administration
fees. Dividends are declared separately for each class. No class has
preferential dividend rights; differences in per share dividend rates
are generally due to differences in separate class
expenses.


Premium and
Discount
Amortization


All premiums and
discounts on fixed-income securities are amortized/accreted for
financial statement
purposes.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

  24
Federal
Taxes

It is the Fund's policy to comply
with the Subchapter M provision of the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders each year substantially all of its income.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is necessary. As of
and during the year ended August 31, 2010, the
Fund did not have a liability for any uncertain tax positions. The Fund
recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities
as income tax expense in the Statement of Operations. As of
August 31, 2010, tax years 2007
through 2010 remain subject to
examination by the Fund's major tax jurisdictions, which include the
United States of America and the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts.


When-Issued
and Delayed Delivery
Transactions


The Fund may
engage in when-issued or delayed delivery transactions. The Fund
records when-issued securities on the trade date and maintains security
positions such that sufficient liquid assets will be available to make
payment for the securities purchased. Securities purchased on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis are marked to market daily and
begin earning interest on the settlement date. Losses may occur on
these transactions due to changes in market conditions or the failure
of counterparties to perform under the
contract.


Other


The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of
assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues reported in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimated.

  254. Federal
Tax
InformationThe timing and
character of income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
These differences are due to differing treatments for discount
accretion/premium amortization on debt
securities.For the year
ended August 31, 2010, permanent differences
identified and reclassified among the components of net assets were
as
follows: Increase
(Decrease) UndistributedNet

$(848)$848Net
investment income (loss), net realized gains (losses) and net assets
were not affected by this
reclassification.The tax
character of distributions as reported on the Statement of Changes in
Net Assets for the year ended August 31, 2010 and
2009, was as
follows: 20102009Tax-exempt

basis were as
follows: Net
unrealized appreciation$1,740,737
Capital loss carryforwards and
deferrals$(3,453,057)The
difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized
appreciation/depreciation is attributable to differing treatments for
open defaulted securities and discount accretion/premium amortization
on debt
securities.At
August 31, 2010, the cost of investments for
federal tax purposes was $38,633,715. The net unrealized appreciation
of investments for federal tax purposes was $1,740,737. This consists
of net unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost of $1,938,261 and net unrealized
depreciation from investments for those securities having an excess of
cost over value of
$197,524.Annual

At August
31, 2010 the Fund had a capital loss carryforward of
$3,122,218 which will reduce the Fund's taxable income arising from
future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the extent
permitted by the Code and thus will reduce the amount of distributions
to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Fund
of any liability for federal income tax. Pursuant to the Code, such
capital loss carryforward will expire as
follows: Expiration

2018$1,218,820Under
current tax regulations, capital losses on securities transactions
realized after October 31 may be
deferred and treated as occurring on the first day of the following
fiscal year. As of August 31, 2010, for federal income tax purposes,
post-October losses of $330,839 were deferred to September
1, 2010.5. Investment
Adviser Fee and Other Transactions with
AffiliatesInvestment
Adviser
FeeFederated Investment
Management Company is the Fund's investment adviser (the
“Adviser”). The advisory agreement between the Fund
and the Adviser provides for an annual fee equal to 0.40% of the Fund's
average daily net assets. Subject to the terms described in the Expense
Limitation note, the Adviser may voluntarily choose to waive any
portion of its fee and/or reimburse certain
operating expenses of the Fund. For the year ended August 31, 2010, the
Adviser voluntarily waived its entire fee of $162,418 and voluntarily
reimbursed $176,175 of other operating
expenses.Administrative
FeeFederated Administrative Services
(FAS), under the Administrative Services Agreement, provides the Fund
with administrative personnel and services. The fee paid to FAS is
based on the average aggregate daily net assets of certain Federated
funds as specified
below: Administrative
FeeAverage Aggregate Daily Net
Assetsof the Federated
Funds0.150%on the first $5 billion

billionAnnual
Shareholder
Report 
  27The
administrative fee received during any fiscal year shall be at least
$150,000 per portfolio and $40,000 per each additional class of Shares.
Subject to the terms described in the Expense Limitation note, FAS may
voluntarily choose to waive any portion of its fee. For the year ended
August 31, 2010, FAS waived $34,594 of its fee. The net fee paid to FAS
was 0.383% of average daily net assets of the Fund. The Fund is
currently being charged the minimum administrative fee; therefore the
fee as a percentage of average aggregate daily net assets is greater
than the amounts presented in the chart
above.Distribution
Services FeeThe
Fund has adopted a Distribution Plan (the “Plan”)
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act. Under the terms of the Plan, the
Fund will compensate Federated Securities Corp. (FSC), the principal
distributor, from the daily net assets of the Fund's Class
A Shares and Class B Shares to finance
activities intended to result in the sale of these shares. The Plan
provides that the Fund may incur distribution expenses at the following
percentages of average daily net assets annually, to
compensate

receives fees, it may pay some or all of them to financial
intermediaries whose customers purchase shares. For the year ended
August 31, 2010, FSC retained $668 of fees paid by the
Fund.Sales
ChargesFront-end sales charges and
contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC) do not represent expenses of
the Fund. They are deducted from the proceeds of sales of Fund shares
prior to investment or from redemption proceeds prior to remittance, as
applicable. For the year ended August 31, 2010, FSC retained $22,689 in
sales charges from the sale of Class A
Shares.Shareholder
Services FeeThe
Fund may pay fees (“Service Fees”) up to 0.25% of the
average daily net assets of the Fund's Class A
Shares and Class B Shares to financial
intermediaries or to Federated Shareholder Services Company (FSSC) for
providing services to shareholders and maintaining shareholder
accounts. Subject to the terms described in the Expense Limitation
note, FSSC may voluntarily reimburse the Fund for Service Fees. For the
year ended August 31, 2010, FSSC voluntarily reimbursed $2,960 of
Service Fees. For the year ended August 31, 2010, FSSC did not receive
any fees paid by the
Fund.Interfund
TransactionsDuring the year ended
August 31, 2010, the Fund engaged in purchase and sale transactions
with funds that have a common investment adviser (or affiliated
investment advisers), common Directors/Trustees

transactions complied with Rule 17a-7 under the Act and amounted to
$17,350,000 and $15,900,000, respectively.Annual

Expense
LimitationThe Adviser and its
affiliates (which may include FSC, FAS and FSSC) have voluntarily
agreed to waive their fees and/or reimburse
expenses so that the total annual fund operating expenses (as shown in
the financial highlights) paid by the Fund's Class
A Shares and Class B Shares (after the
voluntary waivers and/or reimbursements) will not
exceed 0.76% and 1.52% (the “Fee Limit”),
respectively, through the later of (the “Termination
Date”): (a) October 31, 2011; or (b) the date of the Fund's
next effective Prospectus. While the Adviser and its affiliates
currently do not anticipate terminating or increasing these
arrangements prior to the Termination Date, these arrangements may only
be terminated or the Fee Limit increased prior to the Termination Date
with the agreement of the Fund's
Trustees.GeneralCertain
Officers and Trustees of the Fund are Officers and Directors or
Trustees of the above

Investment
TransactionsPurchases and
sales of investments, excluding long-term U.S.
government securities and short-term obligations, for the
year ended August 31, 2010, were as
follows: Purchases$9,961,076
Sales$12,538,1467.
Concentration of
RiskSince the Fund invests a
substantial portion of its assets in issuers located in one state, it
will be more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of that
state than would be a comparable tax-exempt mutual fund that invests
nationally. In order to reduce the credit risk associated with such
factors, at August 31, 2010, 19.1% of the securities in the portfolio
of investments is backed by letters of credit or bond insurance of
various financial institutions and financial guaranty assurance
agencies. The largest percentage of investments insured by or supported
(“backed”) by a letter of credit from any one
institution or agency was 6.1% of total
investments.8. Line
of CreditThe
Fund participates in a $100,000,000 unsecured, uncommitted revolving
line of credit (LOC) agreement with PNC Bank. The LOC was made
available for extraordinary or emergency purposes, primarily for
financing redemption payments. Borrowings are charged interest at a
rate offered to the Fund by PNC Bank at the time of the borrowing. As
of August 31, 2010, there were no outstanding loans. During the year
ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did not utilize the
LOC.9.
Interfund
LendingPursuant to an
Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Fund, along with other funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated
Investors, Inc., may participate in an interfund lending program. This
program provides an alternative credit facility allowing the funds to
borrow from other participating affiliated funds. As of August 31,
2010, there were no outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31,
2010, the program was not
utilized.Annual

10. Legal
ProceedingsSince October
2003, Federated Investors, Inc. and related entities (collectively,
“Federated”), and various Federated sponsored mutual
funds (“Federated Funds”) have been named as
defendants in several class action lawsuits now pending in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were
purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned
and/or redeemed shares of certain Federated Funds
during specified periods beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are
generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal and
improper trading practices including market timing and late trading in
concert with certain institutional traders, which allegedly caused
financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders. Federated without
admitting the validity of any claim has reached a preliminary
settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases. Any settlement would
have to be approved by the Court. Federated entities have also been
named as defendants in several additional lawsuits that are now pending
in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania. These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single
action alleging excessive advisory fees involving one of the Federated
Funds. The Board of the Federated Funds retained the law firm of
Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the Federated Funds in these
lawsuits. Federated and the Federated Funds, and their respective
counsel, have been defending this litigation, and none of the Federated
Funds remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits. Additional lawsuits
based upon similar allegations may be filed in the future. The
potential impact of these lawsuits, all of which seek monetary damages,
attorneys' fees and expenses, and future potential similar suits is
uncertain. Although we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a
material adverse effect on the Federated Funds, there can be no
assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity
and/or other developments resulting from the
allegations in these matters will not result in increased redemptions,
or reduced sales, of shares of the Federated Funds or other adverse
consequences for the Federated
Funds.11.
Subsequent
EventsManagement has
evaluated subsequent events through the date the financial statements
were issued, and determined that no events have occurred that require
additional
disclosure.12. Federal Tax
Information (unaudited)For the fiscal

TO THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF federated municipal securities income trust AND
SHAREHOLDERS OF federated New york Municipal income
fund:


We have audited the
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the
portfolio of investments, of Federated New York Municipal Income Fund
(the “Fund”), a portfolio of Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust, as of August 31, 2010,
and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the
statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the years in the five-year period then ended. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.


We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as
of August 31, 2010 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the
financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Federated
New York Municipal Income Fund as of August 31,
2010, and the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Evaluation
and Approval of Advisory Contract - May
2010




Federated New York Municipal
Income Fund (the
“Fund”)


The
Fund's Board reviewed the Fund's investment advisory contract at
meetings held in May 2010. The Board's decision regarding the contract
reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue
the existing
arrangements.


In this connection,
the Federated funds' Board had previously appointed a Senior Officer,
whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process
by which advisory fees are to be charged to a Federated fund. The
Senior Officer has the authority to retain consultants, experts, or
staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of
his duties, reports directly to the Board, and may be terminated only
with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the
Board. The Senior Officer prepared and furnished to the Board an
independent, written evaluation that covered topics discussed below.
The Board considered that evaluation, along with other information, in
deciding to approve the advisory
contract.


During its
review of the contract, the Board considered compensation and benefits
received by the Adviser. This included the fees received for services
provided to the Fund by other entities in the Federated organization
and research services (if any) received by the Adviser from brokers
that execute Federated fund trades, as well as advisory fees. The Board
is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning
allegedly excessive investment advisory fees, which have indicated that
the following factors may be relevant to an Adviser's fiduciary duty
with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund: the nature and
quality of the services provided by the Adviser, including the
performance of the fund; the Adviser's cost of providing the services;
the extent to which the Adviser may realize “economies of
scale” as a fund grows larger; any indirect benefits that may
accrue to the Adviser and its affiliates as a result of the Adviser's
relationship with a fund; performance and expenses of comparable funds;
and the extent to which the independent Board members are fully
informed about all facts the Board deems relevant bearing on the
Adviser's services and fees. The Board further considered management
fees (including any components thereof) charged to institutional and
other clients of the Adviser for what might be viewed as like services,
and the cost to the Adviser and its affiliates of supplying services
pursuant to the management fee agreements, excluding any
intra-corporate profit and profit margins of the Adviser and its
affiliates for supplying such services. The Board was aware of these
factors and was guided by them in its review of the Fund's advisory
contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and
relevant, as discussed further
below.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

The Board considered
and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated
experience in governing the Fund and working with Federated on matters
relating to the Federated funds, and was assisted in its deliberations
by independent legal counsel. Throughout the year, the Board has
requested and received substantial and detailed information about the
Fund and the Federated organization that was in addition to the
extensive materials that comprise and accompany the Senior Officer's
evaluation. Federated provided much of this information at each regular
meeting of the Board, and furnished additional reports in connection
with the particular meeting at which the Board's formal review of the
advisory contract occurred. Between regularly scheduled meetings, the
Board also received information on particular matters as the need
arose. Thus, the Board's consideration of the advisory contract
included review of the Senior Officer's evaluation, accompanying data
and additional reports covering such matters as: the Adviser's
investment philosophy, revenue, profitability, personnel and processes;
investment and operating strategies; the Fund's short- and long-term
performance (in absolute terms, both on a gross basis and net of
expenses, as well as in relationship to its particular investment
program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds
and/or other benchmarks, as appropriate), and
comments on the reasons for performance; the Fund's investment
objectives; the Fund's expenses (including the advisory fee itself and
the overall expense structure of the Fund, both in absolute terms and
relative to similar and/or competing funds, with
due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations); the use
and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the Fund's
portfolio securities (if any); and the nature, quality and extent of
the advisory and other services provided to the Fund by the Adviser and
its affiliates. The Board also considered the preferences and
expectations of Fund shareholders and their relative sophistication;
the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and
market practices; the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the
mutual fund industry; the Fund's relationship to the Federated family
of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different
investment objectives, policies and strategies which are available for
exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges; compliance
and audit reports concerning the Federated funds and the Federated
companies that service them (including communications from regulatory
agencies), as well as Federated's responses to any issues raised
therein; and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how
the Federated funds and/or Federated are
responding to them. The Board's evaluation process is evolutionary. The
criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change
in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund
marketplace.
With respect to the
Fund's performance and expenses in particular, the Board has found the
use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment
programs to be relevant, given the high degree of competition in the
mutual fund business. The Board focused on comparisons with other
similar Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  38
mutual funds more heavily than non-mutual
fund products or services because it is believed that they are more
relevant. For example, other mutual funds are the products most like
the Fund, they are readily available to Fund shareholders as
alternative investment vehicles, and they are the type of investment
vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the Fund's investors. The
range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally
reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in
the precise marketplace in which the Fund competes. The Fund's ability
to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was
a useful indicator of how the Adviser is executing the Fund's
investment program, which in turn assisted the Board in reaching a
conclusion that the nature, extent, and quality of the Adviser's
investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of
the advisory contract. In this regard, the Senior Officer has reviewed
Federated's fees for providing advisory services to products outside
the Federated family of funds (e.g., institutional and separate
accounts). He concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts
are inherently different products. Those differences include, but are
not limited to, different types of targeted investors; being subject to
different laws and regulations; different legal structures; different
average account sizes; different associated costs; different portfolio
management techniques made necessary by different cash flows; and
portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing. The
Senior Officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative
in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory
contracts.

The Senior Officer
reviewed reports compiled by Federated, using data supplied by
independent fund ranking organizations, regarding the performance of,
and fees charged by, other mutual funds, noting his view that
comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the
reasonableness of proposed
fees.


For the periods covered by the
report, the Fund's performance for the one-year period was above the
median of the relevant peer group, and the Fund's performance fell
below the median of the relevant peer group for the three-year and
five-year periods. The Board discussed the Fund's performance with the
Adviser and recognized the efforts being undertaken by the Adviser. The
Board will continue to monitor these efforts and the performance of
the Fund.

The Board also
received financial information about Federated, including reports on
the compensation and benefits Federated derived from its relationships
with the Federated funds. These reports covered not only the fees under
the advisory contracts, but also fees received by Federated's
subsidiaries for providing other services to the Federated funds under
separate contracts (e.g., for serving as the Federated funds'
administrator). The reports also discussed any indirect benefit
Federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers
who execute Federated fund trades. In addition, the Board considered
the fact that, in order for a fund to be competitive in the
marketplace, Federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees
and/or Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  39
reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to
fund investors and/or indicated to the Board
their intention to do so in the future, where appropriate. Moreover,
the Board receives regular reports regarding the institution or
elimination of these voluntary
waivers.

Federated
furnished reports, requested by the Senior Officer, that reported
revenues on a fund-by-fund basis and made estimates of the allocation
of expenses on a fund-by-fund basis, using allocation methodologies
specified by the Senior Officer. The Senior Officer noted that,
although they may apply consistent allocation processes, the inherent
difficulties in allocating costs (and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects
of that exercise) and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those
costs may render such allocation reports unreliable. The allocation
reports were considered in the analysis by the Board but were
determined to be of limited
use.


The Board and the Senior
Officer also reviewed a report compiled by Federated comparing
profitability information for Federated to other publicly held fund
management companies. In this regard, the Senior Officer noted the
limited availability of such information, but nonetheless concluded
that Federated's profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the
Board agreed.


The Senior
Officer's evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization
of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger. The
Board considered in this regard that the Adviser has made significant
and long-term investments in areas that support all of the Federated
funds, such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management,
compliance, and risk management functions; and systems technology; and
that the benefits of these efforts (as well as any economies, should
they exist) were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole.
Finally, the Board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory
or industry guidelines on this subject, which (as discussed in the
Senior Officer's evaluation) is compounded by the lack of any common
industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund
advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce
the fee as the fund attains a certain size. The Senior Officer did not
recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing Federated's fund
advisory services at this
time.


It was noted in the materials
for the Board meeting that for the period covered by the report, the
Fund's investment advisory fee was waived in its entirety. The Board
reviewed the contractual fee rate and other expenses of the Fund with
the Adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the
Fund remained
competitive.

The Senior Officer's
evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations
contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed
management fees are reasonable, and that Federated appeared to provide
appropriate administrative services to the Fund for the fees paid.
Under these Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  40
circumstances, no changes were recommended
to, and no objection was raised to, the continuation of the Fund's
advisory contract. The Board concluded that the nature, quality and
scope of services provided the Fund by the Adviser and its affiliates
were satisfactory.

In its
decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract, the
Board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the Fund's operations
and various risks, uncertainties and other effects that could occur as
a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract.
In particular, the Board recognized that many shareholders have
invested in the Fund on the strength of the Adviser's industry standing
and reputation and with the expectation that the Adviser will have a
continuing role in providing advisory services to the Fund. Thus, the
Board's approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is
the shareholders who have effectively selected the Adviser by virtue of
having invested in the
Fund.


The Board based its decision
to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances
and relevant factors and with a view to past and future long-term
considerations. Not all of the factors and considerations identified
above were necessarily relevant to the Fund, nor did the Board consider
any one of them to be determinative. With respect to the factors that
were relevant, the Board's decision to approve the contract reflects
its determination that Federated's performance and actions provided a
satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the
existing
arrangements.

Shareholder
Expense Example
(unaudited)


As a shareholder
of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase or redemption
payments; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees
and to the extent applicable, distribution (12b-1) fees
and/or shareholder services fees and other Fund
expenses. This Example is intended to help you to understand your
ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare
these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.
It is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period from March 1,
2010 to August 31,
2010.




ACTUAL
EXPENSES


The first section of the table
below provides information about actual account values and actual
expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with
the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you
incurred over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000
(for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then
multiply the result by the number in the first section under the
heading entitled “Expenses Paid During Period” to
estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during
this
period.




HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE
FOR COMPARISON
PURPOSES


The second section of
the table below provides information about hypothetical account values
and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and
an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses,
which is not the Fund's actual return. Thus, you should not
use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual
ending account balance or your expenses for the period. Rather, these
figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the
ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with other funds. To do so,
compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples
that appear in the shareholder reports of the other
funds.

Management's
Discussion of Fund Performance
(unaudited)


The Fund's total return,
based on net asset value, for the 12-month reporting period ended
August 31, 2010, was 8.34% for Class
A Shares and 8.18% for Class F Shares.
The total return of the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond Ohio Index
(OH Index),1 was 8.97%, during the same period. The Fund's
total return for the most recently completed fiscal year end reflected
actual cash flows, transaction costs and other expenses, which were not
reflected in the total return of the OH
Index.


During the
reporting period, the most significant factors affecting the Fund's
performance relative to the OH Index were: (a) the effective duration
of its portfolio (which indicates the portfolio's sensitivity to
changes in interest rates);2,3 (b) the allocation of the
Fund's portfolio among securities of similar issuers (referred to as
sectors); and (c) the credit ratings of portfolio securities (which
indicates the risk that securities will
default).





1
The
Fund's investment adviser has elected to change the Fund's broad-based
securities market index to the OH Index from the Barclays Capital Ohio
Municipal Bond Index (BCOHMB). The OH Index is more representative of
the securities in which the Fund invests. The OH Index consists of
bonds in the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond
Index (Main Index) that have been issued by the state of Ohio or local
governments or state or local government entities within Ohio. The Main
Index is a broad, comprehensive, market value-weighted index composed
of approximately 55,000 bond issues that are
exempt from U.S. federal income taxes or subject
to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Eligibility criteria for
inclusion in the Main Index include, but are not limited to: the bond
issuer must be a state (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and
U.S. territories) or a local government or agency
where interest on the bond is exempt from U.S.
federal income taxes or subject to the AMT; the bond must be
held by a mutual fund for which Standard &
Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides
prices; it must be denominated in U.S. dollars
and have a minimum par amount of $2 million; and
the bond must have a minimum term to maturity
and/or call date greater than or equal to one
calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced monthly. The total return
of the BCOHMB during the 12-month reporting period was 8.89%. The
BCOHMB is an unmanaged market value-weighted index for the long-term,
tax-exempt bond market comprising investment-grade, tax-exempt and
fixed-rate bonds issued in the state of Ohio. To be included in the
index, bonds must have a minimum credit rating of Baa, an outstanding
par value of at least $7 million and be issued as
part of a transaction of at least $75 million.
The bonds must be fixed-rate, have an issue date after
December 31, 1990, and must be at least one year
from their maturity date, as well as have been issued in the particular
state. The BCOHMB includes both zero coupon bonds and bonds subject to
the alternative minimum tax. Neither the OH Index nor the BCOHMB are
not adjusted to reflect sales charges, expenses and other fees that the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires to be reflected in
the Fund's performance. It is not possible to invest directly in
an
index.

Duration
is a measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Securities with longer durations are more sensitive to changes
in interest rates than securities with shorter durations. For purposes
of this Management's Discussion of Fund Performance, duration is
determined using a third-party
analytical
system.

The
following discussion focuses on the performance of the Fund's
Class A Shares. The 8.34% total return of the
Class A Shares for the reporting period consisted
of 4.03% of tax-exempt dividends and reinvestments and 4.31% of price
appreciation in the net asset value of the
shares.4




MARKET
OVERVIEW


During the 12-month reporting
period, the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight
credit, modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major
contributors to the economic environment. Yields on nominal Treasury
coupon securities fell noticeably during the period, and Treasury
auctions were generally well received. The pace of economic recovery
was more modest in the near term than had been anticipated and
inflation remained subdued. To help support economic recovery the
Federal Reserve Board (the ”Fed”) kept constant its
holdings of securities at the current levels by reinvesting principal
payments from agency debt and mortgage-backed securities in longer-term
Treasury securities, and rolling over its holdings of Treasury debt as
it matured. The Fed maintained the target range for the federal funds
rate between 0.00% and 0.025% during the entire
period.


The state of Ohio
has a history of strong financial management that, spanning several
decades, has been tested by economic underperformance relative to the
rest of the country. The state has addressed budget shortfalls promptly
and has made an effort to build financial reserves. However, Ohio's
economy remained weak due to its heavy reliance on the manufacturing
industry and relied on federal stimulus funding and other non-recurring
measures to balance its fiscal operations. The deterioration in
manufacturing employment impacted the state's already weak demographics
as unemployed workers migrated to other states. Ohio maintained a
moderate debt burden relative to other states but had significant
erosion in the funded portion of its public employee's
pension
liabilities.


The combined
fiscal and monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the
valuation of risky assets. Tax-Exempt municipal credit spreads declined
significantly as the spread between 20-year BBB-rated and AAA-rated
tax-exempt municipal bonds declined by 57 basis
points during the reporting period. This extensive normalization of the
tax-exempt municipal market from the market disruptions in
2008, resulted from several positive technical
factors. Significant federal financial support programs for state
governments were put in place to stimulate local economies and boost
confidence. The Build America Bonds program reduced the supply of
tax-exempt municipal bonds issued, helping to create a shortage of
tax-exempt bonds available in the market. Ongoing strong demand for
yield from investors as money market rates remained very low, the
expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual fund flows
led to solid demand for tax-exempt debt. These factors helped to create
the supply and demand imbalance that has enabled the tax-exempt
municipal market to recover and provide positive returns during
the
period.

The
credit fundamentals of the tax-exempt municipal bond market have shown
continued deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding
requirements, real estate values and revenue
growth.




Duration


As
determined at the end of the 12-month reporting period, the Fund's
dollar-weighted average duration was 5.60 years. Duration management
continued to be a significant component of the Fund's investment
strategy. The shorter a fund's duration relative to an index, the less
its net asset value will react as interest rates change. The Fund's
duration was consistently shorter than the OH Index during the
reporting period. Tax-exempt municipal bond yields declined
significantly during the period as the market stabilized and then
recovered from a near crisis environment to one of improved liquidity,
a near zero federal funds target rate and increased investment
activity. As a result, the Fund's duration underweight (85%) relative
to the OH Index detracted from Fund
performance.




SECTOR


During
the 12-month reporting period, relative to the OH Index the Fund
maintained a higher portfolio allocation to securities issued by
single- and multi-family housing issuers, public power authorities and
life care providers. These allocations helped the Fund's performance
due to the narrowing of credit spreads within these sectors. The Fund
also had a lesser allocation, compared to the OH
Index, to tobacco-related debt which underperformed during
the period and had a large positive contribution to performance. The
Fund maintained an underweight in hospitals relative to the OH Index.
This sector outperformed the OH Index during the period and detracted
from performance. The Fund gained positive excess return from its
sector selection during the
period.




Credit
Quality


Risk-aversion by investors
subsided as the financial markets stabilized and a preference for yield
resulted in the outperformance of bonds rated A and BBB (and unrated
bonds of similar quality)5 relative to bonds rated in the
higher rating categories (or unrated bonds of similar quality). With
the decrease in credit spreads during the period and the narrowing of
credit spreads to a greater extent for A and BBB-rated (or comparable
quality) debt, the Fund's overweight, relative to the OH
Index, in A and BBB-rated debt during the reporting period
helped the Fund's performance as the yield on A and BBB-rated debt
decreased to a greater extent than for other
investment-grade
securities.

protect fund shares against market risk. Investment-grade securities
are securities that are rated at least “BBB” or
unrated securities of a comparable quality. Noninvestment-grade
securities are securities that are not rated at least
“BBB” or unrated securities of a comparable quality.
Credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security will
default. They do not protect a security from credit risk. Lower-rated
bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate investors for
the increased risk associated with them. Among these risks are lower
credit worthiness, greater price volatility, more risk to principal and
income than with higher-rated securities and increased possibilities of
default.

hypothetical investment of $10,000 in the Fund after deducting the
maximum sales charge of 4.50% ($10,000 investment minus $450 sales
charge = $9,550). The Fund's performance assumes the reinvestment of
all dividends and distributions. The OH Index, BCOHMB, OHIG Index and
MSTARMOH have been adjusted to reflect reinvestment of dividends on
securities in the index and
average.2The
Fund's investment adviser has elected to change the Fund's broad-based
securities market index to the OH Index from the Barclay's Capital Ohio
Municipal Bond Index (BCOHMB). The OH Index is more representative of
the securities in which the Fund invests. The OH Index consists of
bonds in the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond
Index (Main Index) that have been issued by the state of Ohio or local
governments or state or local government entities within Ohio. The Main
Index is a broad, comprehensive, market value-weighted index composed
of approximately 55,000 bond issues that are exempt from
U.S. federal income taxes or subject to the
alternative minimum tax (AMT). Eligibility criteria for inclusion in
the Main Index include, but are not limited to: the bond issuer must be
a state (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and U.S.
territories) or local government or a state or local
government entity where interest on the bond is exempt from
U.S. federal income taxes or subject to the AMT;
the bond must be held by a mutual fund for which
Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides prices; it must be denominated in
U.S. dollars and have a minimum par amount of $2
million; and the bond must have a minimum term to maturity
and/or call date greater than or equal to one
calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced monthly. The BCOHMB is an
unmanaged market value-weighted index for the long-term, tax-exempt
bond market comprising investment-grade, tax-exempt and fixed-rate
bonds issued in the state of Ohio. To be included in the index, bonds
must have a minimum credit rating of Baa, an outstanding par value of
at least $7 million and be issued as part of a transaction of at least
$75 million. The bonds must be fixed-rate, have an issue date after
December 31, 1990, and must be at least one year from their maturity
date, as well as have been issued in the particular state. The BCOHMB
includes both zero coupon bonds and bonds subject to the alternative
minimum tax. The OHIG Index represents the portion of the OH Index
composed solely of bonds that are rated BBB-/Baa3 or higher with
remaining maturities of more than three years while limiting tobacco
bonds to 2%, by market weighting, of the sub-index. Neither the OH
Index, BCOHMB nor the OHIG Index are adjusted to reflect sales charges,
expenses and other fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) requires to be reflected in the Fund's performance. The OH Index,
BCOHMB and OHIG Index are unmanaged and, unlike the Fund, are not
affected by cash flows. It is not possible to invest directly in an
index. Morningstar figures represent the average of the total returns
reported by all the mutual funds designated by Morningstar as falling
into the respective category indicated. Funds designated within the
MSTARMOH include those that invest at least 80% of assets in Ohio
municipal debt and can include long-, intermediate- and short-duration
portfolios. They do not reflect sales
charges.3Total

charges.Annual

1.
Organization


Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust (the “Trust”) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “Act”), as an open-end management
investment company. The Trust consists of five portfolios. The
financial statements included herein are only those of the Federated
Ohio Municipal Income Fund (the “Fund”), a
non-diversified portfolio. The financial statements of the other
portfolios are presented separately. The assets of each portfolio are
segregated and a shareholder's interest is limited to the portfolio in
which shares are held. Each portfolio pays its own expenses. The Fund
offers two classes of shares: Class A Shares and
Class F Shares. All shares of the Fund have equal
rights with respect to voting, except on class-specific matters. The
investment objective of the Fund is to provide current income exempt
from federal regular income tax (federal regular income tax does not
include the federal AMT) and the personal income taxes imposed by the
state of Ohio and Ohio municipalities. Interest income from the Fund's
investments may be subject to the federal AMT for individuals
and
corporations.


Effective
November 18, 2008, the Fund began offering Class
A Shares.


On
November 21, 2008, the Fund received assets from
Fifth Third Ohio Municipal Bond Fund as the result of a tax-free
reorganization, as
follows:

Accounting
PoliciesThe following is a
summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles
(GAAP).Investment
ValuationIn calculating its net asset
value (NAV), the Fund generally values investments as
follows:Fixed-income
securities acquired with maturities greater than
60 days are fair valued using
price evaluations provided by a pricing service approved by
the Board of Trustees (the
“Trustees”).Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities of
60 days or less are valued at their cost
(adjusted for the accretion of any discount or amortization of
any
premium).Derivative
contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement
or closing
price.Over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the
Trustees.Shares of other
mutual funds are valued based upon their reported
NAVs.Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  24
If the Fund cannot obtain
a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an investment,
the Fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the mean of bid
and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on price
evaluations, from one or more dealers. If any price, quotation, price
evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when the
NAV is calculated, the Fund uses the fair value of the investment
determined in accordance with the procedures described below. There can
be no assurance that the Fund could purchase or sell an investment at
the price used to calculate the Fund's
NAV.Fair Valuation and
Significant Events
ProceduresThe Trustees have
authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the
current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating
the NAV. Factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an
investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, call rights and other potential prepayments,
terms and type, reported transactions, indications as to values from
dealers and general market conditions. Some pricing services provide a
single price evaluation reflecting the bid-side of the market for an
investment (a “bid” evaluation). Other pricing
services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of
a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment (a
“mid” evaluation). The Fund normally uses bid
evaluations for U.S. Treasury and Agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The
Fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixed-income
securities and OTC derivative contracts. In the event that market
quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment,
the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with
procedures adopted by the
Trustees.The Trustees
also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at
its fair value whenever the Adviser determines that a significant event
affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as
of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and
the time as of which the NAV is computed. An event is considered
significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the
investment's value will change in response to the event and a
reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value.
Examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the
principal market on which a security is traded, or after the time of a
price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer,
include:With respect to
price evaluations of fixed-income securities determined before the
close of regular trading on the NYSE, actions by the Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee and other significant trends in U.S.
fixed-income
markets;Political or other
developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer
conducts its operations or its securities are traded;
andAnnouncements concerning matters
such as acquisitions, recapitalizations, litigation developments, a
natural disaster affecting the issuer's operations or regulatory
changes or market developments affecting the issuer's
industry.The Fund may seek
to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative
pricing sources. If a reliable alternative pricing source is not
available, the Fund will determine the fair value of the investment
using another method approved by the
Trustees.Investment Income,
Gains and Losses, Expenses and
DistributionsInvestment
transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains
and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an identified
cost basis. Interest income and expenses are accrued daily.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions of net investment income are declared and paid monthly.
Non-cash Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  25
dividends included in dividend income, if
any, are recorded at fair value. Investment income, realized and
unrealized gains and losses, and certain fund-level expenses are
allocated to each class based on relative average daily net assets,
except that each class may bear certain expenses unique to that class
such as account administration, distribution services and shareholder
services fees. Dividends are declared separately for each class. No
class has preferential dividend rights; differences in per share
dividend rates are generally due to differences in separate
class
expenses.Premium and
Discount
AmortizationAll premiums and
discounts on fixed-income securities are amortized/accreted for
financial statement
purposes.Federal
TaxesIt is the Fund's policy to comply
with the Subchapter M provision of the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders each year substantially all of its income.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is necessary. As of
and during the year ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did not have a
liability for any uncertain tax positions. The Fund recognizes interest
and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income tax expense
in the Statement of Operations. As of August 31, 2010, tax years
2007 through 2010 remain
subject to examination by the Fund's major tax jurisdictions, which
include the United States of America and the Commonwealth
of
Massachusetts.When-Issued
and Delayed Delivery
TransactionsThe Fund may
engage in when-issued or delayed delivery transactions. The Fund
records when-issued securities on the trade date and maintains security
positions such that sufficient liquid assets will be available to make
payment for the securities purchased. Securities purchased on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis are marked to market daily and
begin earning interest on the settlement date. Losses may occur on
these transactions due to changes in market conditions or the failure
of counterparties to perform under the
contract.Restricted
SecuritiesThe Fund may purchase
securities which are considered restricted. Restricted securities are
securities that either: (a) cannot be offered for public sale without
first being registered, or being able to take advantage of an exemption
from registration, under the Securities Act of 1933; or (b) are subject
to contractual restrictions on public sales. In some cases, when a
security cannot be offered for public sale without first being
registered, the issuer of the restricted security has agreed to
register such securities for resale, at the issuer's expense, either
upon demand by the Fund or in connection with another registered
offering of the securities. Many such restricted securities may be
resold in the secondary market in transactions exempt from
registration. Restricted securities may be determined to be liquid
under criteria established by the Trustees. The Fund will not incur any
registration costs upon such resales. The Fund's restricted securities
are valued at the price provided by dealers in the secondary market or,
if no market prices are available, at the fair value as determined in
accordance with procedures established by and under the general
supervision of the
Trustees.OtherThe
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of
assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues reported in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimated.Annual

Tax
InformationThe timing and
character of income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
These differences are due in part to differing treatments for
expiration of capital loss carryforwards and discount accretion/premium
amortization on debt
securities.For the year
ended August 31, 2010, permanent differences
identified and reclassified among the components of net assets were
as

and 2009, was as
follows: 20102009Ordinary
income$36$ —  Tax-exempt
income$6,865,502$6,719,497As
of August 31, 2010, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as

Capital loss
carryforwards$(2,893,194)At
August 31, 2010, the cost of investments for
federal tax purposes was $182,612,565. The net unrealized appreciation
of investments for federal tax purposes was $9,715,916. This consists
of net unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost of $10,869,762, and net unrealized
depreciation from investments for those securities having an excess of
cost over value of
$1,153,846.At
August 31, 2010, the Fund had a capital loss
carryforward of $2,893,194 which will reduce the Fund's taxable income
arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any, to the
extent permitted by the Code and thus will reduce the amount of
distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to
relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income tax. Pursuant to
the Code, such capital loss carryforward will expire as

fee received during any fiscal year shall be at least $150,000 per
portfolio and $40,000 per each additional class of Shares. Subject to
the terms described in the Expense Limitation note, FAS may voluntarily

2010, the net fee paid to FAS was 0.084% of average daily net assets of
the Fund. FAS waived $33,139 of its
fee.Distribution
Services FeeThe
Fund has adopted a Distribution Plan (the “Plan”)
pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Act. Under the terms of the Plan, the
Fund will compensate Federated Securities Corp. (FSC), the principal
distributor, from the daily net assets of the Fund's Class
A Shares and Class F Shares to finance
activities intended to result in the sale of these shares. The Plan
provides that the Fund may incur distribution expenses at the following
percentage of average daily net assets, annually, to
compensate
FSC. Share

receives fees, it may pay some or all of them to financial
intermediaries whose customers purchase shares. For the year ended

the year ended August 31, 2010, the Fund's Class
A Shares did not incur a distribution services fee; however
it may begin to incur this fee upon approval of the
Trustees.Sales
ChargesFront-end sales charges and
contingent deferred sales charges (CDSC) do not represent expenses of
the Fund. They are deducted from the proceeds of sales of Fund shares
prior to investment or from redemptions proceeds prior to remittance,
as applicable. For the year ended August 31, 2010, FSC retained $44,089

providing services to shareholders and maintaining shareholder
accounts. Subject to the terms described in the Expense Limitation
note, FSSC may voluntarily reimburse the Fund for Service Fees. For the
year ended August 31, 2010, FSSC received $1,478 of fees paid by
the
Fund.Interfund
TransactionsDuring the year ended
August 31, 2010, the Fund engaged in purchase and sale transactions
with funds that have a common investment adviser (or affiliated
investment advisers), common Directors/Trustees,
and/or common Officers. These purchase and sale
transactions complied with Rule 17a-7 under the Act and amounted to
$55,835,000 and $52,635,000,
respectively.Expense
LimitationThe Adviser and its
affiliates (which may include FSC, FAS and FSSC) have voluntarily
agreed to waive their fees and/or reimburse
expenses so that the total operating expenses (as shown in the
financial highlights) paid by the Fund's Class A
Shares and Class F Shares (after the voluntary
waivers and reimbursements) will not exceed 0.75% and 0.90%, (the
“Fee Limit”), respectively, through the later of (the
“Termination Date”): (a) October 31, 2011; or (b) the
date of the Fund's next effective Prospectus. While the Adviser and its
affiliates currently do not anticipate terminating or increasing these
arrangements prior to the Termination Date, these arrangements may only
be terminated or the Fee Limit increased prior to the Termination Date
with the agreement of the
Trustees.GeneralCertain
Officers and Trustees of the Fund are Officers and Directors or
Trustees of the above

Investment
TransactionsPurchases and
sales of investments, excluding long-term U.S.
government securities and short-term obligations, for the
year ended August 31, 2010, were as
follows: Purchases$36,221,551
Sales$36,347,6157.
Concentration of
RiskSince the Fund invests a
substantial portion of its assets in issuers located in one state, it
will be more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of that
state than would be a comparable tax-exempt mutual fund that invests
nationally. In order to reduce the credit risk associated with such
factors, at August 31, 2010, 35.0% of the securities in the portfolio
of investments is backed by letters of credit or bond insurance of
various financial institutions and financial guaranty assurance
agencies. The largest percentage of investments insured by or supported
(backed) by a letter of credit from any one institution or agency was
8.6% of total
investments.Annual

8. Line of
CreditThe Fund participates
in a $100,000,000 unsecured, uncommitted revolving line of credit (LOC)
agreement with PNC Bank. The LOC was made available for extraordinary
or emergency purposes, primarily for financing redemption payments.
Borrowings are charged interest at a rate offered to the Fund by PNC
Bank at the time of the borrowing. As of August 31, 2010, there were no
outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did
not utilize the
LOC.9.
Interfund
LEnDingPursuant to an
Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
the Fund, along with other funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated
Investors, Inc., may participate in an interfund lending program. This
program provides an alternative credit facility allowing the funds to
borrow from other participating affiliated funds. As of August 31,
2010, there were no outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31,
2010, the program was not
utilized.10.
Legal
ProceedingsSince October
2003, Federated Investors, Inc. and related entities (collectively,
“Federated”), and various Federated sponsored mutual
funds (“Federated Funds”) have been named as
defendants in several class action lawsuits now pending in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were
purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned
and/or redeemed shares of certain Federated Funds
during specified periods beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are
generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal and
improper trading practices including market timing and late trading in
concert with certain institutional traders, which allegedly caused
financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders. Federated without
admitting the validity of any claim has reached a preliminary
settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases. Any settlement would
have to be approved by the Court. Federated entities have also been
named as defendants in several additional lawsuits that are now pending
in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania. These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single
action alleging excessive advisory fees involving one of the Federated
Funds. The Board of the Federated Funds retained the law firm of
Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the Federated Funds in these
lawsuits. Federated and the Federated Funds, and their respective
counsel, have been defending this litigation, and none of the Federated
Funds remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits. Additional lawsuits
based upon similar allegations may be filed in the future. The
potential impact of these lawsuits, all of which seek monetary damages,
attorneys' fees and expenses, and future potential similar suits is
uncertain. Although we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a
material adverse effect on the Federated Funds, there can be no
assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity
and/or other developments resulting from the
allegations in these matters will not result in increased redemptions,
or reduced sales, of shares of the Federated Funds or other adverse
consequences for the Federated
Funds.11.

Report of
Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm




TO THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF federated municipal securities income trust AND
SHAREHOLDERS OF federated Ohio Municipal income
fund:


We have audited the
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the
portfolio of investments, of Federated Ohio Municipal Income Fund (the
“Fund”), a portfolio of Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust, as of August 31, 2010,
and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the
statements of changes in net assets for each of the years or periods in
the two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each
of the years in the five-year period then ended. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.


We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as
of August 31, 2010, by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the
financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Federated
Ohio Municipal Income Fund as of August 31, 2010,
and the results of its operations for the year then ended, the changes
in its net assets for each of the years in the two-year period then
ended, and the financial highlights for each of the years or periods in
the five-year period then ended, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting
principles.

Evaluation
and Approval of Advisory Contract - May
2010




Federated Ohio Municipal Income
Fund (the
“Fund”)


The
Fund's Board reviewed the Fund's investment advisory contract at
meetings held in May 2010. The Board's decision regarding the contract
reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue
the existing
arrangements.


In this connection,
the Federated funds' Board had previously appointed a Senior Officer,
whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process
by which advisory fees are to be charged to a Federated fund. The
Senior Officer has the authority to retain consultants, experts, or
staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of
his duties, reports directly to the Board, and may be terminated only
with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the
Board. The Senior Officer prepared and furnished to the Board an
independent, written evaluation that covered topics discussed below.
The Board considered that evaluation, along with other information, in
deciding to approve the advisory
contract.


During its
review of the contract, the Board considered compensation and benefits
received by the Adviser. This included the fees received for services
provided to the Fund by other entities in the Federated organization
and research services (if any) received by the Adviser from brokers
that execute Federated fund trades, as well as advisory fees. The Board
is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning
allegedly excessive investment advisory fees, which have indicated that
the following factors may be relevant to an Adviser's fiduciary duty
with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund: the nature and
quality of the services provided by the Adviser, including the
performance of the fund; the Adviser's cost of providing the services;
the extent to which the Adviser may realize “economies of
scale” as a fund grows larger; any indirect benefits that may
accrue to the Adviser and its affiliates as a result of the Adviser's
relationship with a fund; performance and expenses of comparable funds;
and the extent to which the independent Board members are fully
informed about all facts the Board deems relevant bearing on the
Adviser's services and fees. The Board further considered management
fees (including any components thereof) charged to institutional and
other clients of the Adviser for what might be viewed as like services,
and the cost to the Adviser and its affiliates of supplying services
pursuant to the management fee agreements, excluding any
intra-corporate profit and profit margins of the Adviser and its
affiliates for supplying such services. The Board was aware of these
factors and was guided by them in its review of the Fund's advisory
contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and
relevant, as discussed further
below.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

  38
The Board considered
and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated
experience in governing the Fund and working with Federated on matters
relating to the Federated funds, and was assisted in its deliberations
by independent legal counsel. Throughout the year, the Board has
requested and received substantial and detailed information about the
Fund and the Federated organization that was in addition to the
extensive materials that comprise and accompany the Senior Officer's
evaluation. Federated provided much of this information at each regular
meeting of the Board, and furnished additional reports in connection
with the particular meeting at which the Board's formal review of the
advisory contract occurred. Between regularly scheduled meetings, the
Board also received information on particular matters as the need
arose. Thus, the Board's consideration of the advisory contract
included review of the Senior Officer's evaluation, accompanying data
and additional reports covering such matters as: the Adviser's
investment philosophy, revenue, profitability, personnel and processes;
investment and operating strategies; the Fund's short- and long-term
performance (in absolute terms, both on a gross basis and net of
expenses, as well as in relationship to its particular investment
program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds
and/or other benchmarks, as appropriate), and
comments on the reasons for performance; the Fund's investment
objectives; the Fund's expenses (including the advisory fee itself and
the overall expense structure of the Fund, both in absolute terms and
relative to similar and/or competing funds, with
due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations); the use
and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the Fund's
portfolio securities (if any); and the nature, quality and extent of
the advisory and other services provided to the Fund by the Adviser and
its affiliates. The Board also considered the preferences and
expectations of Fund shareholders and their relative sophistication;
the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and
market practices; the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the
mutual fund industry; the Fund's relationship to the Federated family
of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different
investment objectives, policies and strategies which are available for
exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges; compliance
and audit reports concerning the Federated funds and the Federated
companies that service them (including communications from regulatory
agencies), as well as Federated's responses to any issues raised
therein; and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how
the Federated funds and/or Federated are
responding to them. The Board's evaluation process is evolutionary. The
criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change
in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund
marketplace.
With respect to the
Fund's performance and expenses in particular, the Board has found the
use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment
programs to be relevant, given the high degree of competition in the
mutual fund business. The Board focused on comparisons with other
similar Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  39
mutual funds more heavily than non-mutual
fund products or services because it is believed that they are more
relevant. For example, other mutual funds are the products most like
the Fund, they are readily available to Fund shareholders as
alternative investment vehicles, and they are the type of investment
vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the Fund's investors. The
range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally
reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in
the precise marketplace in which the Fund competes. The Fund's ability
to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was
a useful indicator of how the Adviser is executing the Fund's
investment program, which in turn assisted the Board in reaching a
conclusion that the nature, extent, and quality of the Adviser's
investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of
the advisory contract. In this regard, the Senior Officer has reviewed
Federated's fees for providing advisory services to products outside
the Federated family of funds (e.g., institutional and separate
accounts). He concluded that mutual funds and institutional accounts
are inherently different products. Those differences include, but are
not limited to, different types of targeted investors; being subject to
different laws and regulations; different legal structures; different
average account sizes; different associated costs; different portfolio
management techniques made necessary by different cash flows; and
portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing. The
Senior Officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative
in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory
contracts.

The Senior Officer
reviewed reports compiled by Federated, using data supplied by
independent fund ranking organizations, regarding the performance of,
and fees charged by, other mutual funds, noting his view that
comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the
reasonableness of proposed
fees.


The Fund's performance fell
below the median of the relevant peer group for the one-year,
three-year and five-year periods covered by the report. The Board
discussed the Fund's performance with the Adviser and recognized the
efforts being undertaken by the Adviser. The Board will continue to
monitor these efforts and the performance of the
Fund.

The Board also
received financial information about Federated, including reports on
the compensation and benefits Federated derived from its relationships
with the Federated funds. These reports covered not only the fees under
the advisory contracts, but also fees received by Federated's
subsidiaries for providing other services to the Federated funds under
separate contracts (e.g., for serving as the Federated funds'
administrator). The reports also discussed any indirect benefit
Federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers
who execute Federated fund trades. In addition, the Board considered
the fact that, in order for a fund to be competitive in the
marketplace, Federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees
and/or Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  40
reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to
fund investors and/or indicated to the Board
their intention to do so in the future, where appropriate. Moreover,
the Board receives regular reports regarding the institution or
elimination of these voluntary
waivers.

Federated
furnished reports, requested by the Senior Officer, that reported
revenues on a fund-by-fund basis and made estimates of the allocation
of expenses on a fund-by-fund basis, using allocation methodologies
specified by the Senior Officer. The Senior Officer noted that,
although they may apply consistent allocation processes, the inherent
difficulties in allocating costs (and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects
of that exercise) and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those
costs may render such allocation reports unreliable. The allocation
reports were considered in the analysis by the Board but were
determined to be of limited
use.


The Board and the Senior
Officer also reviewed a report compiled by Federated comparing
profitability information for Federated to other publicly held fund
management companies. In this regard, the Senior Officer noted the
limited availability of such information, but nonetheless concluded
that Federated's profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the
Board agreed.


The Senior
Officer's evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization
of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger. The
Board considered in this regard that the Adviser has made significant
and long-term investments in areas that support all of the Federated
funds, such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management,
compliance, and risk management functions; and systems technology; and
that the benefits of these efforts (as well as any economies, should
they exist) were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole.
Finally, the Board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory
or industry guidelines on this subject, which (as discussed in the
Senior Officer's evaluation) is compounded by the lack of any common
industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund
advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce
the fee as the fund attains a certain size. The Senior Officer did not
recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing Federated's fund
advisory services at this
time.


It was noted in the materials
for the Board meeting that for the period covered by the report, the
Fund's investment advisory fee, after waivers and expense
reimbursements, if any, was below the median of the relevant peer
group. The Board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the Fund with
the Adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the
Fund remained
competitive.

The Senior Officer's
evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations
contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed
management fees are reasonable, and that Federated appeared to provide
appropriate administrative services to the Fund for the fees paid.
Under these Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  41
circumstances, no changes were recommended
to, and no objection was raised to, the continuation of the Fund's
advisory contract. The Board concluded that the nature, quality and
scope of services provided the Fund by the Adviser and its affiliates
were satisfactory.

In its
decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract, the
Board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the Fund's operations
and various risks, uncertainties and other effects that could occur as
a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract.
In particular, the Board recognized that many shareholders have
invested in the Fund on the strength of the Adviser's industry standing
and reputation and with the expectation that the Adviser will have a
continuing role in providing advisory services to the Fund. Thus, the
Board's approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is
the shareholders who have effectively selected the Adviser by virtue of
having invested in the
Fund.


The Board based its decision
to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances
and relevant factors and with a view to past and future long-term
considerations. Not all of the factors and considerations identified
above were necessarily relevant to the Fund, nor did the Board consider
any one of them to be determinative. With respect to the factors that
were relevant, the Board's decision to approve the contract reflects
its determination that Federated's performance and actions provided a
satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the
existing
arrangements.

Shareholder
Expense Example
(unaudited)


As a shareholder
of the Fund, you incur two types of costs: (1) transaction
costs, including sales charges (loads) on purchase or redemption
payments; and (2) ongoing costs, including management fees
and to the extent applicable, distribution (12b-1) fees
and/or shareholder services fees and other Fund
expenses. This Example is intended to help you to understand your
ongoing costs (in dollars) of investing in the Fund and to compare
these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds.
It is based on an investment of $1,000 invested at the beginning of the
period and held for the entire period from March 1,
2010 to August 31,
2010.




ACTUAL
EXPENSES


The first section of the table
below provides information about actual account values and actual
expenses. You may use the information in this section, together with
the amount you invested, to estimate the expenses that you
incurred over the period. Simply divide your account value by $1,000
(for example, an $8,600 account value divided by $1,000 = 8.6), then
multiply the result by the number in the first section under the
heading entitled “Expenses Paid During Period” to
estimate the expenses attributable to your investment during
this
period.




HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE
FOR COMPARISON
PURPOSES


The second section of
the table below provides information about hypothetical account values
and hypothetical expenses based on the Fund's actual expense ratio and
an assumed rate of return of 5% per year before expenses,
which is not the Fund's actual return. Thus, you should not
use the hypothetical account values and expenses to estimate the actual
ending account balance or your expenses for the period. Rather, these
figures are required to be provided to enable you to compare the
ongoing costs of investing in the Fund with other funds. To do so,
compare this 5% hypothetical example with the 5% hypothetical examples
that appear in the shareholder reports of the other
funds.

Please note that the
expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs
only and do not reflect any transaction costs, such as sales charges
(loads) on purchase or redemption payments. Therefore, the second
section of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only, and
will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning
different funds. In addition, if these transaction costs were included,
your costs would have been
higher.

Management's
Discussion of Fund
Performance


The Fund's total
return, based on net asset value, for the 12-month reporting period
ended August 31, 2010, was 9.60% for
Class A Shares and 8.76% for Class
B Shares. The total return of the S&P/Investortools
Municipal Bond Pennsylvania Index (PA Index),1 a broad-based
securities market index, was 9.85% during the same period. The Fund's
total return for the most recently completed fiscal year reflected
actual cash flows, transaction costs and other expenses, which were not
reflected in the total return of the PA
Index.



1
The
Fund's investment adviser has elected to change the Fund's broad-based
securities market index to the PA Index from the Barclays Capital
Pennsylvania Municipal Bond Index (BCPAMB). The PA Index is more
representative of the securities in which the Fund invests. The PA
Index consists of bonds in the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond
Index (Main Index) that have been issued by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or local governments or state or local government entities
within Pennsylvania. The Main Index is a broad, comprehensive, market
value-weighted index composed of approximately 55,000
bond issues that are exempt from U.S.
federal income taxes or subject to the alternative minimum
tax (AMT). Eligibility criteria for inclusion in the Main Index
include, but are not limited to: the bond issuer must be a state
(including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and U.S.
territories) or a local government or agency where interest
on the bond is exempt from U.S. federal income
taxes or subject to the AMT; the bond must be held by a mutual fund for
which Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides prices; it must be denominated in
U.S. dollars and have a minimum par amount of
$2 million; and the bond must have a minimum term
to maturity and/or call date greater than or
equal to one calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced monthly. The
total return of the BCPAMB during the 12-month
reporting period was 9.10%. The BCPAMB is an unmanaged, market
value-weighted index for the long-term, tax-exempt bond market
comprising investment-grade, tax-exempt and fixed-rate bonds issued in
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. To be included in the index, bonds
must have a minimum credit rating of Baa, an outstanding par value of
at least $7 million and be issued as part of a
transaction of at least $75 million. The bonds
must be fixed-rate, have an issue date after December 31,
1990, and must be at least one year from their maturity date,
as well as have been issued in the particular state. The BCPAMB
includes both zero coupon bonds and bonds subject to the AMT. Neither
the PA Index nor the BCPAMB are adjusted to reflect sales charges,
expenses and other fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) requires to be reflected in the Fund's performance. It is not
possible to invest directly in an
index.


Annual
Shareholder
Report

  5
During the reporting
period, the most significant factors affecting the Fund's performance
relative to the PA Index were: (a) the effective duration of its
portfolio (which indicates the portfolio's sensitivity to changes in
interest rates);2,3 (b) the allocation of the Fund's
portfolio among securities of similar issuers (referred to as sectors);
and (c) the credit rating of portfolio
securities.

The following
discussion focuses on the performance of the Fund's Class
A Shares. The 9.60% total return of the Class
A Shares for the reporting period consisted of 4.30% of
tax-exempt dividends and reinvestments and 5.30% of price appreciation
in the net asset value of the
shares.4




MARKET
OVERVIEW


During the 12-month reporting
period, the pace of recovery in output and employment slowed with tight
credit, modest income growth and lower housing wealth being major
contributors to the economic environment. Yields on nominal Treasury
coupon securities fell noticeably during the period, and Treasury
auctions were generally well received. The pace of economic recovery
was more modest than had been anticipated and inflation remained
subdued. To help support economic recovery, the Federal Reserve Board
(the “Fed”) kept constant its holdings of securities
at the current levels by reinvesting principal payments from agency
debt and mortgage-backed securities in longer term Treasury securities
and rolling over its holdings of Treasury debt as it matured. The Fed
maintained the target range for the federal funds rate between 0.00%
and 0.25% during the entire
period.


The Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania continued to have one of the oldest populations in the
U.S. with a median age of 39.9 years, three years
above the national median level. The Commonwealth continued to maintain
a moderate debt burden and a diversifying economy but continued to have
weak revenue growth. The Commonwealth continued to draw upon its
sizable reserves amid measures to maintain budget balance. The
Pennsylvania economy continued to diversify away from manufacturing;
strong employment in education and health services continued to be a
stabilizing factor. The pension system has historically been
well
funded.

is a measure of a security's price sensitivity to changes in interest
rates. Securities with longer durations are more
sensitive to changes in interest rates than securities with shorter
durations. For purposes of this Management's Discussion of Fund
Performance, duration is determined using a
third-party analytical
system.

Bond
prices are sensitive to changes in interest rates and a rise in
interest rates can cause a decline in their

The combined fiscal and
monetary stimuli drove an impressive rebound in the valuation of risky
assets. Tax-exempt municipal credit spreads declined significantly as
the spread between 20 year BBB-rated and
AAA-rated tax-exempt municipal bonds declined by 57
basis points during the reporting period. This extensive
normalization of the tax-exempt municipal market from the market
disruptions in 2008 resulted from several
positive technical factors. Significant federal financial support
programs for state governments were put in place to stimulate local
economies and boost confidence. The Build America Bonds program reduced
the supply of tax-exempt municipal bonds issued, helping to create a
shortage of tax-exempt bonds available in the market. Ongoing strong
demand for yield from investors as money market rates remained very
low, the expectations of higher marginal tax rates and strong mutual
fund flows led to solid demand for tax-exempt debt. These factors
helped to create the supply and demand imbalance that has enabled the
tax-exempt municipal market to recover and provide positive returns
during the
period.

The credit
fundamentals of the tax-exempt municipal bond market have shown
continued deterioration in such credit factors as pension funding
requirements, real estate values and revenue
growth.




Duration


As
determined at the end of the 12-month reporting period, the Fund's
dollar-weighted average duration for the reporting period was 6.2
years. Duration management was a significant component of the Fund's
investment strategy. The shorter a fund's duration relative to an
index, the less its net asset value will react as interest rates
change. The Fund adjusted duration relative to the PA Index several
times during the reporting period. Tax-exempt municipal bond yields
declined significantly during the period as the market stabilized and
then recovered from a near crisis environment to one of improved
liquidity, a near zero Federal funds rate and increased investment
activity. As a result, the Fund's duration underweight (90%) relative
to the PA Index detracted from Fund
performance.




Sector


During
the 12-month reporting period, the Fund maintained a higher portfolio
allocation to securities issued by multi-family housing issuers, public
power authorities and life care providers. These allocations helped the
Fund's performance due to the narrowing of credit spreads within these
sectors. The Fund also had less of an allocation to industrial
development debt and hospitals than the PA Index. These sectors
outperformed the PA Index during the period and detracted
from
performance.

CREDIT
QUALITY

Risk-aversion by investors
subsided as the financial markets stabilized and a preference for yield
resulted in the outperformance of bonds rated A and BBB (and unrated
bonds of similar quality)5 relative to bonds rated in the
higher rating categories (or unrated bonds of similar quality). With
the decrease in credit spreads during the period and the narrowing of
credit spreads to a greater extent for A- and BBB-rated (or comparable
quality) debt, the Fund's overweight, relative to the PA Index, in
BBB-rated debt during the reporting period helped the Fund's
performance as the yield on BBB-rated debt decreased to a greater
extent than for other investment-grade securities.6 Also,
the Fund's weighting in BB-rated debt relative to the PA Index's zero
weighting in that rating category resulted in a positive contribution
to Fund performance for the same
reasons.



5
Credit
ratings pertain only to the securities in the portfolio and do not
protect Fund shares against market
risk.


6
Investment-grade
securities are securities that are rated at least
“BBB” or unrated securities of a comparable quality.
Noninvestment-grade securities are securities that are not rated at
least “BBB” or unrated securities of a comparable
quality. Credit ratings are an indication of the risk that a security
will default. They do not protect a security from credit risk.
Lower-rated bonds typically offer higher yields to help compensate
investors for the increased risk associated with them. Among these
risks are lower credit worthiness, greater price volatility, more risk
to principal and income than with higher-rated securities and increased
possibilities of
default.

Fund's investment adviser has elected to change the Fund's broad-based
securities market index to the PA Index from the BCPAMB. The PA Index
is more representative of the securities in which the fund invests. The
PA Index consists of bonds in the S&P/Investortools Municipal Bond
Index (Main Index) that have been issued by the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania or local governments or state or local government entities
within Pennsylvania. The Main Index is a broad, comprehensive, market
value-weighted index composed of approximately 55,000 bond issues that
are exempt from U.S. federal income taxes or
subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). Eligibility criteria for
inclusion in the Main Index include, but are not limited to: the bond
issuer must be a state (including the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and
U.S. territories) or local government or state or
local government entity where interest on the bond is exempt from
U.S. federal income taxes or subject to the AMT;
the bond must be held by a mutual fund for which
Standard & Poor's
Securities Evaluations, Inc. provides prices; it must be denominated in
U.S. dollars and have a minimum par amount of $2
million; and the bond must have a minimum term to maturity
and/or call date greater than or equal to one
calendar month. The Main Index is rebalanced monthly. The BCPAMB is an
unmanaged, market value-weighted index for the long-term, tax-exempt
bond market comprising investment-grade, tax-exempt and fixed-rate
bonds issued in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. To be included in the
index, bonds must have a minimum credit rating of Baa, an outstanding
par value of at least $7 million and be issued as part of a transaction
of at least $75 million. The bonds must be fixed-rate, have an issue
date after December 31, 1990, and must be at least one year from their
maturity date, as well as have been issued in Pennsylvania. The PAIG
Index represents the return of the portion of the PA Index composed
solely of bonds that are rated at least BBB with remaining maturities
of more than three years that are not subject to AMT. Neither the PA
Index, BCPAMB nor the PAIG Index are adjusted to reflect sales charges,
expenses and other fees that the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) requires to be reflected in the Fund's performance. The PA Index,
BCPAMB and PAIG Index are unmanaged, and, unlike the Fund, are not
affected by cash flows. It is not possible to invest directly in an
index. Morningstar figures represent the average of the total returns
reported by all the mutual funds designated by Morningstar as falling
into the respective category indicated. Funds designated within the

1.
Organization


Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust (the “Trust”) is registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the “Act”), as an open-end management
investment company. The Trust consists of five portfolios. The
financial statements included herein are only those of Federated
Pennsylvania Municipal Income Fund (the “Fund”), a
non-diversified portfolio. The financial statements of the other
portfolios are presented separately. The assets of each portfolio are
segregated and a shareholder's interest is limited to the portfolio in
which shares are held. Each portfolio pays its own expenses. The Fund
offers two classes of shares: Class A Shares and
Class B Shares. All shares of the Fund have equal
rights with respect to voting, except on class-specific matters. The
investment objective of the Fund is to provide current income exempt
from federal regular income tax (federal regular income tax does not
include the federal alternative minimum tax (AMT)) and the personal
income taxes imposed by the state of Pennsylvania and Pennsylvania
municipalities. Interest income from the Fund's investments may be
subject to the federal AMT for individuals and
corporations.


On
January 16, 2009, the Fund received assets from
Fulton Tax Exempt Income Fund as the result of a tax-free
reorganization, as

Accounting
PoliciesThe following is a
summary of significant accounting policies consistently followed by the
Fund in the preparation of its financial statements. These policies are
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles
(GAAP).Investment
ValuationIn calculating its net asset
value (NAV), the Fund generally values investments as
follows:Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities greater than
60 days are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the
Trustees.Fixed-income
securities acquired with remaining maturities of
60 days or less are valued at their cost
(adjusted for the accretion of any discount or amortization of
any
premium).Derivative
contracts listed on exchanges are valued at their reported settlement
or closing
price.Over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative contracts are fair valued using price evaluations
provided by a pricing service approved by the
Trustees.Shares of other
mutual funds are valued based upon their reported
NAVs.Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  28
If the Fund cannot obtain
a price or price evaluation from a pricing service for an investment,
the Fund may attempt to value the investment based upon the mean of bid
and asked quotations or fair value the investment based on price
evaluations, from one or more dealers. If any price, quotation, price
evaluation or other pricing source is not readily available when the
NAV is calculated, the Fund uses the fair value of the investment
determined in accordance with the procedures described below. There can
be no assurance that the Fund could purchase or sell an investment at
the price used to calculate the Fund's
NAV.Fair Valuation and
Significant Events
ProceduresThe Trustees have
authorized the use of pricing services to provide evaluations of the
current fair value of certain investments for purposes of calculating
the NAV. Factors considered by pricing services in evaluating an
investment include the yields or prices of investments of comparable
quality, coupon, maturity, call rights and other potential prepayments,
terms and type, reported transactions, indications as to values from
dealers and general market conditions. Some pricing services provide a
single price evaluation reflecting the bid-side of the market for an
investment (a “bid” evaluation). Other pricing
services offer both bid evaluations and price evaluations indicative of
a price between the prices bid and asked for the investment (a
“mid” evaluation). The Fund normally uses bid
evaluations for U.S. Treasury and Agency
securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. The
Fund normally uses mid evaluations for other types of fixed-income
securities and OTC derivative contracts. In the event that market
quotations and price evaluations are not available for an investment,
the fair value of the investment is determined in accordance with
procedures adopted by the
Trustees.The Trustees
also have adopted procedures requiring an investment to be priced at
its fair value whenever the Adviser determines that a significant event
affecting the value of the investment has occurred between the time as
of which the price of the investment would otherwise be determined and
the time as of which the NAV is computed. An event is considered
significant if there is both an affirmative expectation that the
investment's value will change in response to the event and a
reasonable basis for quantifying the resulting change in value.
Examples of significant events that may occur after the close of the
principal market on which a security is traded, or after the time of a
price evaluation provided by a pricing service or a dealer,
include:With respect to
price evaluations of fixed-income securities determined before the
close of regular trading on the NYSE, actions by the Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee and other significant trends in U.S.
fixed-income
markets;Political or other
developments affecting the economy or markets in which an issuer
conducts its operations or its securities are traded;
andAnnouncements concerning matters
such as acquisitions, recapitalizations, litigation developments, a
natural disaster affecting the issuer's operations or regulatory
changes or market developments affecting the issuer's
industry.The Fund may seek
to obtain more current quotations or price evaluations from alternative
pricing sources. If a reliable alternative pricing source is not
available, the Fund will determine the fair value of the investment
using another method approved by the
Trustees.Investment Income,
Gains and Losses, Expenses and
DistributionsInvestment
transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. Realized gains
and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an identified
cost basis. Interest income and expenses are accrued daily.
Distributions to shareholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date.
Distributions of net investment income are declared and paid monthly.
Non-cash Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  29
dividends included in dividend income, if
any, are recorded at fair value. Investment income, realized and
unrealized gains and losses and certain fund-level expenses are
allocated to each class based on relative average daily net assets,
except that each class may bear certain expenses unique to that class
such as account administration, distribution services and shareholder
services fees. Dividends are declared separately for each class. No
class has preferential dividend rights; differences in per share
dividend rates are generally due to differences in separate
class
expenses.Premium and
Discount
AmortizationAll premiums and
discounts on fixed-income securities are amortized/accreted for
financial statement
purposes.Federal
TaxesIt is the Fund's policy to comply
with the Subchapter M provision of the Internal Revenue Code and to
distribute to shareholders each year substantially all of its income.
Accordingly, no provision for federal income tax is necessary. As of
and during the year ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did not have a
liability for any uncertain tax positions. The Fund recognizes interest
and penalties, if any, related to tax liabilities as income tax expense
in the Statement of Operations. As of August 31, 2010, tax years
2007 through 2010 remain
subject to examination by the Fund's major tax jurisdictions, which
include the United States of America and the Commonwealth
of
Massachusetts.When-Issued
and Delayed Delivery
TransactionsThe Fund may
engage in when-issued or delayed delivery transactions. The Fund
records when-issued securities on the trade date and maintains security
positions such that sufficient liquid assets will be available to make
payment for the securities purchased. Securities purchased on a
when-issued or delayed delivery basis are marked to market daily and
begin earning interest on the settlement date. Losses may occur on
these transactions due to changes in market conditions or the failure
of counterparties to perform under the
contract.Restricted
SecuritiesThe fund may purchase
securities which are considered restricted. Restricted securities are
securities that either: (a) cannot be offered for public sale without
first being registered, or being able to take advantage of an exemption
from registration, under the Securities Act of 1933; or (b) are subject
to contractual restrictions on public sales. In some cases, when a
security cannot be offered for public sale without first being
registered, the issuer of the restricted security has agreed to
register such securities for resale, at the issuer's expense, either
upon demand by the Fund or in connection with another registered
offering of the securities. Many such restricted securities may be
resold in the secondary market in transactions exempt from
registration. Restricted securities may be determined to be liquid
under criteria established by the Trustees. The Fund will not incur any
registration costs upon such resales. The Fund's restricted securities
are valued at the price provided by dealers in the secondary market or,
if no market prices are available, at the fair value as determined in
accordance with procedures established by and under the general
supervision of the
Trustees.OtherThe
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of
assets, liabilities, expenses and revenues reported in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those
estimated.Annual

Federal Tax
InformationThe timing and
character of income and capital gain distributions are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from GAAP.
These differences are due to expiration of capital loss carryforwards
and differing treatments for discount accretion/premium amortization on
debt
securities.For the year
ended August 31, 2010, permanent differences

the years ended August 31, 2010 and 2009, was
as
follows: 20102009Tax-exempt
income$11,666,966$13,070,249As
of August 31, 2010, the components of distributable earnings on a tax
basis were as

unrealized appreciation$11,305,686
Capital loss carry
forwards$(20,017,077)The
difference between book-basis and tax-basis net unrealized
appreciation/depreciation is attributable to differing treatments for
discount accretion/premium amortization on debt
securities.At
August 31, 2010, the cost of investments for
federal tax purposes was $266,987,568. The net unrealized appreciation
of investments for federal tax purposes was $11,305,686. This consists
of net unrealized appreciation from investments for those securities
having an excess of value over cost of $13,843,814 and net unrealized
depreciation from investments for those securities having an excess of
cost over value of
$2,538,128.At
August 31, 2010, the Fund had a capital loss
carry forward of $20,017,077 which will reduce the Fund's taxable
income arising from future net realized gains on investments, if any,
to the extent permitted by the Code and thus will reduce the amount of
distributions to shareholders which would otherwise be necessary to
relieve the Fund of any liability for federal income tax. Pursuant to
the Code, such capital loss carry forward will expire as
follows: Expiration

Fund will compensate Federated Securities Corp. (FSC), the principal
distributor, from the daily net assets of the Fund's Class
A Shares and Class B Shares to finance
activities intended to result in the sale of these shares. The Plan
provides that the Fund may incur distribution expenses at the following

Fund.Interfund
TransactionsDuring the year ended
August 31, 2010, the Fund engaged in purchase and sale transactions
with funds that have a common investment adviser (or affiliated
investment advisers), common Directors/Trustees
and/or common Officers. These purchase and sale
transactions complied with Rule 17a-7 under the Act and amounted to
$73,595,000 and $73,795,000,
respectively.Expense
LimitationThe Adviser and its
affiliates (which may include FSC, FAS and FSSC) have voluntarily
agreed to waive their fees and/or reimburse
expenses so that the total annual fund operating expenses (as shown in
the financial highlights) paid by the Fund's Class
A Shares and Class B Shares (after the
voluntary waivers and reimbursements) will not exceed 0.75% and 1.52%,
respectively, (the “Fee Limit”) through the later of
(the “Termination Date”): (a) October 31, 2011; or
(b) the date of the Fund's next effective Prospectus. While the Adviser
and its affiliates currently do not anticipate terminating or
increasing these arrangements prior to the Termination Date, these
arrangements may only be terminated or the Fee Limit increased prior to
the Termination Date with the agreement of the
Trustees.GeneralCertain
Officers and Trustees of the Fund are Officers and Directors or
Trustees of the above

Investment
TransactionsPurchases and
sales of investments, excluding long-term U.S.
government securities and short-term obligations, for the
year ended August 31, 2010, were as
follows: Purchases$33,572,245
Sales$63,189,2547.
Concentration of
RiskSince the Fund invests a
substantial portion of its assets in issuers located in one state, it
will be more susceptible to factors adversely affecting issuers of that
state than would be a comparable tax-exempt mutual fund that invests
nationally. In order to reduce the credit risk associated with such
factors, at August 31, 2010, 40.9% of the securities in the portfolio
of investments is backed by letters of credit or bond insurance of
various financial institutions and financial guaranty assurance
agencies. The largest percentage of investments insured by or supported
(backed) by a letter of credit from any one institution or agency was
11.4% of total
investments.Annual

8. Line of
CreditThe Fund participates
in a $100,000,000 unsecured, uncommitted revolving line of credit (LOC)
agreement with PNC Bank. The LOC was made available for extraordinary
or emergency purposes, primarily for financing redemption payments.
Borrowings are charged interest at a rate offered to the Fund by PNC
Bank at the time of the borrowing. As of August 31, 2010, there were no
outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31, 2010, the Fund did
not utilize the
LOC.9.
Interfund
LendingPursuant to an
Exemptive Order issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
Fund, along with other funds advised by subsidiaries of Federated
Investors, Inc., may participate in an interfund lending program. This
program provides an alternative credit facility allowing the funds to
borrow from other participating affiliated funds. As of August 31,
2010, there were no outstanding loans. During the year ended August 31,
2010, the program was not
utilized.10.
Legal
ProceedingsSince October
2003, Federated Investors, Inc. and related entities (collectively,
“Federated”), and various Federated sponsored mutual
funds (“Federated Funds”) have been named as
defendants in several class action lawsuits now pending in the United
States District Court for the District of Maryland. The lawsuits were
purportedly filed on behalf of people who purchased, owned
and/or redeemed shares of certain Federated Funds
during specified periods beginning November 1, 1998. The suits are
generally similar in alleging that Federated engaged in illegal and
improper trading practices including market timing and late trading in
concert with certain institutional traders, which allegedly caused
financial injury to the mutual fund shareholders. Federated without
admitting the validity of any claim has reached a preliminary
settlement with the Plaintiffs in these cases. Any settlement would
have to be approved by the Court. Federated entities have also been
named as defendants in several additional lawsuits that are now pending
in the United States District Court for the Western District of
Pennsylvania. These lawsuits have been consolidated into a single
action alleging excessive advisory fees involving one of the Federated
Funds. The Board of the Federated Funds retained the law firm of
Dickstein Shapiro LLP to represent the Federated Funds in these
lawsuits. Federated and the Federated Funds, and their respective
counsel, have been defending this litigation, and none of the Federated
Funds remains a defendant in any of the lawsuits. Additional lawsuits
based upon similar allegations may be filed in the future. The
potential impact of these lawsuits, all of which seek monetary damages,
attorneys' fees and expenses, and future potential similar suits is
uncertain. Although we do not believe that these lawsuits will have a
material adverse effect on the Federated Funds, there can be no
assurance that these suits, ongoing adverse publicity
and/or other developments resulting from the
allegations in these matters will not result in increased redemptions,
or reduced sales of shares of the Federated Funds, or other adverse
consequences for the Federated
Funds.11.

TO THE BOARD OF
TRUSTEES OF federated municipal securities income trust AND
SHAREHOLDERS OF federated pennsylvania municipal income
fund:


We have audited the
accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including the
portfolio of investments, of Federated Pennsylvania Municipal Income
Fund (the “Fund”), a portfolio of Federated Municipal
Securities Income Trust, as of August 31, 2010,
and the related statement of operations for the year then ended, the
statements of changes in net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the years in the five-year period then ended. These financial
statements and financial highlights are the responsibility of the
Fund's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial highlights based on our
audits.


We conducted our
audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements and financial highlights are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as
of August 31, 2010 by correspondence with the
custodian and brokers or by other appropriate auditing procedures. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.


In our opinion, the
financial statements and financial highlights referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Federated
Pennsylvania Municipal Income Fund as of August 31,
2010, and the results of its operations for the year then
ended, the changes in its net assets for each of the years in the
two-year period then ended, and the financial highlights for each of
the years in the five-year period then ended, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

Evaluation
and Approval of Advisory Contract - May
2010




Federated Pennsylvania Municipal
Income Fund (the
“Fund”)


The
Fund's Board reviewed the Fund's investment advisory contract at
meetings held in May 2010. The Board's decision regarding the contract
reflects the exercise of its business judgment on whether to continue
the existing
arrangements.


In this connection,
the Federated funds' Board had previously appointed a Senior Officer,
whose duties include specified responsibilities relating to the process
by which advisory fees are to be charged to a Federated fund. The
Senior Officer has the authority to retain consultants, experts, or
staff as may be reasonably necessary to assist in the performance of
his duties, reports directly to the Board, and may be terminated only
with the approval of a majority of the independent members of the
Board. The Senior Officer prepared and furnished to the Board an
independent, written evaluation that covered topics discussed below.
The Board considered that evaluation, along with other information, in
deciding to approve the advisory
contract.


During its
review of the contract, the Board considered compensation and benefits
received by the Adviser. This included the fees received for services
provided to the Fund by other entities in the Federated organization
and research services (if any) received by the Adviser from brokers
that execute Federated fund trades, as well as advisory fees. The Board
is also familiar with and considered judicial decisions concerning
allegedly excessive investment advisory fees, which have indicated that
the following factors may be relevant to an Adviser's fiduciary duty
with respect to its receipt of compensation from a fund: the nature and
quality of the services provided by the Adviser, including the
performance of the fund; the Adviser's cost of providing the services;
the extent to which the Adviser may realize “economies of
scale” as a fund grows larger; any indirect benefits that may
accrue to the Adviser and its affiliates as a result of the Adviser's
relationship with a fund; performance and expenses of comparable funds;
and the extent to which the independent Board members are fully
informed about all facts the Board deems relevant bearing on the
Adviser's services and fees. The Board further considered management
fees (including any components thereof) charged to institutional and
other clients of the Adviser for what might be viewed as like services,
and the cost to the Adviser and its affiliates of supplying services
pursuant to the management fee agreements, excluding any
intra-corporate profit and profit margins of the Adviser and its
affiliates for supplying such services. The Board was aware of these
factors and was guided by them in its review of the Fund's advisory
contract to the extent it considered them to be appropriate and
relevant, as discussed further
below.

Annual
Shareholder
Report

  42
The Board considered
and weighed these circumstances in light of its substantial accumulated
experience in governing the Fund and working with Federated on matters
relating to the Federated funds, and was assisted in its deliberations
by independent legal counsel. Throughout the year, the Board has
requested and received substantial and detailed information about the
Fund and the Federated organization that was in addition to the
extensive materials that comprise and accompany the Senior Officer's
evaluation. Federated provided much of this information at each regular
meeting of the Board, and furnished additional reports in connection
with the particular meeting at which the Board's formal review of the
advisory contract occurred. Between regularly scheduled meetings, the
Board also received information on particular matters as the need
arose. Thus, the Board's consideration of the advisory contract
included review of the Senior Officer's evaluation, accompanying data
and additional reports covering such matters as: the Adviser's
investment philosophy, revenue, profitability, personnel and processes;
investment and operating strategies; the Fund's short- and long-term
performance (in absolute terms, both on a gross basis and net of
expenses, as well as in relationship to its particular investment
program and certain competitor or “peer group” funds
and/or other benchmarks, as appropriate), and
comments on the reasons for performance; the Fund's investment
objectives; the Fund's expenses (including the advisory fee itself and
the overall expense structure of the Fund, both in absolute terms and
relative to similar and/or competing funds, with
due regard for contractual or voluntary expense limitations); the use
and allocation of brokerage commissions derived from trading the Fund's
portfolio securities (if any); and the nature, quality and extent of
the advisory and other services provided to the Fund by the Adviser and
its affiliates. The Board also considered the preferences and
expectations of Fund shareholders and their relative sophistication;
the continuing state of competition in the mutual fund industry and
market practices; the range of comparable fees for similar funds in the
mutual fund industry; the Fund's relationship to the Federated family
of funds which include a comprehensive array of funds with different
investment objectives, policies and strategies which are available for
exchange without the incurrence of additional sales charges; compliance
and audit reports concerning the Federated funds and the Federated
companies that service them (including communications from regulatory
agencies), as well as Federated's responses to any issues raised
therein; and relevant developments in the mutual fund industry and how
the Federated funds and/or Federated are
responding to them. The Board's evaluation process is evolutionary. The
criteria considered and the emphasis placed on relevant criteria change
in recognition of changing circumstances in the mutual fund
marketplace.
With respect to the
Fund's performance and expenses in particular, the Board has found the
use of comparisons to other mutual funds with comparable investment
programs to be relevant, given the high degree of competition in the
mutual fund business. The Board focused on comparisons with other
similar Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  43
mutual funds more heavily than non-mutual
fund products or services because it is believed that they are more
relevant. For example, other mutual funds are the products most like
the Fund, they are readily available to Fund shareholders as
alternative investment vehicles, and they are the type of investment
vehicle in fact chosen and maintained by the Fund's investors. The
range of their fees and expenses therefore appears to be a generally
reliable indication of what consumers have found to be reasonable in
the precise marketplace in which the Fund competes. The Fund's ability
to deliver competitive performance when compared to its peer group was
a useful indicator of how the Adviser is executing the Fund's
investment program, which in turn assisted the Board in reaching a
conclusion that the nature, extent, and quality of the Adviser's
investment management services were such as to warrant continuation of
the advisory contract. In this regard, the Senior Officer has reviewed
Federated's fees for providing advisory services to products outside
the Federated family of funds (e.g., institutional and
separate accounts). He concluded that mutual funds and institutional
accounts are inherently different products. Those differences include,
but are not limited to, different types of targeted investors; being
subject to different laws and regulations; different legal structures;
different average account sizes; different associated costs; different
portfolio management techniques made necessary by different cash flows;
and portfolio manager time spent in review of securities pricing. The
Senior Officer did not consider these fee schedules to be determinative
in judging the appropriateness of mutual fund advisory
contracts.

The Senior Officer
reviewed reports compiled by Federated, using data supplied by
independent fund ranking organizations, regarding the performance of,
and fees charged by, other mutual funds, noting his view that
comparisons to fund peer groups are relevant in judging the
reasonableness of proposed
fees.


The Fund's performance fell
below the median of the relevant peer group for the one-year,
three-year and five-year periods covered by the report. The Board
discussed the Fund's performance with the Adviser and recognized the
efforts being undertaken by the Adviser. The Board will continue to
monitor these efforts and the performance of the
Fund.

The Board also
received financial information about Federated, including reports on
the compensation and benefits Federated derived from its relationships
with the Federated funds. These reports covered not only the fees under
the advisory contracts, but also fees received by Federated's
subsidiaries for providing other services to the Federated funds under
separate contracts (e.g., for serving as the Federated funds'
administrator). The reports also discussed any indirect benefit
Federated may derive from its receipt of research services from brokers
who execute Federated fund trades. In addition, the Board considered
the fact that, in order for a fund to be competitive in the
marketplace, Federated and its affiliates frequently waived fees
and/or Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  44
reimbursed expenses and have disclosed to
fund investors and/or indicated to the Board
their intention to do so in the future, where appropriate. Moreover,
the Board receives regular reports regarding the institution or
elimination of these voluntary
waivers.

Federated
furnished reports, requested by the Senior Officer, that reported
revenues on a fund-by-fund basis and made estimates of the allocation
of expenses on a fund-by-fund basis, using allocation methodologies
specified by the Senior Officer. The Senior Officer noted that,
although they may apply consistent allocation processes, the inherent
difficulties in allocating costs (and the unavoidable arbitrary aspects
of that exercise) and the lack of consensus on how to allocate those
costs may render such allocation reports unreliable. The allocation
reports were considered in the analysis by the Board but were
determined to be of limited
use.


The Board and the Senior
Officer also reviewed a report compiled by Federated comparing
profitability information for Federated to other publicly held fund
management companies. In this regard, the Senior Officer noted the
limited availability of such information, but nonetheless concluded
that Federated's profit margins did not appear to be excessive and the
Board agreed.


The Senior
Officer's evaluation also discussed the notion of possible realization
of “economies of scale” as a fund grows larger. The
Board considered in this regard that the Adviser has made significant
and long-term investments in areas that support all of the Federated
funds, such as personnel and processes for the portfolio management,
compliance, and risk management functions; and systems technology; and
that the benefits of these efforts (as well as any economies, should
they exist) were likely to be enjoyed by the fund complex as a whole.
Finally, the Board also noted the absence of any applicable regulatory
or industry guidelines on this subject, which (as discussed in the
Senior Officer's evaluation) is compounded by the lack of any common
industry practice or general pattern with respect to structuring fund
advisory fees with “breakpoints” that serve to reduce
the fee as the fund attains a certain size. The Senior Officer did not
recommend institution of breakpoints in pricing Federated's fund
advisory services at this
time.


It was noted in the materials
for the Board meeting that for the period covered by the report, the
Fund's investment advisory fee, after waivers and expense
reimbursements, if any, was below the median of the relevant peer
group. The Board reviewed the fees and other expenses of the Fund with
the Adviser and was satisfied that the overall expense structure of the
Fund remained
competitive.

The Senior Officer's
evaluation noted his belief that the information and observations
contained in his evaluation supported a finding that the proposed
management fees are reasonable, and that Federated appeared to provide
appropriate administrative services to the Fund for the fees paid.
Under these Annual
Shareholder
Report 
  45
circumstances, no changes were recommended
to, and no objection was raised to, the continuation of the Fund's
advisory contract. The Board concluded that the nature, quality and
scope of services provided the Fund by the Adviser and its affiliates
were satisfactory.

In its
decision to continue an existing investment advisory contract, the
Board was mindful of the potential disruptions of the Fund's operations
and various risks, uncertainties and other effects that could occur as
a result of a decision to terminate or not renew an advisory contract.
In particular, the Board recognized that many shareholders have
invested in the Fund on the strength of the Adviser's industry standing
and reputation and with the expectation that the Adviser will have a
continuing role in providing advisory services to the Fund. Thus, the
Board's approval of the advisory contract reflected the fact that it is
the shareholders who have effectively selected the Adviser by virtue of
having invested in the
Fund.


The Board based its decision
to approve the advisory contract on the totality of the circumstances
and relevant factors and with a view to past and future long-term
considerations. Not all of the factors and considerations identified
above were necessarily relevant to the Fund, nor did the Board consider
any one of them to be determinative. With respect to the factors that
were relevant, the Board's decision to approve the contract reflects
its determination that Federated's performance and actions provided a
satisfactory basis to support the decision to continue the
existing
arrangements.

(e)(1)                      Audit Committee Policies regarding Pre-approval of Services.
 
The Audit Committee is required to pre-approve audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditor in order to assure that the provision of such services do not impair the auditor’s independence.  Unless a type of service to be provided by the independent auditor has received general pre-approval, it will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.  Any proposed services exceeding pre-approved cost levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.
 
Certain services have the general pre-approval of the Audit Committee.  The term of the general pre-approval is 12 months from the date of pre-approval, unless the Audit Committee specifically provides for a different period.  The Audit Committee will annually review the services that may be provided by the independent auditor without obtaining specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee and may grant general pre-approval for such services.  The Audit Committee will revise the list of general pre-approved services from time to time, based on subsequent determinations.  The Audit Committee will not delegate its responsibilities to pre-approve services performed by the independent auditor to management.
 
The Audit Committee has delegated pre-approval authority to its Chairman.  The Chairman will report any pre-approval decisions to the Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.  The Committee will designate another member with such pre-approval authority when the Chairman is unavailable.
 
AUDIT SERVICES
 
The annual Audit services engagement terms and fees will be subject to the specific pre-approval of the Audit Committee.  The Audit Committee must approve any changes in terms, conditions and fees resulting from changes in audit scope, registered investment company (RIC) structure or other matters.
 
In addition to the annual Audit services engagement specifically approved by the Audit Committee, the Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval for other Audit Services, which are those services that only the independent auditor reasonably can provide.  The Audit Committee has pre-approved certain Audit services, all other Audit services must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
 
AUDIT-RELATED SERVICES
 
Audit-related services are assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of the Company’s financial statements or that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor.  The Audit Committee believes that the provision of Audit-related services does not impair the independence of the auditor, and has pre-approved certain Audit-related services, all other Audit-related services must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
 
TAX SERVICES
 
The Audit Committee believes that the independent auditor can provide Tax services to the Company such as tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice without impairing the auditor’s independence.  However, the Audit Committee will not permit the retention of the independent auditor in connection with a transaction initially recommended by the independent auditor, the purpose of which may be tax avoidance and the tax treatment of which may not be supported in the Internal Revenue Code and related regulations.  The Audit Committee has pre-approved certain Tax services, all Tax services involving large and complex transactions must be specifically pre-approved by the Audit Committee.
 
ALL OTHER SERVICES
 
With respect to the provision of services other than audit, review or attest services the pre-approval requirement is waived if:
 




(1)  


The aggregate amount of all such services provided constitutes no more than five percent of the total amount of revenues paid by the registrant, the registrant’s adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant to its accountant during the fiscal year in which the services are provided;







(2)  


Such services were not recognized by the registrant, the registrant’s adviser (not including any sub-adviser whose role is primarily portfolio management and is subcontracted with or overseen by another investment adviser), and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant  at the time of the engagement to be non-audit services; and







(3)  


Such services are promptly brought to the attention of the Audit Committee of the issuer and approved prior to the completion of the audit by the Audit Committee or by one or more members of the Audit Committee who are members of the board of directors to whom authority to grant such approvals has been delegated by the Audit Committee.





 
The Audit Committee may grant general pre-approval to those permissible non-audit services classified as All Other services that it believes are routine and recurring services, and would not impair the independence of the auditor.
 
The SEC’s rules and relevant guidance should be consulted to determine the precise definitions of prohibited non-audit services and the applicability of exceptions to certain of the prohibitions.
 
PRE-APPROVAL FEE LEVELS
 
Pre-approval fee levels for all services to be provided by the independent auditor will be established annually by the Audit Committee.  Any proposed services exceeding these levels will require specific pre-approval by the Audit Committee.
 
PROCEDURES
 
Requests or applications to provide services that require specific approval by the Audit Committee will be submitted to the Audit Committee by both the independent auditor and the Principal Accounting Officer and/or Internal Auditor, and must include a joint statement as to whether, in their view, the request or application is consistent with the SEC’s rules on auditor independence.
 
(e)(2)                      Percentage of services identified in items 4(b) through 4(d) that were approved by the registrants audit committee pursuant to paragraph (c)(7)(i)(C) of Rule 2-01 of Regulation S-X:
