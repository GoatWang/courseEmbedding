GREENWICH, Conn., Sept. 18, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Catterton Partners, the leading consumer-focused private equity firm, today announced that it has closed its seventh buyout fund, Catterton Partners VII, L.P., as well as its second growth fund, Catterton Growth Partners II, L.P.  With the closing of these two funds, which include a combined $2.1 billion of Limited and General Partner commitments, Catterton now has over $4.0 billion under active management focused on growing well-positioned consumer companies.  
Both funds were significantly over-subscribed.  To help accommodate the investor demand, Catterton Partners VII increased its hard cap from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion.  Catterton Growth Partners II, which was raised in just three months, also increased its hard cap, from $350 million to $400 million.  Both funds received continued strong support from existing investors and also attracted new investors.  The broad LP base consists of leading global public pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, and family offices.  
Consistent with Catterton's proven investment strategy, both funds will target control-oriented investments in high growth consumer companies in attractive categories.  Catterton Partners VII will target companies with enterprise values typically from $100 million to more than $1 billion.  Similar to the first Growth fund, Catterton Growth Partners II will target companies with enterprise values that are generally less than $100 million.
"We are pleased to have closed two new funds at levels that exceeded our expectations," said J. Michael Chu, Co-Managing Partner of Catterton Partners.  "Over the last 24 years, Catterton has built a leading franchise in consumer investing.  The great success we have enjoyed since our inception would not be possible without the support of our limited partners and the outstanding work of the management teams with whom we partner.  Our ability to close these funds in a short period of time is a testament to our strategy and solidifies our leadership in consumer-focused investing.  We look forward to continuing to leverage our expertise to help high-growth consumer companies realize their full potential."
"We were honored to earn the overwhelming support of investors in these two funds, which surpassed our targets," said Scott A. Dahnke, Co-Managing Partner of Catterton Partners.  "Catterton is well known for building market-leading consumer growth companies, powered by strong brands with deep consumer appeal.  We will continue to pursue the strategy our firm has followed since our inception: partnering with management teams of well-positioned consumer companies to build outstanding brands.  We look forward to continued success and to delivering strong returns in Fund VII and Growth Fund II."   
Fund VII has already completed three investments in Primanti Brothers, PIRCH and CorePower Yoga.  Growth Partners II has already completed its first investment in Snap Kitchen.   
The final close of these two funds follows a very active 18 months in which Catterton exited 11 portfolio companies and completed 12 new investments.  Recent exited investments include Plum Organics, MonoSol, Heartland RV, and O.N.E Coconut Water.  In addition, three of Catterton's portfolio companies completed successful IPOs, including Restoration Hardware, Bloomin' Brands Inc., and Noodles & Company.  Over the past year, the firm also expanded its deep team of investment and operating professionals and now has 18 investment and operating partners and 42 investment professionals, arguably the largest and most experienced team in the middle market.
Catterton's previous buyout fund, Catterton Partners VI L.P., closed in June 2006 with $1 billion in commitments.  Its previous growth fund, Catterton Growth Partners, L.P., closed in April 2008 with $316 million in commitments.
About Catterton PartnersCatterton Partners is the leading consumer-focused private equity firm with more than $4.0 billion currently under management and a twenty-four year track record of success in building high growth companies.  Since its founding in 1989, Catterton has leveraged its category insight, strategic and operating skills, and network of industry contacts to establish one of the strongest private equity investment track records in the middle market.  Catterton Partners invests in all major consumer segments, including Food and Beverage, Retail and Restaurants, Consumer Products and Services, Consumer Health, and Media and Marketing Services.  Representative Catterton investments include Restoration Hardware, Outback Steakhouse, Sweet Leaf Tea, Noodles & Company, Frederic Fekkai, Build-A-Bear Workshop, Wellness and Nature's Variety pet food, Kettle Foods, Odwalla, Plum Organics and P.F.

MetLife to Acquire Logan Circle Partners, L.P.




Adds Seasoned Team with Strong Track Record in Fixed Income


Significant Milestone Furthering MetLife’s Enterprise Strategy






July 07, 2017 04:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK & PHILADELPHIA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) (“MetLife”) and Fortress Investment Group LLC 
      (NYSE: FIG) (“Fortress”) today announced a definitive agreement for 
      MetLife to acquire Logan Circle Partners, L.P., Fortress’ traditional 
      fixed income asset management business, for approximately $250 million 
      in cash. Following the anticipated separation of Brighthouse Financial 
      next month and assuming the closing of the Logan Circle Partners 
      acquisition, MetLife’s Investment Management business (MIM) would have 
      more than $560 billion in total assets under management, of which more 
      than $140 billion would be managed on behalf of third parties.
    

      Logan Circle Partners is a fundamental research-based investment manager 
      providing institutional clients actively managed investment solutions 
      across a broad spectrum of fixed income strategies. The Logan Circle 
      Partners senior investment team has on average more than 20 years of 
      investment management experience and has been working together since 
      2000. The firm has more than 100 institutional clients and more than $33 
      billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2017. Logan Circle 
      Partners shares MetLife’s focus on investment performance, client 
      service, and risk management.
    

      “This transaction is directly aligned with our enterprise strategy to 
      deliver value by focusing on businesses with strong risk-adjusted 
      internal rates of returns, low capital intensity and sustainable cash 
      flows,” said Steven A. Kandarian, chairman, president and CEO, MetLife, 
      Inc. “Logan Circle Partners will bring a talented team with a track 
      record of outperformance and an established consultant distribution 
      platform to our Investment Management business. We are delighted to 
      welcome the Logan Circle Partners team to MetLife.”
    

      Steven J. Goulart, executive vice president and chief investment 
      officer, MetLife, Inc., added, “Logan Circle Partners has built a 
      strong, scalable, fee-based asset management business, driven by idea 
      generation and an investment process that has delivered superior 
      performance for its institutional clients. Joining Logan Circle Partners 
      with MetLife’s Investment Management business will enable us to offer 
      our domestic and international clients a broader set of investment 
      solutions and will significantly enhance our reach in the consultant 
      distribution channel. We will also benefit from a significant increase 
      in scale by combining Logan Circle Partners with our fixed income 
      platform.”
    

      Jude T. Driscoll, Logan Circle Partners founder, chief executive officer 
      and chief investment officer, said, “We are excited to join MetLife and 
      believe our collective resources across the fixed income spectrum 
      will enable us to enhance our best-in-class investment management and 
      client service capabilities. Our team's core focus and objectives will 
      remain unchanged—delivering returns through research-driven portfolios 
      built on in-depth fundamental research. This is an ideal combination for 
      our investors and our team."
    

Transaction Details


      Under the terms of the agreement, MetLife will acquire 100 percent of 
      Fortress’ ownership stake in Logan Circle Partners.
    

      This transaction will not impact MetLife’s existing $3 billion 
      repurchase authorization, which is expected to be completed by year-end 
      2017.
    

      The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and 
      regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the third quarter of 
      2017.
    

      Moelis & Company LLC served as financial advisor and Morgan, Lewis & 
      Bockius LLP served as legal counsel to MetLife. BofA Merrill Lynch 
      served as financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP 
      served as legal counsel to the seller.

Forward-Looking Statements


      This news release may contain or incorporate by reference information 
      that includes or is based upon forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      Forward-looking statements give expectations or forecasts of future 
      events. These statements can be identified by the fact that they do not 
      relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as 
      “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” 
      “believe,” “will,” “following,” and other words and terms of similar 
      meaning, or are tied to future periods, in connection with a discussion 
      of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these 
      include statements relating to future actions, prospective services or 
      products, future performance or results of current and anticipated 
      services or products, sales efforts, expenses, the outcome of 
      contingencies such as legal proceedings, trends in operations and 
      financial results.
    

      Any or all forward-looking statements may turn out to be wrong. They can 
      be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and 
      uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the 
      actual future results of MetLife, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates. 
      These statements are based on current expectations and the current 
      economic environment. They involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
      that are difficult to predict. These statements are not guarantees of 
      future performance. Actual results could differ materially from those 
      expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Risks, 
      uncertainties, and other factors that might cause such differences 
      include the risks, uncertainties and other factors identified in 
      MetLife, Inc.’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Annual 
      Report") filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 
      "SEC"), any Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed by MetLife, Inc. with 
      the SEC after the date of the Annual Report under the captions "Note 
      Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors," and other 
      filings MetLife, Inc. makes with the SEC. MetLife, Inc. does not 
      undertake any obligation to publicly correct or update any 
      forward-looking statement if MetLife, Inc. later becomes aware that such 
      statement is not likely to be achieved. Please consult any further 
      disclosures MetLife, Inc. makes on related subjects in reports to the 
      SEC.
    

Explanatory Note on Non-GAAP Financial Information


      MetLife Combined Managed Assets (as defined below) is a financial 
      measure based on methodologies other than accounting principles 
      generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). “MetLife 
      Combined Managed Assets” include at estimated fair value (i) 
      actively-managed general account assets (“Managed Assets”), (ii) 
      passive-indexed insurance company separate account assets, and (iii) 
      non-proprietary assets managed on behalf of unaffiliated investors. 
      Managed Assets exclude assets such as policy loans, other invested 
      assets, mortgage loans held-for-sale, and commercial mortgage loans held 
      by consolidated securitization entities, as substantially all of those 
      assets are not actively managed in MetLife’s general account investment 
      portfolio. Fair value option securities are also excluded as this amount 
      is primarily comprised of contractholder-directed unit-linked 
      investments, where the contractholder, and not MetLife, directs the 
      investment of these funds. Mortgage loans and certain real estate 
      investments have also been adjusted from carrying value to estimated 
      fair value. Passive-indexed insurance company separate account assets 
      represent separate account assets of the MetLife insurance companies 
      which are included in MetLife, Inc.’s consolidated financial statements 
      at estimated fair value. Non-proprietary assets managed on behalf of 
      unaffiliated investors include investment grade and below investment 
      grade corporates, mortgage loans and real estate equity, all of which 
      are at estimated fair value but are excluded from MetLife, Inc.’s 
      consolidated financial statements. MetLife believes the use of MetLife 
      Combined Managed Assets enhances the understanding of the depth and 
      breadth of its investment management services both on behalf of its 
      general account investment portfolio, separate accounts and unaffiliated 
      investors. A reconciliation of Total Investments to Managed Assets and 
      MetLife Combined Managed Assets is set forth below. Additional 
      information about MetLife’s investments is available in MetLife, Inc.’s 
      Quarterly Financial Supplement for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and 
      MetLife, Inc.’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended 
      March 31, 2017, each of which may be accessed through MetLife, Inc.’s 
      Investor Relations Web page at http://investor.metlife.com. 
      MetLife Combined Managed Assets and Managed Assets are non-GAAP 
      financial measures and should not be viewed as substitutes for Total 
      Investments, the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

      (1) Includes $79.7 billion of general account investments and $12.6 
      billion of separate account investments managed by MetLife on behalf of 
      Brighthouse Financial, Inc. upon its anticipated separation.
    

      (2) Represents assets under management by Logan Circle Partners, L.P. as 
      reported in the Fortress Investment Group LLC (“Fortress”) March 31, 
      2017 Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Assets 
      under management as measured by Fortress refers to the management fee 
      paying assets it manages or co-manages, including, as applicable, 
      capital it has the right to call from its investors pursuant to their 
      capital commitments to various funds. In addition, AUM includes 
      management fee paying assets managed by autonomous businesses in which 
      it retains a minority interest. Fortress’ AUM equals the sum of:
    

      (i) the capital commitments or invested capital (or net asset value, 
      "NAV," if lower) of its private equity funds and credit private equity 
      funds, depending on which measure management fees are being calculated 
      upon at a given point in time, which in connection with certain private 
      equity funds includes the mark-to-market value of certain public 
      securities held within the funds,
    

      (ii) the contributed capital or book equity (as defined) of its publicly 
      traded permanent capital vehicles,
    

      (iii) the NAV of its hedge funds, including the Value Recovery Funds 
      which pay fees based on realizations;
    

      (iv) the NAV or fair value of its managed accounts, to the extent 
      management fees are charged; and
    

      (v) AUM of the funds related to the affiliated manager and co-managed 
      funds.
    

      For each of the above, the amounts exclude assets under management for 
      which Fortress charges either no or nominal fees, generally related to 
      its investments in its funds as well as investments in its funds by its 
      principals, directors and employees.
    

      Fortress’ calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other 
      asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to 
      similar measures presented by other asset managers. Its definition of 
      AUM is not based on any definition of assets under management contained 
      in its operating agreement or in any of its Fortress Fund management 
      agreements. Finally, its calculation of AUM differs from the manner in 
      which its affiliates registered with the United States Securities and 
      Exchange Commission report "Regulatory Assets Under Management" on Form 
      ADV and Form PF in various ways.

Benefits
Quality documentation for quality care
 






		The final word in speech recognition
	
Dragon Medical is the go-to speech recognition solution for more than 10,000 healthcare facilities and 500,000 physicians worldwide. Our solutions ensure 300 million patient stories get told accurately every year.











		When doctors speak, your EHR listens
	
Clinicians can document patient stories more completely and in their own words—enabling them to update the history of present illness, review of symptoms, physical examination and assessment and plan in real time.











		Made for small practices
	
Designed and priced exclusively for independent practices of 24 physicians or fewer, Dragon Medical Practice Edition is up to 99% accurate out of the box and includes a complete range of medical vocabularies.



















Features
Highly accurate clinical speech recognition from word one







			The whole story
		
Covering nearly 90 specialties and subspecialties, Dragon Medical Practice Edition helps clinicians document the complete patient history and physical information. And the experience is the same from workstation to workstation.










			Fast and accurate
		
The clinical narrative is updated in real time, so clinicians don’t have to wait for transcribed reports or spend time typing into their EHRs, allowing more time to spend with patients.











			Complete EHR navigation
		
Dragon Medical Practice Edition lets clinicians navigate any Windows®-based EHR system using voice commands—three times faster than most people can type or click with a mouse—supporting EHR adoption.













			Healthcare-compliant
		
Dragon Medical Practice Edition supports HIPAA patient confidentiality guidelines, a critical requirement for any practice concerned with patient confidentiality.










			On the money
		
Practices that supply documentation through Dragon Medical speech recognition technology earn a higher rate of reimbursement than practices that provide notes built by point-and-click EHR templates alone.











			Time saver
		
Using speech recognition technology, clinicians dictate, edit and sign medical records right at the point of care—saving up to $12,000 in annual documentation costs.















 If people aren’t talking to Dragon, they’re talking about it 









I use the EHR for a lot of point-and-click, but for the subjective information, as well as my conclusions and impressions, that’s where Dragon Medical Practice Edition shines...I would never go back to life pre-Dragon Medical.

Andrew Fireman 

		MD, Cardiologist, AMS Cardiology, Abington, Pennsylvania






With Dragon Medical Practice Edition and the EHR, we can generate the code that truly reflects the work we do for complex patients. Our Level 4 encounters increased from 3% to 14% over a six-month period.

Chuck Stillwaggon

		Practice Administrator, Orthopedics Northwest, PLLC, Yakima, WA
