Relationship-Driven Property Management
Kennedy Wilson (NYSE:KW) offers a comprehensive line of real estate services for the full life cycle of real estate ownership and investment.  From operating assets with maximum efficiency to marketing assets at the right time to the appropriate pool of potential investors, Kennedy Wilson helps its clients achieve their real estate goals.
With a history dating back to 1977, Kennedy Wilson has established standards, policies and procedures for virtually every aspect of real estate operations and management. At the same time, the company's entrepreneurial culture allows for flexibility and encourages creativity and customized solutions in the best interests of our clients.
Kennedy Wilson launched its property management business in 1998 when it acquired Heitman Properties, Ltd., a full service property management, leasing and construction management company.  Since then, the firm’s portfolio has grown to include more than 50 million square feet of income property under management.
Case Studies
7060 HOLLYWOOD
7060 Hollywood Blvd. is a 12-story Class A office tower with approximately 175,000 SF.  Kennedy Wilson earned the construction and property management assignment in August of 2007 and became a joint venture partner of the project seven months later.  In 2009, Kennedy Wilson completed an $18 million renovation of the building, including complete demolition of all interiors, replacement of windows, modernization of elevators, replacement of mechanical systems and enhancement of the main lobby and ground floor retail storefronts.  Additionally, the Company completed a $7 million tenant improvement build out for a high profile entertainment company, securing a 100,000 SF lease—one of the largest lease transactions of 2009 in Los Angeles.
OLIVE 8
Olive 8 is Seattle's first green condo/hotel with a LEED™ Silver Certification.  The 22 story, 229-unit condominium project of luxury one and two bedroom units sits atop the Hyatt at Olive 8, offering residents world class hotel amenities such as room service, housekeeping, spa services and a 24-hour concierge.
After little sales activity, the developer of Olive 8 hired Kennedy Wilson to conduct a one-day auction in September of 2010.  Kennedy Wilson confined the auction sale to units on the 18th to 26th floors, offering and selling 32 units for $13.3 million.  Over 600 people attended the auction and the Company's campaign attracted over 4000 homebuyers.
ARAMARK TOWER
Under Kennedy Wilson management, ARAMARK Tower’s office component has been 100% leased since 1998.  With 90% of the office tower comprised of two major tenants, the building experiences a tremendous amount of interfloor elevator traffic.  With two banks of six elevators each, vertical transportation and elevator performance is of paramount concern. Historically, the building had a full time elevator mechanic to help ensure optimal performance and tenant satisfaction.  The associated cost, coupled with tenant expansions, was placing an increasing burden on the property.
The Kennedy Wilson team sought creative solutions to address both issues.  At the end of the day, while conventional elevator systems provided greater reliability in terms of service, the empirical data suggested that wait and/or destination times were not materially enhanced.  After an exhaustive search process involving several consultants, in 2004 ARAMARK Tower became the first office building in Philadelphia to install destination-based dispatching technology.  Not only has this technology improved overall system performance, with a 35-45% improvement in destination times, but the maintenance costs have been reduced by 50%, allowing the property owner to recover a portion of its investment.  As an added benefit, involving the building’s major tenant in the selection process was instrumental in helping to secure a 309,000 square foot lease renewal.

Utah Villas & Vacation Rentals


Exploring UtahNature is at its most spectacular in the mountains around our luxury Utah villas, nestled in the famed ski resorts where Olympic glory was won just a few years ago. The wilds of this unique state are dramatic, with rocky red canyons and dense pine forests, but most people stay at Utah rental homes for the snow, which falls soft and thick. Visit Park City and dine and dance into the wee hours or settle back into sophisticated Deer Valley. Utah ski vacation rentals offer something for everyone, even in the summer, when the mountain is alive and kicking with hiking, biking and activities on the river.Experience Utah rentalsOffering the kind of first-rate service rarely seen on the slopes, Deer Valley ski resort is a new approach to luxury winter getaways. It is clearly doing something right – the park consistently ranks among the top resorts in North America, especially among those who prefer more sophisticated après-ski. Deer Valley rentals run the gamut in style and size, but all offer a comfortable, luxurious place to lay your head at the end of an activity-filled day.

Ski-in/ski-out is music to any snow-lovers ears. Cody House in Jackson Hole’s Teton Village has the magic capability for you to strap on your skis and be on the slopes within minutes. It’s a spacious 3,320-square foot condominium with stellar mountain views and the little extra touches that make it feel immediately like home.
After a day in below-zero temperatures, warm up beside the toasty fireplace with a cup of hot cocoa. The villa has Wi-Fi access, and a DVD player and television to ensure you can unwind in whichever way you please. Outside, a whirlpool spa complete with mountain views is the perfect place for an apres-ski glass of bubbly. There you’ll also find a barbecue, perfect for visiting Jackson Hole in the summer months and cooking up your favorite grilled goods.
The chalet’s decor is understated and elegant—classic pine wood furniture and antiques bring life to the space, while paintings of the vast American landscape decorate the wall. The kitchen was made with the active types in mind, just as much as those who are looking to spend special moments with their family. It’s equipped with all the necessities to make a quick meal before taking to the slopes, such as a toaster and coffee maker. The large centre island is likely to become the gathering spot for evening drinks and afternoon snacks.
Cody House’s four bedrooms comfortably accommodate up to eight guests. The master bedroom has a king size bed, en-suite bathroom with jetted tub and steam shower. The second bedroom has a queen size bed and its own en-suite bathroom. The second and third bedrooms, perfect for the kids, are equipped with two twin beds each, a bunk bed in one. The cozy bunk room bed is finished with a reading corner, TV and DVD player.
Jackson Hole is a playground for those who love active travel. In the summer months, canoe, kayak or explore the mountains with a rugged hike. In the winter, it’s a no brainer—get your skis and snowboard and brace yourself for an exhilarating day. Explore the village’s charming shops, upscale eateries and fun-loving bars.

Great experience!

Luxury Retreat staff was fantastic to work with and our condo was simply beautiful. We had a lot of special circumstances with this trip and Jeff and Michelle could not have been easier to work with or more helpful. We had our groceries all there when we arrived and Cody House is a truly special property that met all of our requirements and then some. It was a wonderful trip!

A fantastic condo with plenty of room and great location!

The condo was first class! The deck though was very small considering the size of the condo. We had a party of 6 and could only comfortably sit 4.
