News MV Portfolios Provides Shareholder Update
Download PDF
JACKSONVILLE, FL -- (Marketwired) -- 11/18/14 -- 
 Today, MV Portfolios, Inc. (OTCQB: MVPI) ("MVP" or the "Company"), a Jacksonville based intellectual property investment, development and licensing company, is providing shareholders with an update on its business developments and financial results for the fiscal first quarter ending September 30, 2014. 
William Meadow, President and Chief Executive Officer of MVP, commented, "Upon going public in February of this year, we set forth a two-pronged strategy. 
First, we decided to assert and enforce our street level imaging patent portfolio, around which I had built my former company, Visual Real Estate. Our lawsuit against Google has been filed and we are meeting milestones on a timetable established by the court system and patent board. 
Second, we wanted to productize innovative intellectual property (IP) developed by top universities. To that end, we have signed our first two exclusive option agreements with top universities in the U.S. and in the U.K. on inventions that we believe have astonishing commercial potential. Our goal is to take well-vetted cutting-edge intellectual property from academic labs and bring it into mainstream commercial use through investments in product development activities and commercialization agreements. We plan to create multiple startups that will grow into large corporations with global reach - all in the mobile, smart object and location based services industries."
Operational Highlights to Date:

Wholly owned subsidiary Visual Real Estate filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Google Inc. in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida claiming infringement of three of Visual Real Estate's patents: U.S. which, among other things, identifies Google Street View and Google Earth as infringing.
            
The U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida in the Google case has established a schedule for a claim construction hearing and other case events and deadlines. Google has petitioned for an inter partes review before the USPTO for the three patents and MVP has responded.
            
As part of MVP's innovation strategy, MVP intends to partner with U.S. and international universities, and certain inventors, in funding development and commercialization of carefully selected and vetted patent portfolios with a focus on large scale distribution.
            
MVP has successfully signed its first exclusive option to invest, develop and market a patent portfolio relating to a perfect focus "rubber lens" with a top Ivy League University.
            
MVP has expanded its operations to the United Kingdom, led by its representative in the UK Brian Rivette. He is focused on implementing a key MVP growth strategy: identifying and blending complementary academic innovation from the Americas, Europe and Asia.
            
MVP has established a one-year exclusive option with a major UK university to explore a product build out of an incredibly powerful invention. MVP plans to work with several companies to develop and commercialize a MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical System) based product. The new product would have the potential of providing indoor "GPS like" location information for consumer and industrial products.

Financial Results for the fiscal first quarter ending September 30, 2014:
MVP filed its Form 10-Q for the first quarter ending September 30, 2014 on November 14, 2014. As of November 12, 2014 the Company had 21.2 million shares of common stock issued and outstanding. While the Company incurred a net loss of $11.5 million during the quarter, the net cash used in operating activities for the quarter was $613,898. The following $8.5 million in non-cash charges impacted the net loss: 

$3.7 million to interest expense in connection with conversion of certain notes into preferred stock.
            
The issuance of 1,400,000 shares to unrelated parties as compensation for services valued at $2.8 million.
            
$2.7 million in compensation expenses related to stock options that vested during the quarter. The total fair value of the stock options was estimated to be $9.3 million of which $6.7 million will be recognized over the remaining vesting period of the options, which runs through March 2017.

The company also incurred expenses related to the ongoing litigation between its wholly owned subsidiary Visual Real Estate and Google.

(MVPI), a company that is engaged in the business of patent acquisition, product development, patent licensing and patent enforcement against parties believed to be selling goods or services that rely upon its patented technology, with a 12-month price target of $1.67.The report is available here: MVPI Initiation Report. SeeThruEquity is an approved equity research contributor on Thomson First Call, Capital IQ, FactSet, and Zack's. The report will also be available on these platforms.Founded in 2014, MVPI owns a portfolio of 8 issued and 11 pending patents, which specializes in disclosing systems and methods for providing video drive-by data to enable a street level view of a neighborhood surrounding a geographic location of interest. MVPI has also embarked upon a low cost IP acquisition strategy through which it intends to partner with U.S. and international universities, and certain inventors, in funding developing and commercializing carefully selected patent portfolios. The company has recently signed an exclusive option agreement with a major university in the U.S. to market dielectric elastomer ("Rubber Lens") innovation that has the potential to create digital smart phone images where all objects are in perfect focus."MVPI is focused on developing inventions that involve mobile devices, smart objects, sensors and location based services which allow the resulting products to be quickly put in the hands of billions of end-users who have integrated smart-device technology into their lives. It believes these innovations have the potential of witnessing rapid adoption in future due to 4 billion anticipated internet users and 50 billion smart objects by 2017. The founder and CEO, Billy Meadow, has already completed a Productized IP model at Columbia University and has recently signed an exclusive option agreement with a major university to market dielectric elastomer that has the potential to create digital smart phone images where all objects are in focus. These are key developments and display solid execution by company management," commented Ajay Tandon, CEO of SeeThruEquity. "Further, we view the company as an interesting play in the IP monetization space and are initiating coverage with a 12-month price target of $1.67 per share."Additional investment highlights are as follows:Broad portfolio of patents to get complemented with low cost IP acquisition business modelMVPI has a portfolio of patents in disruptive technology which specializes in disclosing systems and methods for providing video drive-by data to enable a street level view of a neighborhood surrounding a geographic location of interest. It has currently 8 issued U.S. patents and 11 pending patents. MVPI is focused towards expanding its intellectual property portfolio through both internal development and acquisition. It has already identified over a half a dozen extremely high-value inventions for acquisition in near future. The Company has also conceptualized a low cost IP acquisition business model which allows it to collaborate with U.S. and international universities in developing, productizing and commercializing carefully selected patent portfolios. This business model will help MVPI in driving royalty revenue which will be entirely uncorrelated to market conditions.Aggressive IP monetization plan coupled with current litigation with Google to propel revenues in near futureMVPI is focused on developing inventions that involve mobile devices, smart objects, sensors and location based services which allow the resulting products to be quickly put in the hands of billions of end-users who have integrated smart-device technology into their lives. MV Portfolios' IP will be monetized through a series of companies over the next 3-4 years. The Company may sell the entire spin out company to a distribution channel entity or license to multiple niche market leaders. Revenue will result from both a series of low-risk, high-reward spin out companies and a potentially very high pay out litigation with Google.Read MoreExperienced management team with success in partnering with universities and productizing their assetsMVPI intends to leverage the huge experience of its management team which is led by Founder & President, William D. Meadow, who has 17 issued patents and an extensive experience in patent licensing at the university level. As a part of the MVPI's strategy to collaborate with universities for the development of IP, It has recently signed an option agreement with a major university in the U.S. to market dielectric elastomer ("Rubber Lens") innovation which can be used as an added enhancement in a smart phone camera.Please review important disclosures on our website at www.seethruequity.com.About MV Portfolios, Inc.MV Portfolios, Inc.
