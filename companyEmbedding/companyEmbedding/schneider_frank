other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month

These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A -

	Frank Schneider assesses economic losses, loss causation, and valuation issues for companies and investors in a range of industries and across different classes of financial instruments. He also provides financial and statistical analyses for internal investigations. Dr. Schneider works with attorneys during all phases of the litigation process and prepares experts for deposition and trial. His primary areas of focus are litigation involving financial institutions, securities, valuation issues, and M&A transactions; and white collar litigation.



Financial institutions

	Addressed issues involving banks, insurance companies, mortgage originators, private equity firms, hedge funds, and mutual funds:


		Analyzed the relationship between economic trends, changes in the regulatory environment, and company performance, including recent casework involving the credit crisis and the resulting litigation related to mortgage-backed securities

		Addressed class certification issues in cases involving institutional investors

		Analyzed issues in the commercial banking industry, including private banking, regulatory capital requirements, loan loss reserves, and credit quality

		Analyzed structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and other off-balance-sheet conduits and the impact of liquidity on these entities

		Assessed quality of execution of foreign exchange transactions

		Analyzed market-wide liquidity as well as liquidity of specific securities

		Performed financial analysis of a portfolio of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and other structured products

		Examined determinants of profitability and alleged bid-rigging in municipal bond derivative transactions

		Assessed allegations of manipulation in setting of major interest rate benchmark

		Investigated investment strategies of hedge funds and mutual funds, including portfolio risk, performance, fees, and consistency with disclosed investment guidelines, as well as shareholder investment and redemption behavior

		Performed detailed analysis of hedge and mutual funds’ large-scale, position-level data that included equities, futures, swaps, and other securities


Securities litigation

	Analyzed loss causation, class certification, liability, and damages in Rule 10b-5, Section 11, and ERISA cases alleging accounting misstatements, fraudulent earnings guidance, and other misconduct:


		Evaluated whether securities traded in an efficient market

		Analyzed the stock price reaction to the release of news through event studies

		Examined characteristics of securities traded on multiple exchanges

		Analyzed the structure and leveraging effect of inverse floaters

		Assessed loss causation and damages in 401(k) company “stock drop” litigations

		Analyzed the stock market’s response to earnings surprises

		Researched the value of corporate control and voting rights


Valuation and M&A-related litigation

	Conducted valuation analyses in a range of contexts, including mergers and acquisitions, breach of contract, joint ventures, and the valuation of specific business lines or assets:


		Performed valuation of a major financial institution in the context of a merger during the credit crisis

		Analyzed valuation analyses contained in fairness opinions for M&A transactions

		Estimated lost profits from an alleged breach of contract

		Reviewed valuation models used by a financial institution to value CDOs

		Performed valuation analysis of the impact of the entry of a new drug into an existing market


White collar litigation


		Assessed damages in cases involving alleged Ponzi schemes

		Analyzed materiality and damages in insider trading cases


	Before joining Cornerstone Research, Dr. Schneider worked at Protego Asesores Financieros (now part of Evercore) as a senior investment banking analyst, focusing on private equity transactions, M&A transactions, and valuation matters. During his Ph.D. studies he consulted for the World Bank.
