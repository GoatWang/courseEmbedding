Welcome

Hendershot Investments, Inc., founded in 1994, provides professional investment advisory services. We are devoted to helping you improve your long-term financial success. Our personalized service is designed to grow and conserve your wealth by investing in high-quality, well-managed companies. More than 50 years of cumulative experience has taught our investment team that successful investing requires discipline, patience and the ability to stay rational, especially during periods of market volatility. As fiduciaries, we place our clients’ best interests above our own, acting with care, prudence and diligence on behalf of our clients, regardless of the impact on our firm. Our "fee-only" compensation removes potential conflicts of interests and aligns our interests with yours.  If your account grows, we grow too.

We build long-term relationships by understanding and serving our clients well. We remain disciplined, rational and focused on building our clients' wealth despite inevitable market volatility.

Our Team





Our Approach
Through extensive in-house research, we find high-quality companies with consistent, above-average growth and durable competitive advantages. We purchase these HI-quality stocks at reasonable valuations and hold them for the long-term. Investment portfolios are tailor-made to each client's unique circumstances and are managed on a continuous basis.
I don’t want a lot of good investments; I want a few outstanding ones. If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is almost never. —Philip Fisher







Investment Discipline

We are devoted to serving our clients with integrity. For us, our clients' best interests are first and foremost. Committed to diligence and continuous learning, we strive to provide wise advice and prudent stewardship of the assets entrusted to our care.  Having earned the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, we fully subscribe to the CFA Institute's Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Conduct.
It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you'll do things differently. —Warren Buffett
 

CFA Code of Ethics











 





HI-Quality Company News
 
As long-time students of the stock market, we have developed valuation models to assess the relative merits of HI-quality companies. We scour annual reports, SEC filings and news to independently determine company valuations, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of herd-mentality investing. Quarterly earnings conference calls with management keep us abreast of corporate developments and give us insight into the heartbeat of corporate leadership. On a daily basis, we post news from the HI-quality companies held in your portfolio.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

HI-Quality Company News
 
As long-time students of the stock market, we have developed valuation models to assess the relative merits of HI-quality companies. We scour annual reports, SEC filings and news to independently determine company valuations, thereby avoiding the pitfalls of herd-mentality investing. Quarterly earnings conference calls with management keep us abreast of corporate developments and give us insight into the heartbeat of corporate leadership. On a daily basis, we post news from the HI-quality companies held in your portfolio.
