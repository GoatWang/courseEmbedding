Biography
A longtime trailblazer in the field of microprocessors, Dr. Youssef A. El-Mansy has led the way in developing innovative yet manufacturable technologies. Thanks to his pioneering leadership, first as group vice president and now as corporate vice president and director of logic technology development, Intel has risen to the top of its field and the semiconductor technology cycle has accelerated from three years to two. Since he joined Intel Corporation, Hillsboro, Oregon in 1979, Dr. El-Mansy has led the development of logic technology from the 1-micron through 0.065 micron generation. He is primarily responsible for the "copy exactly" methodology, which enables high-yielding production ramps of new semiconductor processes at multiple sites at unprecedented rates.
An IEEE Fellow, Dr. El-Mansy has served the IEEE Electron Devices Society (EDS) on numerous committees and currently serves on the EDS VLSI Symposia Executive Committee. He has published over 30 papers and is the 2013 co-recipient, along with Sunlin Chou, of the IEEE Robert N. Noyce Medal for "establishing a highly effective research-development manufacturing methodology that led to industry leadership in logic technology for advanced microprocessor products."

Susan Badawy and Youssef El-Mansy's Wedding Website







MenuSusan and Youssef   September 30, 2017    • Silverton, OR70 days to go!Our StoryOur StoryFor years we have been Halloween birthday twins and Egyptian American acquaintances. The similarities were always uncanny but our timing never aligned. That is, until it was meant to. From rekindling our friendship over Instagram (ha!) to epiphany inducing dates/adventures, our love grew into what we have now. We find ourselves grateful beyond measure that we get to spend the rest of our lives together! The ProposalThe proposal was nothing short of breath-taking, literally! Youssef took me on a stunning (yet steep) hike up the Summit of Cascade Head. Although I had a pretty good feeling he was going to propose that weekend, I had no idea it was going to be on this hike. I thought there was no way he would make me hike to the top of this summit, looking a hot mess, then ask me to marry him. Once we got to the top, we were greeted with a gorgeous view of the coast line. Youssef set up a picnic for us to relax. Once Youssef asked me to stand up, I had an idea of what was about to happen. Sure enough, he got on one knee and made me the happiest girl in the world!
