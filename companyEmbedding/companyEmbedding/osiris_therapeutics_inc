Osiris Ransomware Removal Report


































				Osiris Ransomware			

Osiris Ransomware Description
The Osiris Ransomware belongs to a batch of variants of the Locky Ransomware family that have been released in the final months of 2016. The Osiris Ransomware identifies the files it encrypts through the use of the extension '.Osiris,' which come from the ancient Egyptian religion. This follows a pattern used in threats such as the '.thor' Ransomware, which also uses a mythological god in order to identify its threat. The Osiris Ransomware encrypts the victim's files to make them inaccessible and then demands the payment of a ransom. During its attack, the Osiris Ransomware will replace the files' names with random characters followed by the extension mentioned above. The Osiris Ransomware delivers a ransom note in the form of an HTML file, as well as changes the victim's desktop wallpaper image. The Osiris Ransomware attack is typical of these infections, essentially taking the victim's files hostage until the victim agrees to pay a large ransom of 2.5 BitCoin (approximately $2000 USD). 
An Underworld God Resurrected to Cause Harm to Innocent Files
The Osiris Ransomware attack is quite simple and a typical variant in these attacks. Since the first appearance of the Locky Ransomware family, countless variants of the threat have often been observed appearing in batches or waves and connected by common characteristics in their ransom notes or attacks. This points to the possibility of the Locky Ransomware family being a part of a RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) campaign, where con artists lease out their ransomware threats to other con artists to create attacks without having to go through the development process of creating a ransomware Trojan. Like other ransomware Trojans active today, the Osiris Ransomware encrypts the victim's files using a strong encryption algorithm, then demands that the victim pays a large ransom in exchange for the decryption key. 
Understanding How the Osiris Ransomware may Infect a Computer
The most common way in which the Osiris Ransomware is distributed is through the use of corrupted email attachments, often taking advantage of vulnerabilities in certain applications to download and install this threat. Because of this, one of the best ways to prevent the Osiris Ransomware infection is to handle unsolicited email messages with care and avoid file attachments or embedded links that may install the Osiris Ransomware or other threats on the victim's computer. 
The following is the full text of the Osiris Ransomware ransom note, contained in its HTML file and desktop image: 
'!!! IMPORTANT INFORMATION !!!
All of your files are encrypted with RSA-2048 and AES-128 ciphers.
More information about RSA and AES can be found here:
hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA (cryptosystem)
hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced Encryption Standard
Decrypting of your files is only possible with the private key and decrypt program, which is on our secret server.
To receive your private key follow one of the links:
If all of this addresses are not available, follow these steps:
1. Download and install Tor Browser: hxxp://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html
2. After a successful installation, run the browser and wait for initialisation.
3. Type in the address bar:
4. Follow the instructions on the site.
!!! Your personal identification ID: D56F3331E80D9E17 !!!'
This is a text that has been observed in various other variants of the Locky Ransomware family. When victims of the attack connect to the payment website, they receive the following message: 
'Locky Decryptor™
We present a special software - Locky Decryptor™ -
which allows to decrypt and return control to all your encrypted files.
How to buy Locky Decryptor™?
You can make a payment with BitCoins, there are many methods to get them.
You should register BitCoin wallet:

Infected with Osiris Ransomware? Scan Your PC			


		Download SpyHunter's Spyware Scannerto Detect Osiris Ransomware 	
	* SpyHunter's scanner is only for malware detection. If SpyHunter detects malware on your PC, you will need to purchase SpyHunter's malware removal tool to remove the malware threats. Read more on SpyHunter. If you no longer wish to have SpyHunter installed on your computer, follow these steps to uninstall SpyHunter.
Security Doesn't Let You Download SpyHunter or Access the Internet?

Solutions: Your computer may have malware hiding in memory that prevents any program, including SpyHunter, from executing on your computer. Follow to download SpyHunter and gain access to the Internet:


Use an alternative browser. Malware may disable your browser. If you're using IE, for example, and having problems downloading SpyHunter, you should open Firefox, Chrome or Safari browser instead.		

Use a removable media. Download SpyHunter on another clean computer, burn it to a USB flash drive, DVD/CD, or any preferred removable media, then install it on your infected computer and run SpyHunter's malware scanner.		

Start Windows in Safe Mode. If you can not access your Window's desktop, reboot your computer in "Safe Mode with Networking" and install SpyHunter in Safe Mode.		

IE Users: Disable proxy server for Internet Explorer to browse the web with Internet Explorer or update your anti-spyware program. Malware modifies your Windows settings to use a proxy server to prevent you from browsing the web with IE.

					Threat Scorecard
					?
						
							The ESG Threat Scorecard is an assessment report that is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our Malware Research Center. The ESG Threat Scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends, incidents and severity over time.
							
							In addition to the effective scoring for each threat, we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat. The data used for the ESG Threat Scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a 30-day period. The ESG Threat Scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats.
							
							Each of the fields listed on the ESG Threat Scorecard, containing a specific value, are as follows:
							
Ranking: The current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database.
							
Threat Level: The level of threat a particular PC threat could have on an infected computer. The threat level is based on a particular threat's behavior and other risk factors. We rate the threat level as low, medium or high. The different threat levels are discussed in the SpyHunter Risk Assessment Model.
							
Infected PCs: The number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected PCs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by SpyHunter's Spyware Scanner.
							
% Change: The daily percent change in the frequency of infected PCs of a specific threat. The formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat. An increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain. When a specific threat's ranking decreases, the percentage rate reflects its recent decline. For a specific threat remaining unchanged, the percent change remains in its current state. The % Change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges, in the last 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. Next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does, either upward or downward, in the rankings. Each level of movement is color coded: a green up-arrow (∧) indicates a rise, a red down-arrow (∨) indicates a decline, and a brown equal symbol (=) indicates no change or plateaued.
							
Top 3 Countries Infected: Lists the top three countries a particular threat has targeted the most over the past month. This data allows PC users to track the geographic distribution of a particular threat throughout the world.

Instructions to Download and Install SpyHunter - Remove Spyware & Malware with SpyHunter - Enigma Software Group USA LLC






























		Congratulations! Your SpyHunter download should begin shortly.	

		If your SpyHunter download/install did not start automatically, learn why you're having issues downloading SpyHunter or browsing the Internet.	

		For more details on SpyHunter and to understand our policies, please review our EULA, Privacy Policy and SpyHunter Risk Assessment Model.		If you no longer wish to use SpyHunter, follow these steps to uninstall SpyHunter from your computer.	


		IMPORTANT NOTICE IF YOU HAVE MALWAREBYTES ANTI-MALWARE INSTALLED	

		Malwarebytes Inc., the maker of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware ("MBAM") and AdwCleaner, is intentionally blocking SpyHunter and RegHunter for what we believe are competitive reasons. This creates an immediate incompatibility between SpyHunter and MBAM coexisting on the same PC.	

		We have taken legal action against Malwarebytes and are seeking remedies for this unfair conduct. We are very sorry for the inconvenience, but this is outside of our control. Malwarebytes Inc. initiated this course of action.	

		If you would like to use SpyHunter on your computer instead of MBAM, our development team has designed an alternative installer. This installer will disable MBAM and allow you to install SpyHunter.	

If you wish to install and use SpyHunter and disable MBAM, please click the button below:

		IMPORTANT NOTICE IF YOU HAVE MALWAREBYTES ANTI-MALWARE INSTALLED	

		Malwarebytes Inc., the maker of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware ("MBAM") and AdwCleaner, is intentionally blocking SpyHunter and RegHunter for what we believe are competitive reasons. This creates an immediate incompatibility between SpyHunter and MBAM coexisting on the same PC.	

		We have taken legal action against Malwarebytes and are seeking remedies for this unfair conduct. We are very sorry for the inconvenience, but this is outside of our control. Malwarebytes Inc. initiated this course of action.	

		If you would like to use SpyHunter on your computer instead of MBAM, our development team has designed an alternative installer. This installer will disable MBAM and allow you to install SpyHunter.	

If you wish to install and use SpyHunter and disable MBAM, please click the button below:

The Removal Tool for Osiris - SpyHunter 4 was developed Enigma Software and it's an anti-malware utility certified by West Coast Labs Checkmark Certification System. Enigma Software was observed and reviewed by many creditable media sources such as CNN.com, USA Today, PC World and Forbes.com. A lot of tests were performed and they proved that SpyHunter 4 has one of the best detection and removal ranks for Browser Hijackers and other Malware.


Osiris Information


The Osiris is a malware, also known as browser hijacker. Usually, most of the search engines are legitimate and not harmful; however, most of the browser hijackers are developed with one goal, which is to generate advertising revenues. Innocent users will be tricked into clicking on displayed ads or advertising banners, and the owners of malware will earn a fee for every click. You may find a lot of reports about the Osiris and how it changes browser setting, installs unwanted toolbars without users’ consent, and how hard is to remove it from the system. All of that is done in order to guarantee the advertising earnings for the search engines.
                    




Recommended Solution


If you want to remove the Osiris from your computer easily and securely, please download and install Removal Tool for the Osiris. This anti-malware utility was designed specifically to scan your system, find and remove any undesired browser add-ons and extensions and it is also optimized to protect Windows Operating Systems against any browser settings modifications without users' authorization.

Technology

Osiris leads the way and is focused on  developing regenerative medicine solutions that benefit patients.



MSC Primer
BioSmart
Product Pipeline




A Viable Solution to a Better Approach
Through more than 20 years of research and clinical work, Osiris not only defined the science and natural healing potential of cellular regenerative therapies but also created a body of work that established the medical community’s understanding of cellular technology. This technology has helped us better understand the interdependencies associated with 
 controlling inflammation, reducing fibrosis, and the regulation of tissue homeostasis and repair, including the development of BioSmart™ – a proprietary process for cell and tissue preservation that maintains the integrity of the biological materials. BioSmart™ serves as the manufacturing backbone for all Osiris products.




BioSmart™


Start with a Smart Approach
Osiris has developed and employs a cryopreservation process that maintains the natural activity of the tissue product. The basis of our BioSmart™ process includes preservation of the 3D matrix, endogenous growth factors, and tissue-resident cells.





MSC Primer


The Science of MSCs
Through our new IND, Osiris seeks to harness the abilities of cellular matrices to promote the body’s natural healing, delivering better therapeutic options for patients and physicians that improve treatment outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. To this end, we have advanced stem cell technology translated from the minds of visionary scientists to the treatment of patients in need. Along the way, through basic science and clinical research, Osiris has gained invaluable knowledge of cell-based solutions for unmet medical needs, including MSCs.

Cell types originating from MSCs are present through the entire body, and it has been shown that MSCs can be isolated from virtually any organ. Tissue protection, regeneration, and the ability to regulate inflammation are key activities of MSCs in the body, which illustrates the broad therapeutic potential of these cells.

 VIA FACSIMILE AND UPS C. Randall Mills, PhDChief Executive OfficerOsiris Therapeutics, Inc.7015 Albert Einstein DriveColumbia, MD 21046-1707 Dear Dr. Mills: During an inspection of your firm, Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., located at 7015 Albert Einstein Drive, Columbia, MD, from May 23 to June 4, 2013, investigators from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) collected information on the manufacture of a number of products that are derived from amniotic and chorionic tissue (amniotic/chorionic-based products). This information was provided to the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) for review. You are currently registered with the FDA to screen, test, package, process, store, label, and distribute a variety of amniotic/chorionic-based products. These products include: Ovation®,Grafix PRIME®, Grafix CORE®, and Grafix XC™, all of which are intended for use, among other things, in the repair, replacement, or reconstruction of tissue defects, as well as wound healing and tissue repair.  These amniotic/chorionic-based products are human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) as defined in 21 CFR 1271.3(d). However, these products are HCT/Ps that do not meet all of the criteria in 21 CFR 1271.10(a) and therefore, are not regulated solely under section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act) and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271. Your Ovation® product does not meet the minimal manipulation criterion set forth in 21 CFR 1271.3(f)(1) because your manufacturing process alters the original relevant characteristics of the tissue relating to the tissue’s utility for reconstruction, repair, or replacement. The original relevant characteristics of the structural tissue are altered significantly by the processing, which includes --------(b)(4)-------- of the chorionic membrane, ------------------------------------------------------------------------------(b)(4)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------. In addition, Ovation® and your products, Grafix PRIME®, Grafix CORE®, and Grafix XC™, do not meet the criterion in 21 CFR 1271.10(a)(4)(ii) because the products are dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for their primary function, and are not intended for autologous use or allogeneic use in a first or second degree relative. The HCT/Ps referenced above are drugs as defined under section 201(g) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 321(g)] and biological products as defined in section 351(i) of the PHS Act [42 U.S.C. 262(i)]. Please be advised that in order to lawfully market a drug that is also a biological product, a valid biologics license must be in effect [42 U.S.C. 262(a)]. Such licenses are issued only after a showing of safety and efficacy for the product's intended use. While in the development stage, such products may be distributed for clinical use in humans only if the sponsor has an investigational new drug (IND) application in effect as specified by FDA regulations [21 U.S.C. 355(i); 42 U.S.C. 262(a)(3); 21 CFR Part 312].  None of the amniotic/chorionic-based products described in this letter are the subject of an approved biologics license application (BLA), nor are there INDs in effect for any of these products. Based on this information, we have determined that your actions have violated the Act and the PHS Act. This letter is not intended to be an all-inclusive review of the products that your firm markets. It is your responsibility to ensure that all products marketed by your firm are in compliance with the Act and the PHS Act and their implementing regulations. We request that you notify this office, in writing, of the steps you have taken or will take to address the violations noted above and to prevent their recurrence. Your response should be sent to me at the following address: U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, HFM-600, 1401 Rockville Pike, Suite 200 N, Rockville, Maryland 20852-1448. If you have any questions regarding this matter, you may contact Anna M. Flynn at (301) 827-6201. Please be advised that only written communications are considered official. Sincerely,  /s/ Mary A. MalarkeyDirectorOffice of Compliance and Biologics QualityCenter for Biologics Evaluation and Research

Osiris Ransomware Removal Report


































				Osiris Ransomware			

Osiris Ransomware Description
The Osiris Ransomware belongs to a batch of variants of the Locky Ransomware family that have been released in the final months of 2016. The Osiris Ransomware identifies the files it encrypts through the use of the extension '.Osiris,' which come from the ancient Egyptian religion. This follows a pattern used in threats such as the '.thor' Ransomware, which also uses a mythological god in order to identify its threat. The Osiris Ransomware encrypts the victim's files to make them inaccessible and then demands the payment of a ransom. During its attack, the Osiris Ransomware will replace the files' names with random characters followed by the extension mentioned above. The Osiris Ransomware delivers a ransom note in the form of an HTML file, as well as changes the victim's desktop wallpaper image. The Osiris Ransomware attack is typical of these infections, essentially taking the victim's files hostage until the victim agrees to pay a large ransom of 2.5 BitCoin (approximately $2000 USD). 
An Underworld God Resurrected to Cause Harm to Innocent Files
The Osiris Ransomware attack is quite simple and a typical variant in these attacks. Since the first appearance of the Locky Ransomware family, countless variants of the threat have often been observed appearing in batches or waves and connected by common characteristics in their ransom notes or attacks. This points to the possibility of the Locky Ransomware family being a part of a RaaS (Ransomware as a Service) campaign, where con artists lease out their ransomware threats to other con artists to create attacks without having to go through the development process of creating a ransomware Trojan. Like other ransomware Trojans active today, the Osiris Ransomware encrypts the victim's files using a strong encryption algorithm, then demands that the victim pays a large ransom in exchange for the decryption key. 
Understanding How the Osiris Ransomware may Infect a Computer
The most common way in which the Osiris Ransomware is distributed is through the use of corrupted email attachments, often taking advantage of vulnerabilities in certain applications to download and install this threat. Because of this, one of the best ways to prevent the Osiris Ransomware infection is to handle unsolicited email messages with care and avoid file attachments or embedded links that may install the Osiris Ransomware or other threats on the victim's computer. 
The following is the full text of the Osiris Ransomware ransom note, contained in its HTML file and desktop image: 
'!!! IMPORTANT INFORMATION !!!
All of your files are encrypted with RSA-2048 and AES-128 ciphers.
More information about RSA and AES can be found here:
hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA (cryptosystem)
hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced Encryption Standard
Decrypting of your files is only possible with the private key and decrypt program, which is on our secret server.
To receive your private key follow one of the links:
If all of this addresses are not available, follow these steps:
1. Download and install Tor Browser: hxxp://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html
2. After a successful installation, run the browser and wait for initialisation.
3. Type in the address bar:
4. Follow the instructions on the site.
!!! Your personal identification ID: D56F3331E80D9E17 !!!'
This is a text that has been observed in various other variants of the Locky Ransomware family. When victims of the attack connect to the payment website, they receive the following message: 
'Locky Decryptor™
We present a special software - Locky Decryptor™ -
which allows to decrypt and return control to all your encrypted files.
How to buy Locky Decryptor™?

Infected with Osiris Ransomware? Scan Your PC			


		Download SpyHunter's Spyware Scannerto Detect Osiris Ransomware 	
	* SpyHunter's scanner is only for malware detection. If SpyHunter detects malware on your PC, you will need to purchase SpyHunter's malware removal tool to remove the malware threats. Read more on SpyHunter. If you no longer wish to have SpyHunter installed on your computer, follow these steps to uninstall SpyHunter.
Security Doesn't Let You Download SpyHunter or Access the Internet?

Solutions: Your computer may have malware hiding in memory that prevents any program, including SpyHunter, from executing on your computer. Follow to download SpyHunter and gain access to the Internet:


Use an alternative browser. Malware may disable your browser. If you're using IE, for example, and having problems downloading SpyHunter, you should open Firefox, Chrome or Safari browser instead.		

Use a removable media. Download SpyHunter on another clean computer, burn it to a USB flash drive, DVD/CD, or any preferred removable media, then install it on your infected computer and run SpyHunter's malware scanner.		

Start Windows in Safe Mode. If you can not access your Window's desktop, reboot your computer in "Safe Mode with Networking" and install SpyHunter in Safe Mode.		

IE Users: Disable proxy server for Internet Explorer to browse the web with Internet Explorer or update your anti-spyware program. Malware modifies your Windows settings to use a proxy server to prevent you from browsing the web with IE.

					Threat Scorecard
					?
						
							The ESG Threat Scorecard is an assessment report that is given to every malware threat that has been collected and analyzed through our Malware Research Center. The ESG Threat Scorecard evaluates and ranks each threat by using several metrics such as trends, incidents and severity over time.
							
							In addition to the effective scoring for each threat, we are able to interpret anonymous geographic data to list the top three countries infected with a particular threat. The data used for the ESG Threat Scorecard is updated daily and displayed based on trends for a 30-day period. The ESG Threat Scorecard is a useful tool for a wide array of computer users from end users seeking a solution to remove a particular threat or security experts pursuing analysis and research data on emerging threats.
							
							Each of the fields listed on the ESG Threat Scorecard, containing a specific value, are as follows:
							
Ranking: The current ranking of a particular threat among all the other threats found on our malware research database.
							
Threat Level: The level of threat a particular PC threat could have on an infected computer. The threat level is based on a particular threat's behavior and other risk factors. We rate the threat level as low, medium or high. The different threat levels are discussed in the SpyHunter Risk Assessment Model.
							
Infected PCs: The number of confirmed and suspected cases of a particular threat detected on infected PCs retrieved from diagnostic and scan log reports generated by SpyHunter's Spyware Scanner.
							
% Change: The daily percent change in the frequency of infected PCs of a specific threat. The formula for percent changes results from current trends of a specific threat. An increase in the rankings of a specific threat yields a recalculation of the percentage of its recent gain. When a specific threat's ranking decreases, the percentage rate reflects its recent decline. For a specific threat remaining unchanged, the percent change remains in its current state. The % Change data is calculated and displayed in three different date ranges, in the last 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days. Next to the percentage change is the trend movement a specific malware threat does, either upward or downward, in the rankings. Each level of movement is color coded: a green up-arrow (∧) indicates a rise, a red down-arrow (∨) indicates a decline, and a brown equal symbol (=) indicates no change or plateaued.
							
Top 3 Countries Infected: Lists the top three countries a particular threat has targeted the most over the past month. This data allows PC users to track the geographic distribution of a particular threat throughout the world.

Instructions to Download and Install SpyHunter - Remove Spyware & Malware with SpyHunter - Enigma Software Group USA LLC






























		Congratulations! Your SpyHunter download should begin shortly.	

		If your SpyHunter download/install did not start automatically, learn why you're having issues downloading SpyHunter or browsing the Internet.	

		For more details on SpyHunter and to understand our policies, please review our EULA, Privacy Policy and SpyHunter Risk Assessment Model.		If you no longer wish to use SpyHunter, follow these steps to uninstall SpyHunter from your computer.	


		IMPORTANT NOTICE IF YOU HAVE MALWAREBYTES ANTI-MALWARE INSTALLED	

		Malwarebytes Inc., the maker of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware ("MBAM") and AdwCleaner, is intentionally blocking SpyHunter and RegHunter for what we believe are competitive reasons. This creates an immediate incompatibility between SpyHunter and MBAM coexisting on the same PC.	

		We have taken legal action against Malwarebytes and are seeking remedies for this unfair conduct. We are very sorry for the inconvenience, but this is outside of our control. Malwarebytes Inc. initiated this course of action.	

		If you would like to use SpyHunter on your computer instead of MBAM, our development team has designed an alternative installer. This installer will disable MBAM and allow you to install SpyHunter.	

If you wish to install and use SpyHunter and disable MBAM, please click the button below:

		IMPORTANT NOTICE IF YOU HAVE MALWAREBYTES ANTI-MALWARE INSTALLED	

		Malwarebytes Inc., the maker of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware ("MBAM") and AdwCleaner, is intentionally blocking SpyHunter and RegHunter for what we believe are competitive reasons. This creates an immediate incompatibility between SpyHunter and MBAM coexisting on the same PC.	

		We have taken legal action against Malwarebytes and are seeking remedies for this unfair conduct. We are very sorry for the inconvenience, but this is outside of our control. Malwarebytes Inc. initiated this course of action.	

		If you would like to use SpyHunter on your computer instead of MBAM, our development team has designed an alternative installer. This installer will disable MBAM and allow you to install SpyHunter.	

If you wish to install and use SpyHunter and disable MBAM, please click the button below:

The Removal Tool for Osiris - SpyHunter 4 was developed Enigma Software and it's an anti-malware utility certified by West Coast Labs Checkmark Certification System. Enigma Software was observed and reviewed by many creditable media sources such as CNN.com, USA Today, PC World and Forbes.com. A lot of tests were performed and they proved that SpyHunter 4 has one of the best detection and removal ranks for Browser Hijackers and other Malware.


Osiris Information


The Osiris is a malware, also known as browser hijacker. Usually, most of the search engines are legitimate and not harmful; however, most of the browser hijackers are developed with one goal, which is to generate advertising revenues. Innocent users will be tricked into clicking on displayed ads or advertising banners, and the owners of malware will earn a fee for every click. You may find a lot of reports about the Osiris and how it changes browser setting, installs unwanted toolbars without users’ consent, and how hard is to remove it from the system. All of that is done in order to guarantee the advertising earnings for the search engines.
                    




Recommended Solution


If you want to remove the Osiris from your computer easily and securely, please download and install Removal Tool for the Osiris. This anti-malware utility was designed specifically to scan your system, find and remove any undesired browser add-ons and extensions and it is also optimized to protect Windows Operating Systems against any browser settings modifications without users' authorization.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

BBB Reason for Ratings


        BBB rating is based on 13 factors: Get the details about the factors considered.










BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Zappos.com has received 4.67 out of 5 stars based on 8 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
