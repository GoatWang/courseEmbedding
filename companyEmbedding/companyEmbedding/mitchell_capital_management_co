Investment Strategy 









We approach capital management with discipline and discernment, rolling up our sleeves for our clients every day. Investing is not about overnight wealth; rather, we believe investing is about the steady growth of assets over time. Investing is about achieving financial security while maintaining peace of mind.
We are conservative, disciplined, long-term managers of financial assets. It’s the only way we know. Our strategy is rooted in the enduring principles of Benjamin Graham; we pair his wisdom with our daily diligence in serving you. 
Our investment strategy starts and ends with you: we work hard each day to earn your trust because we know peace of mind is priceless. We carefully design investment programs that reflect a comprehensive understanding of each client’s risk tolerance, as well as preference for growth, income and stability. After extensive analysis and systematic appraisal, we select securities that match each client’s objectives. 
We monitor portfolios closely and continuously, staying alert to opportunities and sensitive to risk, and relieving clients of administrative tasks that accompany an investment program. Our investment philosophy is conservative and disciplined. And because we believe in taking good care of good people, we communicate throughout. Comprehensive reports are paired with ongoing conversation, because our relationship with you is the heart of our strategy.

History - Mitchell Capital









































Mitchell Capital - 



 




History 









Fred Mitchell had built a strong and admirable career in financial services, holding top roles in leading companies. But Fred had a vision for a firm that approached security analysis with discipline and discernment, a firm based on wisdom and strategy. It was with that passion that he founded Mitchell Capital Management in 1987 — and that same passion drives our firm today.
Our strategy is rooted in the enduring principles of 20th century economist Benjamin Graham. And we still apply traditional and time-tested principles to the modern market. Over the past nearly 30 years, our firm has expanded, with a growing team of talented professionals.
Today, the legacy of our investment process and client service is present every day, as we roll up our sleeves and approach capital management with diligence. Mitchell Capital is employee-owned, and each owner walks through the door every day. That’s how committed we are to the service of our clients. We work hard each day to earn your trust — because we know peace of mind is priceless.

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
