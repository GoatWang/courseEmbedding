Federal Street Acquisition Corp. Completes $460,000,000 Initial 
      Public Offering






July 24, 2017 04:01 PM Eastern Daylight Time



BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Federal Street Acquisition Corp. (the “Company”), a newly organized 
      blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, 
      capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, 
      reorganization or similar business combination with one or more 
      businesses, today announced the closing of its initial public offering 
      of 46,000,000 units, which includes 6,000,000 units issued pursuant to 
      the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option. The 
      offering was priced at $10.00 per unit, resulting in gross proceeds of 
      $460,000,000, before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions 
      and other offering expenses payable by the Company.
    

      The Company’s units began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the 
      ticker symbol “FSACU” on July 19, 2017. Each unit consists of one share 
      of the Company’s Class A common stock and one-half of one warrant. Each 
      whole warrant will entitle the holder thereof to purchase one share of 
      the Company’s Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. Once 
      the securities comprising the units begin separate trading, the Class A 
      common stock and warrants are expected to be listed on the NASDAQ 
      Capital Market under the ticker symbols “FSAC” and “FSACW,” respectively.
    

      Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and BofA Merrill Lynch served as joint 
      book-running managers of the offering.
    

      The offering was made only by means of a prospectus, copies of which may 
      be obtained from Citigroup Global Markets Inc., c/o Broadridge Financial 
      Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717, Telephone: (800)

      or BofA Merrill Lynch Attention: Prospectus Department, NC1-004-03-43, 
      200 North College Street, 3rd floor, Charlotte NC 28255-0001, dg.prospectus_requests@baml.com.
    

      A registration statement relating to the securities has been declared 
      effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on July 
      18, 2017. This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or 
      the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of 
      these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, 
      solicitation, or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or 
      qualification under the securities laws of any such state or 
      jurisdiction.
    

      This press release contains statements that constitute “forward-looking 
      statements,” including with respect to the proposed initial public 
      offering and the anticipated use of the net proceeds. No assurance can 
      be given that the offering discussed above will be completed on the 
      terms described, or at all, or that the net proceeds of the offering 
      will be used as indicated. Forward-looking statements are subject to 
      numerous conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the 
      Company, including those set forth in the Risk Factors section of the 
      Company’s registration statement and preliminary prospectus for the 
      Company’s offering filed with the SEC. Copies are available on the SEC’s 
      website, www.sec.gov.

      revisions or changes after the date of this release, except as required

Video webinar: Using Regulation A+ to list on a stock exchange

Posted on August 19, 2016 | Leave a comment


As detailed in our Bloomberg / Vintage educational webcast on the similarities and differences between the Reg A+ and time-tested IPO processes, Reg A+ can be a vehicle (Elio Motors pun intended) to list onto a national exchange.

.
So far, Elio Motors is the only Reg A+ issuers to execute that. It’s also interesting to learn of how an underwriter can participate in the process. 


Our experts on the webinar:

REPORT: Two-thirds of Wall Street use mobile devices for equity research

Posted on August 17, 2016 | Leave a comment


Ooooooh, so institutional investors do look up from their Bloomberg Portal once in a while. The comparative flip-flop with individual investors is perplexing: perhaps the tools favored by Main Street are not optimized for smart mobile user-experience (UX).

What shareholder communications can do to assure a smart UX for visitors is build/design your IR website to be responsive. Responsive design automatically displays content based on screen size, platform and orientation.
One important caveat – most IR websites cannot be built with responsive design if your main corporate site is not responsive. Generally, IR websites are constructed using corporate site’s look-and-feel, or to use webspeak, using the corporate website’s cascading style sheet (CSS).  The use of the CSS assures that shareholders have a consistent experience navigating throughout a company’s entire website.

Here are some examples of the sites we host: we can build a variety of design formats – at a variety of service packages to fit into a budget.

The success of the Confidential S-1 filing process is not confidential

Posted on August 16, 2016 | Leave a comment


On July 21, we celebrated the sixth birthday (anniversary?) of Dodd-Frank, and although some of the ruling’s initiatives are less than beloved by many, aka Volcker Rule, the “confidential IPO” bucketed under the JOBS Act has been an undisputed success.

I was reminded of this when reviewing last week’s list of companies who officially became “issuers.” All three were Emerging Growth Companies (EGC) and all three filed as a confidential IPO.

Airgain (wireless telecommunication equipment) filed confidentially as an EGC in Aug 2014, filed publicly in Jul 2016, raised $12m – priced below the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 12


Protagonist Therapeutics (biopharmaceuticals) filed confidentially as an EGC in May 2016, filed publicly in Jul 2016, raised $90m – priced within the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 11 and finished the day down 3%


Medpace (clinical contract research company) filed confidentially as an EGC in Mar 2016, filed publicly in Jun 2016, raised $161m – priced within the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 11 and finished the day up 21%

What is: Emerging Growth Company 
An Emerging Growth Company (EGC) is an issuer that has total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. 
What is: Confidential filing process 
An Emerging Growth Company can submit a confidential draft IPO registration to the SEC for review in advance of its initial public offering. This allows the company to hone their message and offering – especially with the SEC.It allows the company to change their mind about going public without anyone knowing. Publicly “pulling their IPO” is often viewed as a failure.
DOWNLOAD THE WORKFLOW WHITEPAPER HERE

The EGC and SEC are prohibited from publicly disclosing the confidential filing, comments, and amendments during this review process. As the EGC moves closer toward its IPO, the JOBS Act requires that these filings be made available to the public.
The EGC would be required to publicly file their draft registration and amendments, with the SEC no later than 15 days before its roadshow. Plus the SEC staff will publicly release its comment letter and responses to staff comment letters on confidential draft submissions after the registration statement for the IPO becomes effective but no sooner than 20 days after the effective date.
As you see in the three companies above, confidential does not equate to simple. Airgain needed two years to get into position.

2016 deals v. dollars for M&A

Posted on August 12, 2016 | Leave a comment


As reported in Mergermarket’s Global and Regional M&A: H1 2016 report, US dealmaking within the first half of 2016 has rebalanced with history – juxtaposed to 2015’s record-breaking values. M&A activity totaled US$ 562.7bn across 2,242 transactions, a 31.5% drop in value and decrease in volume by 342 transactions from H1 2015.

For Vintage, a deal’s dollar value is a moot point: we treat all deals at par, as the services we supply are agnostic. To be exact, a 50 million dollar acquisition demands the same level of virtual data room security as a one billion dollar acquisition. Likewise with the S-4 creation and filing. Accuracy is de rigueur.
Top dealmakers dollars v. deal count
Each week, we track that week’s underwriters (view here). It’s interesting to compare the top twenty dealmakers total (H1) dollar volume with the number of individual deals. As you see, the numbers don’t necessarily align.

Ping-ponging with the SEC as the IPO optimism pipeline grows

Posted on August 11, 2016 | Leave a comment


This past week, we’ve seen some positive pundit-isms towards what has been a sad year for IPOs.
Kathleen Smith, a principal at IPO-focused Renaissance Capital, expects a uptick the remaining of the year, but doesn’t expect 2016 to match the 170 IPOs and $30 billion raised in 2015, which itself was down from the 2014’s big IPO year.
“The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility. We’ve had some high volatility in the past year, but that’s moderated back down to normal levels.”
The IPO window is ready to open, “it’s just a matter of when,” said Garvis Toler, global head of capital markets at the New York Stock Exchange. “The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility. We’ve had some high volatility in the past year, but that’s moderated back down to normal levels. People need to perceive that it’s a hospitable environment.”
Liz Myers, JPMorgan’s global head of equity capital markets, reported that JPMorgan has 20+ IPOs in their global pipeline in September, and a “full pipeline” for the balance of 2017. Additionally, JP Morgan expects to see more than a dozen tech IPOs before the end of the year. Venture capitalists count more than 150 unicorns (privately held companies valued above $1 billion) in the US. IPOs bring big gains to VC firms and other early investors, allowing them to invest in the next star companies.
What do companies, especially Emerging Growth Companies, do as they prepare for their IPO?
Well… they prepare. One place to start is to understand the actual drafting registration process you’ll experience with the SEC. THIS WHITEPAPER ILLUSTRATES THAT PROCESS.

What you’ll see illustrated in the whitepaper is that the SEC will absolutely PONG back your PING, looking for sharper definition on one, some or all (eek!) of these topics:

Acquisitions
Contingencies
Divestitures
Estimates
Fair value
Goodwill impairment
Income taxes
Internal controls
MD&A
Non-GAAP abuse / reconciliation
Segment reporting
Stock compensation

As your securities lawyers will clearly express, “don’t take it personally.” SEC letters are a part of the process and the back-and-forth can take months, with an average of 8 months.
Lastly, although it is a bit of a ping pong match, its NOT a competition. The SEC wants companies to succeed while simultaneously protecting investors.

The SEC suggests redefining “smaller” to reduce filing burden for some issuers

Posted on August 10, 2016 | Leave a comment


The SEC has proposed an updated change regarding the definition and subsequent qualification of a SRC: smaller reporting company. 
Today, US issuers qualify as a SRC if they either 1.) have a public float of less than $75 million or 2.) for issuers without a public float, annual revenues of less than $50 million.
The benefit of being a SRC company is a lighter disclosure burden under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X including only having to disclose two years of audited financial statements and zero Compensation Discussion & Analysis reporting responsibility.
The new update would allow issuers to be re-classified as a SRC if they have 1.) a public float of less than $250 million or 2.) for companies without a public float, annual revenues of less than $100 million.
The updates are projected to reduce the work burden and costs for reporting (while still protecting investors) for close to 800 current non-SRC issuers… about 11% of all SEC reporting issuers.
One point: issuers with more than $75 million in public float, even if reclassified as a SRC, are still accelerated filers. Their 10-Q and 10-K filings deadlines do not change nor does their Sarbanes-Oxley 404 auditor verification reporting. Also, a SDC is still required to file XBRL –our team will assist in keep those fees low and accuracy high.
If all that is not confusing enough, a SRC can also be an EGC which may be not have SOX responsibilities. For sure, talk to your SEC lawyer, PDQ. You know… CYA.
Comments on the proposed rules are due August 30, 2016.

As of last week, in 2016, only 55 companies have rung the IPO bell on Wall Street (or in Times Square). This is 45%, YOY, of 2015 and 30%, YOY, of 2014. The money raised is the same percentages.
So, with such dramatic reductions in S-1 filings, what has kept our Capital Markets Operations Team so busy? Mergers.

2016’s domestic M&A, although down one-fourth from last years’ tremendous activity, has kept our transactions pros working all three shifts.** SEC form S-4 can be as complicated as an IPO’s S-1 and, absolutely, the production precision needed is equal.
Prior the S-4, our team is onboarding and training the appropriate working groups to manage their virtual data room (VIEW DEMO VIDEO) – assuring the right content gets into the right folders and that the wrongs eyes don’t have access. Security and administrative permissioning is paramount.
Why are companies exiting via M&A rather than an IPO? The Wall Street Journal states several factors, including the soft market performance of many IPOs, buyers’ appetite for great targets and, notably, the underlying patience of Private Equity.
From the WSJ:
“Trader Corp., an online automotive marketplace owned by private-equity firm Apax Partners, was days away from publicly unveiling its IPO plans in early July when it announced a deal to sell itself to Thoma Bravo LLC for about $1.2 billion, according to several people close to the deal. The move surprised many of the company’s IPO bankers, who expected the company to fetch a higher valuation in a public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.”
Regardless of a company’s individual exit strategy, we’re pleased so many are allowing us to help them execute their plan.

**NOTE: By operating three shifts – typesetting, EDGARizing, production – we mitigate rush charges to clients. We KNOW filings are always on deadline. It’s the nature of the business. Charging “rush” charges rarely makes sense.

The success of the Confidential S-1 filing process is not confidential

Posted on August 16, 2016 | Leave a comment


On July 21, we celebrated the sixth birthday (anniversary?) of Dodd-Frank, and although some of the ruling’s initiatives are less than beloved by many, aka Volcker Rule, the “confidential IPO” bucketed under the JOBS Act has been an undisputed success.

I was reminded of this when reviewing last week’s list of companies who officially became “issuers.” All three were Emerging Growth Companies (EGC) and all three filed as a confidential IPO.

Airgain (wireless telecommunication equipment) filed confidentially as an EGC in Aug 2014, filed publicly in Jul 2016, raised $12m – priced below the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 12


Protagonist Therapeutics (biopharmaceuticals) filed confidentially as an EGC in May 2016, filed publicly in Jul 2016, raised $90m – priced within the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 11 and finished the day down 3%


Medpace (clinical contract research company) filed confidentially as an EGC in Mar 2016, filed publicly in Jun 2016, raised $161m – priced within the range – traded on the NASDAQ on Aug 11 and finished the day up 21%

What is: Emerging Growth Company 
An Emerging Growth Company (EGC) is an issuer that has total annual gross revenues of less than $1 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year. 
What is: Confidential filing process 
An Emerging Growth Company can submit a confidential draft IPO registration to the SEC for review in advance of its initial public offering. This allows the company to hone their message and offering – especially with the SEC.It allows the company to change their mind about going public without anyone knowing. Publicly “pulling their IPO” is often viewed as a failure.
DOWNLOAD THE WORKFLOW WHITEPAPER HERE

The EGC and SEC are prohibited from publicly disclosing the confidential filing, comments, and amendments during this review process. As the EGC moves closer toward its IPO, the JOBS Act requires that these filings be made available to the public.
The EGC would be required to publicly file their draft registration and amendments, with the SEC no later than 15 days before its roadshow. Plus the SEC staff will publicly release its comment letter and responses to staff comment letters on confidential draft submissions after the registration statement for the IPO becomes effective but no sooner than 20 days after the effective date.
As you see in the three companies above, confidential does not equate to simple. Airgain needed two years to get into position.

2016 deals v. dollars for M&A

Posted on August 12, 2016 | Leave a comment


As reported in Mergermarket’s Global and Regional M&A: H1 2016 report, US dealmaking within the first half of 2016 has rebalanced with history – juxtaposed to 2015’s record-breaking values. M&A activity totaled US$ 562.7bn across 2,242 transactions, a 31.5% drop in value and decrease in volume by 342 transactions from H1 2015.

For Vintage, a deal’s dollar value is a moot point: we treat all deals at par, as the services we supply are agnostic. To be exact, a 50 million dollar acquisition demands the same level of virtual data room security as a one billion dollar acquisition. Likewise with the S-4 creation and filing. Accuracy is de rigueur.
Top dealmakers dollars v. deal count
Each week, we track that week’s underwriters (view here). It’s interesting to compare the top twenty dealmakers total (H1) dollar volume with the number of individual deals. As you see, the numbers don’t necessarily align.

Ping-ponging with the SEC as the IPO optimism pipeline grows

Posted on August 11, 2016 | Leave a comment


This past week, we’ve seen some positive pundit-isms towards what has been a sad year for IPOs.
Kathleen Smith, a principal at IPO-focused Renaissance Capital, expects a uptick the remaining of the year, but doesn’t expect 2016 to match the 170 IPOs and $30 billion raised in 2015, which itself was down from the 2014’s big IPO year.
“The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility. We’ve had some high volatility in the past year, but that’s moderated back down to normal levels.”
The IPO window is ready to open, “it’s just a matter of when,” said Garvis Toler, global head of capital markets at the New York Stock Exchange. “The enemy of a healthy IPO market is uncertainty and volatility. We’ve had some high volatility in the past year, but that’s moderated back down to normal levels. People need to perceive that it’s a hospitable environment.”
Liz Myers, JPMorgan’s global head of equity capital markets, reported that JPMorgan has 20+ IPOs in their global pipeline in September, and a “full pipeline” for the balance of 2017. Additionally, JP Morgan expects to see more than a dozen tech IPOs before the end of the year. Venture capitalists count more than 150 unicorns (privately held companies valued above $1 billion) in the US. IPOs bring big gains to VC firms and other early investors, allowing them to invest in the next star companies.
What do companies, especially Emerging Growth Companies, do as they prepare for their IPO?
Well… they prepare. One place to start is to understand the actual drafting registration process you’ll experience with the SEC. THIS WHITEPAPER ILLUSTRATES THAT PROCESS.

What you’ll see illustrated in the whitepaper is that the SEC will absolutely PONG back your PING, looking for sharper definition on one, some or all (eek!) of these topics:

Acquisitions
Contingencies
Divestitures
Estimates
Fair value
Goodwill impairment
Income taxes
Internal controls
MD&A
Non-GAAP abuse / reconciliation
Segment reporting
Stock compensation

As your securities lawyers will clearly express, “don’t take it personally.” SEC letters are a part of the process and the back-and-forth can take months, with an average of 8 months.
Lastly, although it is a bit of a ping pong match, its NOT a competition. The SEC wants companies to succeed while simultaneously protecting investors.

The SEC suggests redefining “smaller” to reduce filing burden for some issuers

Posted on August 10, 2016 | Leave a comment


The SEC has proposed an updated change regarding the definition and subsequent qualification of a SRC: smaller reporting company. 
Today, US issuers qualify as a SRC if they either 1.) have a public float of less than $75 million or 2.) for issuers without a public float, annual revenues of less than $50 million.
The benefit of being a SRC company is a lighter disclosure burden under Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X including only having to disclose two years of audited financial statements and zero Compensation Discussion & Analysis reporting responsibility.
The new update would allow issuers to be re-classified as a SRC if they have 1.) a public float of less than $250 million or 2.) for companies without a public float, annual revenues of less than $100 million.
The updates are projected to reduce the work burden and costs for reporting (while still protecting investors) for close to 800 current non-SRC issuers… about 11% of all SEC reporting issuers.
One point: issuers with more than $75 million in public float, even if reclassified as a SRC, are still accelerated filers. Their 10-Q and 10-K filings deadlines do not change nor does their Sarbanes-Oxley 404 auditor verification reporting. Also, a SDC is still required to file XBRL –our team will assist in keep those fees low and accuracy high.
If all that is not confusing enough, a SRC can also be an EGC which may be not have SOX responsibilities. For sure, talk to your SEC lawyer, PDQ. You know… CYA.
Comments on the proposed rules are due August 30, 2016.

Experts for corporate exit execution

Posted on August 9, 2016 | Leave a comment


As of last week, in 2016, only 55 companies have rung the IPO bell on Wall Street (or in Times Square). This is 45%, YOY, of 2015 and 30%, YOY, of 2014. The money raised is the same percentages.
So, with such dramatic reductions in S-1 filings, what has kept our Capital Markets Operations Team so busy? Mergers.

2016’s domestic M&A, although down one-fourth from last years’ tremendous activity, has kept our transactions pros working all three shifts.** SEC form S-4 can be as complicated as an IPO’s S-1 and, absolutely, the production precision needed is equal.
Prior the S-4, our team is onboarding and training the appropriate working groups to manage their virtual data room (VIEW DEMO VIDEO) – assuring the right content gets into the right folders and that the wrongs eyes don’t have access. Security and administrative permissioning is paramount.
Why are companies exiting via M&A rather than an IPO? The Wall Street Journal states several factors, including the soft market performance of many IPOs, buyers’ appetite for great targets and, notably, the underlying patience of Private Equity.
From the WSJ:
“Trader Corp., an online automotive marketplace owned by private-equity firm Apax Partners, was days away from publicly unveiling its IPO plans in early July when it announced a deal to sell itself to Thoma Bravo LLC for about $1.2 billion, according to several people close to the deal. The move surprised many of the company’s IPO bankers, who expected the company to fetch a higher valuation in a public offering, according to people familiar with the matter.”
Regardless of a company’s individual exit strategy, we’re pleased so many are allowing us to help them execute their plan.

**NOTE: By operating three shifts – typesetting, EDGARizing, production – we mitigate rush charges to clients. We KNOW filings are always on deadline. It’s the nature of the business. Charging “rush” charges rarely makes sense.

Notes to
Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

NOTE 1
NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

NATURE OF
OPERATIONS

Robin
Street Acquisition Corporation (the "Company") was incorporated on
July 22, 2016 under the laws of the state of Delaware to engage in
any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to,
selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company has been in the
developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have
been limited to issuing shares to its original shareholders. The
Company will attempt to locate and negotiate with a business entity
for the combination of that target company with Robin Street. The
combination will normally take the form of a merger,
stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets exchange. In most
instances the target company will wish to structure the business
combination to be within the definition of a tax-free
reorganization under
Section 351 or Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. No assurances can be given that the Company will be
successful in locating or negotiating with any target company. The
Company has been formed to provide a method for a foreign or
domestic private company to become a reporting company with a class
of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.

BASIS OF
PRESENTATION

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is
designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited
condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the
Company's management, who are responsible for their integrity and
objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("GAAP") in all material respects, and have been consistently
applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial
statements.

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP") were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.
The results for the period from July 22, 2016 (Inception) to
September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

USE OF
ESTIMATES

The
preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in
conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.

CASH

Cash and
cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking
institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments
with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company did not
have cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016.

CONCENTRATION
OF RISK

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations
of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company places its
cash with high quality banking institutions. The Company did not
have cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation limit as of September 30, 2016.

INCOME
TAXES

Under ASC
740, "Income Taxes," deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
temporary differences between the financial statement carrying
amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax
bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years
in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered
or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more
likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized. As of Sesptember 30, 2016 there were no deferred
taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating
loss or carry forward prior to expiration.

LOSS PER
COMMON SHARE

Basic loss
per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net
loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted loss per common share reflect the
potential dilution that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into
common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then
shared in the loss of the entity. As of September 30, 2016, there
are no outstanding dilutive securities.

FAIR VALUE
OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements
of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value
measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a
recurring basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for
fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are
recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed
financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant
unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are as follows:

Level 1
inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for
identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to
access at the measurement date.

Level 2
inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1
that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly.

Level 3
inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. The
carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their
fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

On
November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes. The Board
is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce
complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).
The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify,
evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting
principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced
while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information
provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an
entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into
current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of
financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income
taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax
liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified
statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update
apply to all entities that present a classified statement of
financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax
liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be
offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the
amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the
amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements
issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and
interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is
permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or
annual reporting period. The Company is still in the process of
evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

On June
12, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-10-Technical Corrections
and Improvements. The amendments in this Update cover a wide range
of Topics in the Codification. The amendments in this Update
represent changes to make minor corrections or minor improvements
to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant
effect on current accounting practice or create a significant
administrative cost to most entities. This Accounting Standards
Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update
2014-240-Technical Corrections and Improvements, which has been
deleted. Transition guidance varies based on the amendments in this
Update. The amendments in this Update that require transition
guidance are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. All other amendments will be effective upon the
issuance of this Update. Management is in the process of assessing
the impact of this ASU on the Company's financial
statements.

Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements

On April
30, 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-06 Earnings Per Share
(Topic 260):
Effects on Historical Earnings per Units of Master Limited
Partnership Dropdown Transactions. Under Topic 260, Earnings Per
Share, master limited partnerships (MLPs) apply the two-class
method to calculate earnings per unit (EPU) because the general
partner, limited partners, and incentive distribution rights
holders each participate differently in the distribution of
available cash. When a general partner transfers (or "drops down")
net assets to a master limited partnership and that transaction is
accounted for as a transaction between entities under common
control, the statements of operations of the master limited
partnership are adjusted retrospectively to reflect the dropdown
transaction as if it occurred on the earliest date during which the
entities were under common control. The amendments in this Update
specify that for purposes of calculating historical EPU under the
