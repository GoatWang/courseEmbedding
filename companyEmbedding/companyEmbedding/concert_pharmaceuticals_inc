ACRYSOF® IQ TORIC INTRAOCULAR LENSES IMPORTANT PRODUCT INFORMATION




CAUTION:
   
	Federal (USA) law restricts this device to the sale by or on the order of a physician.



INDICATIONS:
   
    The AcrySof® IQ Toric posterior chamber intraocular lenses are intended for primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for visual correction of aphakia and pre-existing corneal astigmatism secondary to removal of a cataractous lens in adult patients with or without presbyopia, who desire improved uncorrected distance vision, reduction of residual refractive cylinder and increased spectacle independence for distance vision.



WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS:
    
   Careful preoperative evaluation and sound clinical judgment should be used by the surgeon to decide the risk/benefit ratio before implanting a lens in a patient with any of the conditions described in the Directions for Use labeling. Toric IOLs should not be implanted if the posterior capsule is ruptured, if the zonules are damaged, or if a primary posterior capsulotomy is planned. Rotation can reduce astigmatic correction; if necessary lens repositioning should occur as early as possible prior to lens encapsulation. All viscoelastics should be removed from both the anterior and posterior sides of the lens; residual viscoelastics may allow the lens to rotate.
   

	Optical theory suggests that high astigmatic patients (i.e., > 2.5 D) may experience spatial distortions. Possible toric IOL related factors may include residual cylindrical error or axis misalignments. Prior to surgery, physicians should provide prospective patients with a copy of the Patient Information Brochure available from Alcon for this product informing them of possible risks and benefits associated with the AcrySof® IQ Toric Cylinder Power IOLs. 


	Studies have shown that color vision discrimination is not adversely affected in individuals with the AcrySof® Natural IOL and normal color vision. The effect on vision of the AcrySof® Natural IOL in subjects with hereditary color vision defects and acquired color vision defects secondary to ocular disease (e.g., glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, chronic uveitis, and other retinal or optic nerve diseases) has not been studied. Do not resterilize; do not store over 45° C; use only sterile irrigating solutions such as BSS® or BSS PLUS® Sterile Intraocular Irrigating Solutions.



 ATTENTION:
   
	Reference the Directions for Use labeling for a complete listing of indications, warnings and precautions.

Product Pipeline - Concert Pharmaceuticals



















































Concert Pharmaceuticals
Product Pipeline
Our innovative approach to drug development has resulted in multiple drug candidates that are progressing in clinical development.  For each drug candidate, application of our DCE Platform® resulted in a novel, differentiated, and potentially superior product, building on a product concept that starts with an approved drug.
Through our wholly owned development candidates and our strategic collaborators, our DCE Platform-derived pipeline of product candidates includes novel drugs to treat a range of disease areas including autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and central nervous system (CNS) disorders
To learn more about Concert’s sponsored clinical trials, please visit clinicaltrials.gov.

Proprietary Drug Candidates

CTP-656: CTP-656 is an investigational cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that has the potential to be used as part of future once-daily combination regimens of CFTR modulators that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. In a Phase 1 cross-over comparison of CTP-656 and Kalydeco, CTP-656 demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile compared to Kalydeco including a reduced rate of clearance, longer half-life, substantially increased exposure and greater plasma levels at 24 hours. CTP-656 has been granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  In July 2017, Vertex acquired  worldwide development and commercialization rights to CTP-656 and other assets related to the treatment of cystic fibrosis.
CTP-543: CTP-543 is an oral selective inhibitor of certain Janus kinases, known as JAK1 and JAK2, that we are developing for the treatment of alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that results in partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and/or body. CTP-543 was discovered by applying our deuterium chemistry technology to modify ruxolitinib, which is commercially available under the name Jakafi® in the U.S. for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Ruxolitinib has been used in an academic investigator-sponsored clinical trial and has been shown to promote hair growth in individuals with alopecia areata.  We conducted preclinical studies demonstrating that CTP-543 retains ruxolitinib’s JAK1and JAK2 inhibition profile and showing improved metabolic stability relative to ruxolitinib.  A Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating CTP-543 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe alopecia areata is underway.

Partnered Drug Candidates

AVP-786: AVP-786 is a combination of a deuterium-substituted dextromethorphan analog and a low dose of quinidine being investigated for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Avanir is conducting several Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate AVP-786 for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, the most advanced of which are Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of agitation associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
JZP-386: JZP-386 is a product candidate containing deuterated sodium oxybate for potential use in patients with narcolepsy, which is in development in collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals. Sodium oxybate is the active ingredient in the marketed drug Xyrem. Jazz Pharmaceuticals is exploring formulation options designed to leverage the positive effects observed with JZP-386 in the Phase 1 trials.
CTP-730: CTP-730 is a deuterated apremilast analog for the potential treatment of inflammatory disease, which is in development under a multi-product collaboration with Celgene. Phase 1 testing of CTP-730 is complete.

 Our DCE Platform-driven pipeline of product candidates includes novel drugs that offer the potential to target a range of diseases including autoimmune disorders, inflammation, and CNS disorders.

Proprietary Drug Candidates

CTP-656: CTP-656 is an investigational cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) potentiator that has the potential to be used as part of future once-daily combination regimens of CFTR modulators that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. In a Phase 1 cross-over comparison of CTP-656 and Kalydeco, CTP-656 demonstrated a superior pharmacokinetic profile compared to Kalydeco including a reduced rate of clearance, longer half-life, substantially increased exposure and greater plasma levels at 24 hours. CTP-656 has been granted orphan drug designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  In July 2017, Vertex acquired  worldwide development and commercialization rights to CTP-656 and other assets related to the treatment of cystic fibrosis.
CTP-543: CTP-543 is an oral selective inhibitor of certain Janus kinases, known as JAK1 and JAK2, that we are developing for the treatment of alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that results in partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and/or body. CTP-543 was discovered by applying our deuterium chemistry technology to modify ruxolitinib, which is commercially available under the name Jakafi® in the U.S. for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. Ruxolitinib has been used in an academic investigator-sponsored clinical trial and has been shown to promote hair growth in individuals with alopecia areata.  We conducted preclinical studies demonstrating that CTP-543 retains ruxolitinib’s JAK1and JAK2 inhibition profile and showing improved metabolic stability relative to ruxolitinib.  A Phase 2a clinical trial evaluating CTP-543 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe alopecia areata is underway.

Partnered Drug Candidates

AVP-786: AVP-786 is a combination of a deuterium-substituted dextromethorphan analog and a low dose of quinidine being investigated for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Avanir is conducting several Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate AVP-786 for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders, the most advanced of which are Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of agitation associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
JZP-386: JZP-386 is a product candidate containing deuterated sodium oxybate for potential use in patients with narcolepsy, which is in development in collaboration with Jazz Pharmaceuticals. Sodium oxybate is the active ingredient in the marketed drug Xyrem. Jazz Pharmaceuticals is exploring formulation options designed to leverage the positive effects observed with JZP-386 in the Phase 1 trials.
CTP-730: CTP-730 is a deuterated apremilast analog for the potential treatment of inflammatory disease, which is in development under a multi-product collaboration with Celgene. Phase 1 testing of CTP-730 is complete.

 Our DCE Platform-driven pipeline of product candidates includes novel drugs that offer the potential to target a range of diseases including autoimmune disorders, inflammation, and CNS disorders.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Concert Pharma stock drops 10% after FDA puts hair loss drug on clinical hold
Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares dropped 9.7% to $14.50 Wednesday morning after the Food and Drug Administration put its hair loss drug on clinical hold. The regulator imposed the hold before subjects in the phase 2a trial were dosed, and said that it needed to review certain toxicology studies to support the one-year dosing planned for the trial. "The FDA did not cite a safety concern," said Concert Pharma. The company plans to submit the requested reports soon, after which the FDA has 30 days to tell Concert Pharma whether it will lift the clinical hold. The drug in question, CTP-543, is intended for the autoimmune skin disease alopecia areata, which causes hair loss typically on the scalp and face, and affects nearly 7 million people in the U.S., according to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. Concert Pharma shares have risen 44.1% over the last three months, compared with a 1.4% rise in the S&P 500 .

Concert Pharma stock drops 10% after FDA puts hair loss drug on clinical hold
Concert Pharmaceuticals Inc.  shares dropped 9.7% to $14.50 Wednesday morning after the Food and Drug Administration put its hair loss drug on clinical hold. The regulator imposed the hold before subjects in the phase 2a trial were dosed, and said that it needed to review certain toxicology studies to support the one-year dosing planned for the trial. "The FDA did not cite a safety concern," said Concert Pharma. The company plans to submit the requested reports soon, after which the FDA has 30 days to tell Concert Pharma whether it will lift the clinical hold. The drug in question, CTP-543, is intended for the autoimmune skin disease alopecia areata, which causes hair loss typically on the scalp and face, and affects nearly 7 million people in the U.S., according to the National Alopecia Areata Foundation. Concert Pharma shares have risen 44.1% over the last three months, compared with a 1.4% rise in the S&P 500 .

AcrySof® IQ Toric IOL+








ACRYSOF® IQ TORIC INTRAOCULAR LENSES IMPORTANT PRODUCT INFORMATION




CAUTION:
   
	Federal (USA) law restricts this device to the sale by or on the order of a physician.



INDICATIONS:
   
    The AcrySof® IQ Toric posterior chamber intraocular lenses are intended for primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for visual correction of aphakia and pre-existing corneal astigmatism secondary to removal of a cataractous lens in adult patients with or without presbyopia, who desire improved uncorrected distance vision, reduction of residual refractive cylinder and increased spectacle independence for distance vision.



WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS:
    
   Careful preoperative evaluation and sound clinical judgment should be used by the surgeon to decide the risk/benefit ratio before implanting a lens in a patient with any of the conditions described in the Directions for Use labeling. Toric IOLs should not be implanted if the posterior capsule is ruptured, if the zonules are damaged, or if a primary posterior capsulotomy is planned. Rotation can reduce astigmatic correction; if necessary lens repositioning should occur as early as possible prior to lens encapsulation. All viscoelastics should be removed from both the anterior and posterior sides of the lens; residual viscoelastics may allow the lens to rotate.
   

	Optical theory suggests that high astigmatic patients (i.e., > 2.5 D) may experience spatial distortions. Possible toric IOL related factors may include residual cylindrical error or axis misalignments. Prior to surgery, physicians should provide prospective patients with a copy of the Patient Information Brochure available from Alcon for this product informing them of possible risks and benefits associated with the AcrySof® IQ Toric Cylinder Power IOLs. 


	Studies have shown that color vision discrimination is not adversely affected in individuals with the AcrySof® Natural IOL and normal color vision. The effect on vision of the AcrySof® Natural IOL in subjects with hereditary color vision defects and acquired color vision defects secondary to ocular disease (e.g., glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, chronic uveitis, and other retinal or optic nerve diseases) has not been studied. Do not resterilize; do not store over 45° C; use only sterile irrigating solutions such as BSS® or BSS PLUS® Sterile Intraocular Irrigating Solutions.



 ATTENTION:
   
	Reference the Directions for Use labeling for a complete listing of indications, warnings and precautions.

ACRYSOF® IQ TORIC INTRAOCULAR LENSES IMPORTANT PRODUCT INFORMATION




CAUTION:
   
	Federal (USA) law restricts this device to the sale by or on the order of a physician.



INDICATIONS:
   
    The AcrySof® IQ Toric posterior chamber intraocular lenses are intended for primary implantation in the capsular bag of the eye for visual correction of aphakia and pre-existing corneal astigmatism secondary to removal of a cataractous lens in adult patients with or without presbyopia, who desire improved uncorrected distance vision, reduction of residual refractive cylinder and increased spectacle independence for distance vision.



WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS:
    
   Careful preoperative evaluation and sound clinical judgment should be used by the surgeon to decide the risk/benefit ratio before implanting a lens in a patient with any of the conditions described in the Directions for Use labeling. Toric IOLs should not be implanted if the posterior capsule is ruptured, if the zonules are damaged, or if a primary posterior capsulotomy is planned. Rotation can reduce astigmatic correction; if necessary lens repositioning should occur as early as possible prior to lens encapsulation. All viscoelastics should be removed from both the anterior and posterior sides of the lens; residual viscoelastics may allow the lens to rotate.
