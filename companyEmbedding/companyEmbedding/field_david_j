Overview



Playing While White argues that whiteness matters in sports culture, both on and off the field. Offering critical analysis of athletic stars such as Johnny Manziel, Marshall Henderson, Jordan Spieth, Lance Armstrong, Josh Hamilton, as well as the predominantly white cultures of NASCAR and extreme sports, David Leonard identifies how whiteness is central to the commodification of athletes and the sports they play.Leonard demonstrates that sporting cultures are a key site in the trafficking of racial ideas, narratives, and ideologies. He identifies how white athletes are frequently characterized as intelligent leaders who are presumed innocent of the kinds of transgressions black athletes are often pathologized for. With an analysis of the racial dynamics of sports traditions as varied as football, cycling, hockey, baseball, tennis, snowboarding, and soccer, as well as the reception and media portrayals of specific white athletes, Leonard examines how and why whiteness matters within sports and what that tells us about race in the twenty-first century United States.

What People are Saying About This


Joshua Newman
Issues of white privilege, and broader considerations of ‘whiteness’ as social construction, are critical to contemporary US social and political discourse. In Playing While White, Leonard expertly explicates the extent to which sport plays an important role in constructing and privileging white identity politics in American society.

Jessica Luther
Leonard's in-depth investigation at how whiteness operates in sport (and, in turn, our society at large) is smart, cutting, nuanced, and, above all, important. It is a necessary work for this time.

Bomani Jones
For years, Leonard has demonstrated an understanding of the modern sporting landscape and a touch for applying academic insight to this most secular world. His voice and mind lend both gravity and dexterity on these topics.

Mark Anthony Neal
Few have talked about race and sports with the passion and critical acuity of David J. Leonard. With Playing While White, he takes the road less paved and turns his attention to Whiteness, exploding the myths of privilege and entitlement that we are all too willing to assign to Black Athletes.

Lori Martin
Examines the effects of the dominant racial ideology on American sports and highlights the ways that whiteness is privileged above other racial identities. Playing While White will appeal to sports fans interested in ways to explain the racial disparities in American sports.

Dave Zirin
David Leonard is one of our most brutally honest truth tellers. He uses sports as a lens to understand how sports can both challenge and perpetuate institutionalized racism. It's a book for the conscious sports fan and people unafraid to discuss these issues ..with candor and clarity. I can't recommend it enough.

Michael Eric Dyson
Systemic racism is often explored within the contexts of many of our institutions: government, education, criminal justice. Playing While White thoughtfully engages in a discourse around the privilege that whiteness affords, highlighting the ways that white athletes and whiteness are profiled as innocent, desirable, smart, and exceptional. This is in sharp juxtaposition to the way that Black bodies continue to be policed and profiled, demonized and denigrated both on and off of the field. This poses the following query: do Black lives matter in the world of sports? Leonard's brilliant and thorough analysis of the institutionalized racism that is perpetrated in sport is one that we must all delve deeper into, and grapple with, as a society.

James Spaulding, recently deceased after military action, finds himself in a new body courtesy of top grade medical cover. But physical miracles don't always heal the mind.  Traumatised by his experiences, he accepts an invitation from his sister to spend time at a remote house in Cornwall, England.     

Annabella Spaulding has inherited an extraordinary property from their estranged grandfather. A man neither has seen since childhood.  Taking her husband and two brothers with her, Annabella seeks to heal the painful rifts between them.  

But when owners of a local mine show an unhealthy interest in the property, it becomes worryingly apparent their grandfather may not have died from natural causes.  Monsters lurk in the quiet places. And they want to get into the house.

There is a great secret bound within the house, and digging through the clues to discover the truth James and his sister risk tearing down the walls of sanity and reality.

                    By iceanark  
                

                                        Apr 24, 2015
                


                                Oakfield kept me reading every night. I love the way each character comes to life with a few swift strokes of gritty narrative, and keeps you wanting to know more. I could not put it down. I even had to read the last few chapters very early one morning before going to work. To make a film reference, for me, it was a cross between Dusk till Dawn (the way the story shifts gear halfway) and Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest (the slow cranking of suspicion and tension until a sudden release). Oakfield is an essential book for every fan. Now I have to go back and reread his other books.

Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Litigation Practice Areas & Notable Cases

 

Antitrust




Noonan’s antitrust case experience includes successfully defending ARCO as lead counsel in one of the largest consumer class actions in California history, which sought damages for claimed antitrust in violations in the retail sale of gasoline. He also acted as co-lead counsel for a group of Fortune 500 companies in the successful prosecution of antitrust claims for recovery of overcharges due to price fixing in the copper market, and served as co-trial counsel for Sempra Energy in the Continental Forge consumer class action natural gas antitrust cases.




Professional Liability




Noonan regularly represents other attorneys and those facing professional liability issues. In an ethics/e-discovery trial, he effectively defended a group of lawyers against misconduct charges relating to document production in the much publicized Qualcomm sanctions proceedings. 




Securities




Securities is an especially intricate area of litigation, as it involves many laws and often high stakes that Noonan is adept at. 




Business




Business litigation is a frequent practice area for Noonan. In one case, he achieved a string of favorable judgments and verdicts on behalf of Wells Fargo and a predecessor bank, following trial in both state and federal court in representative actions brought by thousands of investors in the failed Pioneer Mortgage Company.




Bet-the-Company




Bet-the-Company litigation is a complex, high-stakes practice where the survival of a company is at risk. It is a specialty of Noonan’s and the firm’s overall, for which he has won many top awards. 




Additional Practice Areas




Noonan has experience in numerous other practice areas, including class actions. For example, he successfully obtained a defense jury verdict as trial counsel for Ralphs Grocery Company in a consumer class action brought against Southern California’s three major grocery retailers that alleged price maintenance in the sale of eggs. Noonan also represented California consumers as lead trial counsel in a class action lawsuit against a manufacturer of an ephedra dietary supplement for false and misleading print and television advertisements, obtaining a judgment for $12.5 million in restitution and injunctive relief.

The first installment of David J. Rouzzo's breath-taking series comes to life with the suspense-filled story of HATHIN.  

Haunted by frightening visions and memories, a man searches for his past and finds he is part of an unimaginable future. As he finds himself threatened by the vampires called nightwalkers who haunt the town he lives in, he joins a team of people forced together with the same mission - to bring an end to the terror that has haunted them for so long.

Find yourself trapped in the battle between Hathin and the nightwalkers and discover a tale will leave you craving for more.

Dive into the pages of the book that started the ongoing HATHIN Series and fall in love with the legend filled with suspense, action, terror and love that continues getting darker and more terrifying with each new book!
