Your wet phone or device can be fixed. TekDry is the solution.
Use the store locator to find a TekDry location near you. Our patented solution will repair your water-damaged phone or device in just 30 minutes with contacts and data restored!

          THE DAMAGE IS DONE. NOW WHAT?

              HELPFUL TIPS            



If your phone is dropped in salt water, turn it oﬀ and rinse with fresh water to prevent corrosion from the salt.
The heat from using a blow dryer or oven can warp and damage sensitive equipment in your phone.







        WHAT TO DO IF YOU DROP YOUR PHONE OR DEVICE IN WATER      
If you drop your phone in water, drop it in the toilet, spill a drink all over it, run it through the washing machine, or get it wet in anyway, do NOT use rice! Rice drying out a phone is just a myth! It takes days to dry, and that causes corrosion.

REMEMBER:


DON’T PLUG IT IN
One of the most important keys to success is to resist the urge to plug your phone in. Water and electricity are not friends!

MAIL-IN SERVICE
ONLY FOR PHONES THAT HAVE GOTTEN WET WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS!
We want you to have the best chance of success, please DO NOT send us your phone if it has been wet more than 24 hours.






Show All Answers
Hide All Answers



 
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOUR PHONE GOT WET?
For wet phones we receive within 48 hours that have not been plugged in, we have a success
rate of over 80%.

 
HAVE YOU PLUGGED IT IN?
Resist the urge to plug your phone in! Plugging in your wet device can cut success rates
in half.

 
WHAT TYPE OF LIQUID DID YOUR DEVICE FALL INTO?
Hot tubs and saltwater represent the harshest exposures and have much lower success rates.
TIP: If your device fell into saltwater, gently rinse it in tap water and dry immediately before
sending it to us.





If your phone has gotten wet WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS,
we will fix your wet phone and send it back to you for $70.00.
And remember, if it doesn’t work, we will issue you a refund of the service fee.
Time is critical. We highly recommend purchasing an overnight shipping label from the company of your choosing and shipping it to us as soon as possible. As soon as you purchase our mail-in service you will receive a confirmation email with detailed instructions.

The best revenge on a cheating boyfriend is to drown his Apple devices in a bathtub: http://t.co/PO109pnkPv pic.twitter.com/TaXDQAQ1wz
— Mashable (@mashable) April 23, 2015



Girlfriend gets back at cheating boyfriend by drowning all of his electronics in a bathtub.
After finding out her Apple-loving boyfriend was cheating on her, this young woman scorned took all of his electronic devices and threw them in a bathtub…and we mean all of them. After her boyfriend took to Twitter to showcase the damage, her story of revenge went viral. If the boyfriend in question knew about our service he would have had be a much quicker (and cheaper) fix to his dilemma. We don’t condone cheating or revenge but we do hope to make the dreaded water-damaged device scenario a lot less scary for everyone it happens to, whether it be a phone slipping into the toilet or a bathtub full of gadgets.

          How to save a phone that fell in the toilet          
 Posted by tekdry on April 20, 2016 



A wet phone is never funny but it can be a lot less terrifying if you know the right things to do after the fact.
Whether it falls out of your back pocket or slips out of your hand, we’ve all been there. Hopefully this exact scenario has never happened to you but it’s likely that at least someone you know has dropped their phone in the toilet. Data shows this to be the most common way that phones get wet.

Kanye West’s daughter once flushed his phone down the toilet, Kim Kardashian reveals http://t.co/egReBZl7jk pic.twitter.com/ISzwnw45mX
— The Independent (@Independent) February 3, 2015



Has your toddler ever gotten your smartphone or tablet wet? Toddlers, smartphones, and toilets no longer have to be the most terrifying combination that exists.
The rice trick didn’t work for Kanye West when 19-month-old daughter flushed his phone down the toilet recently, so don’t trust it with your wet device!   But, celebrity parents aren’t the only ones that have to deal with phones going down the toilet. Along with people who keep their phones in their back pockets, new parents are among those most likely to have a wet phone. The number of accessible electronics in a family household is growing and toddlers are more tech-savvier than we think, putting devices at a higher risk of getting wet.








          Even professional athletes use their phones on the toilet          
 Posted by tekdry on April 19, 2016 

 

Red Socks player Pablo Sandoval made headlines not for his performance, but rather for using his phone on the toilet during a game.
At least his phone didn’t fall in! Besides embarrassment, his punishment is a one game suspension after admitting to social media usage while going to the bathroom during a game.

Saving the world from wet phones…one happy customer at a time.






















              For pet owners everywhere            
“When my sassy cat knocked my iPhone in the toilet this morning, I thought I was going to be out a few hundred dollars at the end of the day today. I took it to TEKDRY and they were able to rescue it in only 30 minutes! It was quick, easy, and affordable! I would recommend them to anyone whose smartphone/device goes for a swim! THANK YOU, TRKDRY!”

              No $300 trip            
“I want to shout out a BIG – HUGE THANK YOU to TekDry for saving my son’s iPod Touch! We experienced a major tragedy yesterday when I inadvertently washed my son’s iPod Touch – it was in a pocket and I didn’t notice. Into the washing machine it went! Through the wash cycle, through the rinse cycle – all that was left was the spin, when we realized that the iPod was missing and, ‘Oh #*&$! – it’s in the washing machine!’ I immediately contacted TekDry. Once in TekDry’s possession, I got word that it was saved!! No $300 trip to Apple to replace it! No time lost reloading all the games, music, pictures…..! No worries – it’s saved!! This is an amazing invention! Add TekDry’s number to your quick dial because it’s only a matter of time until you need their assistance! Great job guys – and THANKS from me and Caden!”

              TekDry saved my vacation memories and my phone            
“A few weeks ago, my family took a long anticipated vacation. My kids enjoyed surfing lessons and the gorgeous California weather, but their favorite activity was visiting Legoland – where everything is awesome – a memorable day that was almost ruined by a single can of soda. Without my knowledge, one of my children placed a large cup of Coke inside my backpack – subsequently leaking throughout the entire bag and soaking my phone in a liquid mess for over 45 minutes until I realized what had happened. When I took my iPhone 5 out it refused to turn on and I thought all hope was lost. I have become so reliant on my smartphone that I didn’t even bring my laptop on the trip with me. As the owner of my own business, I can’t afford to lose contact while I’m away. Desperate for a solution, I purchased a new phone. I returned home a week after my phone had gotten wet. My new phone didn’t have any of my personal information on it and all of my precious California vacation photos were lost. I decided to try TekDry and within 24 hours I had my phone back and it was in perfect working condition. The guys at TekDry were great. I did everything wrong, but they did everything right and my phone – and vacation memories – were salvaged.”

              The company every mom should know about            
“Well my story may not be the most ‘exciting’ story, but from what I’m told it happens the most. A few months ago, I was doing what most moms have learned to do as a method of survival: multitasking. I have learned to juggle opening juice boxes, brushing my teeth, wiping noses, and kissing skinned knees all at once, but one day I tried texting as well and it all went down the toilet, literally. I dropped my iPhone 5 right into the toilet. I scooped it up quickly, but the damage was already done. There were red lines across my screen and it quickly shut itself off. Thankfully, I knew where to go. My husband had recently worked with someone who knew and had told him about TekDry. I rushed off to TekDry and told them my story. In about 30 minutes my phone was back in working order and I hadn’t lost a single photo! As a mother of six, those photos were precious memories that I couldn’t imagine losing. I’m so grateful that TekDry was able to restore my phone as well as my memories.”

              Not only a great company            
“In a recent meeting, the unthinkable happened: I spilled an entire glass of water all over my keyboard. While it was embarrassing, my biggest concern was my data! As a software developer and marketer, my MacBook Pro houses my entire workload. Without it, I would lose hours of past work as well as hours of work that still had to be done! In less than an hour, Eric informed me that my MacBook Pro had been rescued. I picked it up the next morning and it was working great, with all of my data intact! TekDry saved me hours of headache and extra work as well as at least $1,500! My MacBook Pro has been working well following its rescue, and I couldn’t be happier. TekDry is not only a great company, but they are great guys as well! They truly care about the customer and they want to save our electronic devices, our data, and our sanity!”

“Thanks for saving my water-damaged iPhone yesterday! 20 minutes and it was back in my hands for an important conference call. Life saver!!”

              Still going strong            
“I made the common mistake of dropping my iPhone 5 in the toilet, and it was fully submerged in water for a few seconds. I tried drying it and then restarting it, but it seemed like a lost cause. As I was shamefully walking towards the Apple store to ask for some sort of help (even though I didn’t expect any), I saw TekDry. By the time I was done with my shopping, my formerly wet iPhone was saved! I don’t know how they did it, but even as I write this message on that same phone a long time later, it’s still going strong. Thanks TekDry!”

              Data intact!            
“So my phone had a little incident with a bathtub last weekend (don’t even ask) and wouldn’t turn back on. I hadn’t backed it up since getting home from Australia with all my pictures of Kynley and Kyler on it so I was devastated. I found this company online and for $70 they were able to repair it with all my data intact (so I have all my pictures of my babies!!!). I just want to give TekDry a huge shout out for being so amazing!”

              Completely restored            
“Classic move: Saturday night, cell phone in my back pocket, go to use bathroom, get halfway over toilet and you can guess where my brand new phone ended up! TekDry rescued my cell phone in less than 20 minutes! Completely restored.”
Kristi




              Ingenious business            
“Thank you TekDry for fixing my phone! I did everything wrong after it got dropped in the toilet (used it for 24 hrs and then plugged it in) and after my phone went through your process it was restored to full functionality. I am going to spread the word A) on what NOT to do if you get your phone wet, and B) on your cool, ingenious business. Thank you again!! You saved me hundreds of dollars!!!”

              Water damage be gone!            
“I just received my phone back in less than 24 hours and guess what….it works again! Water damage be gone. Thank you, TekDry!”

              Saved the same phone twice!            
“We thought we were going to need to buy new phones. These guys saved the same phone twice! AMAZING!”

              Fraction of the cost!            
“I want to thank TEKDRY for rescuing my 12-year-old daughter’s iPhone 5. It was 3 full days since the ‘toilet incident’ and Holly’s options didn’t look good. She bought the phone with her own money and saved for a year to get it. She was distraught. Even with insurance the out of pocket cost would have been $199 to replace. Thanks to TekDry for a fraction of that cost she is back in business and texting her girlfriends again!”

              Coffee and keyboards don’t mix            
“Thank you so, so much for salvaging the (well-used, but still useable) laptop! After an errant cup of coffee hit the keyboard, I thought we were doomed (goodbye, Minecraft!). However, TekDry saved the day with this awesome technology.”
