Home WiFi Support





















                    Ask TWC - Virtual Assistant
                







 Go



















Find the answers to questions our customers ask most often, such as:








Can I purchase my own internet modem?








How do I get a new remote control?








How do I make a payment?








What if I have problems logging in?








Where can I replace or return my TWC Internet hardware?






















Learn the Home WiFi basics





Home WiFi is a wireless home network that allows your WiFi-enabled devices, such as laptops, printers, tablets, SMART TVs, smartphones, gaming devices, etc., to connect to the Internet and to one another without the use of wires. You can connect multiple devices at the same time, and it gives you the freedom to move from room to room and stay connected to the Internet from anywhere within the WiFi's signal range.
Manage your Home WiFi
If you need to change any of your WiFi settings, such as the name of your Home WiFi network or password, you need the WiFi-enabled Internet modem passcode your technician records for you at the time of installation, usually in the back of the Welcome Guide. This is the code that enables you to get access to the settings inside the WiFi-enabled Internet modem.

Type http://192.168.0.1 in your browser's URL. This link works only when you are connected to your modem and Spectrum Internet service at home.

Enter the username and passcode for your WiFi-enabled Internet modem. If you don’t know the credentials for your WiFi-enabled Internet modem you can look up your default settings.
Various settings will be available to you. To view/change your network name/password, look for WiFi (Connection settings).
Save if you made changes.

For additional help with your settings, find the user guide for your equipment or call 1-800-892-4357.






Our Home WiFi service includes:





Installation and setup of your equipment
Personalization of your network name, password and security settings
24/7 support for your equipment and service

Note: We do not support non-Spectrum provided WiFi-enabled Internet modem or routers. Please refer to your router’s manufacturer user guide for support.










Setting up your Home WiFi




Equipment
When you subscribe to Spectrum’s Home WiFi, we install a Spectrum-leased WiFi-enabled Internet modem, a single box that functions as both an Internet modem and a wireless router. Depending on your location and subscribed speed plan, you can enjoy WiFi-enabled Internet modems that use the latest WiFi standard 802.11ac, enabling you to get better, faster speed all over your home and increased bandwidth for multiple devices connected at the same time.
Network name
At the time of installation, your technician sets up your chosen network name (SSID) and network password and enables the best security setting (WPA2) on your WiFi-enabled Internet modem. This will protect your Home WiFi network and keep unwanted users from accessing it. The technician will record your chosen network name and password in the back of your Welcome Guide so you can add a new device when needed or allow additional users to your network.
If you are installing our WiFi-enabled Internet modem yourself using the Easy Connect Kit, please follow the steps outlined in your Easy Connect Guide.
How to connect
To connect your devices to the WiFi-enabled Internet modem:

Make sure the WiFi connection on your device is turned on.
Click on Network Connections (setting name may vary by device).
Select your new chosen network name (SSID).
Enter your new network password.











Home WiFi Performance




As fast as our Home WiFi may be, WiFi connections aren't as fast as wired connections, so we have provided you with our top 10 tips for optimizing your experience and minimizing interference on your Home WiFi network.










Home WiFi connection problems




If your WiFi is not connecting:

Ensure the WiFi connection on your devices is turned on.
Check all connections on your WiFi-enabled Internet modem. You may find that a cord has become loose or has been pulled out.
Reboot your WiFi-enabled Internet modem. If there has been a cable problem in your area, it may be necessary to reboot the WiFi-enabled Internet modem in order to re-establish a proper connection.
Make sure you are within range of your WiFi-enabled Internet modem.
Restart your devices. This fixes a surprising amount of problems, especially those that have cropped up unexpectedly, or with no apparent cause.
Check your cable TV (if applicable). If your TV is experiencing problems, your Internet services are most likely affected as well.
Check out our top 10 tips to maximize your Home WiFi performance page to ensure you have the optimal setup for your Home WiFi.

If none of these recommendations correct your problem, contact us.

Time Warner Cable is a well-known cable TV and internet provider that also offers a range of smart home security and automation packages. Time Warner gives customers access to professional installations, state-of-the-art touchscreen panels, 24/7 monitoring, and video surveillance. However, these features come at a price—the upfront cost of a Time Warner home security system is relatively high compared to what other companies in the industry typically charge.

The Good

Shorter contract lengths
State-of-the-art touchscreen panel
Broadband monitoring with cellular backup
Indoor or outdoor video surveillance
Professional installation

Shorter Contract Lengths
Time Warner Cable’s contract length for home security systems is 18 months, which is considerably shorter than the three to five-year contracts required by many other companies in the industry.
State-of-the-Art Touchscreen Panel
Time Warner is very transparent when it comes to providing potential customers with equipment and pricing information. All packages include an in-home touchscreen panel, a motion or glass-break sensor, and two door/window sensors. Then, depending in which package you choose, you’ll get either a smart thermostat or an indoor/outdoor camera. The component that really stands out in this mix is the touchscreen panel, which has a sleek, attractive design that will look great in any home. The panel also carries a 24-hour battery backup, built-in cellular backup, wifi connectivity, and access to dozens of apps.
Broadband Monitoring With Cellular Backup
As mentioned above, Time Warner’s touchscreen panel carries 24-hour battery backup, cellular backup, and wifi connectivity. This means that even if your home’s electricity or internet is down, you can have peace of mind knowing that your security system is still up and running.
Indoor or Outdoor Video Surveillance
Many home security companies only provide an indoor camera with standard packages and offer the option to purchase exterior cameras separately. However, Time Warner provides its customer with a rare level of flexibility by allowing them to select whether they would like an indoor or an outdoor security camera with their package. The camera may be programmed to record at specific times and can be controlled and monitored online or via smartphone.
Professional Installation
All Time Warner security systems are professionally installed, so customers can be confident that their system will be set up correctly.
 

The Bad

Time Warner internet required
High upfront costs
Expensive monthly monitoring
Mixed camera reviews

Time Warner Internet Required
In order to use Time Warner’s home security services, customers must utilize the company’s internet services as well. This can be a difficult, expensive, and inconvenient switch for those who are not currently customers of Time Warner.
High Upfront Costs
Time Warner’s equipment is pretty pricey. Upfront costs start at $99.99 for the Basic Security package, $149.99 for the Security & Video package, and $199.99 for the Security, Video & Energy package. If you’d like to purchase additional window/door sensors, you’ll be paying $20 to $40 each.
Expensive Monthly Monitoring
Time Warner’s monthly monitoring rates are on the more expensive side as well. Monitoring prices start $39.99 per month, which is double what some competing home security companies charge for comparable packages.
Mixed Camera Reviews
According to reviews we’ve received, some customers have had problems with their Time Warner security cameras. Reported issues include cameras that do not work all of the time, display only black and white footage, malfunction in temperatures below 32 degrees, and are not compatible with other home security systems.
 

The Bottom Line
Time Warner Cable’s home security service offers some great features, including professional installations, short contract lengths, indoor and outdoor surveillance, and state-of-the-art equipment. However, upfront costs are high and monthly monitoring rates are expensive in comparison to many other top companies in the industry. Additionally, Time Warner home security customers must also use Time Warner internet, a requirement that can be costly and inconvenient for those who are not currently doing business with the company.

These system is awful it is wifi based does not always work….I own cameras that I can not take with me to other companys. They take the monitoring screen back n they cameras are useless. It was a complete waste of money on my part. The prices are outragious you have to use Spectrums WiFi services for the system to work. They trap you completely. Thank God we were smart n left them….your better off With DVR system every 10 days the data is lost it wont store footage so you can go back n look at the features

We’ve had TWC (now Spectrum) Intelligent home for several years.  It as expensive to set up and nowadays there are better options for an intelligent home system.  The touch pad from Spectrum is actually quite good and easy to use with lots of information.  The apps for your phone/mobile device are also easy to set up and use.  
The alarm system itself is adequate. You can control the system from anywhere in the world where you have Internet connection.  If someone is coming to your house, you can give them a temporary code to get in and you will be notified by text when they arrive and when they depart. 
The Intelligent home thermostats are a different story.  They are old and clunky.  You cannot program them to turn on or off at specific times.  The maximum temperature for air conditioning is 86 degrees which is too hot if you’re home …. but if your leaving for several days and want to keep the house at 90 to lower a/c costs, you’re out of luck (we live in the desert where daytime highs are often in the 110 range).  Furthermore, the phone app only works occasionally when raising or lowering the temperature from a remote location (or even within the home).   You’ll lower the temp from 86 to 78 when returning home, only to arrive at home and discover it never changed (even though the app says it did).
Overall, I would not get Intelligent Home from TWC/Spectrum now.  Several years ago when it first came out, it was cutting edge.  But they have failed to keep up with the technology.

All away around, horrible cameras and a waste of money. Here’s to all burglars…the crappy nighttime image, double image from window reflection, not weather resistant for outside eve installation, small viewing radius, and intermittent video viewing will allow you to wipe out a house with little worries of identification. I cannot even view my pet sitter or contractors come and go because of the long delay and delay in video while viewing remotely. Thank you TWC for taking my $300 for cameras and making me feel as unprotected as if I had not installed tour crappy cameras at all. Even tour Tech guys agree that they are laughable and won’t even use them in their own homes even this they’re free to them. These were purchased 18 months ago and they’ve had no upgrades.

An absolute nightmare! Stay away from them! I FINALLY get rid of this system tomorrow and this is after they were trying to add an additional month to contract. Luckily I had documentation of when installed. System is just sorry, and once I paid equipement off and expected to have a lower bill then Spectrum raised my cable, internet, and phone rate along with dropping channels from lineup and I RARELY can even get 100Mb/s download (wired or wifi) when paying for 300Mb/s. This of course sends (un)intelligent home into a spin. Cameras don’t do what they claim. All but useless. Also, you make any changes to your other Spectrum services you have to go through a special number to (un)Intelligent home and they mess things up more often than not. I can not say one good thing about Spectrum or any of their services.

I have been very disappointed with the quality of service. First of all their 24/7 monitoring is always going off-line. Also as they note you must have their cable service. Since Spectrum has taken over the price for everything has jumped almost 50%. I decided to go with another security service and as I was taking down the sensors I discovered they were not only screwed to the wall but also glued. This resulted in some very ugly gouges in the walls. If you want home security keep looking. There are several highly rated services that would serve you better than Spectrum/Intelligent Home.

Phone app not connecting yet once again and customer service rude. No attempt to try and fix unless I was able to go unplug equipment while I am not able to at the moment. No offer of a credit for having limited to no service for a week until they take thier sweet time getting someone out to fix it. 
This is the 6th time in as many months there have been issues and I will be canceling my service for a company that actually values my business and has technology that actually works.

My home carried TWC for nearly ten years and offered me a chance to upgrade service by getting security on TWC as well. I wasn’t under contract and would get a price break. However, there were  $750 in hidden fees for yet another installation, and then TWC changed to Spectrum and would not honor any of the agreements, and the cable speed dropped while my bill that was promised to drop down to $125 for bundle, that tripled at $275 per month, and the speed was not being met. I was told it was the rented modem and router, and after spending several days trying to fix, a cable guy came in and changed the gear, and told me that I had extra boxes I didn’t need but am having to pay for, so asked him to take back to reduce my rate. He took the box but did not amend and I end up owing for that as well. This is an unethical company. Most the time my security camera would not work because the system was down or the router was defective, and I’m paying rent on all the gear and having to pay extra to make faster cable speed. So as TWC, now Spectrum, did not honor end to provide service, I brought all the gear back and terminated account, yet IntelligentHome hits my credit rating with false report of me owing an additional $200 for termination fee. Guys, they stole an extra $250 from me each month after stealing $175 in gear and not providing quality service. I ought to sue is what I ought to do. In all, this company has cost me a loss of $1,000 and false sense of security when system was never functional under IntelligentHome. Look elsewhere. You will have more money and better security without IntelligentHome.

Ive had Intelligent Home for 3 years now. I have a feeling most people’s issues with it are lack of knowledge. This system works perfectly fine. No camera has EVER gone offline as far as I can tell nor has any sensor. One of the cameras are pointed at the driveway, we have a big house so we use it to see whos home, ive checked it at all hours during the day from work and night time when on vacation, never an issue. The system has a lot of customization for alerts, you can set it to tell you the basics like when an alarm is tripped or when the power goes out or for more custom occurrences, like if a certain door is opened after a certain time or if it isnt opened by a certain time. Great for knowing if kids leave in the middle of the night or if they dont come home from somewhere when planned. My only issue has been with customer service for the alarm portion. Everyone gives you a different answer and certain account changes have to be made by I.H. support, not TWC normal customer service. It was a bit bumpy in the beginning with what I as given with what I was promised, after a few rough conversations, they made it right. Its a shame to see they no longer offer new subscriptions, Ive spent 3 years talking this thing up and had a few people (who are also very happy) sign up. The only other negative I think would be the upfront cost, I spent almost $1000 on equipment and additional sensors are $69 but can be found on Amazon for $25. The door locks are another pain point, $300/ea and only from Best Buy. But like any smart shopper, I did my research before buying, I knew what I was getting into.

Note that Time Warner is now Spectrum and the relationship that Time Warner had with Intelligent Home is not promoted or offer in their current portfolio of services and products. That being said, my experience was not positive and regret having done business with them. Not trustworthy, or accommodating in any manner. Avoid this at all costs.

Brenda McDuffie constant issues with being offline no broadband promised $200 gift card but I  didn’t receive it. Loop hole I was penalized for being late on Internet bill prior to upgrading to phone cable and intelligent home. I will be downgrading to Internet only. Kicking everything else to the curb. In the market searching for other security systems providers forget cable…there are cheaper options. These clowns have the nerve to send certified letters when you are late but mind you they bill 1 month ahead. I have had it after being called  900 on a Saturday morning to collect a debt when the product quality is poor.

Please do not buy this system. Super slow and poor quality you will only be able to see what ever you need to see if the target does not move for 10 seconds on average. I called time Warner and their answer was that that is best their system can do. This is pretty sad considering we live in 2017 and $35 wifi camera will give you HD quality and speed and you can buy them pretty much anywhere without paying monthly.
I am truly disappointed and will never recommend  this system to anyone.

6 cameras at 150. each. Needed video image for intentional overnight damage to vehicle…the cameras were “offline.” Cameras had not been recording for two months! I was told to check online status frequently. After the first incident, eggs were thrown onto my neighbors car parked within range of my camera…embarrassing to have to tell my neighbor that the camera was once again offline. Agin I was told to check for online now status daily. Really??
Went to bed one night after checking and confirming online status, by morning someone had intentionally moved things around on my porch (by now the neighborhood must know that my cameras are not reliable) I knew that I would catch it on 24/7 but no, it went offline at 2:am.
I hate TWC, their solution…” Cancel the service” sure REFUND me something.

Awful security system.  Constant equipment failure.. I pretty much have someone at my house once a month to fix failed sensors .Customer service is not great..They call you from the same number that an alarm is in progress call comes from If there is a problem with the equipment. Several times I have left work meetings  because home security is calling, and I think that my house was being robbed. Only to find that once again they were letting me know that I have a failed sensor. The sensors should not fail as often as they do. Save your money and time and invest in a real home security system.

when this system was installed, I was promised a $200 credit, which I never received. They did not install the thermostat, so I had to hire an electrician, and at the end of the lease, they insisted that I return all of the equipment, although they specifically told me in person that all the equipment was mine to keep.  Shame on them for scamming an older lady, breaking promises, and illegal marketing.

So after 18 months of monitoring, I was told I could cancel and still have my equipment, but was never told I will not have the key pad, which is key, the system is no good without the keypad. Why pay over $800 for a system that is no good to you without the key pad. Beware! Go with CPI or ADT but not time warner. Their system is no good if you try to leave to another carried, it can only be monitored with time warner internet and they will take the key pad.

I had Them install a security system along with 2 cameras back in March ’16. I’ve had 3 service techs out because cameras would just stop recording. They came out & replaced some equipment, while out there the service tech said this equipment is junk & they no longer install it. Had someone attempt to break into my truck which was in perfect view of camera & when I went to look at video, guess what???? It stopped recording 8 days prior. I’ve made 3 phone calls to terminate service & they won’t waive termination fee. All I hear is that I’m responsible to honor the contract & I keep telling them that they also need to honor it by supplying functional equipment. I will be contacting attorney general & NY Public Service Commission
