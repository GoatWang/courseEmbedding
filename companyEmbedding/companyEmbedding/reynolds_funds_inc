1The Adviser has undertaken to reimburse the Fund to the extent that the aggregate annual operating expenses, including investment advisory fees and administration fees but excluding interest, taxes, brokerage commissions and other costs incurred in connection with the purchase or sale of portfolio securities, and extraordinary items, exceed that percentage of the average net assets of the Fund for the year, as determined by valuations made as of the close of each business day of the year, which is the most restrictive percentage provided by the state laws of the various states in which the shares of the Fund are qualified for sale or, if the states in which the shares of the Fund are qualified for sale impose no such restrictions, 2%.  As of the date hereof, no such state law provision was applicable to the Fund.  The Fund monitors its expense ratio on a monthly basis. If the accrued amount of the expenses of the Fund exceeds the expense limitation, the Fund creates an account receivable from the Adviser for the amount of such excess. Refer to the current Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for other historical performance information.

Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Prospectuses



Reynolds Funds (the “Company”) is a no-load, open-end, diversified management investment company, better known as a mutual fund, registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”). It was incorporated under the laws of Maryland on April 28, 1988. The Company consists of the Reynolds Blue Chip Growth Fund (the “Fund”). The Fund obtains its assets by continuously selling its shares to individual and institutional investors. Proceeds from such sales are invested in securities of other issuers. In this way, the Fund:

Combines the resources of many investors, with each individual investor having an interest in every one of the securities owned by the Fund;
Provides each individual investor with diversification by investing in the securities of many different issuers;
Reduces transaction costs by buying and selling larger blocks of securities; and
Furnishes professional portfolio management to select and watch over its investments. See “Management of the Fund” in the Prospectus for a discussion of the Fund's Adviser.

The Fund will redeem any of its outstanding shares on demand of the owner at its next determined net asset value. Registration of the Company under the Act does not involve supervision of the Company’s management or policies by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
For more information, please download the Prospectus.

Individual Retirement Accounts



Reynolds Blue Chip Growth Fund offers three different types of IRAs. Upon creation of an IRA, you must designate whether the IRA will be a Traditional IRA, a Roth IRA, or an Education IRA. (In addition, there are SEP-IRAs and SIMPLE IRAs, which are discussed in the Disclosure Statement for Traditional IRAs in the IRA Info Kit.)
In a Traditional IRA, amounts contributed to the IRA may be tax deductible at the time of contribution. Distributions from the IRA will be taxed at distribution except to the extent that the distribution represents a return of your own contributions for which you did not claim (or where not eligible to claim) a deduction.
In a Roth IRA, amounts contributed to your IRA are taxed at the time of contribution, but distributions from the IRA are not subject to tax if you have held the IRA for certain minimum periods of time (generally, until age 59-1/2 but in some cases longer).
In an Education IRA, you contribute to an IRA maintained on behalf of a beneficiary and do not receive a current deduction. However, if amounts are used for certain educational purposes, neither  you nor the beneficiary of the IRA are taxed upon distribution. 
Each type of IRA is a custodial account created for the exclusive benefit of the beneficiary you (or your spouse) in the case of the Traditional IRA and Roth IRA, and a named beneficiary in the case of an Education IRA. U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC serves as custodian of the IRA. Your, your spouse’s or your beneficiary’s (as applicable) interest in the account is nonforfeitable.
For more information, please download the IRA Information Kit.

Leading By Example

A MESSAGE FROM LANCE MITCHELL, CEO Reynolds Consumer Products
We are proud of our well-known and trusted brands, including Reynolds Wrap® foil, Hefty® trash bags, slider bags, and disposable tableware, and in 2014, we added Alcan® foil, Canada’s top foil brand. Our goal is to continue to earn your trust and offer new products and product improvements that make running a household easier. 
How we do it is just as important as the products we sell. Integrity is extremely important to us; we drive results through combining innovation and teamwork. A majority of our products are made in the U.S. and Canada, and the safety of our employees is our top priority. We put safety first, always. Our customer relationships are based on a long history of trust. We work to make not only our individual products successful; but provide insights to our retailers that help improve the product category.
We're looking for people that will help us reach our goals, including professionals in marketing, HR, IT, operations, logistics/supply chain, finance, and more. Please take a few minutes to read what some of our employees think about working here.

Reynolds Wrap® foil was invented after aluminum was no longer needed for military use; and became a new staple for American kitchens. Hefty® waste bags were first developed with excess material from an early plastics innovator, creating another household essential.
