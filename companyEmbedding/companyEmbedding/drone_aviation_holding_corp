DRONES
Reporting for Work
Like the internet and GPS before them, drones are evolving beyond their military origin to become powerful business tools. They’ve already made the leap to the consumer market, and now they're being put to work in commercial and civil government applications from firefighting to farming. That’s creating a market opportunity that's too large to ignore.












The opportunity ahead
Between now and 2020, we forecast a $100 billion market opportunity for drones—helped by growing demand from the commercial and civil government sectors.

Military
Drones got their start as safer, cheaper and often more capable alternatives to manned military aircraft. Defense will remain the largest market for the foreseeable future as global competition heats up and technology continues to improve.
Source: Goldman Sachs Research



Consumer
The consumer drone market was the first to develop outside the military. Demand has taken off in the last two years and hobbyist drones have become a familiar sight, but there is plenty of room for growth.
Source: Goldman Sachs Research



Commercial/civil
The fastest growth opportunity comes from businesses and civil governments. They're just beginning to explore the possibilities, but we expect they'll spend $13 billion on drones between now and 2020, putting thousands of them in the sky. Here's where you might see them.

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A COMMERCIAL DRONE Into the Fire 
 A wildfire has broken out and is spreading rapidly. Local firefighters want to conduct a water drop over the hottest parts of the blaze, but they need to give the helicopter pilot the coordinates. 















A drone equipped with a thermal camera can fly over the scene and identify the hot spots. 












 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A COMMERCIAL DRONE  AIRBORNE INSPECTION 
 An oil and gas company is about to conduct its required monthly pipeline inspection. The company would usually hire a $2,500-an-hour helicopter crew for the job. But now they're using a drone. 















A Drone can survey 150 miles of pipeline per day – on par with the helicopter crew but at a lower cost.












 But these benefits depend on regulators allowing drone operations beyond a pilot's line of sight. Pipeline inspection isn't unique in this regard — most commercial applications will require or benefit from more relaxed flight regulations. Take agriculture, for example. 


A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A COMMERCIAL DRONE CROP CIRCLES
 A farmer decides to hire a drone to monitor his crops during the critical summer growing season. At current altitude restrictions, it could inspect up to 1,000 acres of farmland a day, turning around surveys faster and more accurately than planes or satellites. 















If regulators were to increase the maximum flight height by just 40%, the drone could double the farmer’s daily coverage.












 Drones for all The Consumer market 
 Flight, speed, dramatic photography – it’s easy to see why drones appeal to consumers. This is the largest non-military market today, and it’s still in its early stages. 













EARLY STAGES
The global consumer drone market is still a fraction of the size of other high-end consumer electronics.

But Ready to Grow

 Now in Service Drones in the Military 
 This is the most mature market, where drones have long been used to keep pilots out of harm's way while performing tasks like intelligence gathering or chemical detection.

GROWING CAPABILITY SET 
Current drone technology has already surpassed manned aircraft in endurance, range, safety and cost efficiency — but research and development is far from over. The next generation of drones will widen the gap between manned and unmanned flight even further, adding greater stealth, sensory, payload, range, autonomous, and communications capabilities.

The Really Big Picture
Drone sensor technology currently in development can map 2.7 million square miles in a single flight – nearly the area of the 48 contiguous US states.

 Navigating the HeadwindsRewriting the Rules
 The rapid growth of the drone industry has outpaced the development of rules and systems to govern their use. This uncertainty weighs on innovation and commercial adoption, but anticipated regulatory clarity should unlock demand. NASA is leading a multibillion-dollar effort to develop a US airspace management system capable of safely coordinating manned and unmanned flight, while the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is expected to further ease restrictions that are keeping commercial drones from reaching their full potential. 





















Range
Drone flight is currently limited to a pilot's line of sight
Beyond line of sight










400 Feet






Current FAA Regulations
What's Needed to Unlock Commercial Demand



Altitude

Drones cannot fly over  400 feet
Flight above 400 feet


operations

Drones cannot operate over people and must be flown by someone with a remote pilot certificate
Autonomous operations allowed,  along with flight over populated areas





















 the Takeaway 

With the evolution of regulations, we see drones headed for new heights in the business world. The same safety, efficiency and cost benefits that appeal to the military make drones attractive for a wide range of business and civil government functions. The $100 billion market opportunity we forecast over the next five years is just the tip of the iceberg. Drones' full economic potential is likely to be multiple times that number, as their ripple effects reverberate through the economy.

Technology 
 










RAPTOR Flight Control System
The most important UAS technology, and most difficult to master, is the vehicle autopilot and the operator interface, the Ground Control Station. Drone Aviation’s RAPTOR Flight Control System comprises the Georgia Institute of Technology’s GUST autopilot, and the DAC developed GCS. 




Autopilot

The RAPTOR on-board autopilot (GUST), executes on standard Intel i3, i5, i7, single board computing architecture. RAPTOR is not performance constrained as are many flight control systems operating on proprietary, difficult to upgrade hardware. Being able to rapidly increase computing power allows for mission expansion using capabilities such as GPS-denied vision navigation, target recognition and neural network vehicle control. Commercially licensed exclusively to DAC, GUST is an extensible software platform for full vehicle and environment simulation, on-board dynamic vehicle flight control (autopilot), and sensor-fusion navigation. GUST is mature technology with 15 years of research and operational experience and continues to be improved and expanded by Georgia Tech and Drone Aviation.




Ground Control Station (GCS)

The RAPTOR GCS is unique in the industry. Developed by DAC for use in tethered systems, the GCS is uncluttered by removing confusing settings and options, vehicle tuning and informational windows not required for tethered systems. Further, the RAPTOR GCS operating system is separate from the operator’s tablet, PC, phone or other display and input device. This abstraction layer allows the vehicle to be monitored by a central site, and operated with many different types of devices locally, over a secure wifi or wired Ethernet/Fiber optic link.

The DAC tether system is an armored smart leash that provides uninterruptible power, and unhackable communications to the WATT UAS and WASP aerostat. While this concept appears simple, DAC’s proprietary tether technology is a key differentiator and enabler for long-duration, safe, unmanned flight. 
Advantages:
Tether-based systems for aerial platforms deliver a number of advantages: 
Fly more reliably and safely than free-flying unmanned aircraft
Unlimited flight duration from ground-based power
Transmit power, video and other data, vehicle control, securely through Kevlar armored tether, no signal to hack




















Tension Control Winch System
A critical part of the WATT Ground Support Equipment, the tension control winch maintains consistent tether alignment with the WATT aerial vehicle. As the vehicle ascends or descends the winch system rapidly adjusts. When in loiter or mobility modes, the tension control monitoring and adjustment system measures tether line tension hundreds of times per second.

Small adjustments are made to ensure the tether does not become slack or pull on the aerial vehicle. The system is fully automatic, compensating for both drone operation and environmental conditions. Managed tension avoids slack or whipping of the tether in winds or vehicle flight changes which can result in the tether wrapping around nearby obstructions. Further, the vehicle is more stable when the tether tension is actively managed as the tether is not inconsistently pulling on the vehicle.


Advantages:

More stable vehicle flight, resulting in better video and higher accuracy station-keeping
Safer operation, especially in windy conditions or mobile operations
Winch is designed to allow safe recovery of aerial vehicle






















ACCESSIBLE. MOBILE. RELIABLE.










About




















Drone Aviation was formed in April 2014 from the acquisition of Lighter Than Air Systems Corp. (LTAS), founded in 2009. The development of tethered drones started with LTAS in late 2009 as a potential aerostat system replacement. Drone Aviation Corp. (DAC) is focused on global agencies and organizations in the commercial, military, research and law enforcement sectors. Customers include the US Army, US Marines, US Navy, US EPA, NREL, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Ecuadorian Air Force, many US research universities and US law enforcement agencies.
Taming Altitude is Drone Aviation’s approach to unmanned systems design, manufacturing and flight operations. Combining engineering, human factors-based design, software, and safety systems to provide a reliable, easy to deploy system.
DAC’s goal is to lead the UAS industry from the equivalent of the pioneering days of manned flight, to the daily airline operations of modern times.
Drone Aviation’s technology and UAS solutions are based on manned system aeronautical engineering, and licensed pilot training and experience. Further, through our experience manufacturing and supporting systems in use by the DoD, Drone Aviation will help the industry mature for wider use in the National Air Space.
 
WHY ARE WE UNIQUE
People, Processes, Technology and Products
People  The DAC team has a broad range of skill sets and experience. From scientists to engineers to former military personnel. They are our strength, source of innovation and make Drone Aviation a world-class UAS company.
Processes  Drone Aviation is built on an organization, LTAS Corp., that has 6 years of experience engineering, manufacturing and supporting aerostat systems in the field. Systems that are mission-critical to US Army Soldiers and US Marines for communications and force protection. DAC has internal systems and processes such as; change management, engineering test and evaluation, separation of development, test and production software environments, departmental structures specific to production, R&D, engineering, documentation, and support. Drone Aviation’s processes and procedures are what you need and expect in a technology partner that provides UAS systems. Startups and new entrants to the industry may not have the maturity to support your mission.
Technology  Drone Aviation is leading the UAS community in numerous unmanned technologies. On-board power systems weighing less than 3 lbs. yet delivering 150 amps of current, automatic tether tension control system, armored tether, data over the same two wires carrying the power, simplified Ground Control Station, highly-stabilized, all-weather dual sensor ISR payloads with human detection ranges of 3km. All incorporated into a low-cost and highly reliable system.
Products  DAC products range from aerostats to tethered UAS systems, with technical commonality across most sub-systems. This approach provides a logistically light capability to customers starting with one DAC platform and later incorporating another into their concept of operations.

 China Aviation Supplies Holding Company Signs GTA For 140 Airbus Aircraft


Airbus’  Single- And Twin-Aisle Aircraft Meet The Diverse Needs Of Chinese Customers
China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CAS) has signed with Airbus a General Terms Agreement (GTA) for the purchase of a total of 140 aircraft. The agreement comprises of 100 A320 Family aircraft and 40 A350 XWB Family aircraft, reflecting the strong demand of Chinese airlines in all market segments including domestic, low cost, regional and international long haul.

The GTA was signed in Berlin by Tom Enders, Airbus CEO, and Sun Bo, Executive Vice President of CAS, in the presence of visiting Chinese President Xi Jinping and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
“This is a great endorsement for our leading products in both single aisle and wide body segments”, said Enders. “China is today one of the world’s most important markets for aviation, and we are honoured to support the development and rapid growth of China’s civil aviation with our competitive product portfolio.”
The world’s passenger aircraft fleet above 100 seats is set to more than double in the next 20 years to over 40,000 planes as traffic is forecast to grow at 4.4 percent per year. Emerging markets such as China continue to be an engine for growth, with domestic traffic to become the world’s largest market, according to Airbus’ latest Global Market Forecast 2017-2036.

By the end of May 2017, the in-service Airbus fleet with Chinese operators totaled some 1,440 aircraft, of which nearly 1,230 are A320 Family planes. The A350 XWB has received valuable endorsements from several Chinese customers. The unrivalled operational performance and cabin comfort of the A350 XWB will give Chinese airlines a competitive edge to attract more passengers on international routes.

Drone Aviation Holding Corp. Key Developments

Drone Aviation Holding Corp. Introduces Fuse Automated Smart Winch Tethering System for Dji Inspire Drones
May 25 17
Drone Aviation Holding Corp. introduced FUSE, its automated smart winch tethering system designed to meet the unique specifications for DJI Inspire drones, the world’s most popular commercial drone. Utilizing a new patent-pending power pack, the FUSE Tether System maximizes drone use for both Inspire 1 and Inspire 2 owners. By integrating the FUSE Tether System, DJI Inspire users dramatically and affordably increase drone flight time with uninterrupted power from the ground, facilitating long duration flight operations by news media, first responders, infrastructure inspectors, and insurance companies, just to name a few. In commercial applications such as these, DJI Inspire drones are the most commonly used platforms with >70% market share according to Frost & Sullivan research. FUSE is based on the same military-grade advanced tethering technology utilized in the Company’s tethered products sold to the U.S. Department of Defense, including the WATT electric tethered drone, and is an important element for compliance with the FAA’s Part 107 commercial drone safety guidelines. The FUSE Tether System is comprised of a customized power pack and an Automated Smart Tension Control Winch Case with 200ft. of tether supporting 110-volt ground power sources including portable generators.


Drone Aviation announces Unveil New Heavy Lift Watt 300 Multirotor Tethered Drone and Recently Upgraded Wasp Military Aerostat Platforms at SOFIC 2017
May 9 17
Drone Aviation Holding Corp. announced that it is unveiling the new WATT 300 heavy-lift tethered multirotor drone and an upgraded military WASP aerostat platform at the 2017 Special Operations Forces Industry Conference (SOFIC). SOFIC is being held next week from May 15th through May 18th at the Tampa Convention Center in Tampa, FL. SOFIC is the defense industry’s premier event for members of the Special Operations Forces (SOF), focusing on advancing defense industry technology solutions and building the global SOF alliance, attracting over 9,000 government and industry attendees. Company team members will be hosting informational meetings at booth (#1350) and will be displaying the Company’s full range of tethered aerial products including the upgraded WASP tactical aerostat platform and the WATT 200 electric tethered drone. Also on display will be the first unveiling of the new WATT 300 heavy-lift multirotor drone which delivers enhanced multi-mission capabilities due to its ability to support the same advanced Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) sensor payloads utilized by the WASP aerostat platform. Drone Aviation’s WASP and WATT are intended to provide semi-persistent, mobile intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance ("ISR") for various military, law enforcement and commercial security applications. The WASP (Winch Aerostat Small Platform) is a highly tactical and mobile aerostat system which can be operated by as few as two soldiers and can provide day/night video and wireless communication range extension from either a fixed, stationary position or while being towed. Over the past four years, U.S. Army-owned WASP systems have successfully completed thousands of hours of soldier training operations, various DoD exercises, and customer operations. WASP is currently being utilized by the DoD as a mobile, tactical aerial solution that can support various ISR mission profiles involving ground-based assets as well as aerial assets through communication retransmission. The patented WATT Electric Tethered Aerial Platform is the Company’s turn-key electric tethered drone designed to provide secure and reliable aerial communications and monitoring for extended durations. WATT utilizes a high strength, Kevlar®-armored tether connected to the ground providing uninterruptible power, unjammable command and control, and secure collection and distribution of sensor data, to deliver highly effective coverage from altitudes up to 400 feet for up to 8 hours or more. Supporting advanced mil-spec communications packages and sensors, including highly stabilized zoom EO/IR systems, WATT provides excellent persistent ISR and aerial monitoring capabilities over a wide area.


Drone Aviation Holding Corp Aviation Delivers Enhanced WASP Tactical Aerostat to Dod
Mar 3 17
Drone Aviation Holding Corp. has successfully completed the integration of Government-furnished ISR equipment supporting the simultaneous use of communications and optical payload packages onto the Winch Aerostat Small Platform ("WASP") tactical aerostat under its most recent contract award from the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). Under terms of the integration contracts valued in excess of $346,000 awarded to the Company in second half 2016, Drone Aviation has integrated both advanced communications and optical sensors onto the WASP adding new mission capabilities that were previously only available on much larger, multi-million-dollar stationary aerostat systems such as the Persistent Ground Surveillance System (PGSS) aerostats. With these new capabilities, the WASP aerostat can now support multiple advanced communications and optical payloads simultaneously, greatly expanding its mission flexibility to include a wider array of ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance) support requirements. The upgraded payload system now also includes secure voice and data network range extension highlighted by the ability to extend communications to over 30km.
