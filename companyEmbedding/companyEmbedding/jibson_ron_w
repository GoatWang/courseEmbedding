Questar Chairman, President and CEO Ron Jibson to Retire upon Close 
      of Dominion Resources Merger






April 27, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Questar Corporation’s (NYSE:STR) board of directors today announced that 
      Chairman Ronald W. Jibson intends to retire upon the completion of the 
      company’s merger with Dominion (NYSE:D). Jibson also serves as president 
      and chief executive officer of the Salt Lake City-based integrated 
      energy company, which announced on Feb. 1, 2016, it is combining with 
      Virginia-based Dominion. Subject to shareholder and regulatory 
      approvals, the transaction is expected to be completed during 2016.
    


      Jibson will retire as Questar’s chairman after serving since July 2012. 
      He has been Questar’s president and CEO since July 2010. Prior to that, 
      he was an executive vice president of the corporation and president of 
      its utility subsidiary, Questar Gas Company, which serves about 1 
      million customers in Utah, southern Idaho and southwestern Wyoming. 
      Jibson has held several Questar executive and management positions since 
      starting with the company as a design engineer in 1980.
    

      “On behalf of Questar’s board and shareholders, I’d like to thank Ron 
      for his years of service as Questar’s chairman and CEO, and for his long 
      career with Questar, which he has been instrumental in building into one 
      of the nation’s premier energy firms,” said Harris H. Simmons, Questar’s 
      lead director and Zions Bancorporation’s chairman and CEO. “Ron has led 
      Questar with great integrity, and he’s been both a driving force for 
      economic development and a deeply engaged community leader in the 
      Intermountain West.”
    

      “It’s been the opportunity of a lifetime to help lead Questar over the 
      past several years,” Jibson said. “I’m proud to have worked with 
      employees who have so successfully operated one of the nation’s most 
      respected energy companies. The fact that another top-tier company sees 
      the benefits of combining forces is evidence of their hard work. I look 
      forward to helping complete our combination with Dominion, and I’m 
      confident it will be great for our customers, employees, shareholders 
      and the communities we serve.”
    

      “Ron is widely admired for his distinguished record of leadership at 
      Questar, the energy industry and the community,” said Thomas F. Farrell 
      II, chairman, president & CEO of Dominion. “He has worked tirelessly and 
      with the highest level of integrity throughout his career to achieve 
      outstanding results, while holding true to the public service tradition 
      of our business. We at Dominion feel honored to work with Ron on our 
      historic business combination and we wish him all the best as he moves 
      to the next chapter in his life.”

This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Utah:













Does Ronald W Jibson carry a valid contracting license?



Contractors in Utah are required to be licensed to perform work on residential properties. The Utah Division of Occupational and Professional Licensing issues over fifty separate license classifications to contractors. Licensing standards in Utah are very strict, offering homeowners peace of mind when hiring contractors. Always check a contractor's references to avoid problems during a construction project. 
Ronald W Jibson currently holds license 165440-2202 , which was Inactive when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Utah?



Utah requires contractors to pass a business and law exam, as well as a trade exam to become licensed. Six hours of continuing education is required to maintain a license in the state. 











Your liability risk when hiring Ronald W Jibson



Utah requires licensed contractors to carry workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of both insurance certificates for your records before the start of any work.











Financial recourse when hiring Ronald W Jibson



Licensed contractors in Utah must obtain a surety bond before performing work on residential properties. Home owners can file a claim against this bond to recoup losses or damages in the event of faulty work.











What else should I know before hiring Ronald W Jibson



Utah requires license applicants to submit a credit report with their application.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Utah, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
