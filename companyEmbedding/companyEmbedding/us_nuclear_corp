US Nuclear Corp to Present at LD Micro Conference


President/CEO to Speak About the China Market, New Advanced Tritium Radiation Detection Monitors and the Growing Terrorist Threat of Black Market Nuclear Material Theft
LOS ANGELES, CA / ACCESSWIRE / November 25, 2015 / US Nuclear Corp. (OTC: UCLE) today announced that its President and CEO, Robert I. Goldstein, will present at the LD Micro Conference on Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 8 AM Pacific Standard Time, at the Luxe Sunset Hotel in Los Angeles, CA. Mr. Goldstein will speak on the topic of the Company's products, the nuclear energy market, how nuclear energy is clean energy, the China nuclear energy opportunity, growing nuclear threats of radioactive materials known as a "dirty bomb", a drone program that carries a special radiation detection system used to detect radiation in the air, and new advanced radiation detector monitors for the nuclear energy industry. Mr. Goldstein said, "China has made a tremendous capital commitment for nuclear energy building hundreds of billions of dollars of reactors and planned reactors to supply their country's growing energy needs, and importantly, to combat the toxic effects of burning coal as a fuel source." Additionally, he added, "There are more credible threats of arms smugglers attempting to sell stolen nuclear material to terrorists and extremist groups like ISIS than ever before. Law enforcement, government agencies and the military require special tools in detecting such material, we seek to provide these additional tools to assist. Our new drone will make an appearance at our presentation to demonstrate how it can help provide critical support to law enforcement and military applications." "We will also discuss the features of our new Model 593 from Overhoff Technology Corp. that offers advanced tritium detection that is 300 times more sensitive than previous models."
Management is also available for individual meetings. Accordingly, the Company will file a Form 8-K on SEC Edgar disclosing its presentation at the LD Micro Conference, and this press release and the presentation deck which will be discussed on Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 8AM Pacific Standard Time will be filed as exhibits.

US Nuclear Corp. Receives $722,500 Contract To Supply U.S. Air Force with Tritium Monitors 








July 6, 2017





LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Jul 6, 2017) - US Nuclear Corp. (
  
   OTCBB
  : 
  
   UCLE
  ) was recently awarded a $722,500 contract to supply the U.S. Air Force with a new fleet of portable Tritium air monitors, bringing their current order back-log up to $2.4 million. The new monitors will replace the fleet of obsolete instruments currently being used. Sandia National Laboratories was enlisted to help the USAF in testing and selecting an appropriate replacement model, and after several years of deliberation, US Nuclear (Overhoff division) was awarded the contract. 
"We are honored that our instrument was selected as the best by Sandia and the USAF, who enlist some of the smartest people in the instrumentation industry," commented Robert Goldstein, CEO of US Nuclear Corp. "It was a long road to receive the contract, but we were confident in the quality and performance of our product. Units will be delivered in partial shipments every month throughout the rest of the year until the quota is met, with payment prior to each shipment to generate cash-flow and keep our momentum strong through 2017." 
The portable tritium monitors are a critical safety instrument, measuring tritium concentration in the ambient air by pumping the air through a set of ionization detectors. An audible and visual alarm will sound if levels exceed the alarm limit, warning the user to evacuate or take action.

US Nuclear Corp. to Open New Office in Beijing and Meet with Drone Executives 








02/15/2017










































LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Feb 15, 2017) -  US Nuclear Corp. (OTCBB: UCLE) is excited to announce the opening of their new office in Beijing, China, which will commence on February 25, 2017. The staff will include local product specialists and trained technicians. 
CEO Robert Goldstein said, "Having our own office in Beijing, China will greatly improve communications between current and future customers, distributors, and key officials. With the support of local sales representatives, we will be able to understand and negotiate the market more adeptly, while our skilled technicians can offer fast and local service for our products. This will help lead the way to major expansion in China's burgeoning nuclear power industry, especially with regards to our popular tritium monitors. Our air and water monitoring products will also be fundamental as China pursues multi-billion dollar programs to tackle air and water pollution." 
Furthermore, while in China, US Nuclear Corp. is scheduled to meet with the leading executives in the drone industry, including investors, suppliers, and distributors. 
Mr. Goldstein added that "US Nuclear is the pioneer in chemical and radiation sniffing drones, so it will be an honor to meet the top players of the drone world in China."
Drones let us rise above our two dimensional world and really see what is going on. US Nuclear takes drones to a whole new level by incorporating chemical and radiation sniffing sensors to give vital, real time information to fire, police, rescue, and border security. US Nuclear's drones allow for unprecedented maneuverability while keeping personnel safe and out of danger. Other applications and industries that would benefit from these enhanced sensing drones also include oil/gas extraction and refining, utilities, pipelines, mining, and clean energy. 
Drone usage around the world is soaring. For more details, please take a look at this inspiring Goldman Sachs report on the $100 billion drone industry:[Native Advertisement]

Technical Associates was founded in 1946 as a spin off from the Manhattan Project. TA’s founders designed and built the first industrial grade radiation monitors to safeguard the scientists building the world’s first atomic bomb. TA excels in product engineering for radiation measurement and safety instruments for a diverse range of requirements, tailoring to the customer’s unique specifications; the result of over 60 years of dedication and commitment to radiation monitoring. Technical Associates places special emphases in air and water monitoring, i.e. developing the world’s only real-time continuous alpha, beta, gamma, and tritium in water monitor capable of measuring at or below EPA/PAG level guidelines.
