Fisher Price Teams with Smart Toy, LLC to Launch New "Smart Toy"

Sep 27, 2015

        Fisher Price, 
      
        Smart Toy,

Smart Toy, LLC is probably better known as Ubooly for launching a fuzzy animal cover for the tablet that uses an application to bring it to life. After a buy out from Cartwheel Kids, LLC in 2014 and a rebranding to Smart Toy, the company has launched its first full "smart" toy.


This Smart Toy Wants to Be Your Child's BFFF

First set to launch on their website in July 2015, the launch was pushed to September and now, it appears Smart Toy's first product will take the company's name Smart Toy® and launch under the Fisher Price brand. The toy is currently in Pre-Sales through Toys-R-Us for $99. Smart Toy, LLC has even received a registered trademark for the generic name - Smart Toy® which is impressive.

This toy appears to pack WiFi, Bluetooth, speech recognition, and camera technology into one cute little furry creature that a parent can customize with their smart phone and activity cards. This is definitely a smart toy to watch this Christmas season and we are excited to see how it fairs on the market.
The price tag of $99 is a great value given the technology and application when compared to other smart toys like the Bluetooth only Dash robot from Wonder Workshop which retails for $169.99.
Likely Fisher Price and Smart Toy are looking for follow-on app purchases of activities and features to cover the margins over time. The typical retail markup would dictate that the cost of goods on a $99 toy is less than $20, which is quite low for all the technology they have packed into these smart bears and monkeys. If this is the case, this is an exciting first step as this "smart" toy technology space to prove that follow-on purchases can cover the cost of the higher priced toys. Maybe in the future kids will have fewer toys but they will be smarter and evolve over time. We at Dynepic® sure think so.






This is not the first time a big toy manufacturer has teamed up with a startup. Mattel, parent company to Fisher Price, teamed with Toy Talk to bring out Hello Barbie, which is due on shelves this October.
It appears that Smart Toy is also marketed under www.smarttoylabs.com so I am sure there is much more to come from this innovative smart toy company.
 
Author Krissa Watry is CEO of Dynepic® where they are building the Internet of Toys and launching services for app developers and toy manufacturers to more easily extend their products to kids and collaboratively connect with others in a safe and parent approved manner. See more here.

      Privacy Policy
    


Effective Date: 14 July 2017
Dynepic, Inc. (“Dynepic” or “We”) is the developer of mobile and web products, including the iOKids Application. 
This Privacy Policy explains the kinds of information, including Personally Identifiable Information (i.e., data that can be reasonably linked to a specific individual or household) (hereafter “PII”), Dynepic collects, uses, stores, and shares in connection with the operation of the iOKids Application using the Internet of Kids Platform, (collectively, "Dynepic Products").
This Privacy Policy also explains the choices that users can make about the information we collect, use, store, and share. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Dynepic does not own or control (including any third-party products or services that you use in conjunction with Dynepic Products). 
The iOKids® Application
Parents can create an iOKids account and add/create a “Child” profile within the iOKids Application. A Parent may add/create a Child profile only for use by an individual under 13. The iOKids Application allows parents to create individualized login credentials for their kids (“Child” or “Children”) to then use to access the iOKids Application.
Dynepic will verify the identity of an adult parent or guardian  (“Parent”) in a Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”)-approved manner, such as through the use of a credit card, debit card, or other payment system in connection with an in-app purchase. This will also give us verifiable consent from each Parent to collect, use, store, and share your Child’s PII in accordance with this Privacy Policy.  From the iOKids Application, a Parent can add their Children, create iOKids login credentials for their Children, and then monitor and control how their Children connect on the iOKids Application and the Internet of Kids Platform.
The iOKids Application allows Children to send messages (Direct and Magic), including VIDEOS with their Parent-approved friends. We will require each Parent’s prior approval for a friend request. In addition, the messages between a friend and a Child can be monitored by each Parent from the iOKids Application. Parents have 30 days to monitor their Child's Magic Message activity with the Parent dashboard. Magic Messages are only shown to a user's friends for 24 hours. A Parent may unfriend a Child's friend thereby blocking communications between the Child and friend. 
The iOKids® Platform
The iOKids Application single sign-on and applications are powered by the iOKids Platform. This platform is where the iOKids Application profiles, preferences, and communications are stored.
Privacy Code—An Overview
We take user privacy and children’s privacy seriously. We strive to:

Be transparent about the different types of information we collect and how we use them.
Ask your permission before sharing PII with third parties and
Use industry standard data security tools to protect the Dynepic Products from unauthorized access and use.

By using the Dynepic Products, you agree to allow us to collect and process information as described below.
What Information Do We Collect and Store?
Before we collect any information from a Child, we require that a Parent first provides COPPA-Compliant verifiable parental consent for us to collect, use, store, and in limited cases, share this information under the provisions of this Privacy Policy.
If at any time our use of your or your Child’s PII changes, you will be asked to provide consent in the iOKids Application prior to our use of the PII in the new manner.
We give Parents the ability to control their children’s data throughout the use of the Dynepic Products. The following table summarizes the information we may collect from Parents and Children and what we store on our cloud servers in order to provide our services.
As explained in the sections below, you the Parent can revoke consent at any time and ensure the PII entered by your Child in our app is permanently deleted.

Parents and Under 13 Accounts
We collect and store the following information from a Parent and their children under 13 on the iOKids Application.

Information provided by the Parent during app setup using the iOKids Application including:

Parent’s Full name
Parent’s Username
Parent’s Age
Parent’s Email
Parent’s Image
Nickname (e.g. What a child calls you.)
Children’s Full name
Children’s Date of Birth
Children’s Image
Children’s Username


IP Address
Device ID
Username
Photographs
Video
In-App purchase payment processing information, which is collected when you purchase through our site, though not stored beyond processing.

When you create an iOKids Application account, we collect and store your email address and password as a Parent. From this point forward, your email address is used for communications from Dynepic.  You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login ID and password which you can update anytime via the iOKids Application. Like most Internet sites, we routinely record log entries of all users (including information such as your IP address) and technical information (such as your browser type and version) when your browser, mobile device or iOKids Application contacts our servers. These log files are used for troubleshooting and are stored on our cloud servers.
The iOKids Application is designed for use by the entire family, including kids of all ages. Dynepic treats the accounts of Children different from those aged 13 and over in order to ensure the privacy protection and safety of kids on the platform.
Parents can review their under 13 Children’s message logs in the iOKids App and we recommend you delete any information inadvertently shared by your Child that you do not want stored (long press on child’s direct message or magic message to delete). Because of the way we maintain certain services, after your information is deleted, backup copies may linger for some time before they are deleted.
Age 13 and Over Accounts
We collect and store the following information from persons age 13 and over (“Young Adults”) on the iOKids Application.

Information provided during app setup using the iOKids Application including:

Full name
Age
Email
Profile Image
Username


Photographs
Videos
IP Address
Device ID

If you are a “Young Adult” user messaging with a Child, your messages will be viewable by the Child’s Parent.

Children Under 13 Years Old
Children can use the iOKids Application with parental controls set by the parent from the iOKids Application. During the iOKids Application setup, a user must enter his or her age. If the age that indicates the user is a Child, the Child is then asked to enter his or her parent’s email address. The iOKids Application then requires a parent to finish setup using the iOKids Application before the Child will be able to log in into the iOKids Application.
All Children must use their iOKids account set up by their Parent. Please notify us immediately if you are aware of a Child who is improperly setup as a Young Adult or a Parent account. Most PII is entered and controlled by the Child’s Parent during account creation and a summary of this information is viewable on the iOKids Application Privacy Dashboard, along with any other PII captured through the services.
Though warnings are displayed that personal information should not be shared on the iOKids platform, a Child may reveal personal information while messaging with their Parent-approved friends. We strongly encourage Parents to monitor the Child’s message logs. Magic Messages are available for 30 days for Parent's to review. While Parents can delete the information from the message history, the data may not be permanently deleted from other devices, including devices of other iOKids users, due to data backups, screenshots of data, etc. It is important Parents discuss with their Children what is appropriate content to exchange with friends.
How does Dynepic use the information it collects?
We may use all of the information we collect and receive for the following general purposes:


To provide services. We use the information we collect and receive to provide you with the services you use or request. For example: If you ask us to remember your login information for the Site, we'll use information stored in cookies when you return to those websites to remember you (“Authentication”).

To improve services. We also use the information we collect and receive to provide content and advertising that people are likely to find relevant and engaging. For example: new platform apps and features.

Maintenance. If we receive information from users that a service isn't working properly, we may use that information to address any problem (“Troubleshooting”).

For a more detailed breakdown of how we use PII specifically, please refer to the following chart.

We may derive aggregated, anonymous information, and analytics data on use of the Dynepic Products. This allows us to analyze usage, trends, and improve our system.
With Whom does Dynepic share my information?
Dynepic limits the sharing of your PII to the greatest extent possible. We use certain reputable third party services to provide an essential piece of the core services of Dynepic’s Products and in those cases PII may be shared. In these cases, we require these providers to protect the confidentiality and security of PII. We may also share certain information with reputable third parties and service providers for activities solely in support of internal operations, such as to perform analytics or to serve contextual advertisements. Under no circumstance do we share PII for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the delivery of Dynepic Products and services.
Except as described herein, we will only provide PII about our users to a third party if required to do so by law, including in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. We may also access, preserve and share information when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to: detect, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activity; to protect ourselves, you and others, including as part of investigations; or to prevent death or imminent bodily harm.
We may take steps to de-identify or otherwise modify the information that we collect so that it is not intended to identify you personally. We may also aggregate information about users so that such information is not intended to specifically identify any users.  We may share this aggregated and anonymous information with third parties in a variety of ways, including to publish trends and improve our system. We require our third party partners to keep all such information in its anonymous form.

There is no standard that governs what, if anything, websites should do when they receive these signals. Dynepic currently does not take action in response to these signals. If and when a standard for responding is established, we may revisit our policy on responding to these signals.
California Residents—Your California Privacy Rights
California’s "Shine the Light" law, Civil Code section 1798.83, requires certain businesses to respond to requests from California customers asking about the business' practices related to disclosing personal information to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternately, such businesses may have in place a policy not to disclose personal information of customers to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. We have such a policy in place.
International Transfer
If any users submit information to Dynepic, it may be necessary to transfer such information we collect internationally. In particular, the information provided likely will be transferred to and processed in the United States by us, our agents or contractors. Our privacy practices are guided by data privacy laws in the United States. The data protection laws of the United States or other countries may not be as comprehensive or equivalent to those in the visitor's country of residence. By using Dynepic Products, visitors consent to the collection, international transfer, storage, and processing of their information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any other privacy notice provided at the time the information is collected, and your personal information may be subject to legal requirements, including lawful requirements to disclose personal information to government authorities, in those jurisdictions.
Security & Safety
Dynepic takes security seriously and cares about the integrity of personal information and PII. We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while transmitted from your devices through the Internet to our cloud servers.
We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions, including, where appropriate, password protection, encryption, SSL, firewalls, and internal restrictions on who may access data to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security.
You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, tablet, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared device, choosing a unique, robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
We expect Parents to use the iOKids Application as a “verified” Parent to manage and monitor their Children’s under 13 iOKids accounts. For the security of everyone on the platform and to ensure people know who they are interacting with, please do NOT log on and interact as the Child. As the Parent, you can message a Parent, but you should not message a Child’s friend unless their Parent has allowed you to be on their Child’s approved friends list.
When you set up an iOKids user account, your password is encrypted. If you need to reset your password, you will need to confirm it via e-mail. Children’s password resets will be sent to the parent’s email since the Child does not have an email account. If you have a Child with the iOKids Application, make sure that your iOKids user account is only connected to other iOKids accounts you know and trust. Children under 13 years of age must use the login credentials setup by the Parent to sign into the iOKids app. Note, the Children’s iOKids login credentials will not allow them to log in to the iOKids “Parent” account and we recommend the parent NEVER provide their Parent credentials to the Child.
For safety purposes, the iOKids Application is designed so that there is no ability for users to contact under 13 accounts on the iOKids Application until both Child's Parent and the Child’s friend accept a friend invitation. Parents are expected to monitor their Child's iOKids friends list and message history using the iOKids Application Parent Dashboard. A Parent may delete message history, pictures, and videos they want deleted from their Child’s conversations.
Updates To This Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to change our practices and our Privacy Policy at any time. We will notify you of material changes to our privacy practices by placing an updated privacy policy on the Site or in some circumstances we may notify you through other means. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify you via an email to the email address associated with your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.

If you want to contact Dynepic for any reason, including to review or update personal information collected on our Sites, have it deleted, or request that there be no further collection, use, or disclosure of personal information, please direct all correspondence to: Dynepic, Inc., PO Box 297, Folly Beach, SC 29439 or email privacy@iokids.net.
