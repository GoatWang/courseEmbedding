STATEMENT OF QUALIFICATION
All information included herein is not intended to be, and should not be construed as, an offer or a solicitation of an offer of securities of any kind. Any such offer or solicitation will be made only after one has been qualified and has received a confidential private offering memorandum relating to a particular investment. Access to information about our investments is limited to investors who qualify as accredited investors within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
Investments in real estate, real estate-related products, private equity funds, and other alternative investments (collectively, "Alternative Investments") involve a high degree of risk and often engage in leverage and other speculative investment practices that may increase the risk of investment loss. Alternative Investments may be highly illiquid, may not be required to provide periodic pricing or valuation information to investors, may involve complex tax structures that could result in delays in distributing tax information, may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as public securities, may charge fees which could offset any profits and the underlying investments may not be transparent and may be known only to the investment manager. Alternative Investment performance can be volatile and an investor could lose all or a substantial amount of his or her investment. There is often no secondary market for Alternative Investment interests and there may be restrictions on transferring interests in such Alternative Investments. Further, investing in foreign markets may entail risks that differ from those associated with investments in U.S. markets. The past performance of Alternative Investments is not indicative of future results.
Information appearing on this website is provided for general informational purposes only.  Kipling Capital, Inc makes no representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of documentation provided by an offering's manager/sponsor or information gathered pertaining to an offering and/or the offering's manager/sponsor. Kipling Capital shall not have any liability for any representations made by managers/sponsors or for any statements appearing on this website. Investors should make their own inquiries with regards to an individual investment and consult with their own advisors regarding the appropriateness of an offering and related legal, tax and regulatory matters. In making investment decisions, investors must rely on their own examinations including merits and risks involved.

Notable AffiliationsView »



HISTORY OF THE FIRM
Integrity, Experience and Trust
Since our inception in 1999, the principals of Kipling Capital have raised over $925 million in equity capital to fund over 450 real estate projects including office, industrial, retail, resort and residential properties valued in excess of $6.5 billion. Targeted annual investor returns (IRR) on these investments have ranged from 9.5% to 58% and programs have typically provided investors with tax deferred or tax exempt income, monthly or quarterly cash flow, and a preferred return to investors.
In 2004, the principals of Kipling Capital, Inc. formed Kipling Investors, LLC for purposes of investing in investment products offered by Kipling Capital.  All investments are made side-by-side with Kipling Capital's clients on the same terms and conditions.  Over the past years, the principals of Kipling Investors, LLC and our Sponsors have committed to co-invest over $60 million alongside our investors in investments offered by Kipling Capital, Inc.  We believe that the commonality of interests created with meaningful co-investment is a key component of our investment success.
Over the course of their professional careers, the Kipling principals have been instrumental in structuring and financing the acquisition and development of many notable properties including Meadowood-Napa Valley, Pebble Beach Resorts, Post Ranch Inn, The Santa Lucia Preserve and the Chileno Bay Club in Cabo San Lucas.

        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
