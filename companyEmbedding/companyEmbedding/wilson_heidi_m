		Report Unethical or Illegal Conduct and Accounting Issues

It takes courage to raise an ethical or legal issue. Whether you are an employee or not, report your knowledge or suspicions of unethical conduct, including violations of our Business Ethics Guide and established codes of ethics and conduct for accounting, internal accounting controls, auditing, and anti-corruption matters. Call the Tennant Ethics Hotline 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and a third party — independent of Tennant management — will accept reports of known or suspected unethical or illegal conduct.
Reports are treated confidentially in compliance with relevant legal obligations and guidelines. Although we do not discourage anonymous reporting, anonymous reports may be prohibited in some countries where Tennant operates, and we can perform a more thorough and complete investigation if we can obtain further information from the reporter. There will be no reprisals against any employee reporting a violation or suspected violation in good faith.
