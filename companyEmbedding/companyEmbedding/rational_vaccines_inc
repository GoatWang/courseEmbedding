Rational Vaccines (RVx) has developed the world’s first line of live-attenuated herpes simplex virus vaccines that have been shown to be up to 100 times more effective than traditional subunit vaccine approaches.    THERAVAXTheravaxHSV is a therapeutic vaccination series. By retraining the immune system to better control herpes simplex virus (HSV), TheravaxHSV offers sufferers the possibility of reducing their genital herpes symptoms.Phase 1 Clinical Trials of TheravaxHSV are imminent. Learn more    PROFAVAXProfavaxHSV is a prophylactic vaccination series that offers the opportunity for recipients to acquire protective immunity against HSV-1 or HSV-2, and thus protect themselves against the risk of acquiring oral or genital herpes.Phase 1 Clinical Trials of ProfavaxHSV will begin after the TheravaxHSV vaccine has completed Phase 1 safety trials. Learn more  HSV ABVIC TestThe accurate, reliable, and rapid herpes test that you will be able to order from home.RVx has developed a new herpes serology test that measures Antibody Binding to Virus-Infected Cells (ABVIC). The HSV ABVIC Test measures a person’s total level of HSV-1 vs. HSV-2-specific antibodies in a manner that is up to 100 times more sensitive than ELISA-based tests, which represent the current standard of medical care. Learn More  Accurate Info…four billion people around the globe are infected with herpes simplex virus serotype 1 (HSV-1) and/or herpes simplex virus serotype 2 (HSV-2), and every week more than one million people are newly infected.About four billion people around the world are infected with herpes. This high frequency of infection is driven by an epidemic in which chronic carriers transmit their herpes infections to over one million uninfected persons per week.  The depth of suffering caused by herpes is underappreciated by the general public, as well as many doctors who have been misled to believe that it is “just a skin condition.”   The absence of a preventative vaccine ensures that 10% of our children will acquire genital herpes before they are married.
