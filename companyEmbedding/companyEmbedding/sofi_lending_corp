History[edit]
SoFi was founded in 2011 by Mike Cagney, Dan Macklin, James Finnigan, and Ian Brady, four students who met at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. The founders hoped SoFi could provide more affordable options for those taking on debt to fund their education.[1] The company’s inaugural loan program was a $2 million pilot at Stanford. For this pilot, 40 alumni invested an average of $50,000 to 100 students.[2][3][4]
In September 2012, SoFi raised $77.2 million, led by Baseline Ventures, with participation from DCM and Renren.[5][6]
On October 2, 2013, SoFi announced that it had raised $500 million in debt and equity to fund and refinance student loans. This total funding amount came from $90 million in equity, $151 million in debt, and $200 million in bank participations, with the remaining capital from alumni and community investors.[7] The $151 million in debt includes a $60 million line of credit from Morgan Stanley, and a $41 million line of credit from Bancorp.[8][9][10]
As of September 2013, SoFi had funded $200 million in loans to 2500 borrowers at the company’s 100 eligible schools.[11]
In November 2013, SoFi announced a deal with Barclays and Morgan Stanley to create a bond backed by peer-to-peer student loans, and this would create the first securitization of these loans to receive a credit rating.[12]
In April 2014, SoFi raised $80 million in a Series C round led by Discovery Capital Management with participation from Peter Thiel, Wicklow Capital, and existing investors. Money was raised to expand the footprint of the company's student loan refinancing business and to extend into new products like mortgages and personal loans.[13]
In February 2015, the company announced a $200 million funding round led by Third Point Management. That same month, the company officially began offering personal loans.[14][15]
By March 2015, the company was offering mortgages in more than 20 states, up from its initial launch that included under ten states in October, 2014.[16][17]
By April 2015, the company had funded more than $2 billion in loans, including student loan refinancing, mortgages, personal loans and MBA loans. To celebrate its $2 billion milestone, SoFi announced a contest, #2BillionTogether, to pay off one of its members student loans.[18]
In September 2015, Former SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt was added as an advisor. The firm also raised a $1 billion round of investment from SoftBank[19] and said it had funded $4 billion in loans.[20]
In May 2016, SoFi became the first startup online lender to receive a triple-A rating from Moody's.[21]
In September 2016, SoFi launched SoFi at Work, an employee benefit program to reduce student debt and build financial wellness, and announced it has more than 600 corporate partners including Debtbench.com among others.[22]
As of October 2016, SoFi has funded more than $12 billion in total loan volume and has 175,000 members.[23] In February 2017, it was announced that Social Finance Inc. raised an additional $500 million from an investor group led by Silver Lake, and also including SoftBank, to help support global expansion.[24][25]
Model[edit]
SoFi originally utilized an alumni-funded lending model that connected students and recent graduates with alumni and institutional investors via school specific student loan funds.[26] Investors received a financial return and borrowers received rates lower than the federal government offered. The company sought to minimize defaults by focusing on low-risk students and graduates.[27]
As SoFi’s product offerings expanded to include mortgages, mortgage refinancing and personal loans, the company moved away from an alumni-funded model to a non-traditional underwriting approach focused on lending to financially responsible individuals. SoFi uses an underwriting model that examines free cash flow, professional history and education in addition to a history of responsible bill payment to evaluate its borrowers.[28]

SoFi, an Online Lender, Is Looking for a Relationship

SAN FRANCISCO — Alyson Casey recently received an invitation to a singles event in Manhattan from a start-up. But it didn’t come from a dating service. It came from the company that had recently refinanced her student loan: SoFi.The idea of a financial firm playing matchmaker initially struck Ms. Casey, a 35-year-old software saleswoman, as rather unorthodox. But the invitation promised an even split of men and women, and free drinks at the rooftop bar of the James hotel.After a few glasses of wine — and a few phone numbers collected — the idea of a student lender helping her find a mate made a lot of sense to her.“These are people with a similar mind-set,” said Ms. Casey, who used SoFi to refinance the student loan that paid for her M.B.A. at New York University. “People who aren’t risk-averse. People who understand a good investment.”

Ms. Casey is not the only one who has been impressed by SoFi’s strategy of stretching the definition of what a lender should do. In addition to holding singles events, SoFi — short for Social Finance Inc. — provides career counseling, wine tastings and home-buying workshops, and is starting to provide financial services other than loans.

This approach is helping elevate SoFi with potential customers and investors in a business — online lending — that has had no shortage of trouble over the past year.After growing swiftly for several years, the nascent industry of online lending was severely shaken in May, when the largest company in the field, Lending Club, dumped its founder and acknowledged financial records were misstated.The investors who had been buying loans originated by Lending Club and rivals like Prosper, OnDeck and Funding Circle fled from nearly everyone in the market, including SoFi, forcing the lenders to curtail their business significantly at a time when they needed to grow to fulfill the expectations of venture capitalists.

SoFi courted its own controversy with unapologetically elitist advertisements, including one during the Super Bowl in January. The company generally lends money only to young, wealthy borrowers — whom it refers to as Henrys, an acronym for high earners, not rich yet.But as the turmoil has calmed down, SoFi is emerging as the new leader. In May a SoFi bond backed by the company’s loans was awarded an Aaa rating by Moody’s Investors Service, a first for SoFi. The company is now originating more student, personal and home loans than it was before the Lending Club crisis, unlike its competitors.So far this year, SoFi has lent out $5.5 billion, up from the $5.2 billion it originated all of last year, and the $1.3 billion it did in 2014. The company has now issued loans to 175,000 customers.“They are the No. 1 player in the space now,” said Matt Burton, the co-founder of Orchard Platform, which provides a marketplace for online lenders.

In a recent interview at SoFi’s offices in San Francisco, the chief executive, Mike Cagney, said the company was preparing to expand to Europe and Asia, and to introduce products like life insurance in the coming months.Mr. Cagney has recently been traveling through Asia and Europe, raising around $500 million in new funding for SoFi. The new investors will increase SoFi’s valuation from its last fund-raising round, when it was worth $4 billion, Mr. Cagney said, though he declined to say what valuation it was targeting.The previous rounds involved Daniel S. Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point; Peter Thiel; and the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank.Mr. Cagney declined to answer questions about any plans for an initial public offering — SoFi had been working toward one, but put it off when it raised money in 2015.The new money will help support Mr. Cagney’s ambitions to expand SoFi from a specialized student loan provider to one offering wealth management, deposit accounts and other products.

In addition to singles events, SoFi offers career counseling and home-buying workshops.The firm started by refinancing student loans, but is expanding into other product lines.

Matt Harris, a partner at Bain Capital Ventures, said that among the most intractable hurdles facing online lenders were the high cost of acquiring customers and the difficulty of building a relationship that outlasts the first loan.He said that SoFi had found a neat solution to these problems by providing additional services, like the singles events and career counseling.“It is a very different strategy than the more transactional lenders,” said Mr. Harris, who is not an investor in SoFi, referring to competitors like Lending Club. “If you are playing a lifetime value game — a relationship game — you have a lot more leeway to subsidize more products and you are less subject to commodification and the vagaries of competition.”

For example, Mr. Cagney said that half of the people who had taken out mortgages with SoFi began as student loan customers. He started the company with three co-founders in 2011 by refinancing the student loans of fellow Stanford business school graduates.

Within 18 months, he expects that mortgages, which were introduced just this year, will be the company’s biggest product line. They currently represent about 15 percent of SoFi’s business, while student loan refinancing is still roughly 50 percent.Mr. Cagney, however, is likely to confront plenty of hurdles.Because SoFi and the other online lenders are not banks, they do not have a steady base of consumer deposits to fund their loans. As a result they must rely on big investors, who are often alarmed when there is any sign of trouble — as happened earlier this year.Since the spring, Mr. Cagney has frequently been on the road, getting bigger credit lines from banks and searching for a broader array of investors to buy the company’s loans. He said SoFi now had a credit line of $4 billion from banks that it could use to originate loans even without investors, in contrast to the $1 billion it had when the first signs of trouble struck the online lending industry last winter.Mr. Cagney has also been spending time in Utah, weighing whether to seek a bank charter from the state, which would allow SoFi to begin collecting deposits. SoFi is opening a service center in Utah, and Mr. Cagney said he was looking into what becoming a bank would mean. He is still wary, because regulations may limit SoFi’s ability to do things like hold singles and networking events.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation “is very particular about what banks can and cannot do,” he said. “There are a lot of things we do that don’t fit into a bank holding company, that are critical to our brand and our mission. If we can’t do those things, we lose a lot of what makes SoFi different.”

On the regulatory front, some industry experts have said that SoFi could face problems because of its elitist approach, serving only customers with the most pristine credit. In the most recent pool of SoFi personal loans, the average annual income of the borrowers was $144,000 a year, and the average credit score was 733, according to the rating agency Kroll.Banking regulations bar lenders from any practices that have a discriminatory impact on minorities, even if the impact is a result of algorithms rather than human decision making. While not a bank at the moment, SoFi is audited by the F.D.I.C. and regulated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.The pursuit of elite customers also leaves some investors concerned that SoFi will not have a base of potential consumers large enough to sustain a big business. These customers often pay off their loans quickly and are, by their very nature, relatively few in number.

That is why Mr. Cagney is looking to Europe and Asia, and is building out more products to offer his customers.At the singles event in New York, the clientele appeared to appreciate SoFi’s strategy.Ms. Casey, the software saleswoman, said that after refinancing her student loan she had refinanced her credit card debt with SoFi when the company began offering that service last year.A few tables over, Lisa Akey said she learned about SoFi from a classmate at school who loved it, and had since talked up the company to her friends.“Immediately I felt it was a company I could trust,” said Ms. Akey, 32, a brand manager at Unilever. “I feel like banks are just banks. SoFi feels like it’s more built around people.”Kim Hutchison, a 34-year-old lawyer, said she had refinanced her law school debt a month earlier and had been preapproved for a mortgage with SoFi just hours before the event.“They are making their customers into better risks and more committed customers,” she said. “I’m jealous of their business model. I wish I had thought of it.”

At the end of any deferment, the total loan balance will be reamortized over the remaining term of the loan. A borrower may request deferment by completing and signing a deferment request form and providing the appropriate documentation requested on the form. Restrictions apply.

However, if you choose a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit pull.Can I refinance previously consolidated loans with SoFi?Yes.  Whether you previously consolidated federal loans through the government’s Direct or FFEL consolidation programs or you did a “consolidation loan” with a private lender, you can still apply to refinance the consolidated loan through SoFi just the way you could with any other federal or private loan.When is the best time to refinance?The earlier you refinance to a lower loan rate, the more money you will save. Even if you are in your grace period, interest accrues for unsubsidized federal loans. SoFi will honor the first six months of any existing grace period of the loans you refinance with us.Who should refinance?Refinancing is a great solution for working graduates who have high-interest, unsubsidized Direct Loans, Graduate PLUS loans, and/or private loans. Federal loans do carry some special benefits, for example, public service forgiveness and economic hardship programs, that may not be accessible to you after you refinance. Check out this blog post that provide more information: When to Consolidate Federal and Private Loans by Refinancing.

If you believe you are a good candidate for refinancing, we encourage you to apply. Loan eligibility also depends on a number of additional factors, such as your financial history, your income sources and your employment. Please review our Eligibility Criteria or call us for further details.Can my spouse and I refinance and consolidate all of our loans into one?No. A consolidated SoFi loan can only be comprised of loans that were previously in one person’s name. However, you and your spouse can apply separately for refinancing.Is it possible to refinance both federal and private student loans?Yes, SoFi will consolidate all qualified education loans.What is the difference between consolidation and refinancing?When you consolidate federal loans through the federal loan consolidation program, you’re combining multiple loans together with a resulting interest rate that’s the weighted average of your original loans’ rates.  When you refinance loans with a private lender, you’re also consolidating (i.e. combining) them, but the lender will use your financial information to give you a new, hopefully lower, interest rate.Does SoFi offer a grace period?SoFi will honor the first six months of any existing grace period of the loans you refinance with us.What is the difference between interest rate and APR?The interest rate is the percentage of the loan amount that is charged for borrowing money. The APR includes not only the interest rate, but also certain other fees charged by the lender, and represents the total cost of borrowing. 
Does SoFi have a variable rate product?Yes, we have a variable rate product.

The maximum amount is the full balance of your qualified education loans.Why was my application to refinance my student loans rejected?While SoFi aims to ultimately improve financial services for everyone, today we’re able to offer student loan refinancing to highly qualified applicants who meet a number of criteria. We determine eligibility on a number of factors, not limited to:

1. A US citizen or permanent resident.
2. Hold a 4-year undergraduate or graduate degree from a Title IV accredited institution.
3. Good employment history. Currently employed, have sufficient income from other sources, or have an offer of employment to start within the next 90 days.
4. In good standing on current student loans.
5. Strong monthly cash flow.
6. A responsible financial history.

If one of the above factors changes, such as your employment or monthly cash flow, we encourage you to apply again in the future.Are there origination or prepayment fees for SoFi loans?No, there are no origination or prepayment fees on SoFi Student Refi loans.Do you require or accept co-signers for Student Loans?Yes. While adding a co-signer is not required, it may help you qualify for a loan or a lower interest rate.How do I add a co-signer to my loan?For guidance on how to add a co-signer, contact us via phone at (855) 456-7634, email (customerservice@sofi.org) or chat once you’ve logged in.How long will adding a co-signer to my loan take?Adding a co-signer is quick—it’s just an email invitation. Depending on your co-signer’s financial situation, the review process for an application with a co-signer may take one to two weeks longer.What are the advantages and disadvantages of adding a co-signer to my loan?If you are pre-approved for a loan, adding a co-signer may lower your rate—but the review process with a co-signer takes one to two weeks longer.If I default on my loan, is my co-signer responsible for repaying my loan?Yes. If you default on your loan, your co-signer will be liable to pay it.If I build a good payment history for an extended period of time, can my co-signer be removed?No. The cosigner can only be removed if they pass away, or if you chose to refinance your SoFi loan and qualify on your own.Why does my co-signer have to sign the agreement without seeing the rates?In short, they consent to your loan before you see your rates so that we can factor in your co-signer when we show your rates. 


SoFi provides you the option of adding a co-signer as an opportunity to help you qualify for a loan. Once you request a co-signer, we will instruct your co-signer to complete the application and consent to co-signing your loan. Since adding a co-signer to your application introduces additional effort for our review team, we want to ensure your co-signer is committed to helping you reduce your student debt and ask for their consent to co-sign at the beginning of the process. We will notify you if you are pre-approved with a co-signer; from that point, you will be able to see your rates and select a loan. 

Once you have been presented with your offer, SoFi recommends that you discuss the rates and loan terms with your co-signer before proceeding with your application. Your co-signer is not obligated, in any way, if you do not accept the terms.Will making a large payment or additional payments change my monthly due amount?Making a large payment or additional payment on a Student Loan Refinance can adjust your payment. Each month we work with our servicing partner Mohela to review the amortization schedule of each student loan to ensure it has been properly followed. If we find your loan payment may be significantly affected, the loan will be reamortized. This is done to prevent a balloon payment at the end of your term. If you make a large payment, your monthly payment amount can decrease, but the remaining time to pay off your loan will remain the same.Are SoFi Loans considered “student loans” for tax purposes?SoFi loans are considered student loans for federal and state tax consideration. Note that you may or may not be eligible for interest deduction depending on your individual tax situation. You should consult your tax advisor for more information.Can I refinance a Parent PLUS loan?Yes, you can refinance a Parent PLUS loan provided you meet the Eligibility Criteria.Can my child on whose behalf I took out a Parent PLUS loan refinance my loan in his or her name?It is possible to refinance a Parent PLUS loan into your child’s name, but your child must apply.  Please contact Customer Support to learn more.Who is MOHELA?MOHELA is SoFi’s third-party loan servicer for student loans.  Once your loan is funded, servicing will be provided by our partner MOHELA, who will contact you to set up an account and collect your monthly payments.  While your loan will be serviced by MOHELA after it has been funded, you will still be a SoFi member and be able to take advantage of our unique member benefits. What is the Entrepreneurship Program?The Entrepreneurship Program is available to SoFi members who have already refinanced with us and have entered repayment. Qualified applicants may receive 6-month deferment and will have access to networking and professional mentorship opportunities. Visit our Entrepreneur Program page for more information.Do you have a Referral Program?Yes and we would love your help in spreading the word to help your friends save money. Check out our Referral Program, which rewards you with cash for new applicants you refer.MortgagesWill applying for a mortgage or mortgage refinancing affect my credit?To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score. However, if you choose a product and continue your application, we will request your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies, which is considered a hard credit pull.Will checking the rates and terms that I qualify for affect my credit?To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score.

Maximum loan amount and program requirements apply.
Can I refinance an existing mortgage?Yes, qualified applicants may apply for refinancing and a minimum of 20% equity is required.Do you require private mortgage insurance (PMI)?No, we do not require PMI on any of our jumbo loans.

What is the difference between a pre-qualification and a pre-approval?A pre-qualification is an estimate of how much you can borrow and the rates you may be eligible for (as determined using today’s rates), based on a preliminary review of your credit report and information you provided to us. With SoFi, there is no fee to get pre-qualified and we do a soft credit pull, which means it won’t affect your credit score.

A pre-approval is a more formal offer, based on a complete credit check, evaluation of your employment history, income and assets, and the completion of the Automated Valuation Model (AVM) for the property you’d like to purchase. A pre-approval allows you to submit an offer with confidence that you are personally approved for a loan. Once you have identified a property to purchase, it must meet SoFi property eligibility standards.Does SoFi require a property appraisal?Yes, for the majority of transactions a property appraisal is required with the exception of those that are eligible for a Fannie Mae Property Inspection Waiver.What is your rate lock policy?SoFi may grant requests for a 30-day rate lock after receipt of a signed purchase contract or a fully completed refinance application. Otherwise, please note that mortgage rates may change on a daily basis.Do you charge loan origination fees?No, we do not charge origination fees on our mortgage products. However, you will still be responsible for standard third-party closing costs as well as other fees like credit report and flood certification.What are standard third-party closing costs?Closing costs are costs associated with a new mortgage or a refinance of an existing mortgage. Typical closing costs include fees for appraisal, title insurance, title search, transfer taxes, settlement services, property taxes and hazard insurance premiums and government recording fees. These fees vary depending on the transaction type and the geographic location of the property.Are there prepayment penalties?No, you can pay off your loan early without incurring a prepayment penalty.
Parent LoansWill applying for a parent loan affect my credit?To check the rates and terms you qualify for, SoFi conducts a soft credit pull that will not affect your credit score.

Entrepreneur ProgramWhat stage businesses is SoFi looking for?

We don’t have strict requirements, but it certainly helps if you have achieved milestones like being accepted into an incubator, receiving investor funding, earning early revenue, or getting outstanding user traction. Many entrepreneurs in the program are preparing to raise seed rounds of funding ranging from $200K-$3M.

Does SoFi take any equity in exchange for the benefits of the program?


No, you keep ownership and control over your business.



 How competitive is the application process?We admit classes of 8-12 entrepreneurs every 3 months, so the program is still very competitive, even among qualified applicants. Because of this, our application committee has tended to admit applicants who have demonstrated external validation (for example: early customers, revenue, funding, awards, or product milestones) but recognizes that varies depending on the type of business.Does SoFi provide office space?


No, but you’re always welcome to meet an investor at our offices.



 How long does the program last and do I need to relocate?Once you join the Entrepreneur Program, you are part of our network indefinitely. Core benefits of the program, including formal pitch opportunities and coordinated peer networking, last 6 months.

No, you can receive most benefits remotely, though we will facilitate occasional in-person events for members in the San Francisco Bay Area.
How do I apply concurrently?Complete the Entrepreneur Program application on this page, and apply to refinance your student loan through the normal application. If accepted into the Entrepreneur Program, we’ll then work with you to grant the deferment.

Do I have to defer my loans?



No, you may opt to continue paying off your loans and still receive the other benefits of the program.




Asset Management ProductsWho can invest with SoFi Asset Management?SoFi Asset Management offers a range of investment funds for individual and institutional investors. For more information on our products, please contact 
assetmgmt@sofi.org.

Unemployment Protection ProgramWhat is SoFi’s Unemployment Protection Program?If you lose your job through no fault of your own, you may apply for the Unemployment Protection Program. If approved for the program, SoFi will put your loans into forbearance, suspending your monthly SoFi loan payments. Unemployment Protection is offered in three month increments, and is capped at 12 months, in aggregate, over the life of the loan.

During each three-month forbearance period, unpaid interest will continue to accrue and will be capitalized (added) onto your principal balance. You do have the option to make interest-only payments during this period in order to prevent the interest from increasing your principal balance.Who is eligible for Unemployment Protection?Refinanced student loans and personal loans are eligible for Unemployment Protection. Mortgage loans are not eligible for Unemployment Protection.
To apply for this assistance you must:

– Be a current SoFi member
– Provide proof that you are eligible for unemployment benefits, or have proof of involuntary severance with an employer
– Actively work with our Career Advisory Group to look for new employment
How do I apply for Unemployment Protection?The application process depends on the type of loan you have:

Student Loans:
For SoFi’s student loans, members should fill out the SoFi General Forbearance Request Form (download now), gather the required documents (proof of unemployment benefits and/or involuntary severance with an employer) and submit via  MOHELA’s website.
After submitting the paperwork, we suggest proactively submitting information via the Career Advisory request form to get the ball rolling more quickly (note that engaging with the Career Advisory Group is a requirement for Unemployment Protection, but reaching out to the team does not increase the chance of approval).
After all documents have been received by MOHELA, the decision process generally takes up to 5 business days to complete. If you have questions about the status of your Unemployment Protection application for this type of loan, please contact MOHELA directly.
Personal Loans:
For SoFi’s personal loans, members should fill out the SoFi Personal Loan Forbearance Request Form (download now) and submit the required documents (proof of unemployment benefits and/or involuntary severance with an employer) per the form’s instructions.
After submitting the paperwork, we suggest proactively submitting information via the Career Advisory request form to get the ball rolling more quickly (note that engaging with the Career Advisory Group is a requirement for Unemployment Protection, but reaching out to the team does not increase the chance of approval).
After all documents have been received by SoFi’s Support team, the decision process generally takes up to 5 business days to complete. If you have questions about the Unemployment Protection application for this type of loan, please contact SoFi’s Support team directly.

If you have more than one type of loan with SoFi, you’ll need to apply for Unemployment Protection for each loan. Note that mortgage loans are not eligible for Unemployment Protection.
Note that the same application process should be followed if extending past the initial three-month Unemployment Protection term.Will my approval in the Unemployment Protection Program affect my credit score?When approved for Unemployment Protection, your loan is placed into forbearance. This status is reported to the credit bureaus, and may be a factor in credit-based decisions from other institutions.
How will my loan payments be affected after Unemployment Protection ends?Each forbearance period lasts for three months. You can re-apply to extend this in three-month increments, up to 12 months over the life of the loan.
During the forbearance period, interest will continue to accrue. Unpaid interest will be capitalized (added) to your principal balance at the end of each three-month forbearance period. If you’re able, we recommend making interest-only payments during this time in order to prevent the interest from being capitalized to the loan principal.
For student loans, forbearance does not extend the loan repayment term.

If interest-only payments are made during the forbearance period, the amount of the principal balance will not increase. Monthly loan payments will increase due to the same loan amount needing to be paid over the same repayment term.
If no payments are made during the forbearance period, the amount of the principal balance will increase. The increase to monthly payments will be more significant than if interest payments were made during the forbearance period.

For personal loans, forbearance does extend the loan repayment term.

If interest-only payments are made during the forbearance period, the repayment term will be extended, but monthly payments will not increase.
If no payments are made during the forbearance period, the unpaid interest will increase the principal balance, and will increase the monthly payment.
I’ve been denied for Unemployment Protection / forbearance. Why?To be eligible for Unemployment Protection, you must be a current SoFi member and provide proof that you are eligible for unemployment benefits or have proof of involuntary severance with an employer.
Denial for Unemployment Protection may happen because:

– One or more of the eligibility requirements have not been met (for example, involuntary job loss is an eligibility requirement for Unemployment Protection, so members who have voluntarily quit their jobs are not eligible)
– All eligibility criteria have been met, but required documentation wasn’t submitted

Regardless of your enrollment in Unemployment Protection, all members can request job search assistance from the Career Advisory Group, who can advise on job search and interview techniques, networking, and offer negotiation.
If I accept a job before the end date of my approved forbearance, do my loan payments get reinstated and become due immediately?No. Once a forbearance is approved, it is not revoked regardless of employment status.  Members can choose to resume payments if they’d like; however, they can wait until the forbearance officially ends to begin making payments.
Note that interest will continue to accrue and be capitalized onto the loan’s principal balance during your forbearance period. Please read the How will my loan payments be affected after Unemployment Protection ends? section for more information. Wealth ManagementWho is eligible for SoFi Wealth? Do I have to be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident?SoFi Wealth is open to all US citizens and permanent residents.  Permanent residents will have to provide passport information and their US taxpayer ID containing a physical address to verify your identity.Does opening an account impact my credit score?No. The Federal Government requires all custodians for investment advisors to verify the identity of investors for anti-money laundering purposes, but it does not impact your credit.Can I transfer an existing IRA or 401(k) to SoFi?Yes. SoFi Wealth can accommodate a range of retirement accounts and rollover options. We offer Traditional, Roth, and SEP IRAs.Can I pick individual ETFs or buy single stocks through SoFi Wealth?SoFi Wealth offers portfolios based on risk tolerance. Each portfolio is comprised of 5-7 different ETFs and is managed on a discretionary basis by our portfolio team.  We do not currently offer the ability to purchase stocks or individual ETFs outside of the managed portfolios, but may be able to accommodate other reasonable restrictions.Does SoFi Wealth invest my money in SoFi loans?No, the funds in your SoFi Wealth account go into freely tradable securities, such as ETFs. How long will it take for my money to be invested?Creating an account and scheduling a deposit takes just a few minutes. Our advisors must first approve your account and confirm your bank information. Then it takes about a day for funds to be wired into a new account, depending on the money transfer policies of your bank. Those funds are invested as soon as practicable once they are deposited into the account.Are your Advisors licensed?Yes, all SoFi Wealth Financial Advisors are registered as investment adviser representatives and hold the Series 65 or another qualifying examination or designation. This means they are held to a fiduciary standard and are required to act in our clients’ best interests. In addition, none of the Advisors earn commission, so the incentive to “upsell” is minimized.Are your accounts insured?Your account is invested in assets that may lose value. However, the introducing broker for the account, SoFi Securities, LLC, and the custodian of securities, Apex Clearing, are members of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC). SIPC protects the securities in your brokerage account up to $500,000, including $250,000 for claims for cash. For details, please see www.sipc.org.Is SoFi Wealth a Broker Dealer or Registered Investment Advisor?Your investment advice relationship is with SoFi Wealth, LLC, a Registered Investment Advisor that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Transactions in your account are introduced (as “agent for custody”) to an independent custodian, Apex Clearing, by SoFi Securities, an affiliated company that is a FINRA registered Broker Dealer. Your securities and money are held by a third party clearing firm (or “custodian”), Apex Clearing, who is also a FINRA registered Broker Dealer.What is the minimum amount to invest?We  believe that investing should be available to all that can afford to do so, so we’ve kept the minimum low—just $500 (or an automatic periodic transfer of at least $100 per month). There is no minimum holding period and you can withdraw your money at any time. Of course, if you have a retirement account there may be tax consequences for withdrawing your money, so be sure to talk to your tax advisor.What are ETFs?ETFs are exchange-traded funds. These are collections of investments that trade as a single security, and they commonly offer a simplified, low-cost way to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks and/or bonds. On the one hand, they work like mutual funds, with tax advantages as well as diversification from investing in a broad range of assets. On the other hand, you get the flexibility and low costs of individual stocks.
ETFs can invest in most types of securities, and be actively managed or not. Actively managed ETFs typically have higher management fees than passively managed ones. SoFi Wealth primarily invests in passively invested ETFs through its model portfolios. We proactively manage the mix of these funds and will change that mix as world economic conditions or our outlook change. This gives you the advantages of active management, the broad diversification of index funds, and the low fees of index ETFs and our ultra-low management fee. Keep in mind that diversification does not eliminate risk and does not assure better performance.
How often will my portfolio be rebalanced?Rebalancing is when we sell some the ETFs that have gone up in value and buy more of the ones that went down in order to keep your portfolio close to its original mix of investments (called the “neutral allocation”). It is important to do this periodically. We will look at portfolios at least quarterly to see if any one asset is more than 5 percentage points off its neutral allocation (called a “tolerance band”). If so, we’ll rebalance the account. We might do it more often if, for example, there is a big move in one asset class, or if we decide to change the mix of the funds in the portfolio.If I sign up for SoFi Wealth at just 0.25% annually, will your financial advisors try to upsell me?No. We believe the best advice is unbiased advice, so SoFi Wealth’s financial advisors aren’t compensated on commission. They’re accessible when you have questions or need some help, but they won’t cold call you with aggressive upselling like other advisors might do. We think it’s important to make sure our incentives are aligned with yours, and we believe this is the best way to do it.What kinds of accounts can I have?We currently offer individual accounts, owned by one person; retirement accounts, such as traditional deductible IRA accounts, Roth IRAs, and Simplified Employee Pensions; and joint accounts that can be held by more than one person.Can I roll over an existing retirement account?Yes you can! Any existing retirement accounts like 401(k) or IRAs can be rolled over to a SoFi Wealth retirement account. You’ll need to contact your existing broker to facilitate the money movement. Not sure where to get started? Our licensed financial advisors can help. Give us a call at 855-525-7634 or email at advisor@sofiwealth.com.What is a SEP IRA?A SEP IRA (Simplified Employee Pension) is a retirement plan that is popular with many small business owners and self-employed individuals because it’s low-cost, flexible, and offers huge potential tax savings. Contributions are made by you as the “employer.” They are tax-deductible from your business income and grow tax-deferred. Note that withdrawals in retirement are taxed as ordinary income and penalties for early withdrawals may apply.Who is eligible for a SEP IRA?Sole proprietors; partnerships; incorporated and unincorporated small businesses, including S and C corporations; and individuals with self-employment income, even if they are covered by their employer’s retirement plan (it’s possible to have both an active SEP IRA and 401(k)).How much can I contribute?Contributions an employer can make to an employee’s SEP-IRA cannot exceed the lesser of $54,000 or 25% of the employee’s compensation.

Member BenefitsWhat is the SoFi Member Rate Discount?Existing SoFi members can receive a 0.125% member interest rate discount on an additional SoFi lending product of a different type. For instance, if you refinance your student loans with SoFi and then you want to take out a personal loan with us, you will receive a 0.125% interest discount on your SoFi Personal Loan. If the interest rate on your personal loan would have been 8%, then you will receive a 7.875% interest rate—just for being an existing SoFi member.Who is eligible for the SoFi Member Rate Discount?When you have an existing loan with us (i.e. a SoFi Mortgage, Personal Loan, or Student Loan), you will receive a 0.125% interest rate discount on a subsequent loan of a different product type. SoFi Wealth members with no SoFi loan accounts will also receive the 0.125% member rate discount on a new loan if the member’s existing Wealth account meets minimum balance criteria described below at the time of origination of the new loan. SoFi Wealth members are eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount on a Mortgage Loan if they have and maintain a minimum balance of $50,000 in their SoFi Wealth account. SoFi Wealth members are eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount on a Personal and Student Loan if they have and maintain a minimum balance of $10,000 in their SoFi Wealth account. SoFi Insurance customers are not yet eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount.I used to have a SoFi loan but I paid it off. Am I still considered a member and will I still get the Member Rate Discount on a subsequent loan product?Yes! If you have already paid off your SoFi loan in full, you are still considered a SoFi member and are eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount on a new loan. Can I get the Member Rate Discount on the same type of loan product?The Member Rate Discount must be for a different type of loan, thus it does not apply if you take out another loan of the same type. For instance, if your first loan was a SoFi Personal Loan, you are not eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount on a second SoFi Personal Loan, but you are eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount on a Student Loan or a Mortgage. SoFi’s Student Loan products (ReFi, PLUS, and Parent In-School loans) are considered separate products. Therefore, a borrower who has previously refinanced their student loans with SoFi is eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount on a different student loan product, such as the Parent In-School loan.If I use the funds in my SoFi Wealth account toward my Mortgage transaction, will I still qualify for the Member Rate Discount on my SoFi Mortgage?Yes, as long as the balance remaining in your SoFi Wealth account still meets the minimum balance criteria of $50,000 after the Mortgage transaction.If I have a Wealth account that doesn’t meet the minimum balance required to get the Member Rate Discount, but I have a SoFi loan, can I get the Member Rate Discount on another loan that I take out with SoFi?Yes, so long as the second SoFi loan is a different type of loan. For instance, if your first loan was a SoFi Personal Loan, you are not eligible to receive the member rate discount on a second SoFi Personal Loan, but you are eligible to receive the member rate discount on a Student Loan or a Mortgage. SoFi’s Student Loan products (ReFi, PLUS, and Parent In-School loans) are considered separate products. Therefore, a borrower who has previously refinanced their student loans with SoFi is eligible to receive the member rate discount on a different student loan product, such as the Parent In-School loan.Can I get the Member Rate Discount on more than one SoFi loan?Yes; members will receive the 0.125% Member Rate Discount on each additional lending product, so long as it is a different type of loan. For instance, if your first loan was a SoFi Personal Loan, you are eligible to receive a 0.125% Member Rate Discount on a SoFi Mortgage, and then another 0.125% Member Rate Discount on a Student Loan ReFi.If I’m not in good standing on my SoFi loan, can I qualify for the Member Rate Discount on my next loan?Members must be in good standing (i.e. not delinquent or charged off) on their current and prior SoFi loan(s) to be eligible for the Member Rate Discount. Specifically, you must be in good standing on your prior SoFi loan(s); you must be current on your existing SoFi loan(s); you must never have been 60 or more days past due on a prior SoFi loan; you must never have been more than once 30 days past due more than once on a prior SoFi loan; and you must never have been in forbearance on a SoFi loan.Can I get the 0.125% Member Rate Discount in addition to the 0.25% AutoPay discount?Yes; you can receive the 0.125% Member Rate Discount in addition to your 0.25% AutoPay discount. Please note that SoFi does not offer an AutoPay discount for Mortgages.Can I get the 0.125% Member Rate Discount in addition to a rate discount offered by my employer or association?The Member Rate Discount cannot be combined with the rate discount offered through a corporate or association partnership channel. For instance, if your first product is a Personal Loan and then you refinance your student loans through a corporate or association partnership link that offers an interest rate discount, you will only receive the corporate or association discount. You will still be eligible to receive the Member Rate Discount if you receive a cash welcome bonus (e.g. for refinancing through your company or association, if applicable) on your loan instead of an corporate/association interest rate discount.How will I know that the Member Rate Discount is being applied to the rate quote in my application?Rate discounts are displayed in the application. You will see the rate discounts on the page where you select your product and interest rate. When does this offer start?SoFi started offering Member Rate Discounts on February 20, 2017.I funded my second loan with SoFi before the Member Rate Discount was announced. Will I get the rate discount retroactively, or does it only apply to new loans moving forward?The Member Rate Discount will apply automatically to new loans moving forward. The Member Rate Discount was activated on 2/20/2017, so if you funded your second (or third, etc.) SoFi loan before that date, you will not receive the Member Rate Discount retroactively on that loan. For any qualifying additional loan(s) that you fund on or after 2/27/2017, you will automatically receive the Member Rate Discount.When does this offer end? Is this a limited-time offer?Once you get a SoFi Member Rate Discount on a loan, you will have the Member Rate Discount for the life of that loan. SoFi reserves the right to change or terminate the Member Rate Discount offer at any time, which means that we can stop offering the Member Rate Discount on loans that have not yet originated; however, once you have the Member Rate Discount on a funded loan, you will not lose the Member Rate Discount, even if we ended the Member Rate Discount Program.Does the Member Rate Discount apply to both variable and fixed rate loans?The 0.125% Member Rate Discount applies to those choosing either a variable or fixed rate. Even as the variable rate changes, the 0.125% Member Rate Discount will continue to apply.If I get the SoFi Member Rate Discount on a 7/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgage (ARM), will the Member Rate Discount stay active throughout the life of my loan?No. 7/1 Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARM) loan products will receive the Member Rate Discount for the duration of the fixed period, i.e. 7 years only.Mobile AppsHow do I download the mobile apps?You can download our mobile apps for iOS and Android here:

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
