Rube Goldberg's product launch formula - Josh Earl


























































Josh EarlMake More Sales with Email Courses
You are here: Home / Marketing / Rube Goldberg’s product launch formulaRube Goldberg’s product launch formula
September 15, 2015 By Josh Leave a Comment Ever heard of Rube Goldberg?
Mr. Goldberg was an engineer and inventor, but what really made him famous is his cartoons.
He'd diagram out these outlandish machines that chained together water wheels and tiny steam locomotives and even the occasional octopus…
Just to accomplish some braindead simple task.
Like his “Simple Way to Uncork a Bottle,” which involved an elephant, a bag of peanuts, a monkey and a sleeping dog (just for starters).
You can see it here.
Hilarious stuff, if you've got a geeky engineering side like me.
And it reminds me of a marketing funnel I saw a few days ago…
This was for a product launch in the a dating niche. (I don't work in this niche at all, but this was one of the few non-sleazy products in that space.)
The launch was clearly a TON of work to put together. The product sells for $497, and typically the higher the price, the more copy you need to make the sale.
And oh man, did they ever have copy. Thousands and thousands of dollars' worth.
Huge long sales page. 10-20 emails for the in-house list, plus more for affiliates. Facebook ads. Landing pages. Webinar scripts.
It got to be so complex that the copywriter sat down and spent a few hours drawing the whole thing out in a workflow diagram. (Fills 3-4 pages of letter sized paper. Really well done, too. The programmer in me is proud…)
Here's the thing, though:
They're halfway through the launch now, and… it's failing.
They've made a few sales, but not nearly what they were expecting.
Ouch.
The copywriter was looking for some quick help to get his launch off life support.
He's in a tough spot.
The clock is ticking—he has 7 days to make this thing work.
No time to make drastic changes to the complex machinery that they've built.
I suggested making some quick tweaks to the offer—like announcing some surprise bonuses. And definitely talking to people who had seen the offer and decided to pass. Maybe they can sweeten the deal and salvage the launch.
That's just a bandaid at best, though.
From what I can see, the real problem here is that the marketer got caught up in the MACHINERY for the launch…
And now he has this huge contraption with 93 moving parts, and it's pretty difficult to tell what the weak links are.
That's why it's smart to build your funnel one piece at a time.
Starting with the basics:
A source of traffic. A way to capture email addresses. A sales page that makes a clear offer. And an email sequence that sends people back to that sales page over and over.
Yes, complex funnels are often necessary.
By starting simple, though, you can see whether the extra complexity actually helps you…
Or whether you're just enlisting an entire zoo to help you pop open a bottle of champaign.

Tilting Back The Light • Acrylic on Canvas • 72″x84″ • 2012
 In preparation
 is the setting forth
 the leaving behind
 the teacher
 the teaching
 the explanations
 the expectations
 the preconceptions
 the narrow field of my vision
 No longer are memories
 words or images
 to mean what they used to mean
 If I think I know what I will find
 I will find nothing
 If I expect nothing
 I will always be surprised
 This is the painter’s path of liberation

Abstract Art
My philosophy of painting – “the Painter’s Path” – is about process rather than product (i.e. painting as a “finished object”). Process painting directs one’s unplanned actions totally toward the flow of the work leaving the painter in a state of “unknowing” and surprise. Process painting is spontaneous and grown rather than constructed. Its resolution is an undeniable Presence which confronts us waiting and enduring, self-existing and self-sufficient. However, one has to be willing to shipwreck the work, to explode it, in order for the work to become what it is, to reveal nothing outside itself.
What I look for in this “no-method method” process: contradictions in composition where there are multiple spaces each with its own focal point and perspective, paradoxes in brushwork close to Daoist and Zen actions that seem in opposition as loaded gestural sweeps approach finely polished areas, a variety of strong contrasts of darks and lights, simple and complex shapes, paintings within paintings.
As a contemporary abstract painter I work with forms in space. The kind of forms and their placement creates the tension and energy between them, holding together the structural balance of the visual surface. Color flattens, gives the illusion of depth, dissolves, or unifies. These elements – space, form, pattern, atmosphere, color and brushwork, the carefully rendered and the explosive – are pulled from the outer limits of the canvas or paper into a nucleus, forever floating and interacting. Whether using acrylics or charcoal, charcoal combined with ink, chalk, or other mediums the subject is the paint or charcoal itself.
My paintings are abstract visions of imaginary places. In highly structured compositions and loose and sumptuous paint, they veer from the monumental to the microscopic, conjure soaring mountains or placid pools of water. But these paintings “are less about a real place than they are about our ideas of nature, the way the landscape looks inside our heads, long after we’ve left it behind and returned to the city”. The hand is evident throughout the canvas: in the scraped surface revealing what lies underneath, in the horizontal drips of wet paint, and in the pooling of color on the surface. It is in the fragmented asymmetry and in the quickening of the calligraphic brush that the scene is endowed with an “Asian sense of the sacred.”
