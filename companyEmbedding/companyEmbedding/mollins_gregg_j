Reliance Steel (RS  -  Free Report)	 said that Gregg J. Mollins has been appointed as its CEO and President, effective as of May 20. He will replace David H. Hannah who has been transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman.Mollins, who joined Reliance Steel as a Division Manager back in 1986 and served on the company’s broad since 1997, possesses more than 37 years of experience in the metals industry. He was appointed as the company’s Vice President in 1992 and was also named Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in 1994.  Mollins was promoted to the role of Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in 1995. His responsibilities were further enhanced in 2002 as he was named Reliance Steel’s President and Chief Operating Officer.  Hannah, who served as Reliance Steel’s CEO since 1999, will remain on its board of directors as Executive Chairman till his retirement in July next year. He will remain active in the company’s operations until his exit. The company will appoint an independent, non-executive Chairman of the board at the time of Hannah's retirement.Reliance Steel also announced the results of its annual meeting of shareholders, which were in sync with the recommendations of the company's board as set forth in the proxy statement. Shareholders, at the annual meeting, approved a number of proposals including the re-election of all of Reliance Steel’s directors for one year and the proposal to reincorporate the company in Delaware.Reliance Steel’s revenues and earnings for the first quarter of 2015, reported on Apr 23, topped Zacks Consensus Estimates, aided by its cost-control actions and higher sales volumes. The company, however, sees continued pricing pressure in 2015 due to high levels of metal imports.While Reliance Steel continues to be challenged by weak steel industry fundamentals and weak pricing, it is well placed to leverage the strong momentum across a number of end markets, including aerospace. The company should also gain from its broad and diversified product base, wide geographic footprint and aggressive acquisition strategy.Reliance Steel is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other steel and metals companies having favorable Zacks Rank are Olympic Steel Inc. (ZEUS  -  Free Report)	, Global Brass and Copper Holdings, Inc. (BRSS  -  Free Report)	 and Norsk Hydro ASA (NHYDY  -  Free Report)	. While Olympic Steel carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Global Brass and Copper Holdings and Norsk Hydro hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

History[edit]
Reliance Steel & Aluminum Company was founded in Los Angeles on February 3, 1939 by Thomas J. Neilan. Originally named Reliance Steel Products Company, the business made and sold steel reinforcing bars (rebar) for the construction industry. In 1944, the name was shortened to Reliance Steel Company.[4]
In 1948, Reliance Steel also began manufacturing products of aluminum and magnesium. As William T. Gimbel, Neilan's nephew who joined the company as a trainee in 1947, later told Metal Service News, "We started out (in 1939) with the dirty, old, down-in-the-gutter carbon steel, but that became a world commodity. So we decided that we wanted to upgrade into something that had a little bit more pizzazz, and we picked aluminum and magnesium."
Gimbel, who started as a warehouse man, succeeded Neilan in 1957 as president of the company, a year after its name was changed to Reliance Steel & Aluminum Company. Under Gimbel, Reliance began its long-running territorial expansion, naming a resident sales agent in Phoenix in 1958. Two years later, Reliance acquired a small Phoenix-based competitor, the Effron Steel Company. With the purchase of another competitor, the Westates Steel Company, in Santa Clara, Reliance Steel expanded into Northern California in 1961.
In 1963, Reliance continued its growth through acquisition by purchasing the Drake Steel Supply Company, which operated metals service centers in Fresno and San Diego, California. With the purchase, Reliance also acquired the services of Joe D. Crider, who had joined Drake in 1949 as a billing clerk and worked his way up to Fresno sales manager. After several years as manager of Reliance Steel's Los Angeles division, Crider was named executive vice-president in 1975, teaming up with Gimbel to form what Metal Service News would later call "perhaps the best known management team in the service center industry."
In 1966, Reliance extended its reach into Texas by acquiring metals service centers in Dallas and San Antonio from Delta Metals, Inc. Two years later, the company bought out another Los Angeles competitor, the Catalina Steel Company, its fifth acquisition in ten years. By then, Reliance Steel had also established SupraCote, a coil-coating division, in Cucamonga, California. It became a separate subsidiary in 1973, and was sold to a management group in 1980.
Reliance Steel acquired Southern Equipment & Supply Company, San Diego's oldest metals service center, in 1972, and immediately launched a $1.8 million project to double the size of the San Diego facility. Two years later, the rapidly growing company announced a $4 million expansion in Los Angeles.
Reliance Steel also wanted to strengthen its position in Texas, and, after attempting to acquire a Houston business, temporarily abandoned its acquisition philosophy and opened a new metals service center in Houston in 1975. Gimbel told Metal Service News, "We had spent probably two years trying to buy out somebody, but at the time there was a big boom there, and everyone felt the streets of Houston were paved with gold. We just could never make a deal to buy someone. So we started our own company." Reliance closed the Houston center in 1984 due to a slump in the oil industry.
In 1980, SupraCote coil-coating subsidiary is sold to management.
Reliance ventured into the eastern part of the United States for the first time in 1975 when it acquired the Purchased Steel Products Company, in Atlanta. The move never panned out, however, and Reliance sold the center in 1987. Gimbel told Metal Center News, "We learned a lesson in Atlanta. If we're going to go further east, that probably means the Chicago area. And you don't move into Chicago on a shoestring."
After more than three decades of operating full-service metals service centers, Reliance opened its first "specialty store" in 1976, forming the Tube Service Company, in Santa Fe Springs, California. The subsidiary specialized in tubular products. A second Tube Service opened three years later in Milpitas, California. In 1977, Reliance also acquired Bralco Metals, in Pico Rivera, California, which specialized in brass, aluminum, and copper. To manage its aluminum, magnesium, and stainless steel products, Reliance created a nonferrous metals division, Reliance Metalcenter, in 1980.
In 1994, after 55 years as a closely held operation, Reliance issued its first public stock. At the time, the company had about 180 stockholders, most of them employees or relatives of founder Thomas J. Neilan. Reliance had previously considered, and rejected, going public several times. In 1984, Gimbel told Metal Service News, "We'd go and talk to the brokers, but, unfortunately, anything with the name steel in it didn't get them very excited." In its prospectus, Reliance also signaled its intention to continue growth through acquisitions, stating, "Traditionally, metals service centers have been small, family-owned businesses that lack the diversity of experience and successful operating techniques of Reliance and thus have and may in the future become candidates for acquisition or consolidation.
Crider, who became chairman in early 1997, succeeding Gimbel, who remained on the board of directors as chairman emeritus, said in interviews that he expected Reliance Steel to continue growing through acquisitions. Industry analysts expected Reliance to focus its expansion on the strengthening Midwest market.
A secondary public offering in November 1997 raised $94 million to fuel further acquisitions. A $150 million private placement followed a year later.
Company president David Hannah succeeded Joe D. Crider as CEO in February 1999. Crider remained chairman. Chairman emeritus William T. Gimbel had died in December 1998.
The company's Valex unit dominated the U.S. market for electropolished stainless steel tubing and fittings used to build semiconductor plants. Expanding overseas, in 1999 Valex opened a distribution center in France and formed a manufacturing joint venture in Korea. Valex shut down its Phoenix distribution site in 2003.
RSAC Management Corp. was formed as a holding company in 1999. The corporation also performed administrative and management tasks for the metals service centers. Reliance ended the decade with sales of nearly $1.6 billion a year.
The U.S. government imposed tariffs on imported steel in early 2002. This made the price of hot-rolled carbon steel rise and Reliance's shares fall, observed the Los Angeles Business Journal. The tariffs were lifted in December 2003 after complaints by U.S. automakers.
Subsidiary AMI Metals, Inc. opened a European business in January 2003. Based in Gosselies, Belgium, AMI Metals Europe, SPRL focused on the aerospace industry. AMI closed its Atlanta area facility during the year while opening a new on in St. Louis.
Acquisitions history[edit]
Reliance grew from a single metals-processing center in Los Angeles into a major corporation by acquiring dozens of competitors. In an interview with an industry publication in 1992, Joe D. Crider, then president and chief operating officer, explained, "You can pay the bill [for higher market share] through price cutting, or through paying goodwill to buy a competitor. In cutting prices, you often trash the marketplace. So over time, the latter route is usually the less expensive, as long as you buy at a reasonable price."
In 1960, Effron Steel is acquired. In 1961, Northern California's Westates Steel is acquired. In 1963, Drake Steel Supply is acquired. In 1966, Texas metals service centers are bought from Delta Metals, Inc. In 1968, Catalina Steel is acquired. In 1972, Southern Equipment & Supply metals service center is acquired and expanded. In 1977, Bralco Metals is acquired.
In 1980, Reliance also acquired Foucar, Ray & Simon, a specialty tube distributor in Hayward, California, with a branch in Portland, Oregon. The Hayward center was eventually merged into the Reliance center in Santa Clara. The Portland operation foundered and then closed in 1984. Gimbel told Metal Service News the acquisition had been a mistake. "Foucar was probably the second oldest service center in California, with a good reputation. They'd done well over the years, but I guess they'd gotten rigor mortis. We thought that we could change all that. We tried and tried to change it, and it didn't work. So we had to admit defeat and close up the place."
In 1981, Reliance purchased the Cd'A Service Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, from Spokane-based Cd'A Steel Service Center. The company then acquired Circle Metals in Carson, California, in 1983, and Tricon Steel & Aluminum in Fremont, California, and Arnold Engineering in Fullerton, California, in 1984. Arnold Engineering was renamed Arnold Technologies, Inc. and relocated to Anaheim.
In 1985, Reliance acquired Ducommum Metals in Phoenix and Los Angeles, the Lafayette Metal Service Corp. in Long Beach, California, and the assets of the Livermore, California, metals service center from Capitol Metals Company.
The company also acquired the Valex Corporation in Ventura, California, which made stainless steel components for electronic and pharmaceutical applications, the Dallas/Fort Worth Russell Steel Division of the Van Pelt Corp., and the Morris Steel & Aluminum Company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1988, Reliance also acquired the Los Angeles Sheet & Steel Division from Earle M. Jorgensen Company.
Over the next two years, it acquired the assets of Albuquerque, New Mexico-based Smith Pipe & Steel and the Los Angeles and Phoenix operations of Lusk Metals.
Other acquisitions in the 1990s included Affiliated Metals, an aluminum and stainless steel specialty center in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Wichita, Kansas, operations of National Steel Service Center Inc., which stocked aluminum plate, sheet, and coil for the aerospace industry. The National Steel acquisition marked Reliance Steel's first foray into the Midwest.
In 1995, Reliance acquired a 50% interest in American Steel, L.L.C. for $19 million. (This shareholding was raised to 50.5 percent in May 2002).
In 1996, the company acquired VMI Corporation, an 11-year-old nonferrous metals service center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and CCC Steel, Inc., which operated carbon-steel service centers in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.
Reliance also announced the acquisition of the Siskin Steel & Supply Company, Inc., with metals service centers in Chattanooga and Nashville, Tennessee; Spartanburg, South Carolina; and Birmingham, Alabama. Reliance Steel paid $71 million for the company, which had revenues of $151 million and would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.
In 1997, the company acquired Amalco Metals, Inc., a metals service center company in Union City, California, that specialized in processing and distributing aluminum plate and sheet, and AMI Metals, Inc., a Brentwood, Tennessee, company that specialized in processing and distributing aluminum plate, sheet, and bar products for the aerospace industry. AMI operated service centers in Fontana, California; Wichita, Kansas; Brentwood, Tennessee; Fort Worth, Texas; Kent, Washington; and Swedesboro, New Jersey.
Reliance acquired Service Steel Aerospace Corp. of Tacoma, Washington, in October 1997.
Reliance bought Phoenix Metals of Atlanta for $21 million in January 1998. It had sales of $120 million a year.
The company acquired a smaller Atlanta company, Georgia Steel Supply, around the same time. Georgia supply had revenues of $22 million a year.
Other 1998 acquisitions included Baltimore's Durrett Sheppard Steel Company (with annual sales of $47 million), Chatham Steel Corporation, Lusk Metals, Engbar Pipe & Steel Company, and Steel Bar Corporation.
Reliance also reached an agreement to buy 50% of American Metals Corporation of West Sacramento, California, which was formerly part of the American Steel joint venture with Portland-based American Industries.
Liebovich Bros. Inc., a Rockford, Illinois, supplier of carbon steel products, was acquired in March 1999. It had sales of $130 million. Other 1999 acquisitions included Allegheny Steel Distributors Inc., Dallas-area aluminum distributor Arrow Metals, and Hagerty Steel of Illinois. Pennsylvania's Toma Metals Inc., a small specialty stainless supplier, was added in 2000.
Reliance bought United Alloys Inc.'s aerospace division in August 2000. Founded in 1971, it had sales of $18 million a year. The acquisition added titanium products to Reliance's lineup.
Viking Materials Inc., a Minneapolis-based processor and distributor of flat-rolled carbon steel products, was bought in early 2001. Viking had been formed in 1973 and had 1999 revenues of $83 million as well as 155 employees and facilities in Illinois and Iowa.
Reliance was also adding to its operations in the South. East Tennessee Steel Supply Inc. was added to Reliance's Chattanooga-based Siskin Steel unit in early 2001. It had revenues of $6.6 million in its 2000 fiscal year.
Pitt Des Moines Inc. (PDM) was purchased for $97.5 million in the summer of 2001. Pitt had sales of $260 million a year at seven locations, most in the West.
Reliance acquired assets of Central Plains Steel Company in April 2002. Based in Kansas, the business had net sales of about $27 million in 2003. Denver metals service center Olympic Metals, Inc. was acquired at the same time. Olympic specialized in aluminum, copper, brass, and stainless steel and had sales of $7 million in 2003.
Certain assets of a unit of bankrupt Metals USA, Inc. were purchased in September 2002 for $30 million. The unit subsequently began operating under its original name, Pacific Metal Company. Its sales were $70 million in 2003.

History[edit]
Reliance Steel & Aluminum Company was founded in Los Angeles on February 3, 1939 by Thomas J. Neilan. Originally named Reliance Steel Products Company, the business made and sold steel reinforcing bars (rebar) for the construction industry. In 1944, the name was shortened to Reliance Steel Company.[4]
In 1948, Reliance Steel also began manufacturing products of aluminum and magnesium. As William T. Gimbel, Neilan's nephew who joined the company as a trainee in 1947, later told Metal Service News, "We started out (in 1939) with the dirty, old, down-in-the-gutter carbon steel, but that became a world commodity. So we decided that we wanted to upgrade into something that had a little bit more pizzazz, and we picked aluminum and magnesium."
Gimbel, who started as a warehouse man, succeeded Neilan in 1957 as president of the company, a year after its name was changed to Reliance Steel & Aluminum Company. Under Gimbel, Reliance began its long-running territorial expansion, naming a resident sales agent in Phoenix in 1958. Two years later, Reliance acquired a small Phoenix-based competitor, the Effron Steel Company. With the purchase of another competitor, the Westates Steel Company, in Santa Clara, Reliance Steel expanded into Northern California in 1961.
In 1963, Reliance continued its growth through acquisition by purchasing the Drake Steel Supply Company, which operated metals service centers in Fresno and San Diego, California. With the purchase, Reliance also acquired the services of Joe D. Crider, who had joined Drake in 1949 as a billing clerk and worked his way up to Fresno sales manager. After several years as manager of Reliance Steel's Los Angeles division, Crider was named executive vice-president in 1975, teaming up with Gimbel to form what Metal Service News would later call "perhaps the best known management team in the service center industry."
In 1966, Reliance extended its reach into Texas by acquiring metals service centers in Dallas and San Antonio from Delta Metals, Inc. Two years later, the company bought out another Los Angeles competitor, the Catalina Steel Company, its fifth acquisition in ten years. By then, Reliance Steel had also established SupraCote, a coil-coating division, in Cucamonga, California. It became a separate subsidiary in 1973, and was sold to a management group in 1980.
Reliance Steel acquired Southern Equipment & Supply Company, San Diego's oldest metals service center, in 1972, and immediately launched a $1.8 million project to double the size of the San Diego facility. Two years later, the rapidly growing company announced a $4 million expansion in Los Angeles.
Reliance Steel also wanted to strengthen its position in Texas, and, after attempting to acquire a Houston business, temporarily abandoned its acquisition philosophy and opened a new metals service center in Houston in 1975. Gimbel told Metal Service News, "We had spent probably two years trying to buy out somebody, but at the time there was a big boom there, and everyone felt the streets of Houston were paved with gold. We just could never make a deal to buy someone. So we started our own company." Reliance closed the Houston center in 1984 due to a slump in the oil industry.
In 1980, SupraCote coil-coating subsidiary is sold to management.
Reliance ventured into the eastern part of the United States for the first time in 1975 when it acquired the Purchased Steel Products Company, in Atlanta. The move never panned out, however, and Reliance sold the center in 1987. Gimbel told Metal Center News, "We learned a lesson in Atlanta. If we're going to go further east, that probably means the Chicago area. And you don't move into Chicago on a shoestring."
After more than three decades of operating full-service metals service centers, Reliance opened its first "specialty store" in 1976, forming the Tube Service Company, in Santa Fe Springs, California. The subsidiary specialized in tubular products. A second Tube Service opened three years later in Milpitas, California. In 1977, Reliance also acquired Bralco Metals, in Pico Rivera, California, which specialized in brass, aluminum, and copper. To manage its aluminum, magnesium, and stainless steel products, Reliance created a nonferrous metals division, Reliance Metalcenter, in 1980.
In 1994, after 55 years as a closely held operation, Reliance issued its first public stock. At the time, the company had about 180 stockholders, most of them employees or relatives of founder Thomas J. Neilan. Reliance had previously considered, and rejected, going public several times. In 1984, Gimbel told Metal Service News, "We'd go and talk to the brokers, but, unfortunately, anything with the name steel in it didn't get them very excited." In its prospectus, Reliance also signaled its intention to continue growth through acquisitions, stating, "Traditionally, metals service centers have been small, family-owned businesses that lack the diversity of experience and successful operating techniques of Reliance and thus have and may in the future become candidates for acquisition or consolidation.
Crider, who became chairman in early 1997, succeeding Gimbel, who remained on the board of directors as chairman emeritus, said in interviews that he expected Reliance Steel to continue growing through acquisitions. Industry analysts expected Reliance to focus its expansion on the strengthening Midwest market.
A secondary public offering in November 1997 raised $94 million to fuel further acquisitions. A $150 million private placement followed a year later.
Company president David Hannah succeeded Joe D. Crider as CEO in February 1999. Crider remained chairman. Chairman emeritus William T. Gimbel had died in December 1998.
The company's Valex unit dominated the U.S. market for electropolished stainless steel tubing and fittings used to build semiconductor plants. Expanding overseas, in 1999 Valex opened a distribution center in France and formed a manufacturing joint venture in Korea. Valex shut down its Phoenix distribution site in 2003.
RSAC Management Corp. was formed as a holding company in 1999. The corporation also performed administrative and management tasks for the metals service centers. Reliance ended the decade with sales of nearly $1.6 billion a year.
The U.S. government imposed tariffs on imported steel in early 2002. This made the price of hot-rolled carbon steel rise and Reliance's shares fall, observed the Los Angeles Business Journal. The tariffs were lifted in December 2003 after complaints by U.S. automakers.
Subsidiary AMI Metals, Inc. opened a European business in January 2003. Based in Gosselies, Belgium, AMI Metals Europe, SPRL focused on the aerospace industry. AMI closed its Atlanta area facility during the year while opening a new on in St. Louis.
Acquisitions history[edit]
Reliance grew from a single metals-processing center in Los Angeles into a major corporation by acquiring dozens of competitors. In an interview with an industry publication in 1992, Joe D. Crider, then president and chief operating officer, explained, "You can pay the bill [for higher market share] through price cutting, or through paying goodwill to buy a competitor. In cutting prices, you often trash the marketplace. So over time, the latter route is usually the less expensive, as long as you buy at a reasonable price."
In 1960, Effron Steel is acquired. In 1961, Northern California's Westates Steel is acquired. In 1963, Drake Steel Supply is acquired. In 1966, Texas metals service centers are bought from Delta Metals, Inc. In 1968, Catalina Steel is acquired. In 1972, Southern Equipment & Supply metals service center is acquired and expanded. In 1977, Bralco Metals is acquired.
In 1980, Reliance also acquired Foucar, Ray & Simon, a specialty tube distributor in Hayward, California, with a branch in Portland, Oregon. The Hayward center was eventually merged into the Reliance center in Santa Clara. The Portland operation foundered and then closed in 1984. Gimbel told Metal Service News the acquisition had been a mistake. "Foucar was probably the second oldest service center in California, with a good reputation. They'd done well over the years, but I guess they'd gotten rigor mortis. We thought that we could change all that. We tried and tried to change it, and it didn't work. So we had to admit defeat and close up the place."
In 1981, Reliance purchased the Cd'A Service Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, from Spokane-based Cd'A Steel Service Center. The company then acquired Circle Metals in Carson, California, in 1983, and Tricon Steel & Aluminum in Fremont, California, and Arnold Engineering in Fullerton, California, in 1984. Arnold Engineering was renamed Arnold Technologies, Inc. and relocated to Anaheim.
In 1985, Reliance acquired Ducommum Metals in Phoenix and Los Angeles, the Lafayette Metal Service Corp. in Long Beach, California, and the assets of the Livermore, California, metals service center from Capitol Metals Company.
The company also acquired the Valex Corporation in Ventura, California, which made stainless steel components for electronic and pharmaceutical applications, the Dallas/Fort Worth Russell Steel Division of the Van Pelt Corp., and the Morris Steel & Aluminum Company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1988, Reliance also acquired the Los Angeles Sheet & Steel Division from Earle M. Jorgensen Company.
Over the next two years, it acquired the assets of Albuquerque, New Mexico-based Smith Pipe & Steel and the Los Angeles and Phoenix operations of Lusk Metals.
Other acquisitions in the 1990s included Affiliated Metals, an aluminum and stainless steel specialty center in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Wichita, Kansas, operations of National Steel Service Center Inc., which stocked aluminum plate, sheet, and coil for the aerospace industry. The National Steel acquisition marked Reliance Steel's first foray into the Midwest.
In 1995, Reliance acquired a 50% interest in American Steel, L.L.C. for $19 million. (This shareholding was raised to 50.5 percent in May 2002).
In 1996, the company acquired VMI Corporation, an 11-year-old nonferrous metals service center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and CCC Steel, Inc., which operated carbon-steel service centers in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.
Reliance also announced the acquisition of the Siskin Steel & Supply Company, Inc., with metals service centers in Chattanooga and Nashville, Tennessee; Spartanburg, South Carolina; and Birmingham, Alabama. Reliance Steel paid $71 million for the company, which had revenues of $151 million and would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.
In 1997, the company acquired Amalco Metals, Inc., a metals service center company in Union City, California, that specialized in processing and distributing aluminum plate and sheet, and AMI Metals, Inc., a Brentwood, Tennessee, company that specialized in processing and distributing aluminum plate, sheet, and bar products for the aerospace industry. AMI operated service centers in Fontana, California; Wichita, Kansas; Brentwood, Tennessee; Fort Worth, Texas; Kent, Washington; and Swedesboro, New Jersey.
Reliance acquired Service Steel Aerospace Corp. of Tacoma, Washington, in October 1997.
Reliance bought Phoenix Metals of Atlanta for $21 million in January 1998. It had sales of $120 million a year.
The company acquired a smaller Atlanta company, Georgia Steel Supply, around the same time. Georgia supply had revenues of $22 million a year.
Other 1998 acquisitions included Baltimore's Durrett Sheppard Steel Company (with annual sales of $47 million), Chatham Steel Corporation, Lusk Metals, Engbar Pipe & Steel Company, and Steel Bar Corporation.
Reliance also reached an agreement to buy 50% of American Metals Corporation of West Sacramento, California, which was formerly part of the American Steel joint venture with Portland-based American Industries.
Liebovich Bros. Inc., a Rockford, Illinois, supplier of carbon steel products, was acquired in March 1999. It had sales of $130 million. Other 1999 acquisitions included Allegheny Steel Distributors Inc., Dallas-area aluminum distributor Arrow Metals, and Hagerty Steel of Illinois. Pennsylvania's Toma Metals Inc., a small specialty stainless supplier, was added in 2000.
Reliance bought United Alloys Inc.'s aerospace division in August 2000. Founded in 1971, it had sales of $18 million a year. The acquisition added titanium products to Reliance's lineup.
Viking Materials Inc., a Minneapolis-based processor and distributor of flat-rolled carbon steel products, was bought in early 2001. Viking had been formed in 1973 and had 1999 revenues of $83 million as well as 155 employees and facilities in Illinois and Iowa.
Reliance was also adding to its operations in the South. East Tennessee Steel Supply Inc. was added to Reliance's Chattanooga-based Siskin Steel unit in early 2001. It had revenues of $6.6 million in its 2000 fiscal year.
Pitt Des Moines Inc. (PDM) was purchased for $97.5 million in the summer of 2001. Pitt had sales of $260 million a year at seven locations, most in the West.
Reliance acquired assets of Central Plains Steel Company in April 2002. Based in Kansas, the business had net sales of about $27 million in 2003. Denver metals service center Olympic Metals, Inc. was acquired at the same time. Olympic specialized in aluminum, copper, brass, and stainless steel and had sales of $7 million in 2003.
Certain assets of a unit of bankrupt Metals USA, Inc. were purchased in September 2002 for $30 million. The unit subsequently began operating under its original name, Pacific Metal Company. Its sales were $70 million in 2003.

The U.S. government imposed tariffs on imported steel in early 2002. This made the price of hot-rolled carbon steel rise and Reliance's shares fall, observed the Los Angeles Business Journal. The tariffs were lifted in December 2003 after complaints by U.S. automakers.
Subsidiary AMI Metals, Inc. opened a European business in January 2003. Based in Gosselies, Belgium, AMI Metals Europe, SPRL focused on the aerospace industry. AMI closed its Atlanta area facility during the year while opening a new on in St. Louis.
Acquisitions history[edit]
Reliance grew from a single metals-processing center in Los Angeles into a major corporation by acquiring dozens of competitors. In an interview with an industry publication in 1992, Joe D. Crider, then president and chief operating officer, explained, "You can pay the bill [for higher market share] through price cutting, or through paying goodwill to buy a competitor. In cutting prices, you often trash the marketplace. So over time, the latter route is usually the less expensive, as long as you buy at a reasonable price."
In 1960, Effron Steel is acquired. In 1961, Northern California's Westates Steel is acquired. In 1963, Drake Steel Supply is acquired. In 1966, Texas metals service centers are bought from Delta Metals, Inc. In 1968, Catalina Steel is acquired. In 1972, Southern Equipment & Supply metals service center is acquired and expanded. In 1977, Bralco Metals is acquired.
In 1980, Reliance also acquired Foucar, Ray & Simon, a specialty tube distributor in Hayward, California, with a branch in Portland, Oregon. The Hayward center was eventually merged into the Reliance center in Santa Clara. The Portland operation foundered and then closed in 1984. Gimbel told Metal Service News the acquisition had been a mistake. "Foucar was probably the second oldest service center in California, with a good reputation. They'd done well over the years, but I guess they'd gotten rigor mortis. We thought that we could change all that. We tried and tried to change it, and it didn't work. So we had to admit defeat and close up the place."
In 1981, Reliance purchased the Cd'A Service Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, from Spokane-based Cd'A Steel Service Center. The company then acquired Circle Metals in Carson, California, in 1983, and Tricon Steel & Aluminum in Fremont, California, and Arnold Engineering in Fullerton, California, in 1984. Arnold Engineering was renamed Arnold Technologies, Inc. and relocated to Anaheim.
In 1985, Reliance acquired Ducommum Metals in Phoenix and Los Angeles, the Lafayette Metal Service Corp. in Long Beach, California, and the assets of the Livermore, California, metals service center from Capitol Metals Company.
The company also acquired the Valex Corporation in Ventura, California, which made stainless steel components for electronic and pharmaceutical applications, the Dallas/Fort Worth Russell Steel Division of the Van Pelt Corp., and the Morris Steel & Aluminum Company in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1988, Reliance also acquired the Los Angeles Sheet & Steel Division from Earle M. Jorgensen Company.
Over the next two years, it acquired the assets of Albuquerque, New Mexico-based Smith Pipe & Steel and the Los Angeles and Phoenix operations of Lusk Metals.
Other acquisitions in the 1990s included Affiliated Metals, an aluminum and stainless steel specialty center in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the Wichita, Kansas, operations of National Steel Service Center Inc., which stocked aluminum plate, sheet, and coil for the aerospace industry. The National Steel acquisition marked Reliance Steel's first foray into the Midwest.
In 1995, Reliance acquired a 50% interest in American Steel, L.L.C. for $19 million. (This shareholding was raised to 50.5 percent in May 2002).
In 1996, the company acquired VMI Corporation, an 11-year-old nonferrous metals service center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and CCC Steel, Inc., which operated carbon-steel service centers in Los Angeles and Salt Lake City.
Reliance also announced the acquisition of the Siskin Steel & Supply Company, Inc., with metals service centers in Chattanooga and Nashville, Tennessee; Spartanburg, South Carolina; and Birmingham, Alabama. Reliance Steel paid $71 million for the company, which had revenues of $151 million and would operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.
In 1997, the company acquired Amalco Metals, Inc., a metals service center company in Union City, California, that specialized in processing and distributing aluminum plate and sheet, and AMI Metals, Inc., a Brentwood, Tennessee, company that specialized in processing and distributing aluminum plate, sheet, and bar products for the aerospace industry. AMI operated service centers in Fontana, California; Wichita, Kansas; Brentwood, Tennessee; Fort Worth, Texas; Kent, Washington; and Swedesboro, New Jersey.
Reliance acquired Service Steel Aerospace Corp. of Tacoma, Washington, in October 1997.
Reliance bought Phoenix Metals of Atlanta for $21 million in January 1998. It had sales of $120 million a year.
The company acquired a smaller Atlanta company, Georgia Steel Supply, around the same time. Georgia supply had revenues of $22 million a year.
Other 1998 acquisitions included Baltimore's Durrett Sheppard Steel Company (with annual sales of $47 million), Chatham Steel Corporation, Lusk Metals, Engbar Pipe & Steel Company, and Steel Bar Corporation.
Reliance also reached an agreement to buy 50% of American Metals Corporation of West Sacramento, California, which was formerly part of the American Steel joint venture with Portland-based American Industries.
Liebovich Bros. Inc., a Rockford, Illinois, supplier of carbon steel products, was acquired in March 1999. It had sales of $130 million. Other 1999 acquisitions included Allegheny Steel Distributors Inc., Dallas-area aluminum distributor Arrow Metals, and Hagerty Steel of Illinois. Pennsylvania's Toma Metals Inc., a small specialty stainless supplier, was added in 2000.
Reliance bought United Alloys Inc.'s aerospace division in August 2000. Founded in 1971, it had sales of $18 million a year. The acquisition added titanium products to Reliance's lineup.
Viking Materials Inc., a Minneapolis-based processor and distributor of flat-rolled carbon steel products, was bought in early 2001. Viking had been formed in 1973 and had 1999 revenues of $83 million as well as 155 employees and facilities in Illinois and Iowa.
Reliance was also adding to its operations in the South. East Tennessee Steel Supply Inc. was added to Reliance's Chattanooga-based Siskin Steel unit in early 2001. It had revenues of $6.6 million in its 2000 fiscal year.
Pitt Des Moines Inc. (PDM) was purchased for $97.5 million in the summer of 2001. Pitt had sales of $260 million a year at seven locations, most in the West.
Reliance acquired assets of Central Plains Steel Company in April 2002. Based in Kansas, the business had net sales of about $27 million in 2003. Denver metals service center Olympic Metals, Inc. was acquired at the same time. Olympic specialized in aluminum, copper, brass, and stainless steel and had sales of $7 million in 2003.
Certain assets of a unit of bankrupt Metals USA, Inc. were purchased in September 2002 for $30 million. The unit subsequently began operating under its original name, Pacific Metal Company. Its sales were $70 million in 2003.

LOS ANGELES, March 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (NYSE:   RS) announced today that the Company's Board of Directors has approved an executive leadership succession plan consistent with the Company's growth strategy and focus on operational execution.

Hannah, who has served as Reliance's Chief Executive Officer since 1999 and Chairman of the Board and CEO since 2007, has announced his intention to transition from his role as CEO effective May 20, 2015 following Reliance's Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Gregg J. Mollins, who currently serves as President and Chief Operating Officer of Reliance, will succeed Mr. Hannah as President and CEO at that time. Mr. Hannah will remain on the Company's Board of Directors as Executive Chairman until July 2016 and will remain involved in the Company's daily operations until his departure, at which time an independent, non-executive Chairman of the Board will be appointed.  
With more than 37 years of experience in the metals industry, Mr. Mollins, age 60, joined Reliance as a Division Manager in 1986. He was appointed Vice President in 1992 and named Vice President and Chief Operating Officer in 1994. The following year, he was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. In 2002, Mr. Mollins' responsibilities were expanded even further and he was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. Mr. Mollins has also served on the Company's Board of Directors since 1997.  
"I congratulate Gregg on his well-deserved appointment as Reliance's Chief Executive Officer," said Mr. Hannah. "Since joining Reliance in 1986, Gregg has held various positions of increasing responsibility and demonstrated business savvy and excellent judgment and leadership in each role. His unique abilities and talents have earned him the respect of our customers, suppliers, shareholders and employees alike. Today's announcement is the culmination of a deliberate succession planning process developed in conjunction with our Board and I am extremely confident that Gregg is the right person to lead Reliance going forward. I am pleased to pass the CEO title to him and look forward to maintaining an active role as Executive Chairman of the Board."  
Mr. Mollins commented, "I am honored by the opportunity to serve as Reliance's next CEO and to continue our track record of success as the premier metals service center company in North America. I look forward to continuing to work with our incredibly talented team at Reliance to build upon our accomplishments and help the Company execute our strategy and deliver more industry leading results."
Reliance also announced several other promotions in connection with its management succession plan, each to take effect concurrently with Mr. Mollins' promotion on May 20, 2015:  

Karla R. Lewis, Reliance's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since 2002, will be promoted to Senior Executive Vice President and CFO and will continue to lead the Company's overall financial operations. Ms. Lewis, who has been with Reliance since 1992, oversees Reliance's accounting, financial planning, capital allocation and investor relations activities. 
William K. Sales, Jr. will be promoted to the office of Executive Vice President, Operations.  Mr. Sales has served as Senior Vice President of Operations since 2002 and oversees the Company's non-ferrous operations, including the aerospace, semi-conductor and electronics industries. 
 James D. Hoffman will also be promoted to the office of Executive Vice President, Operations. Mr. Hoffman has served as the Company's Senior Vice President of Operations since 2008 and oversees the Company's carbon steel and alloy operations, including the energy, auto and non-residential construction industries. 
In light of Mr. Mollins' promotion and to ensure appropriate reassignment of some of Mr. Mollins' current operations management duties, effective April 1, 2015, Michael P. Shanley, currently President of Liebovich Brothers, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Reliance, will assume the title of Senior Vice President, Operations.  
Each of Mr. Sales, Mr. Hoffman, and Stephen P. Koch, Senior Vice President, Operations since 2010, will continue to report to Mr. Mollins. Mrs. Lewis and Mr. Shanley will also report to Mr. Mollins.
In closing, Mr. Hannah said, "As we recently celebrated our 75th corporate anniversary at Reliance and our 20th year as an NYSE-listed company, we are very pleased to announce these promotions which we believe will ensure that Reliance will continue into the future as the great company it has become in its first 75 years."
