Long Short Advisors﻿
Long Short Advisors, LLC is a mutual fund company based in Philadelphia that focuses on undiscovered alternative investments and boutique hedge fund investment strategies.  Our liquid alternative mutual fund products provide the advantages of daily liquidity, low initial investment minimums, more portfolio transparency, lower fees, and access to what we believe are some of the best hedge fund managers and investment managers in the business. We launched our first fund in 2010, a long/short equity mutual fund.Long Short Advisors is committed to bringing boutique institutional investment strategies once only accessible to institutions and ultra-high net worth clients.  We believe in strong alignment of interests with our partners.  Our sub advisors have significant personal investments in the strategies they manage on behalf of fund investors.Philosophy & DisciplineWe are looking for managers that do not follow the herd mentality and try to provide a unique edge and alpha to their strategies.  We believe unique investment managers are defined by several distinguishing traits.The manager has successfully implemented an investment strategy over at least one full market cycle.  There are periods between cycles when managers can generate high returns and low volatility by either explicitly or indirectly latching onto a specific, high performing factor exposure.  It is not until the end of a market cycle, after the prior excesses have been unwound, when we can then sufficiently evaluate the true sources of performance, the sustainability of the investment strategy, and the manager’s attitude towards risk management.We strongly prefer small and medium sized investment management firms as sub-advisors for our funds.  We believe there is an inflection point in the lifecycle of an investment firm where the distractions associated with managing a growing business become an impediment to investment performance.  Our sub-advisors eat their own cooking and have great passion for the investment process.  They hire world class middle and back-office professionals to minimize the time they spend away from managing the portfolio.As a corollary to our feelings on business structure, we partner with investment professionals who have clearly defined the capacity constraints associated with their strategies. We know that in most cases a portfolio manager’s ability to implement the strategy upon which the firm’s successful track record has been built is directly compromised at specific AUM thresholds.  Our sub-advisors will not compromise performance in pursuit of value destroying objectives.We require strong alignment of interests between our sub-advisors and investors in our mutual fund products.  Our sub-advisors have significant investments in the strategies they manage on behalf of Fund investors.  They also have a strong focus on our strategies with limited external business diversions.We believe our sub-advisors possess skills, attributes, and proficiencies that provide a clear competitive advantage distinguishing their strategies as unique.  We have collectively evaluated thousands of managers including who we believe are some of the best and brightest from a broad array of strategies.  This provides a high baseline standard against which we can efficiently identify core competencies that we believe are truly unique.Benefits of Liquid Alternatives?Compared to traditional hedge funds, our liquid alternative mutual fund products provide the advantages of...Daily liquidity / quoted on the exchangeFull quarterly portfolio transparencyNo performance feesLimited leverageNo need to be an accredited investorLower minimum initial investments ($5,000 for LSOFX)Alternatives Research & InsightLong Short Advisors is a resource for alternatives and liquid alternatives.

(Member FINRA)Investment in shares of a Long/Short equity fund is more volatile and risky than some other forms of investments. Since a Long/Short equity fund has both a long and a short portfolio, an investment in the Fund will involve risks associated with twice the number of investment decisions made for a typical stock fund. These types of funds typically have a high portfolio turnover that could increase transaction costs and cause short-term capital gains to be realized.Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.Long Short Advisors is registered as an investment adviser with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Information contained on this website does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy shares of the Fund, nor shall any shares be offered or sold to any person in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation, purchase, or sale would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.This site also is not intended to provide specific individual advice including, without limitation, investment, financial, legal, accounting, or tax advice.FINRA's BrokerCheckCheck the background ofLong Short Advisors LLCon FINRA's BrokerCheck
