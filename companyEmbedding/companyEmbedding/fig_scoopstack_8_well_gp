                 9 Best Natural Cleaning Products For The Kitchen And Bathroom   9 Best Natural Cleaning Products For The Kitchen And BathroomAmazonShareByTaylor FullerMar 27 2017For those wary of the health hazards that come with harsh chemicals, many household cleaners can seem counterintuitive to, well, cleaning. Sure, a chemical-laden cleaning agent might cut through a tough grease stain, but is it leaving toxic residue behind? On the other hand, mixing DIY baking soda and vinegar cleaning cocktails can often end in lackluster results. That's why I set out in search of all-natural household cleaners that actually work. Going green with your household products is beneficial for a number of reasons. First of all, by cutting harmful toxins out of your cleaning routine, it reduces your family's exposure to potential health risks. For instance, your food won't pick up trace amounts of chemicals from the kitchen counter, your hands won't absorb chemicals through surface contact, and you won't be breathing in the harsh fumes. It's also better for the environment and overall air quality. Plus, in most cases, nontoxic cleaning products are actually cheaper.  I scoured Amazon in search of the best natural all-purpose sprays, toilet bowl cleaners, dishwasher gels, degreasers, floor cleaners, and more. Enthusiastic Amazon reviewers rave that their homes are just as clean as before they made the switch to natural bathroom and kitchen cleaners. 1A Natural All-Purpose Cleaner Reviewers Swear Byhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0111WATNS?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3807-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B0111WATNSAmazonMethod All-purpose Natural Surface Cleaner, Pink Grapefruit, 28 ounce (3 Count), $20, AmazonA lot of people worry that natural, all-purpose cleaners aren't as effective as products that use chemicals, but with a backing of more than 980 positive reviews on Amazon, you can be confident that Methods All-Purpose Natural Surface Cleaner packs the same cleaning power as it's less eco-friendly competitors. And it's not just the ingredients you can feel good about, the bottle is biodegradable and the company doesn't test on animals.2A Formula That Is Gentle On Your Skin, But Tough On Greasehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TGP1IDS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00TGP1IDS&linkId=3457c51dab0e206c70457ec8fa768653AmazonGrab Green Natural Power Degreaser Cleaner (Three Pack), $20, AmazonThis nontoxic degreaser is solvent free, phosphate free, biodegradable, ammonia free, and comes in recyclable packaging. That screams green to me! The cleaner can be sprayed on stovetops, cooktop hoods, microwaves, sinks, and more to get rid of gross kitchen grease. The powerful formula can cut through the worst grease buildup and leave your kitchen looking and smelling fresh. It comes in unscented, thyme with fig leaf, tangerine with lemongrass, and red pear with magnolia.3Naturally Clean And Deodorize Your Toilethttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003B2OQQ8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B003B2OQQ8&linkId=d75d5830535291aaec918e362af516fbAmazonEco-Me Natural Powerful Toilet Bowl Cleaner, $9, AmazonSure, you may consider your toilet to be the dirtiest thing in your home, but that doesn't mean you need a toilet bowl cleaner made with harsh chemicals for it to be clean. Leave your toilet bowl sparkling with a product that is made with plant extracts. They have antibacterial properties so your toilet will be clean and germ free without any toxic fumes. It deodorizes with a natural mint scent. 4A Safe Surface Cleaner That Can Do It Allhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NIYV78O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00NIYV78O&linkId=e98b593b9b808768089322c4d1ff427cAmazonPuracy Natural All Purpose Cleaner (Two Pack), $14, AmazonI think this review says it all: "This stuff is excellent. I just used it to clean my entire house and it performed very well on everything from tile, glass, stainless steel, chrome, wood, laminate, computer monitors, TV's, metal, plastic, baseboards, walls- you name it, it cleaned it." The plant-based all purpose cleaning spray (it has a hint of green tea, lime, and some water) can clean anything. It's the perfect product to keep under the kitchen sink for when you need it.5A Daily Shower Spray So You Don't Have To Scrub It Laterhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HNOYR3M/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00HNOYR3M&linkId=ade1f695f1c8a79361c1ba8ba4a62ac1AmazonMethod Daily Shower Spray Eucalyptus Mint, $4, AmazonSpraying down your shower on a daily basis can save you from spending hours scrubbing it later. This non-toxic daily shower spray by Method dissolves stains and protects your walls, curtains, and shower doors from soap scum. It's so gentle that you can just spray it and leave it there until your next shower. One enthusiastic reviewer said, "I can't believe how well this stuff works. I used to have to scrub the glass partition to my shower every few weeks to get the mineral deposits and soap off of it. I use this every other shower at most, and the glass has been spotless for months."6A Floor Clean With A Powerful But Safe Formulahttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038QQ7N2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0038QQ7N2&linkId=bd0fd9cf110348c865ac06eb196c59feAmazonBabyganics Floor Cleaner Concentrate (Two Pack), $11, AmazonThis baby-safe cleaning formula isn't just for new parents. If you're concerned about the harsh chemicals found in so many household products, this solution is a great alternative. Simply mix the plant-based floor solution with water and mop like you usually would. Users agree that it doesn't smell offensive and is a refreshing alternative to chemical-laden cleaners. 7A Deep Cleaning Dishwasher Gel For Safe And Streak-Free Plateshttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009PPWP54/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B009PPWP54&linkId=69faf64b1dd5ef64cf955bb78904c1e3AmazonBetter Life Dishwasher Gel, $12, AmazonWhen you're looking for a dishwasher gel, you want one that not only cleans your dishes, but also leaves them streak-free. One user said, "Better Life Dishwasher Gel has no smell, does not produce any offensive fumes while the dishwasher is running...Your mileage may vary, but our glasses come out clear, plates have no film left behind, silverware has no food particles on them, and silicone and plastic items have no residual soap."8Cleaning Wipes To Keep On Handhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014SW7YNG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B014SW7YNG&linkId=09df4967cd104ecd2b07eb6aaf848443AmazonBetter Life All-Purpose Cleaner Wipes Clary Sage & Citrus, $9, AmazonI find that once one person in the house gets sick, everyone gets sick. That's why I always keep disinfectant wipes on hand. They're a quick and efficient way to wipe down surfaces and stop the spread of germs. These wipes are strong enough to cut through grease, grime, and germs and can be used as a laundry pre-spotter to get tough stains out. 9Use A Natural Sponge That Won't Grow Bacteriahttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00QUQCK6U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=bustle3816-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00QUQCK6U&linkId=66ff405a028db8dd6a9c1f44fa88650eAmazonPura Naturals Stink Free Cleaning Sponges (Six Pack), $15, AmazonIt's counter intuitive to clean your dishes or countertops with a dirty sponge. That's where Pura sponges can help, they claim to repel bacteria and germs. They actually even repel water but grab grease, oils, fats, and chemicals. They're unique leaf-shaped design makes them great for cleaning hard-to-reach places. The sponges are made from renewable resources and have a negative carbon footprint on the environment.

4.0 out of 5 starsCute way to make cones and sundaes!ByAmeyaUon April 24, 2017Great way to scoop ice cream! Makes for a great looking sundae, etc. The only issue I'm encountering is proper cleanup. Despite running it under water for quite some time, it appears the ice cream finds it way into some crevices so there's a chance you'll get some dripping ice cream a while after cleaning. I'm soaking it for 5 minutes before thoroughly rinsing it out.

1.0 out of 5 starsactually, zero starsByStevie I Wonderon December 20, 2013Bad idea. Does not work. Think about it, when the scoop goes straight down into the block of ice cream, what severs the cylinder of ice cream within the scoop from the main block of ice cream? The answer is: Nothing. The cylinder of ice cream does not want to come straight up because it is still attached. There's no way to twist it or move it laterally to separate your scoop from the main block of ice cream.  You just pull with brute force, rotate it, move the handle back and forth a little and the scoop of ice cream finally comes up.  It is very hard to hold the container of ice cream stable and you make a big mess. This thing should never have been marketed.  It doesn't eject very well, either. This is not Sade's Smooth Operator. You will never see one of these in an ice cream shop. It is a piece of dog do-do.

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsFor a friend.ByCharity Hopeon January 26, 2015Package Quantity: 1|Color: Pink|Verified PurchaseI saw this Ice Cream Scoop on my friends pinterest page on the board of random things that she would like to have, so I decided to get it for her as a "just-because" present. The concept is a good one...and since she is a avid ice-cream lover, I thought she would enjoy using this different kind of ice-cream scooper. The first thing that we noticed about it was that after washing it before using it, it was difficult to use before we figured out that the top part had fallen out...and it continues to fall out easily. Other than that, it was okay to use. I wouldn't buy it for myself or for anyone else...but it was a fun present to use for a moment.0Comment|

Please try again later.3.0 out of 5 starsWorks well when the ice cream carton is full but ...ByMark Robertson September 2, 2015Package Quantity: 1|Color: Pink|Verified PurchaseWorks well when the ice cream carton is full but less and less well as the carton empties.  Behind the counter at an ice cream shop with huge tubs of ice cream this scoop would probably be ideal, but at home in the kitchen with regular, small cartons it's kind of difficult.  I went back to using my regular scooper except, as I said, when the carton is full.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.2.0 out of 5 starsPoor design makes it more trouble than its worthByChris Mon April 25, 2015Package Quantity: 1|Color: White|Verified PurchaseBought this so I could better 'scoop' from tall cylindrical ice cream cartons. Looked promising. However, there is one serious design flaw. You can push the scoop into the ice cream with no problem, but there is no way to remove it without twisting it to the side and pulling up at an angle. And what you then have in the scoop looks nothing like the clean cut little cylinders that they portray in the pictures. It needs some sort of mechanism to slice across the bottom of the scoop after you've inserted it into the ice cream. Otherwise you're just pulling up an almost empty scoop.In addition, the buttons on the side that let you release the metal cylinder for cleaning are near impossible to press - needed something like the edge of a spoon and lots of juggling to get it apart.It now sits in the unused utensil bin awaiting the next garage sale.0Comment|

As the ice cream softens, or if you prefer ice cream not super hard, it is almost impossible to get a scoop out.0Comment|

I have  read several blogs and posts here as well but have not been able to get a clear idea of a branching structure to create that will allow merging without any problems (no baseless merging).
 
Here is the sample folder structure that I would use:

$/Main/Release
$/Main/Release/v1
$/Main/Release/v2$/Main/QA
$/Main/QA/v1
$/Main/QA/v2$/Main/Src
 
I want to have one codeline per major release in both QA and Release - hence the v1, v2 etc.  Dev work would be performed under Main/Src - for ALL releases.  Selected builds (labels) would be promoted to QA, and from there to Release. Any bug fixes would be performed on the Release/vXX branch, with the changes being merged back to QA, and Src.  
This would allow dev work to go under Src while bug fixing occurs in the specific version of the Release branch.
To create the initial codebase for Release (or QA)/v2, a branch would be created from Main/Src.
 
Is this a feasible approach?  Any ideas on improving this would also be much appreciated!
 
If anyone knows of any good postings on this issue and shares, that would also really help.
 
Thanks in advance!

A few things:The way you organize folders in the repository has no effect on merging.  Pick whatever layout looks good to you.You cannot create a child branch underneath its parent.  That is, tf branch $/Main/Release $/Main/Release/v1 will give an error.  Branches are inherently recursive, so that would result in an infinite loop...Putting aside /baseless, you can only merge between direct parents and children.  So you can't have every branch be a child of Main/Src unless you want all merges to go thru there.Here's a structure that more closely fits the promotion model you're talking about:Main   |----- QA              |---- Dev  |------ Release 1             |--------- Release 1 Dev  |------ Release 2              |--------- Release 2 DevThis way, development always happens in an isolated "dev" branch.  Code is promoted up the chain until it hits Main.  When Main is ready to ship, create a release branch.  Bugfixes flow up from Release X Dev back to Main, but never the other way around obviously.As mentioned, the folder layout is arbitrary.  You can make them all siblings:$/TeamProject/Main$/TeamProject/QA$/TeamProject/Dev$/TeamProject/Release 1$/TeamProject/Release 1 Dev$/TeamProject/Release 2$/TeamProject/Release 2 Devetc.Or you can group them:$/TeamProject/Main$/TeamProject/Current/Dev$/TeamProject/Current/QA$/TeamProject/Releases/Release 1$/TeamProject/Releases/Release 1 QA$/TeamProject/Releases/Release 2$/TeamProject/Releases/Release 2 QADoesn't matter at all.

As Richard pointed out there are many options. Thus probably why you are asking. I hope to continue this conversation because I'd like to present alternate view that I publically claim to be no better or worse. Same theory in essence as Richards recommendation but different implementation and you may or might not find it an easier maintenance model in merge. I love SCM discussions.
Definately in addition to Richards recommnedations I'd encourage a book Software Configuration Management Patterns by Stephen Berczuck with Brad Appleton : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0201741172/sr=8-1/qid=1154705435/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-2857526-0201452?ie=UTF8 - I seem to end up carrying it everywhere I go when coming to a new client on any SCM related work.

I  disagree-- in that looks very much like a big offer for for some to do exactly what was put aside - a baseless merge.
Under that scenario code fixes for Rel X could only be merged ultimately back into Main since that is the ultimate parent of the release lines. That's fine. But, this means that to get that same code into my active vNext dev line I then also have to merge from main, down through active QA to active dev. In that process I now have code in the QA line that has not even been merged into the dev line (at least for some time) and is some hybrid of who knows what,  but certainly is not QA code. How can I have a QA build on the QA code line when it has code that has not even been dev tested under the vNext codebase. 
This looks to me to taint your QA line and thus promote a baseless merge from Rel X or Main directly to vNext dev to avoid that taint.
Am I missing something?

The idea behind my structure is that branch stability looks like:Stable -- Testable -- Under DevelopmentIf you follow the promotion model strictly, then active development can only happen in a child branch ("Dev" or "Release X Dev").  It's tested and stabilized in the middle branches; nothing makes it into Main without an official rubberstamp of quality, whatever that might mean in your org.So in theory, any code that is forward integrated from main is "stable."  Inevitably there will be merge issues, but if you've compartmentalized development into cohesive features to begin with then those should be minimal.  Meanwhile, the process of driving a slightly-destabilized tree back to high quality doesn't hurt anyone: developers working on new features are isolated until any merge issues are resolved in the staging branch, while QA gets to do what QA does best.I can see an argument for having a merge path directly from Main to Dev, but you can't do that without opening the possibility of RIs that bypass the QA stage.  Also, you can't keep the existing workflow from Dev->QA->Main unless you introduce a cycle somewhere into the graph, which means at least one baseless merge.

Regardless, my suggestion is hardly the only one.  Comb the SCM literature, I'm sure you'll find a strategy that works.  Some articles that each compare several models:http://www.vance.com/steve/perforce/Branching_Strategies.htmlhttp://csdl2.computer.org/persagen/DLAbsToc.jsp?resourcePath=/dl/mags/co/&toc=comp/mags/co/2002/09/r9toc.xml&DOI=10.1109/MC.2002.1033025

Hi Richard,
Thanks for your replies.  The first one especially cleared up the confusion I had between folders and branches, which was the 'root' of my problems.
I have also been reading a whitepaper from Seapine which gives a great explanation of branching models.

I didn't see your post while replying.  I have not had an opportunity to read the book you recommend. The problem (which I suspect a lot of people may have) is that I am primarily a dev, but tasked with creating a strategy for TFS.  So I don't have the time to read through a whole book on SCM.
I did read Brad's post on cmcrossroads earlier, and found it very informative.  The whitepaper I referred to in my earlier post can be found at downloads.seapine.com/pub/papers/SCMBranchingModels.pdf
I like the option presented in fig 3 of the pdf.  I don't know how to (or even I am allowed) to reproduce the diagram here so my comments may be a bit confusing for those who are not looking at the paper.  
One question I have at this point is whether to create a new codeline (for Dev) with every new vX.Y (eg 2.1) release, and then follow the same aproach as in the diagram, or to just have one dev line for ALL versions, but with different Production Candidate (ie QA) branches created off of Dev for each vX.Y release.  I like the idea of creating a new branch for each release, even if no work is done on that branch, but just for the visibility, i.e. not having to search by label etc to get at a particular release.
I was wondering what the pros/cons of creating a new Dev branch (from the previous Dev branch) would be for each new vX.y version.
Our product is small to mid size, just one team, so not remote development etc.  Also we don't have multiple products going on simultaneously that need to branch off from Dev.
Pretty broad questions I know, but your opinion could get me thinking on different lines. 
I wish someone at MS would do a post on this subject, with considerations for TFS. I have seen a couple of MSDN blogs but nothing that I have found to my liking. I have seen a lot of people asking questions of this nature.

G'day,
I have enjoyed reading the discussion, but I think the aspect that was ignored is how easy it is to follow the branches structure and perform merges through GUI. As baseless merge is supported only through command line and baseline merge relations are not easily accessible through TFS, the how-tos of the process are largely left to documentation - that is the user must perform merge according to relation specified somewhere in documentation and using command line at that.
I am looking at the problem from somewhat different point of view. There is pure SCM implementation and there is TFS implementation given version 1 featureset.  From my personal experience, the users tend to start with larger-than-life approach ("let's-build-state-of-the-art-CM-process") and end up with lightened up version of initial process that is easy to perform and maintain.
Therefore as the question asked was about "easy merging", I would discard baseless merge as a possibility and go for approach proposed by Richard.
Yours truly,

Their essential feature is an interactive financial dashboard with a general ledger for handling double-entry bookkeeping. Common features to this class of software are a means of tracking company inventory and purchase orders, sales tracking, automated invoicing, receipt capture via document or image processing, timekeeping, analytics for budgeting and revenue tracking, financial reporting, and  accounts payable/accounts receivable functions. These features are either contained intrinsically (within the accounting software) or managed via integration with third-party software that perform these functions in a modular fashion (e.g. dedicated AR or AP software, Expense Management Software, Image Capture Software, etc.). An automated ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system contains all of these functions (or supports integration with the requisite modules), thus these products appear in this category as well. However ERPs are often industry specific or scaled to the needs of larger companies and may represent overkill for seekers of pure and simplified accounting solutions for their business. Some vendors offer specialized accounting software dedicated to handling the regulatory and reporting needs specific to some industries, like construction or manufacturing. Either an all-in-one solution or a package bundled with smaller, dedicated integratable modules could be the best approach, depending on business needs.Small Business Accounting SoftwareAccounting & Budgeting Software offerings vary a great deal in complexity. Simple, inexpensive or free platforms are available for entrepreneurs and smaller companies, while medium-sized or larger companies may find use for more complex software possessing a greater breadth of features or deeper processing capacity and higher usage limit caps (like unlimited invoicing or the ability of a larger number of users to access the system). QuickBooks, FreshBooks, and Wave Accounting are some of the leading products suited to small business. QuickBooks requires training for new users, but it is convenient to use with an accountant and other financial services, because most providers in the space are already familiar with it. FreshBooks is a bit simpler and requires less training; Wave Accounting is free and aimed at businesses with fewer than 10 employees. When evaluating accounting tools, small businesses may want to pay particular attention to these areas:CostUsability and training requirementsEfficiencyScalability and limitations, including number of customers/invoices/users/transactions per monthCustomer supportReportingMobile functionalityCPA access (unless you manage your own finances)Credit card processing, tax preparation, and payroll servicesIntegrations to third party toolsCloud Accounting SoftwareTraditionally, accounting software products were installed locally on servers located in the firm's location (on-premises or desktop software), and this kind of accounting software is still widely used today. Following the dominant trend in the broader software market though, many newer products are offered as cloud products, delivered over the Internet and accessed with a web browser. Older, on-premise-based installed products are sometimes offered in “hosted” deployments, but this is not the same thing. “Cloud” usually means Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) where the vendor manages the software application and the entire hosting infrastructure on behalf of all customers. The product is designed to be deployed in this one-to-many model and customers access the product through a simple web browser. Xero, Wave, Intacct and NetSuite are examples of cloud accounting vendors. On-premise vendors such as QuickBooks and Sage now offer cloud products as well. Read more about cloud vs. on-premise trend in Accounting software.Accounting & Budgeting Features & CapabilitiesGeneral ledger features make up the core of most accounting & budgeting platforms. Inventory, order, and payroll management features may be included as modules within the platform, or may be handled by third party plug-ins; some of these features are industry specific. Accounting & Budgeting tools also include reporting and customization/integration features (like dashboards and an API for custom integrations) that are common across many software categories. Additional capabilities are relevant for accounting firms who manage finances for multiple businesses. General Ledger FeaturesThe general ledger is a record of transactions and balances. These features comprise the basic bookkeeping functionality of the software:Accounts payable and receivableCash managementBank reconciliationExpense managementTime trackingFixed asset managementMulti-currency and multi-division supportRegulations complianceElectronic tax filingSelf-service portalInventory Management FeaturesThese features give businesses the ability to track and manage the flow of goods or materials into and out of an inventory.

What is Accounting Software?
Financial accounting is a methodology for recording and classifying a firm's financial transactions, including reporting and analysis of these transactions. Accounting transactions are encompassed by the general ledger, which is a complete record of financial transactions over the life of a company. The general ledger (often referred to as “the books”) contains balance sheet and income statement accounts. Balance sheet accounts are assets and liabilities and stockholder's equity, and these accounts show a company's position at a specific moment in time. Income statement accounts include operating revenues and expenses, and show revenues, expenses, losses and net gain for a specified period of time such as a year or a quarter.
Accounting software automates transactional record keeping processes in each of these areas so that accounting transactions can be completed and tracked more efficiently and more accurately. As such, accounting software is quintessential back-office software concerned with record maintenance and regulatory compliance. This is quite distinct from corporate finance, which focuses on “front office” tasks like financial and strategic planning to maximize shareholder return.
But this broad definition of what accounting software does at the most basic level does not begin to describe the range of accounting software varieties on the market.


Types of Accounting Software
There are many different ways to segment the market, but the following broad distinctions can be made regarding the main different types of accounting software.

Accounting versus Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)
In the software realm, the term “accounting” is sometimes used interchangeably with Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), but these software categories are not synonymous. ERP platforms certainly include general ledger accounting functionality, but they have evolved as fully-integrated platforms encompassing a broad range of capabilities usually including human resources, corporate performance management, customer service, supply chain management, manufacturing production and logistics, distribution and sometimes CRM. ERP products have evolved over time away from a unique focus on back-office processes and have swallowed entire software categories whole in pursuit of a single-platform approach.
The focus of this guide is accounting products, which necessarily includes ERP suites. But discussion of ERP products will be largely confined to the general ledger accounting aspects of these broad platforms.


Commercial versus fund accounting
Commercial firms use accounting systems to measure profit and loss performance by product, division, and company. Nonprofits have quite different accounting needs. Nonprofit fund accounting must track different funding sources and grants and allocate expenses across these funds. Additionally, funds must be carefully separated according to donors' restrictions. Nonprofits also need to understand the ratio of overhead to program expenses, which is a unique requirement.


In-house versus outsourced (Business Process Outsourcing, or BPO)
Accounting software can be used by firms to manage their own accounting processes or by specialized firms (often public accountants) working on behalf of clients in what is sometimes referred to as a “platform-led BPO model”. Accounting firms using software products to serve multiple clients have an additional set of requirements, which are not a concern for standard users, such as a branded dashboard to share data with customers, or a billing bypass mechanism allowing the vendor to invoice to the CPA firm instead of the end-user client.


On-premise versus cloud software
Traditionally, accounting software products were installed locally on servers located in the firm's location (on-premises software), and this kind of accounting software is still widely used today. Following the dominant trend in the broader software market though, many newer products are offered as cloud products, delivered over the Internet and accessed with a web browser. Older, on-premise-based installed products are sometimes offered in “hosted” deployments, but this is not the same thing. “Cloud” is usually used to mean Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) where the vendor manages the software application and the entire hosting infrastructure on behalf of all customers. The product is designed to be deployed in this one-to-many model and customers access the product through a simple web browser. An example of hosting is where a vendor offers a product that is usually installed on the customer's premises over the Internet, by hosting the software for a single client on a remote server, which is accessed via a client such as the Citrix client or a browser. This one-to-one model is not usually what is meant by when people talk about cloud software.


Accounting Software features
The primary general ledger features of most accounting tools include:

Accounts Payable and Accounts Receivable, which includes automation and tracking of payment to vendors and suppliers and, on the receivable side, automation of invoices and collections.
Cash management, which provides a complete picture of a company's cash flows, and streamlines payment processing.
Bank reconciliation connecting the software to a company's financial institutions in order to reconcile accounting records with checking, savings and credit card accounts. Often month and year closing capabilities are included.
Expense management for logging and tracking business expenses and reimbursements, including travel-related expenses, with the ability to tie them to particular projects.
Time tracking enabling tracking of billable and non-billable employee time by project.
Calculation and collection of sales tax for transactions.
Fixed asset management, including location, checkout, maintenance scheduling, audit history, cost 
      and depreciation.
Support for transactions across multiple locations or branches and foreign currencies.
Regulations compliance whereby the software helps users adhere to typical accounting standards and regulations such as IFRS, GASB, or GAAP.
Security features like role-based user permissions and single-sign on capability.
Reporting analytics including standardized reports like profit and loss, sales tax return, depreciation, foreign exchange gains and losses, etc., as well as customizable dashboards

In addition to these fundamental features, some accounting and especially ERP products also handle:

Inventory management or the ability to track and manage the flow of goods or materials into and out of an inventory.
Order management, which covers the ability to process orders, and track them from quote to cash.
Payroll management, which handles employee salaries including payroll taxes like income tax withholding, social security, and federal unemployment tax.




Accounting Software Trends

1. Increasing dominance of cloud software
Perhaps the biggest business technology story of the past ten years has been the rapid ascent of the cloud deployment model to a position of unquestioned dominance in the business software sector in general. 
This is also one of the most significant areas of discussion in the accounting software realm today. 
    Accounting and financial applications have been slower to switch to a cloud delivery model than some 
    other sectors, partly because of client concerns around change management and potential client impact, 
    in addition to security worries. Indeed, many companies are still using on-premise software like QuickBooks Desktop, AccountEdge, and Sage 50 (formerly Peachtree), all of which are fully featured and well established products. However, a wave of change is starting to build from the low end, as a number of cloud products designed for small businesses have emerged, such as Xero and Wave, as well as cloud products from QuickBooks, AccountEdge, and Sage. Similarly in the mid-market segment, some cloud vendors, most 
    notably Intacct and NetSuite, have emerged to threaten the ground occupied by legacy installed ERP 
    systems. The ERP world is still dominated by on-premise tools, but this too is changing. Cloud-based, or 
    SaaS products (these terms are often used interchangeably even though they are not synonyms) have effectively won the day in other domains like CRM, which is now dominated by cloud pioneer Salesforce.com. The era of installed or on-premise software is coming to a close, and, in the accounting sphere as in others, the future is cloud deployment.
The advantages of the cloud deployment model include:

No CapEx expense: No outlay for infrastructure and software. Instead, software is paid for monthly on a pay-as-you-go plan
Access the software from anywhere: Users can access the software from anywhere they have an internet connection
No upgrade or patch worries: Vendor updates the software and all customers are automatically on the latest version



2. Integration
Strongly related to the cloud deployment model is the growing importance of programmatic integration with other systems. Historically, accounting packages started life as simple general ledger tools for managing debits and credits. Over time though, CFOs began to see that having islands of general ledger functionality was of limited value, and that integration with other financial capabilities was essential. As a result, vendors began to build broader accounting suites, adding things like accounts payable and receivable, payroll, bill payment, inventory management, etc.
The cloud computing revolution transforming the accounting software sector has radically challenged this integrated suite approach paradigm. It is no longer necessary to purchase a fully integrated suite that does all the things you need it to do. The fact that products now reside in the cloud and do not need to be installed, means that it is much easier to pick and choose discrete products to handle different parts of the financial value chain. A financial accounting system can quite easily be hooked up to a best-of-breed payroll system or an expense management system. It's also relatively straightforward to integrate with an off-the-shelf business intelligence tool to produce automated visualizations of key financial metrics like accounts receivable days, debt to equity ratio, ROI and return on capital employed.
But integration is about more than just adding functional capabilities. There is significant value in automating processes so that human beings are freed from the drudgery of simple data entry. For example, a newer generation of cloud products like Wave and Xero are capable of importing bank data directly, eliminating the need for manual data entry. Automating clearing house transactions and data interchange further reduces manual coding. The automation of all data entry by tight integration with these external systems allows CPAs to concentrate on more strategic tasks while the technology handles the mechanical bookkeeping aspects.


3. More choices for small businesses
Intuit has owned the small business accounting space for many years with QuickBooks, and still has about 90% market share. QuickBooks Online, which was released more than a decade ago, but has struggled in the face of emerging competition from pure-play online vendors. A sign of that competition is the fact that a completely modernized version of the QuickBooks Online product was released in 2013, with a more intuitive interface design and separate apps for iPad and iPhone.
New online products like FreshBooks, Kashoo, Wave and Xero have been designed for Internet deployment and each has an elegant, consumer-like design and an intuitive user interface. These products are generally easier to use for novice users than any QuickBooks product.  Indeed, many of their customers are former QuickBooks users who have switched because they have found QuickBooks too difficult to use. These new tools are also inexpensive and one of the three—Wave—is actually free (it's supported by advertising revenue).
However, these products still command only a small portion of the market and are generally less fully-featured than the various flavors of QuickBooks Desktop. The on-premise versions of QuickBooks are still very popular with accountants and small businesses for exactly this reason. But the landscape is definitely shifting, and small businesses have more choice than ever before. As evidence of this change Brad Smith, CEO of Intuit, recently reported that “for Intuit's FYE2014 for the first time more new QuickBooks users chose the online version than the a traditional desktop version. Contrast that with our income tax preparation products where that shift happened 7 or 8 years ago.”


4. Cloud solutions also transforming mid-market and enterprise
A similar dynamic is playing out at the mid and high-end where cloud pioneers like NetSuite, Intacct, and Workday are challenging the hegemony of traditional industry behemoths like SAP and Oracle. Many of the on-premise ERP heavyweights have made decades of investment in on-premise solutions only to see flat or declining sales while NetSuite and Intacct, for example, have been experiencing double-digit growth for the last several years. The response of the traditional on-premise vendors, of course, is to reposition their offerings and develop a coherent cloud strategy without abandoning their existing platforms. SAP has achieved some success with its cloud-based HANA technology, while Oracle is struggling to upgrade on-premise customers to its cloud platform, now called Oracle ERP Cloud. However, as with QuickBooks in the small-business market, these vendors do have a very dominant share of the market, and the challenge from new cloud vendors is still nascent.
The three main cloud challengers have relatively low market share with very high growth rates; they are, however, quite different one from another. 
Intacct is a small to upper mid-market product serving a range of customer types from technology startups to divisions of multinational corporations. It is focused exclusively on finance applications, with strong integrations to other business applications like Salesforce.com. The Intacct Marketplace showcases a rich ecosystem of third-party integrations, some built by Intacct itself and others built by vendor partners.
NetSuite, on the other hand, is an integrated suite with a broad range of capabilities designed for larger customers. NetSuite's main product includes a fully featured ERP platform with financial management, ecommerce, order management and inventory control, and a CRM, in addition to a professional services automation (PSA) offering. Workday is a true large enterprise platform with an enviable growth rate of around 70% year over year.


5. Business Process Outsourcing
BPO for small and medium firms is not a new phenomenon and is technology-driven, in a model that might be referred to as “platform-led BPO”. This, as the name implies, is all about using technology to facilitate collaboration between firms and public accounting firms and implement industry best practices. The use of technology to create lasting value through automation and best practices depends greatly on accounting software developments, and for that reason has gone through its own evolution. Initially, companies using on-premises products like QuickBooks used outsourcing as a way of securing write-up or financial statement compilation services. This cannot be considered true BPO, but is a kind of precursor. The next phase in the development of this model was accounting firms hosting desktop software on a server such that clients could log into the software using a Citrix client. But the real platform-led BPO tsunami was made possible by the development of cloud software, which enabled the accounting firm and clients to share the same software instance and to see precisely the same data in real time.
Accounting firms frequently offer outsourcing or BPO services to companies who do not have the staff, the skills, or the desire to manage F&A processes themselves, or desire to focus on only their core business, or who want to gain efficiencies and hence lower costs. Services offered span a spectrum from handling a few transactional services such as payroll, accounts payable and receivable, bookkeeping, etc. to offering more strategic services like tax management, yield management, or risk analysis. Specialization in vertical markets is also driving BPO adoption, and accounting firms frequently specialize in a particular market niche. Specialization allows accounting firms to acquire detailed knowledge of the challenges faced by companies in their niche and provide customized dashboards and benchmarking data.
The CPA firm sometimes (but not always) dictates the accounting platform to be used, and most CPA firms have expertise in a number of different cloud platforms to service clients of different types and sizes. Best practice for leading forms is standardize on a few platforms and then dictate the platform, but some firms default to the product that the client firm is already using. There are different models for CPAs in public practice, from referring clients to a particular vendor, to running the software on behalf of a client, to actually re-selling the software. Many accounting products now have CPA versions, which have been specifically designed to facilitate use of their products in this BPO model.
A typical scenario is the CPA firm setting up and running the software on behalf of clients and providing detailed views of the data via dashboards, which allow for mutual decision-making.
The goal of outsourcing from the CFO or financial executive standpoint has always been the same: removing some of the administrative cost overhead from a fairly rote set of operations. The traditional meaning of BPO usually adopted by large companies with over 1,000 employees is the model whereby large service providers like Accenture, Wipro, and Infosys essentially outsource accounting labor offshore to save money by wage differential arbitrage. Although still very widely implemented, this model, some analysts argue, has not achieved the desired aim for the simple reason that a model based on cheap labor is unlikely to be sustainable over the long term. In this model, less attention is paid to things like process standardization and automation through technology that are likely to make a significant difference. In short, a cheap labor model alone is unlikely to lead to sustainable value creation.
The following diagram shows the distribution of accounting products across size of client organization with the traditional sweet spot for CPA outsourcing services.




Factors to Consider when Selecting Accounting Software
The following table summarizes the products featured in this guide, and gives an indication of the size of organizations typically served, whether they are on-premise or installed, and whether they are an ERP suite (vs. financials only). This is a useful guide to orient product selection according to the most basic criteria.

There are also additional factors worth considering.

What add-on capabilities does the product have beyond G/L?
Almost all accounting platforms have additional features beyond the core general ledger transactional accounting capabilities. Many, including small business-oriented solutions, have additional capabilities around things like payroll, time tracking, invoicing, electronic billing, and even business intelligence for analytics and reporting. It's important to understand which additional capabilities are built into the platform and whether they come at an additional cost.


ERP platforms are not all the same
The table above indicates products that are ERP platforms, rather than pure accounting products. However, ERP can mean a lot of different things. For example, although Intacct refers to itself as a “cloud ERP” platform and does include inventory management and project accounting, it is very focused on the accounting function and does not have the broad array of additional capabilities found in some other ERP products. NetSuite on the other hand has a very complete ERP product including supply chain, procurement, warehousing and fulfillment, human capital management and more. The core suite also includes customer relationship management (CRM), professional services automation (PSA), and ecommerce capabilities. Workday, in addition to financials, has its origin in a broad suite of HR tools.


Integration / Connectors
Given the resurgence of a best-of-breed model, it is important to understand the ease of integration to specific 3rd-party systems. Instead of having to build connectors to target systems by using the API (which will be beyond the expertise of many companies), it is preferable if there are pre-built connectors to systems customers need to leverage. For example, Intacct has a connector to Salesforce.com, which can be set up with a few clicks and does not require IT support or help from expensive consultants. Xero has a connector to ADP Run, an HR platform specifically designed for small businesses. NetSuite too has connectors to other systems like Salesforce, Oracle E-Business Suite, SAP ERP and Google Apps. It is important to understand which connectors exist, whether they are third-party connectors or build in to the accounting application, how well they function, and which ones might be on the roadmap.


Usability
Elegant design is not a characteristic normally associated with accounting software, which historically has been functional but far from beautiful. However, some of the newer vendors in the small business sector have started to change that perception. The general trend known as the consumerization of business software has improved software usability dramatically across many different domains as vendors strive to match the completely intuitive experience they have come to expect from products like the iPhone. Accounting products too are starting to benefit from this phenomenon. For example, Xero was designed with usability in mind from the very beginning, and it looks much more like a consumer application than a business application. Intacct, in the mid-market, has also designed a clean, intuitive product with more of a consumer look-and-feel. Well-designed and even beautiful products are products that people love to use. Additionally, intuitive workflows produce far fewer calls to support with the consequent loss in productivity that implies. Product design and usability can no longer be considered simply “nice to have” but are an inherently critical factor in successful product adoption and ROI.

We have eight different Tax IDs and eight different bank accounts which require us to have separate, distinct sets of books. GP is a great, easy-to-use tool that helps us keep track of each of our entities and run complete sets of financials for each one. We also have some very complicated allocations we have to do for our leasing company. This requires us to set up allocation accounts so each expense only has to be entered once, and the system will do the allocations behind the scenes. I've worked with several other GL packages, including QuickBooks, and none of them had the ability to perform complicated allocations.ProsFRx is a very simple third party report writer that makes report running so easy and straight forward. But it can also use more advanced features such as reporting trees so multiple sets of financials can be chained together.The allocation accounts are a great feature of GP. It makes the process of allocating salaries and other expenses when necessary a breeze. If your organization does any type of expense sharing across entities, departments, etc, consider using GP to do that.Overall ease of use. I absolutely love GP. I am a Microsoft Certified Professional in Version 9. It is very intuitive, extremely easy to navigate, simple to set up, and easy to maintain. It has great reporting features, has a simple budget import/export feature, and is truly the best GL package on the market.ConsWith respect to the allocations, once the expense is entered into the allocation account, you lose the ability to run any detail on just the total of the expense. It would be nice if you could run a trial balance on the allocation accounts the same way you can with regular accounts.I've always thought security set up could be a bit simpler. It actually has gotten better through the years. Specifically, with eight separate entities, it would be nice to have a "master" setup where you could call up one group entity, assign the users rights, and then be finished. Currently, whenever I have a new user, I have to call up each individual entity and select all of the features I want the user to have. That means I have to do eight steps for each user.Likelihood to Recommend10.0I love GP. I have for years. I've been a GP consultant, and have been a user for eight years. Before making the decision to select an accounting package, ask such questions as: What types of financial statements do I want? How detailed do I want them? Do I want to create separate entities or will departments work? GP has a very simplistic, onboard report writer. But if you need the ability to customize your reports, you should consider FRx. I believe FRx may be called something different now. It has a very advanced set of allocation accounts that I highly recommend to anyone that has to allocate expenses. from Candi Southall's Full Review (11 More Sections)Constance QuigleyOwner | Computer Software | 1-10 employeesMicrosoft Dynamics GP Review: "GP isn't perfect, but it is a very good product for its space!"8 of 10  |  11/11/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeI use Dynamics GP internally for the accounting of my consulting business. I am also a Microsoft reseller dealing exclusively in Dynamics GP and affiliated 3rd party products. The product is in use as a core accounting product as well as a full ERP system for several customers. Modules include general ledger, payables management, receivables management, inventory, sales order processing, purchase order processing, project accounting, manufacturing, and a broad variety of tools for reporting and data extraction.ProsCore accounting functionality is exceptional - for processing A/P, A/R, and G/L transactions, this product is the best mid-market solution available.Reporting has improved significantly over the years. The product has many tools developed by Microsoft and in conjunction with accounting specific needs, such as SQL reporting services, smartlist builder, and Excel reporting.The user-interface is user-friendly and easy to learn - very similar to other Microsoft products.ConsSupply chain management is adequate but not exceptional, and there are challenges tying the product to a website front end. These features are present and work fine in many environments but are often lacking for customers who need more robust systems.Reporting tools often require consulting expertise or an internal business analyst to develop. Many smaller companies don't have this skill set, so it can be costly to upgrade to GP from a smaller packages like QuickBooks.Some features that are available in competing products are still not present in GP, such as full copy-paste functionality and more intelligent workflow/batch processing functions.Likelihood to Recommend8.0I would say Microsoft Dynamics GP is in the beginning stages of functionality for a hosted solution.

The integrated time clock posts hours directly into GP. The steps to generate the payroll are short and easy.ConsWe found the sales order entry process to be cumbersome and requires too many steps to get the invoice posted and the documents for customer generated. We process many sales orders in a day and need a system that allows for quick entry and processing. This system did not meet that need.We have a fairly simple manufacturing process.

This is a holding company composed by 6 manufacturing companies, which each of those are being managed in GP. The main products are row materials so one of the challenge was to integrate GP with the PLC and the batching systems. GP was the only ERP that allowed this kind of integration. The integration is in real time, and eliminated a lot of manual process in order to create invoices and manage receivables. In addition to that this company is located in Puerto Rico where payroll is a little different than US, specially in the calculation of vacation and sick Hours, with GP we were able to custom the GP vacation and sick window entry to manage the special needs for Puerto Rico's payroll. Other challenge was to manage requisitions from the remote sites, this process was out of control and using Business Portal, we were able to automated the purchasing process and have a better control on all the items that were requested from remote sites. GP has been so flexible to adapt to the company requirements, even though we do not have experience in Dexterity where able to create new functionalities just using extender.ProsAdaptability to new functionalites, easy to customizeEasy to Integrate with other Third party software and a lot of third party software in teh market that integrates with GPEasy deployment for future upgradesIncrease real-time data sharing and integrate business processes in any organtizationGreat reporting Tools , you can build reports from scratch and customize templates for specific individuals or groups to deliver information across the entire organizationConsImprove the Vacation and Sick accruals calculation, basically we would like to have different options or schedule to setup the vacation and sick hours.Likelihood to Recommend10.0I would ask :How will GP help to generate more revenue?What is the Scalability for GP ?What are the benefits we should see with GP ?from Authenticated Review (4 More Sections)Jimmy GarcesSenior Software Developer | Telecommunications | 201-500 employeesMicrosoft Dynamics GP Review: "GP good for the user and the systems Integrator"9 of 10  |  4/8/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeDynamics GP is currently being used by our comapny as the the Accounting, Finance and Logistics teams. It provides a common tool that can be used across multiple departments. Its easy to use and provides many ways to integrate with the company's ERP system. We also use the Analytic Cubes, Management Reporter along with the out of the box SSRS reports for reporting.ProsThe Inventory module integrates smoothly with the Accounting module. Along with the our third party Logistics addin, we can use handheld scanners to maintain our inventory.Writing reports for use within GP is easy. I have written reports and published to GP within 30 minutesThe econnect API is easy and straight forward. We use it for many custom integrations such as automatic Invoice and Payables document generation.ConsMore out of box reports that can be exported to excel in tabular form. There are to many text based reports that even though they can be exported to excel, are still not in a form that allows easy used.Easier setup of the Web Services,More workflow capabilitiesLikelihood to Recommend9.0Out of the box, GP offers a solution that can be used by many of the internal functionality groups. This includes logistics, Payables, Collections, Receivables and Purchasing. When you add the ability to drop third party tools into GP, you now have a flexible application that can be extended well beyond its original boundaries.from Jimmy Garces's Full Review (3 More Sections)Authenticated ReviewerConsultant in Professional Services | Consumer Goods | 501-1000 employeesMicrosoft Dynamics GP: "GP2013 Review"10 of 10  |  4/6/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe implement GP.ProsAccountingDistributionManufacturingConsField ServicesProject AccountingLikelihood to Recommend10.0Microsoft Dynamics GP is good for organizations looking for accounting, distribution, and manufacturing modules. Professional services or job contracts are not a strong side.from Authenticated Review (24 More Sections)Eric MereenApplication Systems Analyst | Logistics and Supply Chain | 5001-10,000 employeesMicrosoft Dynamics GP Review: "Great Plains Can Do Amazing Things"10 of 10  |  3/31/2015Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeWe use Microsoft Dynamics GP for Accounting, A/R, A/P, Payroll, and HR functions. The whole organization uses it except for any operational departments that don't deal with money or accounting. One issue using Great Plains has solved is having all the departments using one system instead of many.ProsIt's ease of use is a plus for many people in my organization, the layout of the software is well received.The software is very flexible. We have a few 3rd party add-ons we have purchased and Microsoft is very supportive of having these add-ons to meet our needs.Great Plains offers a software developer kit (SDK) called eConnect that allows extensive importing through .Net programming into Great Plains. This flexibility has been great when the need to import large files on a regular basis.The support tools from an Admin stand point is great. Check links and reconcile are very good at fixing issue when they come up.Microsoft support is great. They fix the issue quickly and describe why it happened.ConsA lot of document amounts can't be changed or updated, you have to delete them and recreate them if the total is wrong. This can cause a lot of extra hand keying of transactions if they mistyped them.Integration Manager is limited and would benefit in have more options available to the end user.Having a client application that ties into the server would be good. Currently we either remote into the server to access GP or use Citrix. It would be nice to have a way for users to access GP without Citrix or Remote Desktop.Likelihood to Recommend10.0It does accounting really well, it does payroll not so well. I say this because when you get into states that have complicated payroll laws like California, overtime calculations are hard to setup and get right. Same goes for other states when they do out of the normal pay structure like piece rate pay. It does HR, A/P and A/R really well and we have had no issues on that side; just payroll when it comes to certain states and how we do anything that is not salary or hourly.from Eric Mereen's Full Review (2 More Sections)Joel RodencalIT Consultant | Information Technology and Services | 11-50 employeesReview: "Midwest Partner uses and sells Microsoft Dynamics GP"9 of 10  |  12/18/2014Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeThe company I work for (Summit Group Software) is actually a reseller of the Microsoft Dynamics GP product, along with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Having worked with GP for 15 years and seeing it grow from version 5.0 to the currently release of 2013, I can say that I am pleased with the progression that GP has made with Microsoft and I always look forward to future releases to see what they have added. The next release is due out in December (GP 2015) and really looking forward to what I have heard will be great enhancements.ProsGP is a great application to integrate other financial data to. The robustness of SQL helps GP adapt well to being able to integrate information.GP with SQL is great to be able to provide Business Intelligence and get that information out to the related parties instead of relying on your accounting team to get you that information.GP is always getting more functionality and moving with the times. Example in GP 2013 they released a web version so that you can access GP from any where, even a coffee shop!!ConsThe internal reporting to GP is very old school and would like to see a tighter integration to SSRS or other reporting tools. (There are add-ons that do this well, but having it built into GP would be great)Sometimes software packages put together by "developers" miss some of the simple things that "accountants" think of, and there are just some of those simple things that one has to just work around.Likelihood to Recommend9.0Microsoft Dynamics GP usually is a pretty good fit for most businesses. It has a great flexibility with all of the ISV add-ons out there as well as its own customization tools. To keep costs down one of the main questions is: "Who really needs to be in the actual GP application"? Can one get their job done by getting "real-time" reporting provided to them without having to take up a user and being in the application?from Joel Rodencal's Full Review (3 More Sections)Amber BellImplementation and Training Specialist | Computer Software | 11-50 employeesUser Review: "Microsoft Dynamics GP"10 of 10  |  7/7/2014Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeI train and implement companies on using the product. We use it internally for billing customers and paying vendors and for internal payroll and project accounting.ProsReporting - Connecting data to Excel via Live Excel (Database Connection) that is a free part of GP, or via SmartList. The exports are clean and easy to use for calculations and charts.Collaboration - Multiple users have access to the same data via reports and inquiries. Users can see the data in Excel as it is being entered and saved via the connection to Excel. Multiple users can also add data to the same batch. This is great for billing or other large processes.Data Integrity - GP is GAAP compliant. If someone makes a change, you will see it. Unlike some solutions that allow deleting and changing of posted transactions.Navigation - Users can customize the navigation to quickly access Frequently Used screens and reports.Help Features - The built in Help Features and free access to manuals and online training is AMAZINGIntegrated 3rd Party Products - many companies build specialized products that integrate seamlessly into the solution. This allows for companies to address specific needs without paying for and maintaining costly custom solutions.ConsRequires expert help for implementation. Clients who try to implement on their own miss many key setup windows.Some built in reports do not open in a clean version in Excel (Historical Aging). This would be a great feature to add.Likelihood to Recommend10.0GP is a robust and stable product. It is worth investing in a good company for support and implementation. Ask the company how long they have been working with GP. Show them copies of the critical reports and make them show you how to run these using GP. Their idea of an acceptable new report might not work for you. However, be open to change if they have a good idea.from Amber Bell's Full Review (2 More Sections)Melissa BrownConsultant | Computer Software | 1-10 employeesReview: "Become Passionate About your ERP Solution with Microsoft Dynamics GP"10 of 10  |  6/30/2014Invited By: TrustRadius | Incentive: YesUse Cases and Deployment ScopeMy organization utilizes Microsoft Dynamics GP for all our accounting needs. We process timesheets against projects to record consultant's time, convert this into payments to the consultants and invoices to customers. We collect cash from our customers and reconcile the bank statements. Financial statements are easy to produce and all payables transactions are handled through GP as well. It is our only solution and it fits our needs perfectly. ProsMicrosoft Dynamics GP is completely integrated. There is no need for additional products to handle payables, receivables, project accounting, field service, payroll, etc.The drill back capabilities within Microsoft Dynamics GP are phenomenal! There is no need to write down a journal entry number and then go find it, you let the system doing the drilling back for you to go from a journal entry all the way back to the initial transaction in the subledger.The reporting options from Microsoft Dynamics GP are endless. You can utilize any of the hundreds of reports built into the application or easily utilize SmartList to perform ad hoc queries of your data. If more robust reporting is needed, then SQL Reporting Services is available.ConsHaving an integration between Project Accounting and Field Service would be amazing! There are so many companies that have service technicians that perform work on a customer's contract but also have a need for project accounting functionality within that customer's contract. Right now those modules are separate so you either need to use one or duplicate some efforts if you need to use both.Microsoft Dynamics GP could do a better job documenting their new enhancements to the product. They realize great enhancements but the documentation about them, or new products, is lacking so it is difficult as a consultant to know everything a new feature can do for me and my customers.They could enhance their forecasting capabilities with a new forecasting tool within Management Reporter.Likelihood to Recommend10.0I need to fully understand the client's needs in an ERP solution but I have not run into a situation where Microsoft Dynamics GP could not work for the client. It really comes down to what is most important to the client and if that area of Microsoft Dynamics GP is extremely feature packed and a strong suit, then it's a great fit. from Melissa Brown's Full Review (2 More Sections)Microsoft Dynamics GP Rating SummaryOverall Rating (95)7.6Likelihood to Recommend (24)7.9Likelihood to Renew (7)9.9Usability (4)7.0Availability (2)9.9Performance (1)7.0Support (3)8.9Implementation (3)8.2CPA Rating (1)9.0Product scalability (1)9.1Feature Rating SummaryPayroll Management (6)7.6Pay calculation (6)8.0Benefit plan administration (5)6.3Direct deposit files (6)7.8Salary revision and increment management (6)7.8Reimbursement management (5)8.1Customization (8)7.1API for custom integration (8)6.3Plug-ins (8)8.0Security (15)9.4Single sign-on capability (13)9.1Role-based user permissions (15)9.6Reporting & Analytics (15)7.7Dashboards (11)7.3Standard reports (15)7.6Custom reports (15)8.1General Ledger and Configurable Accounting (19)7.9Accounts payable (19)8.4Accounts receivable (13)7.9Cash management (14)8.7Bank reconciliation (17)7.6Expense management (11)8.3Time tracking (6)6.2Fixed asset management (11)7.8Multi-currency support (5)8.6Multi-division support (10)9.0Regulations compliance (3)6.9Electronic tax filing (2)7.8Self-service portal (2)7.5Inventory Management (10)7.8Inventory tracking (9)9.1Automatic reordering (3)8.1Location management (7)8.8Manufacturing module (4)5.2Order Management (10)8.9Pricing (7)8.5Order entry (9)8.9Credit card processing (5)8.9Cost of goods sold (10)9.2Accounting Firm BPO Features (3)5.6Branded client dashboards (2)5.0Client data roll-up capabilities (2)5.0Client data consolidation for benchmarking (2)5.0Configurable alerts (1)7.0Client template cloning (2)5.5Single sign-on (3)8.3Configurable client  onboarding questions (2)8.0Cross-client workflow management (1)2.0Industry-specific versioning (1)1.0Legacy system data migration (2)9.0Microsoft Dynamics GP DescriptionMicrosoft Dynamics GP is one of the ERP products in the Dynamics family.

Hi,
We have upgraded to GP 2010R2 from GP 9 (routing GP 10).
Now we want to use Manufacturing Module in current version. Earlier it was not registered.
Once we add Manufacturing Module using ‘Program and Features’ under ‘Control Panel’. ‘Add/Remove Feature’ install Manufacturing module in current version. But when we ran GP Utilities, we have got this message in ‘Duinstall.txt’ file
‘Failure encountered ON 1/15/2014 at 11:30:34 PM.  Error:  Product 346 does not support upgrading from version 8.0.0.’
We shall be highly obliged, if someone assist in this regard.

Regards.
Irfan Rasheed

Just to make sure of one issue of the upgrade steps;
You should upgrade first to the latest GP 9 service pack, then you can go directly to GP 2010. Utilities should be run initially before adding the module in order to handle stored procedures, tables and database related issues.
Then, go for the manufacturing module.
Your feedback is highly appreciated,

Thanks AlSaadi for your reply.
We have upgraded to GP 2010 after moving to latest service pack of GP 9.0 (SP 4)
Initially we have no requirement of Manufacturing Module. Hence, we do not include it, but now we want to activate this module.

That's absolutely well understood. 
Although, what I want to make sure of that you run the utilities before you add a new feature from the control panel. Once utilities is complete, go for adding the module.

Yes, after upgrading I follow these steps:
Ran GP Utilities, Message appears that ‘Your Microsoft Dynamics GP’ system database is at the current version'. After clicking Next I login to GP.
Then, I have added Manufacturing Module from Control Panel.
And then, I ran GP Utilities and having this message ‘Failure encountered ON 1/16/2014 at 2:51:47 PM.  Error:  Product 346 does not support upgrading from version 8.0.0.’
No Luck...

Meanwhile, I have tested another thing, I have installed a module that was not added earlier. But this module was listed in Registered Modules. After running GP utilities, this module become active.
On the other hand, Manufacturing was not registered earlier, as we haven’t entered its registration keys.
Does this cause any issue.

Since Manf wasn't properly upgraded you will need to reinitialize it. This will drop all tables for this module in this company so all data will be lost. 
This issue is typically due to Manufacturing objects not being correct. Since Manufacturing is not being used we can simply reinstall the module with a few scripts. Make sure you have backups of your databases before you run these scripts: 
Delete DYNAMICS..DB_Upgrade where PRODID = 346and db_name = 'xxxx' 
Delete DYNAMICS..DU000020 where PRODID = 346 and companyID = xx 
Delete DYNAMICS..DU000030 where PRODID = 346 and companyID = xx 
You can find the Companyid by running the following script: 
select CMPANYID,CMPNYNAM,INTERID from Dynamics..SY01500 
Last you need to run the following drop scripts against each company you need to reinstall the module for: 
Drop Table BM010116 
Drop Table PK010033 
Drop view EXPV1001 
Drop view JCV2002 
Drop view JCV2004

Thanks a lot Jonathan for detailed reply.
I have ran scripts and then add Manf Module. It works.

I am getting the same error message. The only thing that shows up in the db_upgrade table is Dynamics database. I delete the record and I get "error Product 346 doesn't support upgrading." There must be another table or view in the Dynamics database. I ran your scripts against all my companies. Do you know what other table or view might be in the dynamics db? Thanks.

I am having the same issue.  I ran the scripts but when I run GP utilities something is writing a record to DB_Upgrade for prodid 346 with a version 8.0.  So then I receive an error  Product 346 does not support upgrading from version 8.0.0.  What is causing this  to write this record to DB_upgrade table.
Thanks,

Was a solution discovered for this? 
I was receiving the message at first for more than one product:
Failure encountered ON 1/30/2015 at 11:09:40 AM.  Error:  Product 309 does not support upgrading from version 10.0.1289.Failure encountered ON 1/30/2015 at 11:09:40 AM.  Error:  Product 346 does not support upgrading from version 10.0.1290.Failure encountered ON 1/30/2015 at 11:09:40 AM.  Error:  Product 414 does not support upgrading from version 10.0.1304.
I removed the records for those PRODID (Fixed Assets, Manufacturing, Human Resources) from:
DYNAMICS..DB_UpgradeDYNAMICS..DU000020DYNAMICS..DU000030
Specifically for Manufacturing, I also ran the following:
Drop Table BM010116 Drop Table PK010033 Drop view EXPV1001 Drop view JCV2002 Drop view JCV2004 Drop View EXPV1000 Drop View EXPV1002 Drop View EXPV1003 Drop View ManufacturingOrders
GP Utilities still returns the error, but only for Manufacturing, and with version 8.0.0
'Failure encountered ON 1/30/2015 at 4:59:42 PM.  Error:  Product 346 does not support upgrading from version 8.0.0.'
The DB_Upgrade table once again has a record for PRODID 346.
How is GP Utilities adding the record back to the DB_Upgrade table??

I fixed this but have been thinking really hard back to Nov14 to figure out how but can't remember. The only thing that comes to mind is to do what Jonathan F said above in all dbs instances. I will keep thinking. I like to help you.

Mine looks like above by the way. I might have manually issued an update statement to set columns after the Utilities. There was one additional step in. That is the step I am having hard time remembering.

I think I've figured it out. In addition to all the steps above, if your initial GP installation was 8.0 or earlier, you need to do the following in the DYNAMICS database:
drop procedure dbo.msys80DummyProc
drop table SYPS0100
It seems that Dynamics utils takes the presence of both those objects as an indication that the manufacturing module was installed with GP8.0. I don't know about other modules.

Hi All,
I solved this problem. I changed the value in fields DB_verBuild and DB_verOldBuild in DB_upgrade table for PRODID 309 and 3180 (FA and AA) to latest version of 309 and 3180 after 2010 SP4 upgrade

Since Manf wasn't properly upgraded you will need to reinitialize it. This will drop all tables for this module in this company so all data will be lost. 
This issue is typically due to Manufacturing objects not being correct. Since Manufacturing is not being used we can simply reinstall the module with a few scripts. Make sure you have backups of your databases before you run these scripts: 
Delete DYNAMICS..DB_Upgrade where PRODID = 346and db_name = 'xxxx' 
Delete DYNAMICS..DU000020 where PRODID = 346 and companyID = xx 
Delete DYNAMICS..DU000030 where PRODID = 346 and companyID = xx 
You can find the Companyid by running the following script: 
select CMPANYID,CMPNYNAM,INTERID from Dynamics..SY01500 
Last you need to run the following drop scripts against each company you need to reinstall the module for: 
Drop Table BM010116 
Drop Table PK010033 
Drop view EXPV1001 
Drop view JCV2002 
Drop view JCV2004 
Drop View EXPV1000 
Drop View EXPV1002 
Drop View EXPV1003 
Drop View ManufacturingOrders

Just to make sure of one issue of the upgrade steps;
You should upgrade first to the latest GP 9 service pack, then you can go directly to GP 2010. Utilities should be run initially before adding the module in order to handle stored procedures, tables and database related issues.
Then, go for the manufacturing module.
Your feedback is highly appreciated,
