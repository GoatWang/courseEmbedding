Michael B. McCallister
MICHAEL B. MCCALLISTER, as President and CEO of Humana Inc., has led the
Fortune 200 company to a leadership position within the health-benefits
industry. During his tenure, Humana, based in Louisville, Ky., has
gained a reputation as the nation’s premier health benefits innovator,
leveraging new products, processes and technology to solve the
employer’s cost dilemma through a consumer-centric value proposition.
Under Mr. McCallister’s direction, Humana is defining a new world of
health benefits featuring consumer-choice health plans that empower
employees to choose and use their health benefits with confidence. Mr.
McCallister has an extensive history with Humana, having joined the
company in 1974 as a finance specialist. From 1975 to 1980, he served
successively as an administrator and Associate Executive Director for
Humana hospitals in Louisiana, Mississippi and California. He became
Executive Director of Humana Hospital-Huntington Beach (California) in
1980 and served as CEO for Humana hospitals in California and Arizona
for the next nine years. He was promoted to Vice President in 1989 with
responsibility for the integrated operations of Humana’s hospitals and
health plans in Arizona. From 1992 to 1996 he served in the same
capacity in Texas, becoming responsible for Humana’s health plan
operations exclusively after the company spun off its hospitals in 1993.
He was a Division President, in charge of Humana’s Texas, Florida and
Puerto Rico operations, from 1996 to 1997. For the three years prior to
being named President and CEO in February 2000, he had senior management
responsibility for health plan operations throughout the company. He
plays a leadership role in key industry advocacy organizations. He is on
the Board of the Business Roundtable (BRT) and in August was named
Chairman of the BRT’s Task Force on Health and Retirement. He is also a
member of the Board of Directors of America’s Health Insurance Plans,
the health benefits industry’s principal trade association. He also
serves on the College of Administration and Business Advisory Board of
Louisiana Tech University. In his community, Mr. McCallister is a Board
member of the Greater Louisville Fund for the Arts and a former
Executive Committee member of Greater Louisville, Inc. (the metro
chamber of commerce). He holds an MBA degree from Pepperdine University
in Malibu, California, and a Bachelor’s degree from Louisiana Tech
University in Ruston, Louisiana.

■ Michael B. McCallister climbed the ladder at Humana Incorporated for 26 years before being named its president and chief executive officer in 2000. As the company grew into one of the largest hospital and health-care companies in the United States, McCallister held a series of executive positions at different hospitals in California, Texas, and Arizona. He rose to upper-level management positions during the 1990s, making his mark as a senior vice president during a time when the company faced large financial losses. After McCallister became president and CEO of the company in 2000, he led the company's turnaround through such innovative ideas as paperless health care management products and consumer-driven health-care plans.
EDUCATION AND EARLY CAREER


McCallister was born in Shreveport, Louisiana, in 1952. He remained in his home state to attend college at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, graduating in 1974. At the time McCallister completed his degree, Humana was less than 15 years old. The company, originally called Extendicare, was formed in 1961 by two young lawyers and other investors who developed, owned, and operated a nursing home business. For the remainder of the 1960s the company acquired more nursing homes and expanded its business to include hospitals. By 1974 Extendicare had purchased about 10 hospitals and changed its name to Humana.
McCallister joined Humana in 1974 as a finance specialist, working in the company's headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky. After a year he returned to Louisiana to serve as executive director of finances for Community Hospital in Springhill, which was a branch of Humana. In 1978 McCallister moved again, accepting a position as executive director for Humana hospitals in Huntington and West Anaheim in California. He remained there from 1978 through 1985, during which time he earned an MBA degree from Pepperdine University in Malibu, California.
Humana grew rapidly throughout the 1970s. By the early 1980s it was the world's largest hospital company, owning more than 80 hospitals. McCallister saw the company's growth at first hand, which later helped him deal with change inside the corporation after he moved into upper-level management positions. In 1985 he moved to Humana Hospitals in Canoga Park, California, and served as executive director there until 1988.
MOVING INTO UPPER MANAGEMENT
McCallister became the president of Humana Hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1988. During the following year, he was elected to serve as Humana's vice president for Humana Health Care Plans in Phoenix, where his job required him to integrate health care and hospital plans. McCallister was transferred to San Antonio, Texas, in 1992 to serve in the same capacity. Humana then spun off its hospital business in 1993 to form a new company known as Galen Health Care, Incorporated. After Humana left the hospital business, McCallister's position in San Antonio was concerned only with health care.
McCallister remained in San Antonio until 1996, when he was named president of the company's Division I, which included its operations in Texas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. In 1997 he became senior vice president for health systems management at the company's headquarters in Louisville. He held that position through 1999, when he was appointed Humana's senior vice president and office chairman, reporting directly to company chairman David A. Jones.
McCallister distinguished himself in the late 1990s. He oversaw Humana's large-group commercial, Medicare, Medic-aid, workers' compensation, and military health care businesses. He worked closely with David A. Jones, the company's chairman and interim chief executive officer, to develop a plan to improve the company's performance. Humana faced huge losses in 1999, and McCallister was largely responsible for putting its turnaround plan into action. Although the company expected to post overall losses, it also experienced significant gains in gross revenue. "Mike's role in producing these results was absolutely essential," Jones said of McCallister (February 3, 2000).
PRESIDENT AND CEO
Humana named McCallister as president and chief executive officer in 2000. "I look forward to working with my colleagues to continue building on the momentum we have established in the last several months [in 1999]," McCallister said when he took the helm (February 3, 2000). McCallister indicated that the company would focus on its core health insurance businesses and sell off its peripheral assets. McCallister's role as president and CEO began on a sour note, however, when he announced that the company had lost $382 million in 1999. Although the results were not unexpected, McCallister felt compelled to pledge that the company would return to profitability.
McCallister promoted several innovations that gained the attention of the healthcare community. In 2001 he introduced an all-digital health plan computer product called Emphesys, which was designed to transfer all medical provider transactions to the Internet and eliminate the use of paper. "We have a track record of being able to transform our company in a very large-scale way," McCallister said in 2001. "New technologies are providing us not just with information, but with actionable information. That's something this industry hasn't had in the past and it sets the stage for us to transform ourselves yet again" (Managed Healthcare Executive, November 1, 2001).
During the following year, McCallister unveiled a revolutionary consumer-driven healthcare plan. He recognized that managed care no longer provided cost savings; Humana's healthcare costs for its own employees had increased 19.2 percent in 2002 alone. The new consumer-driven plans allowed employees to make their own decisions about their healthcare plans, with employers contributing to each employee's tax-free personal account or allowance.


McCallister's strategies paid off for Humana, which experienced a 60-percent increase in profits in 2003. By 2004 Humana was ranked by Business Week as one of the top-performing companies in the United States.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
