WILLIAM C. MONTGOMERY, 55, joined the company’s board of directors in September 2011. He chairs the Management Development and Compensation Committee and is a member of the Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee.
From October 2002 to April 2011, Montgomery was a partner in the investment banking division of Goldman, Sachs & Co., where he headed the firm’s Americas Natural Resources Group as well as its Houston office and was a member of the Investment Banking Services Leadership Group. Over the span of 22 years as an investment banker, Montgomery focused globally on large cap energy companies, primarily in the upstream, integrated and oil service sectors.
Since July 2011, Montgomery has served as a managing director of Quantum Energy Partners, a private equity firm that focuses on investments in the energy and power industries. He is a member of Quantum Energy’s executive and investment committees. In October 2015, Montgomery was elected a director of Enterprise Products Holdings LLC, the general partner of Enterprise Products Partners L.P., and serves on its audit and conflicts committee.
Montgomery has been an active civic leader, chairing the boards of the Houston Museum of Natural Science and the St. Francis Episcopal Day School. He currently serves on the board of trustees of the Kinkaid School, the Episcopal Health Foundation, and the Board of Visitors of the MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Montgomery has spent almost his entire career working in the finance industry focusing on large-cap energy companies.
Formerly as an investment banker and now in private equity, Montgomery has gained significant experience with the energy industry and energy-related capital markets. The company also benefits from the extensive relationships that Montgomery has formed throughout his career serving various global energy companies. Montgomery’s contributions to the Board are aided by the knowledge and experience he gained from his current and former roles, which have involved broad and deep exposure to key issues impacting the upstream, midstream and oil services sectors.

We have tried cases against some of the largest institutions in the nation and state, obtaining multiple million dollar settlements and verdicts for our clients. While every case is different, we are equipped to represent your interests and hold these companies and salespersons accountable and to get you every dollar you deserve.
To learn more about how a lawyer can help following a violation of your consumer rights or an accident caused by the negligence of another, please contact our firm today by calling 267-838-9654 or toll free at 800-254-3497.
The firm handles all forms of

We are committed to fighting for those who have fallen victim to the calculated and deceptive practices of these bad businesses and corporations, as well as the negligence of others.
				
Philadelphia Consumer Law Attorney — Representation On Contingency Fee
The personal finances of many clients are tight, many times largely because of the fraud against them. Most cases we take are handled on a contingency fee basis, meaning we pay for the litigation expenses up front, and then collect our fee and expense reimbursement, if and when we make a recovery for you. If there is no recovery, then you do not owe the firm for time or expenses. We reserve the right to offer an alternative arrangement, especially in medical malpractice cases, depending on the circumstances.
