Once our ASE Certified technicians inspect your car, theyâ€™ll bring you into our bays, show you exactly what (if any) problems they found, explain what needs to be done, and make specific recommendations. You decide if and when you want the recommended work done.Brake Fluid ServiceBrake InspectionIf you experience any of these problems, it could be a sign that your car brakes need repair or replacement. Not only can neglecting your braking system lead to further damage and increased repair costs, it also jeopardizes the safety of you, your passengers, and everyone else on the road. The brake system is your vehicleâ€™s most important safety system, and in order to ensure that they are functioning properly, it is incredibly important to pay attention to potential warning signs and make any necessary repairs. Practicing preventive maintenance will save you a lot of money down the road on costly repairs that are easily avoidable by simply having routine replacements of your brake pads, brake rotors, and brake fluid. At VIP, you can rest assured that we have everything that you need to extend the lifespan of your car or truck. If youâ€™re experiencing problems with your brakes, or something just seems â€œoffâ€ , come in for a Free Brake Inspection and our qualified technicians will find the root of the problem and get you back on the road in no time.Brake RepairFor all of your brake repairs and replacements, VIP Tires and Service is the place to turn.

Only VIP offers Â low price guarantees on every brake system we install, so you can feel confident knowing that weâ€™ve got you covered! Call VIP today!Brake ReplacementAs with any other car part, brakes wear down over time and its components will require eventual replacement for performance and safety reasons. Brake pads are the most commonly replaced component of your brake system, as there are many variables, such as driving style and climate conditions, that can drastically shorten their lifespan. There are four types of brake pads currently available to drivers, and type of pad that you need depends on your vehicle and your driving habits. The four types are...Transmission and DrivetrainTransmission ServiceTransmission Fluid ServiceTransmission ReplacementSteering and SuspensionSuspension Service/RepairThe VIP Standard Alignment Warranty is for 3 months or 3,000 miles, whichever comes first.Â  During the warranty period, as often as necessary, VIP will inspect your steering and suspension system including tire condition and air pressure, put your vehicle on our alignment rack, perform proper rotation of tires, check the alignment, adjust alignment angles to manufacturer's specifications, verify alignment is within specification, and road test vehicle.Â  You are required to present your original Work Order along with the register receipt for verification.Â  The price does not include shims, cam bolts, and other specialty alignment parts and labor.Â Â  Applicable Taxes, Environmental Fees, and Shop Supplies will be charged.Steering Service/RepairDuring this time, VIP will inspect the steering and suspension system including tire condition and air pressure, put your vehicle on our alignment rack, perform proper rotation of tires if needed, check the alignment, adjust alignment angles to manufacturer's specifications, verify alignment is within specification, and road test vehicle as often as you like.Â  You are required to present your original Work Order along with the register receipt for verification.Â  The price does not include shims, cam bolts, and other specialty alignment parts and labor.Â  Applicable Taxes, Environmental Fees, and Shop Supplies will be charged.

By engaging with every customer and taking the time to educate them about their vehicle's needs, we're having fun while growing our customer base. But don't take it from us, check out the Customer Reviews for any of our locations on Google.

Sound interesting?ÂTowing ServiceAuto MaintenanceOur technicians will inform you of the current condition of your car, let you know what parts will need adjusting or replacing next, give you helpful car maintenance tips, and alert you if they notice anything that requires immediate attention. We understand that regular car preventative maintenance and repairs require both time and money, and we make every effort to make the process easier on you. We are open seven days a week, which gives you the freedom to come in when it is convenient forÂBelts and Hoses Service"Whether it's an oil change, replacing brakes or new belts and hoses, that periodic repair bill is a drop in the bucket compared to monthly payments on a new car," said Rich White, executive director of the Car Care Council. "The bottom line is that a properly maintained vehicle is safe, more dependable, more fuel efficient, less polluting and more valuable. The smartest way to get a solid return on investment is to keep your car through what we call the 'Cinderella Era.' It's that period of time after the payoff when your car is still in great shape and needs only modest repairs."TiresTire RotationIn achieving proper alignment you may also benefit from tire rotation. Here, the tires are moved to different locations of the car to achieve more even wear. Since our vehicles are very front-heavy (due to the location of the engine), our front tires have extra weight to contend with, including the pressure of braking. Since these tires take on the brunt of the work in our daily driving, rotation helps manage the tread wear, without repeated replacement of the front tires. VIP can certainly complete this tire rotation for you, and also give you the proper timeline to receive this maintenance on a regular basis.Tire RepairIf something seems to be wrong with your tires, your first instinct may be to replace them right away. Since frequent tire purchases can get expensive over time, it is important to understand your options when it comes to tire repair and service.Â  One common problem that people have with their tires is a puncture or tear after running over something sharp (like a nail) in the road. If the puncture is located in the tire tread and fixable, it is a good idea to see a professional. While tire plug kits are available, research has shown that many of these do-it-yourself repairs are done incorrectly and do not solve the problem, still leaving your tires and vehicle vulnerable to danger.Wheel AlignmentOnce you have your wheels, VIP can mount and balance them for you. Our ASE Certified technicians are trained to properly fit the wheels to the vehicle, using the right bolt pattern, center bore, offset, width, and the accurate load capacity according to the vehicle specifications. We offer wheel installation and proper four wheel alignment along with any other service you need for your vehicle seven days a week, even on Sundays.Tire ReplacementUnderstanding your tire tread is another critical component of tire maintenance.Â  When you are looking at a tire and see the thickly imprinted grooves, this is the tread. The tread is the only part of your vehicle that touches the road, and is responsible for wicking away elements like water and snow to help maintain a solid traction to the road surface. While you may not hear about tread that often, it is incredibly important to both the safety and performance of your vehicle. The law states that your tread must be at least 2/32nd of an inch or more. Are you in compliance with this?Â  To check your tire tread, use the â€œPenny Test.â€  Place a penny into a tread groove. If part of Lincolnâ€™s head is covered by the tread, you are driving with the proper amount of tread. You can also use a tread depth gauge, but make sure to use this instrument in several different spots (outside edges and center) of the tire since tires wear unevenly. However, sometimes the best way to get an accurate read on your tread health is to inspect the car for some visual signs. All tires, including passenger tires have tread wear indicators. If you see these indicators (often the letters â€œTWIâ€  and an arrow) have become flush with the tire tread, you are driving with an unsafe amount of tread and need a tire replacement. If your tread is worn, you run the risk of safety hazards like tire explosion. If you are looking for a solution, come to VIP. We can advise you if your tires can be fixed, or if they need to be replaced.Tire ServiceTire BalancingElectrical and ElectronicElectrical Service/RepairDid you know that after an accident, you should get the electrical system in your vehicle checked? Our VIP Master Tech, Alan Graves, who works out of our Lewiston location, thinks this one of the best pieces of advice he can pass on to his customers. â€œThe electrical system is an important eco-system that keeps your car running and functioning and is often ignored until something goes wrong,â€  says Alan.Lighting ServicesBattery ServiceChris does have some good news to offer if you think your vehicleâ€™s battery is on the fritz, or of you just want to have a better idea of its potential lifespan. Stop by your local VIP and a Master Tech can provide a free battery test and let you know if there is anything to concern yourself with. â€œRemember,â€  Chris says, â€œknowledge is power!â€Engine and Exhaust SystemOil ChangeAt VIP Tires and Service, we have everything that you need to keep your car running at peak performance for as long as it was built to last, and we take pride in making sure that your car is not only safe, but efficient as well. Our ASE Certified technicians understand the importance of preventive maintenance, and they are highly trained in spotting potential issues before they become bigger problems. If youâ€™re just coming in for an oil change, we always perform a detailed Multi-Point Vehicle Safety Inspection â€” free of charge.Engine Tune-UpExhaust System RepairStarter RepairAlternator RepairEngine DiagnosticEmissions InspectionTiming Belt/Chain ReplacementHe timing belt, therefore, is the critical link to ensure that these components don't collide. If collision occurs, damage to the valves, pistons, cylinder head and cylinder walls can result. This can be an expensive repair.Timing belts usually are protected from foreign objects by a cover, making visual inspection impossible.Many domestic vehicles built within the last several years and the majority of imports are equipped with a timing belt. Other engines rely on a timing chain rather than a belt. Refer to your owner's manual or take your car to a repair facility if you are unsure. The owner's manual maintenance schedule is a source of timing belt replacement intervals, typically every 60,000 to 90,000 miles.Timing belt replacement usually requires removal of the engine drive belt that operates the alternator, water pump, power steering pump and air conditioner. Consider replacing this belt, or multiple belts, when having a new timing belt installed.Muffler Repair and ReplacementEngine RepairIt is important to notice the difference in burning smells â€” is it an oil-like smell or sweet, like maple syrup, or is it like rotten eggs? The answer to this question gives your technician a place to start looking for the problem. If you answer sweet, like maple syrup, itâ€™s surely a coolant issue. This is a problem that should be remedied as soon as possible. While itâ€™s a likely a leak; itâ€™s a less expensive fix. If you let it go on too long, youâ€™re most likely going to end up with some serious (and expensive) engine repair or even replacement.Send to PhoneQuirk Edw S Co Inc275 Arsenal St, Watertown, MA 02472(617) 924-8700Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailQuirk Edw S Co Inc275 Arsenal St, Watertown, MA 02472(617) 924-8700Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend

Hesco, Inc. / Dakota Organic Products can provide you with a wide variety of products, including wheat, durum, barley, rye, oats, flax, amaranth, quinoa, spelt, triticale, corn, fibers and more. If you don't see it listed, please ask!

Most grains are processed in some manner by the time they reach the consumer. The first step is cleaning of the grains to remove foreign material, poor quality grain, etc. The grain can then be processed to remove the outer hull, yielding what is called a whole grain, berry, or groat. Whole grains are very nutritious and are sometimes further processed by removing the nutritious bran layer resulting in a pearled or polished grain. Whole and/or pearled grains are then sometimes ground, rolled, flaked, chopped into small grits, meals or flours.

Whole Grains (berries or groats): Grains that are either unprocessed or stripped only of their tough outer hulls. 
Pearled Grains: Grains that are more processed than whole grains and not only have the outer hull removed but also may have some of the bran removed as well. 
Cracked Grains: Whole grains that have been cracked into smaller pieces. 
Flakes (or rolled grains): Grains that are steamed, rolled or flaked. They can be cooked briefly to make cereal, or added to cookies, soups, granola, or other prepared foods. 
Meal: Whole grains that are ground until they have sand like consistency. They are then used to make things such as hot cereals, breads, etc. 
Bran: This is made from the outer husk of the grain and is a rich source of fiber. 
Germ: The exceptionally nutritious embryo found within the grain kernel. Due to the oily content it generally has a short shelf life. 
Flour: Grains that have been ground to a powdery consistency. They are used to make breads and other baked goods.

Our  Story






About Our Company




The Early Years
Chances are the year 1826 doesn’t strike a deep historical chord in most Americans. But to the people at the S.S.S. Company, it’s one of the most significant dates in history. For it was in 1826 that the mighty Creek Indians bequeathed a treasured remedy of theirs, now known as S.S.S. Tonic, to Captain Irwin Dennard of Perry, Georgia as a reward for having saved the life of one of their Chieftains. Captain Dennard sold the formula to Colonel Charles T. Swift who also lived in Perry, Georgia. Colonel Swift formed a partnership with Colonel H.J. Lamar of Macon, Georgia to bottle and sell the Tonic. In 1873, Colonel H.J. Lamar, foreseeing Atlanta as the Metropolis of the south, the manufacturer of S.S.S. Tonic was moved to Atlanta. According to the Companys’ History, the S.S.S. stood for Swift’s Southern Specific in the earlier years.





A Company Is Born
From this storybook-like beginning, The S.S.S. Company was born. Now it’s the oldest non-prescription drug manufacturer in the country. After operating for more than one hundred plus years with only one product, S.S.S. Tonic, the company became diversified. Today, S.S.S. Company and its’ wholly owned subsidiary, Pfeiffer Pharmaceuticals, Inc., markets over one hundred products. The company will continue to develop and promote new products to meet health care needs of people as their desires change.Much of the company’s growth can be attributed to an enduring family pride in the products...and what finer tribute could be paid to any company than it has contributed, literally, to the very life blood of America .
