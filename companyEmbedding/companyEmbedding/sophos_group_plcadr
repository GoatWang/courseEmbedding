    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Sophos was founded by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer and began producing its first antivirus and encryption products in 1985.[2] During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Sophos primarily developed and sold a range of security technologies in the UK, including encryption tools available for most users (private or business). In the late 1990s, Sophos concentrated its efforts on the development and sale of antivirus technology, and embarked on a program of international expansion.[3]
In 2003 Sophos acquired ActiveState, a North American software company that developed anti-spam software. At that time viruses were being spread primarily through email spam and this allowed Sophos to produce a combined anti-spam and antivirus solution.[4] In 2006, Peter Gyenes and Steve Munford were named chairman and CEO of Sophos respectively. Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer remain as members of the board of directors.[5] In 2010, the majority interest of Sophos was sold to Apax.[6] In 2010, Nick Bray, formerly Group CFO at Micro Focus International, was named CFO of Sophos.[7]
In 2011, Utimaco Safeware AG (acquired by Sophos in 2008-9) were accused of supplying data monitoring and tracking software to partners that have sold to governments such as Syria. Sophos issued a statement of apology and confirmed that they had suspended their relationship with the partners in question and launched an investigation.[8][9] In 2012, Kris Hagerman, formerly CEO at Corel Corporation, was named CEO of Sophos and joined the company's board. Former CEO Steve Munford became non-executive chairman of the board.[10] In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a provider of network security products. [11] In June 2015, Sophos announced plans to raise $US100 million on the London Stock Exchange.[12]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
From September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial.[13] In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, US which developed and sold security policy compliance and Network Access Control (NAC) software.[14]
In July 2008, Sophos announced its intention to acquire Utimaco Safeware AG.[15] In July 2009, Sophos completed integration of Utimaco Safeware AG.[16] In May 2010, Sophos reached a definitive agreement to sell a majority interest in the company to Apax Partners, a global private equity group.[6]
In May 2011, Sophos announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Astaro, a privately held provider of network security solutions, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts (US) and Karlsruhe, Germany.[17] In 2012, Sophos acquired what remained of VirusBuster – a Hungarian antivirus firm – after the company had closed.[18] In April 2012, Sophos acquired DIALOGS, a privately held provider of mobile management solutions, headquartered in Germany.[19]
In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a leading global provider of network security products.[20] In October 2014, Sophos acquired Mojave Networks, a leading cloud based security startup.[21] On December 14, 2015, Sophos acquired SurfRight, a small Dutch company behind HitmanPro to strengthen their endpoint protection products.[22] In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.[23][24][25]

Gartner Magic Quadrant for Endpoint Protection Platforms "Sophos is a leader"

Next-Gen Protection
We’re taking a new approach to protection. Sophos Endpoint blocks malware and infections by identifying and preventing the handful of techniques and behaviors used in almost every exploit.
Sophos Endpoint doesn’t rely on signatures to catch malware, which means it catches zero-day threats without adversely affecting the performance of your device. So you get protection before those exploits even arrive.




 
 


By correlating threat indicators, Sophos Endpoint can block web and application exploits, dangerous URLs, potentially unwanted apps, and malicious code from ever touching your endpoints.
 





Decloaking Malware
Sophos Endpoint works on the device and in conjunction with the firewall to detect and isolate compromised devices.  Synchronized Security gives you additional context providing information from the network.

 


Behavioral Analytics
Determines suspicious behaviors, allowing for the detection of malware specifically designed to evade traditional solutions.
Traffic Detection
Pre-filters all HTTP traffic and tracks suspicious traffic as well as the file path of the process sending malicious traffic.
Integrated Endpoint and Network
Instant and automatic communication between the Endpoint and Network alerts the suspected system of exactly what the firewall is detecting, allowing the endpoint protection agent immediate use of that information to discover the process behind the threat.



Is Your Protection Catching Everything?
Make sure your security hasn't overlooked a virus or missed an attack. With Sophos Clean you can do an additional scan, find security breaches, and get rid of them.

So Long Malware
Remove detected malware automatically or isolate compromised devices in order to prevent damage.
 



Isolate
Part of remediating a problem is putting it in quarantine so it can’t keep spreading. When necessary, we’ll even isolate compromised devices until we can be sure they’re safe.





Threat Removal
If we find something malicious, we’ll go ahead and remove it for you. It’s the least we could do. We make it simple and automatic.





Synchronized Security
By automating threat discovery, investigation, and response, Synchronized Security revolutionizes threat detection. Incident response times are reduced exponentially and tactical resources can be refocused on strategic analysis.





Complete Control
Enforce your web, application, device, and data policies with ease, thanks to seamless integration within the endpoint agent and the management console.

Web Control Category-based web filtering enforced both on and off the corporate network
Application Control Point-and-click blocking of applications by category or by name
Device Control Managed access to removable media and mobile devices
Data Control Data-loss prevention (DLP) using prebuilt or custom rules



Sophisticated Simplicity
Like your favorite smartphone or web application, Sophos Endpoint Protection delivers sophisticated functionality coupled with a simple, intuitive user experience.

Quick and easy deployment from the cloud or on-premises
Default policies configured to balance protection, usability, and performance
Automatic removal of third-party endpoint security products
Point-and-click configuration of advanced features like HIPS and device control, made possible by continually updated data from SophosLabs




Flexible Licensing and Deployment
Both of our deployment options deliver outstanding performance and protection, and are licensed per user, not device.
 


Sophos Central
Sophos Central is our unified web console with policies that follow users across devices and platforms.



Sophos Enterprise Console
Our on-premises management platform gives you granular control with role-based administration and an SQL-based reporting interface.

History[edit]
Sophos was founded by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer and began producing its first antivirus and encryption products in 1985.[2] During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Sophos primarily developed and sold a range of security technologies in the UK, including encryption tools available for most users (private or business). In the late 1990s, Sophos concentrated its efforts on the development and sale of antivirus technology, and embarked on a program of international expansion.[3]
In 2003 Sophos acquired ActiveState, a North American software company that developed anti-spam software. At that time viruses were being spread primarily through email spam and this allowed Sophos to produce a combined anti-spam and antivirus solution.[4] In 2006, Peter Gyenes and Steve Munford were named chairman and CEO of Sophos respectively. Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer remain as members of the board of directors.[5] In 2010, the majority interest of Sophos was sold to Apax.[6] In 2010, Nick Bray, formerly Group CFO at Micro Focus International, was named CFO of Sophos.[7]
In 2011, Utimaco Safeware AG (acquired by Sophos in 2008-9) were accused of supplying data monitoring and tracking software to partners that have sold to governments such as Syria. Sophos issued a statement of apology and confirmed that they had suspended their relationship with the partners in question and launched an investigation.[8][9] In 2012, Kris Hagerman, formerly CEO at Corel Corporation, was named CEO of Sophos and joined the company's board. Former CEO Steve Munford became non-executive chairman of the board.[10] In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a provider of network security products. [11] In June 2015, Sophos announced plans to raise $US100 million on the London Stock Exchange.[12]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
From September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial.[13] In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, US which developed and sold security policy compliance and Network Access Control (NAC) software.[14]
In July 2008, Sophos announced its intention to acquire Utimaco Safeware AG.[15] In July 2009, Sophos completed integration of Utimaco Safeware AG.[16] In May 2010, Sophos reached a definitive agreement to sell a majority interest in the company to Apax Partners, a global private equity group.[6]
In May 2011, Sophos announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Astaro, a privately held provider of network security solutions, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts (US) and Karlsruhe, Germany.[17] In 2012, Sophos acquired what remained of VirusBuster – a Hungarian antivirus firm – after the company had closed.[18] In April 2012, Sophos acquired DIALOGS, a privately held provider of mobile management solutions, headquartered in Germany.[19]
In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a leading global provider of network security products.[20] In October 2014, Sophos acquired Mojave Networks, a leading cloud based security startup.[21] On December 14, 2015, Sophos acquired SurfRight, a small Dutch company behind HitmanPro to strengthen their endpoint protection products.[22] In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.[23][24][25]

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

History[edit]
Sophos was founded by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer and began producing its first antivirus and encryption products in 1985.[2] During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Sophos primarily developed and sold a range of security technologies in the UK, including encryption tools available for most users (private or business). In the late 1990s, Sophos concentrated its efforts on the development and sale of antivirus technology, and embarked on a program of international expansion.[3]
In 2003 Sophos acquired ActiveState, a North American software company that developed anti-spam software. At that time viruses were being spread primarily through email spam and this allowed Sophos to produce a combined anti-spam and antivirus solution.[4] In 2006, Peter Gyenes and Steve Munford were named chairman and CEO of Sophos respectively. Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer remain as members of the board of directors.[5] In 2010, the majority interest of Sophos was sold to Apax.[6] In 2010, Nick Bray, formerly Group CFO at Micro Focus International, was named CFO of Sophos.[7]
In 2011, Utimaco Safeware AG (acquired by Sophos in 2008-9) were accused of supplying data monitoring and tracking software to partners that have sold to governments such as Syria. Sophos issued a statement of apology and confirmed that they had suspended their relationship with the partners in question and launched an investigation.[8][9] In 2012, Kris Hagerman, formerly CEO at Corel Corporation, was named CEO of Sophos and joined the company's board. Former CEO Steve Munford became non-executive chairman of the board.[10] In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a provider of network security products. [11] In June 2015, Sophos announced plans to raise $US100 million on the London Stock Exchange.[12]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
From September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial.[13] In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, US which developed and sold security policy compliance and Network Access Control (NAC) software.[14]
In July 2008, Sophos announced its intention to acquire Utimaco Safeware AG.[15] In July 2009, Sophos completed integration of Utimaco Safeware AG.[16] In May 2010, Sophos reached a definitive agreement to sell a majority interest in the company to Apax Partners, a global private equity group.[6]
In May 2011, Sophos announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Astaro, a privately held provider of network security solutions, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts (US) and Karlsruhe, Germany.[17] In 2012, Sophos acquired what remained of VirusBuster – a Hungarian antivirus firm – after the company had closed.[18] In April 2012, Sophos acquired DIALOGS, a privately held provider of mobile management solutions, headquartered in Germany.[19]
In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a leading global provider of network security products.[20] In October 2014, Sophos acquired Mojave Networks, a leading cloud based security startup.[21] On December 14, 2015, Sophos acquired SurfRight, a small Dutch company behind HitmanPro to strengthen their endpoint protection products.[22] In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.[23][24][25]

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

Put your money where your mindset is

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

History[edit]
Sophos was founded by Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer and began producing its first antivirus and encryption products in 1985.[2] During the late 1980s and into the 1990s, Sophos primarily developed and sold a range of security technologies in the UK, including encryption tools available for most users (private or business). In the late 1990s, Sophos concentrated its efforts on the development and sale of antivirus technology, and embarked on a program of international expansion.[3]
In 2003 Sophos acquired ActiveState, a North American software company that developed anti-spam software. At that time viruses were being spread primarily through email spam and this allowed Sophos to produce a combined anti-spam and antivirus solution.[4] In 2006, Peter Gyenes and Steve Munford were named chairman and CEO of Sophos respectively. Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer remain as members of the board of directors.[5] In 2010, the majority interest of Sophos was sold to Apax.[6] In 2010, Nick Bray, formerly Group CFO at Micro Focus International, was named CFO of Sophos.[7]
In 2011, Utimaco Safeware AG (acquired by Sophos in 2008-9) were accused of supplying data monitoring and tracking software to partners that have sold to governments such as Syria. Sophos issued a statement of apology and confirmed that they had suspended their relationship with the partners in question and launched an investigation.[8][9] In 2012, Kris Hagerman, formerly CEO at Corel Corporation, was named CEO of Sophos and joined the company's board. Former CEO Steve Munford became non-executive chairman of the board.[10] In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a provider of network security products. [11] In June 2015, Sophos announced plans to raise $US100 million on the London Stock Exchange.[12]
Acquisitions and partnerships[edit]
From September 2003 to February 2006, Sophos served as the parent company of ActiveState, a developer of programming tools for dynamic programming languages: in February 2006, ActiveState became an independent company when it was sold to Vancouver-based venture capitalist firm Pender Financial.[13] In 2007, Sophos acquired ENDFORCE, a company based in Ohio, US which developed and sold security policy compliance and Network Access Control (NAC) software.[14]
In July 2008, Sophos announced its intention to acquire Utimaco Safeware AG.[15] In July 2009, Sophos completed integration of Utimaco Safeware AG.[16] In May 2010, Sophos reached a definitive agreement to sell a majority interest in the company to Apax Partners, a global private equity group.[6]
In May 2011, Sophos announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire Astaro, a privately held provider of network security solutions, headquartered in Wilmington, Massachusetts (US) and Karlsruhe, Germany.[17] In 2012, Sophos acquired what remained of VirusBuster – a Hungarian antivirus firm – after the company had closed.[18] In April 2012, Sophos acquired DIALOGS, a privately held provider of mobile management solutions, headquartered in Germany.[19]
In February 2014, Sophos announced that it had acquired Cyberoam Technologies, a leading global provider of network security products.[20] In October 2014, Sophos acquired Mojave Networks, a leading cloud based security startup.[21] On December 14, 2015, Sophos acquired SurfRight, a small Dutch company behind HitmanPro to strengthen their endpoint protection products.[22] In February 2017, Sophos acquired Invincea, a software company that provides malware threat detection, prevention, and pre-breach forensic intelligence.[23][24][25]

                        Our Story
                    
We began producing antivirus and encryption products nearly 30 years ago. Today our products help secure the networks used by 100 million people in 150 countries and 100,000 businesses, including Pixar, Under Armour, Xerox, Ford, Avis, and Toshiba.
As IT networks grow in complexity, we’re focused on keeping IT security simple and reliable. We know that a proper security strategy must include networks, servers and devices—all devices—managed easily through the cloud. 













                    Products that work
                
Our products allow you to secure every end point of your network, from laptops to virtual desktops and servers, to web and email traffic and mobile devices. What’s more, securing these devices is made possible through products that fit your precise needs. We ensure your network’s security by providing the one thing no one else can: Simplicity. 
 






                        (Real) help is there when you need it
                    
Our support staff is independently audited and approved by SCP (Service Capability & Performance Support Standard). Our follow-the-sun support operations (UK, U.S., Australia) provide 24/7 English-only support. Additional support offices in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Japan and the Philippines means you can also speak to a support technician who speaks your language.

                        Our Story
                    
We began producing antivirus and encryption products nearly 30 years ago. Today our products help secure the networks used by 100 million people in 150 countries and 100,000 businesses, including Pixar, Under Armour, Xerox, Ford, Avis, and Toshiba.
As IT networks grow in complexity, we’re focused on keeping IT security simple and reliable. We know that a proper security strategy must include networks, servers and devices—all devices—managed easily through the cloud. 













                    Products that work
                
Our products allow you to secure every end point of your network, from laptops to virtual desktops and servers, to web and email traffic and mobile devices. What’s more, securing these devices is made possible through products that fit your precise needs. We ensure your network’s security by providing the one thing no one else can: Simplicity. 
 






                        (Real) help is there when you need it
                    
Our support staff is independently audited and approved by SCP (Service Capability & Performance Support Standard). Our follow-the-sun support operations (UK, U.S., Australia) provide 24/7 English-only support. Additional support offices in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Japan and the Philippines means you can also speak to a support technician who speaks your language.
