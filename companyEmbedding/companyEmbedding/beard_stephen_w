If You Grow, You Know… The hair on your head is different than the hair on your face. Facial hair has special needs that aren’t met with your run of the mill hair shampoo. High West Beard Beard Shampoo is specially formulated to meet these needs. We’ve developed our Beard Shampoo to be strong enough to cleanse your beard of the previous day’s mayhem, but gentle enough to help you maintain your man mane without damaging or stripping it of the moisture and nutrients your beard needs!
