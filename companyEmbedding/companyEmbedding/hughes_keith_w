Former Citigroup Executive Keith W. Hughes Joins Carreker Corporation Board of Directors






July 22, 2003 05:05 PM Eastern Daylight Time

About Keith and Cherie Hughes















































 


  
 
Keith and Cherie Hughes pursued a shared vision in 2001 with the purchase of two young organic vineyards in Glen Ellen, California.   Initially, their intention was to grow exceptional fruit, a goal that evolved into making superb wines that reflect the unique terroir of their land.
					Before coming to the Sonoma Valley, Keith and Cherie made their home and pursued individual careers in Dallas, Texas.  Keith was Chairman and CEO of Associates First Capital.  A Ph.D. clinical psychologist, Cherie worked with children, adolescents and their families in her private practice and also acted as a consultant to schools, developing a school violence prevention program.
					Today, Cherie and Keith work together to manage Hughes Family Vineyards.  "It is extremely important to us," says Cherie "to be involved every step of the way - from the flowering of buds in the spring, to harvest in the fall, to enjoying our great wines with our friends and family."
