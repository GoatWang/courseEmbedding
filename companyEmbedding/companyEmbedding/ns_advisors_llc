Item 1.

Security and Issuer






This Schedule 13D relates to the common stock, $0.01 par value (the “Common Stock”), of Wheeler Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “Issuer”).  The address of the principal executive offices of the Issuer is 2529 Virginia Beach Blvd., Suite 200, Virginia Beach, Virginia 23452.
 



Item 2.

Identity and Background









(a)

This initial Schedule 13D is being filed jointly by (1) NS Advisors, LLC, a Connecticut limited liability company (“NS Advisors”); and (2) Andrew R. Jones, the managing partner of NS Advisors (collectively, the “Reporting Persons”).  The joint filing agreement of the Reporting Persons is attached as Exhibit 99.1 to this initial Schedule 13D.




 



(b)

The principal business address of the Reporting Persons is 274 Riverside Avenue, Westport, Connecticut  06880.




 



(c)

The principal business of NS Advisors is to serve as an investment manager or adviser to various investment partnerships, funds and managed accounts (collectively, the “Clients”).  The principal occupation of Mr. Jones is investment management through his ownership and control over the affairs of NS Advisors.  NS Advisors has voting and dispositive power over the Common Stock held by the Clients.




 



(d)

During the last five years, none of the Reporting Persons has been convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).




 



(e)

During the last five years, none of the Reporting Persons has been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and, as a result of such proceeding, was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violation with respect to such laws.




 



(f)

Mr. Jones is a citizen of the United States of America.




 



Item 3.

Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration






In aggregate, the Reporting Persons have voting and dispositive power over 463,079 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer at an aggregate cost of $5,533,550.06.
 
This includes: (1) 452,833 shares of Common Stock held on behalf of the Clients, acquired at an aggregate cost of $5,398,657.64 using the Clients’ available working capital; and (2) 10,246 shares of Common Stock owned by Mr. Jones through his IRA for a total cost of $134,892.42, acquired using the IRA’s available capital.
 
NS Advisors does not own any Common Stock directly but is deemed to beneficially own Common Stock purchased on behalf of the Clients.  NS Advisors disclaims beneficial ownership of such Common Stock, except to the extent of its pecuniary interest therein.
 












CUSIP No. 963025101


Page 5 of 8 Pages











 
From time to time, the Reporting Persons may purchase Common Stock on margin provided by banking institutions or brokerage firms on such firms’ usual terms and conditions.  All or part of the shares of Common Stock held by the Reporting Persons may from time to time be pledged with one or more banking institutions or brokerage firms as collateral for loans made by such entities.  Such loans, if any, generally bear interest at a rate based upon the federal funds rate plus a margin.  Such indebtedness, if any, may be refinanced with other banks or broker-dealers.  As of the date of this filing, none of the Reporting Persons have loans secured by Common Stock.
 



Item 4.

Purpose of Transaction






This is the Reporting Persons’ initial Schedule 13D filing.  In the aggregate, the Reporting Persons hold 5.4% of the Issuer’s Common Stock, based upon the Issuer’s outstanding shares as of May 1, 2017.
 
Recently, the Reporting Persons have become concerned about the Issuer’s current trading price.  It is the Reporting Persons’ intent to engage in a dialogue with the management and the board of directors of the Issuer to address these concerns and questions.
 
Mr. Jones, the managing partner of NS Advisors, sent a letter dated July 20, 2017, to Mr. Jon S. Wheeler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer addressing, among other things, ways in which it believes shareholder value may be maximized.  A copy of the letter is attached as Exhibit 99.2 to this Schedule 13D.
 
Unless otherwise noted in this Schedule 13D, no Reporting Person has any plans or proposals which relate to, or would result in, any of the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) through (j), inclusive, of the instructions to Item 4 of Schedule 13D.  The Reporting Persons may, at any time and from time to time, review or reconsider their positions and formulate plans or proposals with respect thereto.  The Reporting Persons may make further purchases of shares of Common Stock, although they have no present intention of increasing their aggregate holdings above 9.999% of the Issuer’s outstanding Common Stock.  The Reporting Persons may dispose of any or all the shares of Common Stock which they hold.
 



Item 5.

Interest in Securities of the Issuer






(a) - (b) As of the date of this Schedule 13D, the Reporting Persons held in the aggregate 463,079 shares of Common Stock of the Issuer, which represents 5.4% of the outstanding Common Stock.
 
This includes (1) 452,833 shares of Common Stock owned by the Clients, which represents 5.3% of the outstanding Common Stock; and (2) 10,246 shares of Common Stock owned by Mr. Jones through his IRA, which represents <0.1% of the outstanding Common Stock.
 
The percentages used in this Schedule 13D are calculated based upon 8,616,247 outstanding shares of Common Stock as of May 1, 2017.  This amount is based upon the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock reported as of May 1, 2017, in the Issuer’s quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed on May 2, 2017.
 












CUSIP No. 963025101


Page 6 of 8 Pages











 
Each of the Reporting Persons shares voting and dispositive power over the shares of Common Stock held by the Clients.
 


(c)            Set forth below are all of the transactions in the Common Stock effected by NS Advisors on behalf of the Clients during the past 60 days:

Because Mr. Jones is the managing partner of NS Advisors, he is deemed to share the voting and disposition of shares of Common Stock held by NS Advisors on behalf of the Clients.
 
Mr. Jones did not effect any transactions in the Common Stock directly in his name during the past 60 days.
 
(d)            No person other than the Reporting Persons is known to have the right to receive, or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the Common Stock.
 
(e)            Not applicable.
 



Item 6.

Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect to Securities of the Issuer






NS Advisors is the investment manager on behalf of the Clients.  Each of the Clients has granted NS Advisors the sole and exclusive authority to vote and dispose of the shares of Common Stock held on their behalf pursuant to a management agreement.  NS Advisors is entitled to a fee for managing and advising these Clients, generally based upon a percentage of the Clients’ capital.  NS Advisors serves as general partner of various partnerships, including North Star Partners, L.P.  For serving as the general partner of these partnerships, NS Advisors is entitled to an allocation of a portion of net profits, if any, generated by the partnerships.
 
Other than the foregoing arrangements and relationships, and the Joint Filing Agreement filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this initial Schedule 13D, there are no contracts, arrangements, understandings or relationships among the persons named in Item 2 hereof and between such persons and any person with respect to any securities of the Issuer.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
