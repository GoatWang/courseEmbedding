"Smile and Deliver" informs on the finer points of effective speaking, of how to calm nerves, banish stage fright and to speak with ease and eloquence at any occasion.

About the Author...
Robert G. Phillips was born in India in 1932. As a young man he settled in Scotland and worked as a marine engineer in Glasgow. Later he was employed as an industrial engineer in Aberdeen.  For the twelve years leading up to his retirement, he worked at the Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen as an applications engineer. He retired at the age of sixty-five.

Below you can find some of the articles, currently just placeholders but soon good stories...

Overcoming the Fear
Monday 25 July 2016
A dear friend asked me how after a long career as an engineer I had taken up writing. The story begins many years ago when I was asked to be the Best Man to one of my closest friends.  In preparation for the Best Man’s speech I wrote what I thought would inform and entertain the guests at the wedding reception.  The wedding day arrived.  I was nervous. The Father of the Bride introduced me, “The Best Man will now say a few words.” I stood up, spoke for a few seconds and then lost the ability to say another...[read more]


The Adventurous Seagull
Wednesday 17 August 2016
It was a lovely summers evening, 6.30pm to be exact.  The sun was still shining - an uncommon sight in the City of Aberdeen. My wife, Isabel and myself decided to go for a walk along the beach, taking full advantage of the sun that continued to happily shine down on us. But there was something that caught our eye and stopped us in our tracks. After walking for a while we stopped to take a rest. We found the perfect bench overlooking Aberdeen harbour. The view was great.  All was peaceful until we spotted a small seagull fast asleep...[read more]


My Wife Isabel 
Tuesday 23 August 2016
In the true words of James Brown, “This is a man’s world. But it wouldn’t be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl.” I have enjoyed a long career as an engineer.  In retirement, I turned my hand to writing. Isabel has been extremely supportive with my new hobby. We met 36 years ago in Queens Cross Church. It was during Christian greetings that we spoke for the first time. This is where our journey together began. Isabel is a shy lady, so you can appreciate us getting together wasn’t the easiest task in the world. It wasn’t till...[read more]


That One Email 
Thursday 08 September 2016
It was just a normal Monday morning. Got up, got dressed and had breakfast. Later in the day if you ask me what I had for breakfast, I would have to guess and say porridge. You see my memory isn’t as good as it used to be. However I’m usually right because porridge is what my mother gave each morning when I was a child. ‘ it’s good for you ‘ she would say. I never doubted her, and to this day my breakfast has never varied. It reached lunchtime and all of a sudden my normal Monday morning didn’t...[read more]


My Career Shows No Sign of Stopping
Monday 03 October 2016
Now in the evening of my life, I look back over 85 years and realise that I have been a lucky chap Over these many years I have had, in equal measure, good and not so good times.  On reminiscing, the good times always seem to rise above the not so good times. My family and friends know I enjoy listening to, and telling stories.  Like when I left boarding school in India and went in search of an apprenticeship in Calcutta.  There were many engineering factories in the city. My preference was ships, so I applied to Port Engineering...[read more]
