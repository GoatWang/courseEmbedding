White Glove Shipping
Appropriate for large or fragile items.

      Costs range from $100 for smaller items delivered locally to $1,000+ for extra large
      items transported across the Continental United States. Final cost depends on the size of the items and the
      buyer's location.
    

      Local deliveries typically take about 2 weeks and longer
      distance deliveries typically take about 3-6 weeks.
    
Flat Rate Shipping

      Shipment through recognized carriers such as UPS, FedEx, and USPS. Appropriate for smaller items, most
      accessories and some small furniture.
    

      Costs range from $9 to $299 and up, depending on the size and weight of the item.
    
Delivery is typically 7-10 days
Local Pickup

      Local pickup allows a buyer to avoid shipping costs by picking up an item in person. The buyer must contact the
      seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a pickup date and time. Delays may result in
      additional charges.
    
Local Delivery

      As a lower cost alternative, some of our sellers offer local curbside delivery within a limited geography around
      their location. The buyer must contact the seller within five business days of their purchase to coordinate a
      delivery date and time. Delays may result in additional charges.
    

      If additional labor is required to move the item inside or upstairs, buyers should make sure to plan accordingly.
    




Returns & Cancellations

        Except for Local Pickup and Local Delivery, buyers have 48 hours after delivery to inspect
        their item(s) and contact support@chairish.com if they wish
        to return an item. There are no restocking fees, but we deduct outbound and return shipping charges from the
        buyer's original purchase price (+ taxes when applicable). Buyers may not be reimbursed for returns that are not
        received in original condition.

PLANNING GUIDE: All 74 Fundable Companies of Innovation Showcase

 

Joshua Hall
July 8, 2015
Community, Events, Funding, Startup


The organizers of The Innovation Showcase — the largest entrepreneurial showcase in Indiana and possibly the Midwest — have released the full list of 74 fundable companies that will be pitching for $72,000 in cash investment and services.
These companies are among a select group of startups that made the cut to pitch and exhibit at this year’s Innovation Showcase, which is being held at the Dallara Indycar Factory on the west side of Greater Indianapolis in the town of Speedway on July 9.

That’s not all, you’ll also get actionable insights from some of the most successful entrepreneurs and investors in the country, including:

Chris Heivly, co-founder of MapQuest (sold to AOL for $1.1 billion) and The Startup Factory accelerator based in Durham, North Carolina
Chris Baggott, co-founder of ExactTarget (sold for $2.5 billion to Salesforce) Compendium (sold to Oracle) and several new food ventures
Investors from Drive Capital, Venture Club, and VisionTech-Partners to name a few.

More than 1,000 people are expected to attend Innovation Showcase this year and there are only a limited number of tickets left.

If you want to make the most out of attending an event like Innovation Showcase, you should plan ahead, know who’s exhibiting, and figure out who you want to meet with in advance. Here is more information and direct links to the 2015 exhibitors:

The pinnacle of interior design is the carefully curated “vignette”. A hodgepodge of seemingly random objects placed on a table, console or mantel does the yeoman's share of taking a room from dull and drab to chic and sophisticated. Add a vintage book, a tiny obelisk (now’s not the time to be a minimalist), and whatever suits your fancy!
