		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risks, including the possible loss of principal. Investments in MLP securities are subject to unique risks. The Fund's concentration of investments in energy related MLPs subject it to the risks of MLPs and the energy sector, including the risks of declines in energy and commodity prices, decreases in energy demand, adverse weather conditions, natural or other disasters, changes in government regulation, and changes in tax laws. 
 MLP cash distributions are generally tax deferred. Non-cash expenses, such as depreciation or depletion, usually offset income derived from an MLP's operations. To the extent that these expenses exceed income, cash distributions are considered return of capital under tax law. As such, they are not taxed when received. Instead, the distribution, in the form of return of capital, reduces a unit holder's cost basis. This adjusted cost basis, in turn, results in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when the units are sold. Of course, there can be no assurances that distributions from an MLP will be tax deferred. The Fund will be treated as a regular corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, as a result, unlike most investment companies, is subject to corporate income tax to the extent the Fund recognizes taxable income. Any taxes paid by the Fund will reduce the amount available to pay distributions to investors, and therefore investors in the Fund will likely receive lower distributions than if they invested directly in MLPs. 
 
Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.

Leverage may result in greater volatility of NAV and market price of the fund's common shares, increasing a shareholder's risk of loss. Investments in small-cap or illiquid securities can increase the risk and volatility of the Fund. The Fund may make significant investments in derivative instruments. Derivative instruments can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Legg Mason, Inc., its affiliates and its employees are not in the business of providing tax or legal advice to taxpayers. These materials and any tax-related statements are not intended or written to be used, and cannot be used or relied upon, by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties. Tax-related statements, if any, may have been written in connection with the “promotion or marketing” of the transaction(s) or matter(s) addressed by these materials, to the extent allowed by applicable law. Any taxpayer should seek advice based on the taxpayer’s particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when sold, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns based on Market Price or NAV, and assume the reinvestment of all distributions at the Dividend Reinvestment Plan Price or NAV, respectively. All returns include the deduction of management fees, operating expenses and all other fund expenses, and do not reflect the deduction of brokerage commissions or taxes that investors may pay on distributions or the sale of shares. Returns for periods of less than one year are not annualized.

 Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding.

 Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. The Market Price may differ from a fund’s NAV.
*Distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV. As of 05/31/2017, the fund estimates that the distributions will be paid from: 100.00% investment income;0.00% realized capital gains; and, 0.00% return of capital. The Distribution Rate is subject to change and is not a quotation of Fund performance. The Board of Directors may terminate or suspend the managed distribution policy at any time. Any such termination or suspension could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Fund's shares. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment. For more information about a distribution's composition refer to the Fund's distribution press release or, if applicable, the Section 19 notice located in the Press Releases section below.



























A NOTE ABOUT FEES & EXPENSES: Based on the Fund’s net assets of the common shares, as of the most recent Annual Report.
Management fees: Under the investment management agreement, the Fund pays an annual fee, paid monthly, as a portion of the Fund's average daily Managed Assets. “Managed Assets” are defined as net assets plus the amount of any borrowing, including loans from certain financial institutions and/or the issuance of debt securities (collectively, “Borrowings”), and assets attributable to any preferred stock (“Preferred Stock”) that may be outstanding. Please see the fund’s Annual Report for more information on expenses.


Income Tax Expense: Includes deferred income taxes which reflect (i) taxes on unrealized gains (losses), which are attributable to temporary difference between fair market value and tax basis, (ii) the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and (iii) the net tax benefit of accumulated net operating capital losses. To the extent the Fund has a deferred tax asset, consideration is given as to whether a valuation allowance is required. See the fund’s Annual Report for information on taxes.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS INFORMATION: Portfolio characteristics and holdings are subject to change at any time. Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.
The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded. 

Percentages are based on total portfolio as of quarter-end and are subject to change at any time. For informational purposes only and not to be considered a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.

 Distributions 






Distributions









IMPORTANT DISTRIBUTION INFORMATION: Distributions paid by the Fund may be comprised of income, capital gains, and/or return of capital. At year-end the Fund will issue a Form 1099 with the final composition of the distribution for tax purposes. A current estimate of the distribution's composition can be found in the performance section on this page or in the most recent distribution press release and/or Section 19 notice located in the press release section below. The Distribution Rate is not guaranteed, subject to change, and is not a quotation of Fund performance. A return of capital is not taxable and results in a reduction in the tax basis of a shareholder's investment.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks associated with hedge funds, alternative investments and other risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
The Closed-End Funds are not sold or distributed by Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC ("LMIS") or any affiliate of Legg Mason, Inc. Unlike open-end funds, shares are not continually offered. Like other public companies, closed-end funds have a one-time initial public offering, and once their shares are first issued, are generally bought and sold through non-affiliated broker/dealers and trade on nationally recognized stock exchanges. Share prices will fluctuate with market conditions and, at the time of sale, may be worth more or less than your original investment. Shares of exchange-traded closed-end funds may trade at a discount or premium to their original offering price, and often trade at a discount to their net asset value. Net Asset Value (NAV) is total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding. Market Price, determined by supply and demand, is the price an investor purchases or sells the fund. Investment return, market price and net asset value will fluctuate with changes in market conditions. The Funds are subject to investment risks, including the possible loss of principal invested.

ClearBridge American Energy MLP Fund Inc. Portfolio Composition as of December 31, 2016
BY Business Wire — 5:30 PM ET 01/30/2017

 NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      ClearBridge American Energy MLP Fund Inc. (CBA) announces its
      portfolio composition as of December 31, 2016.
    

Investment Objective: The Fund seeks to provide a high level of
      total return, with an equal emphasis on current distributions and
      capital appreciation.
    

Investment Strategy: The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by
      investing primarily in US-based master limited partnerships (“MLPs”) in
      the energy sector. Initially, the Fund intends to focus its investments
      on MLPs that, in the Fund’s opinion, are poised to benefit from the
      growing production and usage of natural gas, while minimizing exposure
      to commodity price fluctuations. Energy entities are engaged in the
      business of exploring, developing, producing, gathering, transporting,
      processing, storing, refining, distributing, mining or marketing natural
      gas, natural gas liquids (including propane), crude oil, refined
      petroleum products or coal.

          Portfolio holdings and weightings are historical and are presented
          here for informational purposes only. They are subject to change at
          any time.
        



          **
        



          The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due
          primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings and other liabilities; net
          assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in
          the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements
          and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that
          have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the
          Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be
          compounded.
        



          ***
        



          Percentages are based on total assets.
        







           
        



      ClearBridge American Energy MLP Fund Inc. (CBA) is a non-diversified,
      closed-end management investment company which is advised by Legg Mason
      Partners Fund Advisor, LLC (“LMPFA”) and subadvised by ClearBridge
      Investments, LLC (“ClearBridge”). LMPFA and ClearBridge are wholly owned
      subsidiaries of Legg Mason, Inc.
    

      An investment in the Fund involves risk, including loss of principal.
      The Fund's concentration of investments in energy related MLPs subject
      it to the risks of investing in MLPs and the energy sector. Investment
      return and the value of shares will fluctuate.

Strategy Facts


The strategy's MLP investments offer consistent income distributions and generate returns with a low historical correlation to traditional asset classes.
Energy infrastructure MLPs are well positioned to benefit over the long term from a resurgence in U.S. energy production.
Portfolio managers Chris Eades and Michael Clarfeld bring a long tenure of investment experience with expertise in energy and income-producing assets.







Literature & Perspectives





Energy MLP Strategy
2Q17 Commentary: OPEC held to its production cutbacks, ceding more share to U.S. shale producers.





With Potential Tailwinds, MLPs Remain Attractive
We continue to believe MLP stocks at current levels are attractive on an absolute and relative basis.





Energy MLP Strategy
1Q17 Commentary: We continue to believe that incremental U.S. oil barrels are needed to avert a shortage of oil, as the global oil market is on course to move to undersupplied.





Energy MLP Strategy
4Q16 Commentary: OPEC’s decision to curb output could accelerate inventory drawdowns and result in firmer oil prices.





Energy MLP Strategy
3Q16 Commentary: MLP companies have seen ample access to capital markets, alleviating fears that the companies would not be able to fund capital expenditures.

MLPs are optimistic but investors not so much, analyst says

 Executives at energy MLPs are mostly optimistic about their growth prospects but investors do not share their enthusiasm, as the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP +0.1%) trades at YTD lows, Mizuho analyst Brian Zarahn learned at an MLP investment conference in Orlando last week. MLP management teams offered a relatively constructive view supported by rising U.S. volumes which are positive for cash flow growth, as well as producer drilling efficiencies and growing demand for petrochemicals, but investor optimism on 2018 will wane if oil prices remain below $50/bbl, Zarahn says. Finally, heavy competition in the Permian Basin could lower returns for winning projects and pose pricing pressure for incumbent crude pipelines, according to Zarahn, who prefers exposure to diversified, integrated midstream MLPs such as Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) and Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP).ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, YMLP, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPG, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, MLPY, TTP, CTR, MLPS, CEN, ZMLP, SMM, DSE, FPL, AMU, MIE, YMLI, MLPJ, JMLP, ENFR, ATMP, MLPC, IMLP

Trump tax plan could provide big boost for MLPs

 The Trump administration's proposal to cut tax rates on pass-through businesses would deliver a windfall to investors in energy MLPs and possibly offer a much-needed boost to the group, according to a Reuters analysis. The plan's proposed cut to the top tax rate on pass-through businesses to 15% from the current rate of up to 36.9% largely would benefit owners of private businesses, but MLP investors would receive the same treatment. MLPs have broadly underperformed the broader stock market over the past several years, largely due to the weakness in oil prices. Mike Bresson, a tax partner with the Baker Botts law firm in Houston says the proposed change would enhance an already superior tax structure enjoyed by MLPs, but adds "the devil is in the details, and we haven’t seen them."ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, YMLP, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPG, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, MLPY, TTP, CTR, MLPS, CEN, ZMLP, SMM, DSE, FPL, AMU, MIE, YMLI, MLPJ, JMLP, ENFR, ATMP, MLPC, IMLP

Dakota Access pipeline gets official OK; tribe files first legal challenge

Energy Transfer Partners (ETP +0.3%) says it received the easement from the Army Crops of Engineers needed to complete construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, and the company says construction work already has started.The Cheyenne River Sioux, one of two American Indian tribes fighting the pipeline, filed a legal challenge this morning to try to block its completion, saying a pipeline leak could contaminate its drinking water; the Standing Rock Sioux tribe also has vowed to fight the construction in court.ETP says it will take about two months to complete drilling under Lake Oahe, but any timetable looks iffy when considering the legal and physical obstacles opponents will use to block it.For investors in energy MLPs, controversy around new pipeline construction - and volatility in MLPs - is not going away, but existing pipelines are growing more valuable, says Cohen & Steers portfolio manager Tyler Rosenlicht, "because it has gotten so difficult to build a new one, [so] the existing asset base is naturally worth more."ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, TTP, CTR, MLPS, CEN, SMM, DSE, FPL, AMU, MIE, JMLP, ENFR, ATMP, IMLP

Noble Midstream IPO raises $281M in test of MLP investor interest

 Noble Midstream Partners (NYSE:NBLX), the pipeline partnership backed by Noble Energy (NYSE:NBL), raised $281M today in its IPO, the first for an oil and gas MLP this year. The IPO sold 12.5M units, as planned, at $22.50 each, after the company had looked to price units in the $19-$21 range. NBLX provides crude oil, natural gas and water-related midstream services on 300K acres in the Denver-Julesburg basin in Colorado and on 40K acres in the Delaware Basin within Texas’ Permian Basin. While the deal is not likely to open the floodgates for new MLP offerings, a successful stock market debut should signal to MLP management teams that they can raise equity if they need it, which is “in striking contrast to the beginning of the year,” says Chris Eades, portfolio manager for several MLP strategies at ClearBridge Investments.ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, TTP, CTR, MLPS, CEN, SMM, DSE, FPL, AMU, MIE, JMLP, ENFR, ATMP, IMLP

More analysts warming up to select MLPs as sentiment improves

 Energy MLPs enjoyed a lift this week (at least until yesterday) following news of the Enbridge-Spectra merger, particularly those lacking sponsorship by producers that may be targets for consolidation. Credit Suisse sees logical players to be involved in combinations to secure access to opportunities and capital including ETE/ETP, EPD, MMP, PAA/PAGP, OKE/OKS, WPZ, PSX/PSXP, MPC/MPLX, TRGP, NS/NSH, GEL and TEP/TEGP. FBR Capital says MLP valuations have improved ~45% from lows reached early this year, and expects macro trends to lift the sector; the firm thinks CAPL could enjoy double-digit growth for nearly seven years, and says MMLP is another notable outperformer whose valuation reflects more than enough discount for a distribution cut (which the firm is forecasting) - it also likes ENLK, EEP, TLP, SRLP, USAC, WLKP and USDP, RBC notes favorable sentiment in the MLP realm, highlighting attractive valuations particularly at ETP, BWP and AMID, and sees dropdown stories - out of favor YTD - such as VLP and SHLX offering visible growth that can support the stocks over the next 12 months.

Still some upside left in MLPs, DA Davidson analyst says

Energy MLPs hardly would seem a bargain after posting one of their best-ever quarters, but DA Davidson analyst Poe Fratt thinks there's still some room to run for the group, citing the average yield in the past five and 20 years, plus improving sentiment.Fratt feels the group’s above average yield of 7.07% and yield spread of 548 bps compare favorably with the average yield of 6.3% and average spread of 415 bps over the past five years, as well as the long-term median yield of 6.8% and median spread of 370 bps since 1996.The analyst says his best current ideas are Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), which he says “remains well positioned in the current environment,” Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) and Spectra Energy Partners (NYSE:SEP).Wells Fargo also recommends MLPs in a new strategy report for their diversification benefits, but it also warns that the sector is a “highly volatile income option."ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, TTP, CTR, MLPS

Energy MLPs enjoyed strong Q2, but Citi still cautious

Energy MLPs had one of the strongest quarters ever in Q2, with the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index surging 18.1% in a major recovery since the losses seen early in the year, and the index is now up 8% YTD.DA Davidson’s Poe Fratt sees tempered MLP growth “on full display,” and remains positive on crude oil prices through 2017 despite recent weakness, believing that non-OPEC production finally is declining and lower capex has set the stage for better supply demand.Fratt’s best current ideas include Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), Genesis Energy (NYSE:GEL), Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP), and Spectra Energy Partners (NYSE:SEP), all of which he rates Buy.But Citi's Faisel Khan says investors should stay cautious given that the group faces tight liquidity and stretched balance sheets; he considers Legacy Reserves (NASDAQ:LGCY), Vanguard Natural Resources (NASDAQ:VNR) and EV Energy Partners (NASDAQ:EVEP) among the higher risk names, and that Atlas Resources Partners (NYSE:ARP) is "running out of options" and could be forced into bankruptcy.ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, TTP, CTR, MLPS

MLPs are looking up, analyst says; recommends EPD, GEL, SEP, MMP

 The past week has rewarded the energy MLP sector with new YTD highs, mostly thanks to the gains in crude oil prices; the Alerian MLP ETF rose another 0.8% to $12.36 in today's trade, up from $11.77 a week ago and $7.97 in mid-February. DA Davison MLP analyst Poe Fratt tells Bloomberg he still sees good value in MLPs, saying MLP prices have only just started to inch up since early April, noting that while Treasury yields have fallen, yield spreads look more attractive.Fratt's best 2016 idea in energy MLPs is Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD), which he says remains well positioned in the challenging environment; the firm also rates Genesis Energy (NYSE:GEL), Spectra Energy Partners (NYSE:SEP) and Magellan Midstream Partners (NYSE:MMP) at Buy.ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, TTP, CTR, MLPS, CEN, SMM, DSE, FPL, AMU, MIE, JMLP, ENFR, ATMP, MLPW, IMLP

Bernstein: Near-term MLP worries overdone but less long-term upside seen

 Bernstein analysts initiate several midstream and pipeline MLPs, estimating that less than 7% of MLPs $70B in service revenues are at risk in a $40/bbl oil environment; oil production volumes will likely fall this year, but midstream pipeline plays will mostly be unaffected, the firm says. On the other hand, the firm sees less long-term upside to MLPs than many investors expect, as after next year existing and in-progress gas and crude infrastructure will be sufficient to handle forward production through 2025. Bernstein prefers Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE:EPD) because of its significant committed market-based projects, and Williams Partners (NYSE:WPZ) and Williams Cos. (NYSE:WMB) on the belief they have been unfairly punished due to expected dividend cuts; the firm rates EPD, WPZ and WMB at Outperform.Bernstein ranks Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), Spectra Energy (NYSE:SE), Spectra Energy Partners (NYSE:SEP), Energy Transfer Partners (NYSE:ETP), Energy Transfer Equity (NYSE:ETE), Cheniere Energy (NYSEMKT:LNG) and Cheniere Energy Partners (NYSEMKT:CQP) at Market Perform; the only name rated Underperform is Sunoco Logistics (NYSE:SXL).ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, YMLP, TYG, KYE, SRV, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, KMF, MLPA, EMLP, FMO, AMZA, FEI, JMF, SRF, CBA, MLPG, MLPN, GMZ, MLPX, GER, EMO, MLPY, TTP, CTR, MLPS, CEN, ZMLP, SMM, DSE, FPL, AMU, MIE, YMLI, JMLP, ENFR, ATMP, MLPW, MLPC, IMLP

Production declines continue to challenge midstream MLPs, analyst says

 While energy supply and demand dynamics may be about to start improving, the benefits are not yet evident in the profit picture for midstream MLPs, Wunderlich's Jeff Birnbaum writes, as declining onshore crude production will continue to challenge midstream operators. E&P guidance and more recent EIA data indicates more significant declines may come in 2016 than expected several months ago, according to Birnbaum. Among individual MLPs, the analyst expects Plains All American (PAA +2.3%) to use its scale, downstream operations and lack of 2016 financing needs as weapons to take share from smaller competitors, and sees a rebound in Gulf of Mexico production as a positive for Genesis Energy (GEL +5.8%). With additional liquified petroleum gas export capacity online in 2016 and the prospect for a more normalized 2016-17 winter, the propane market should tighten relative to a sloppy 2015, which Birnbaum believes will benefit Enterprise Products Partners (EPD +3.5%), Targa Resources (TRGP +1.1%), DCP Midstream Partners (DPM +6.8%) and NGL Energy Partners (NGL -0.1%).

Some MLP investors may be in for rude tax surprise

 Devastation in the oil patch has caused large losses for investors in MLPs, and in some cases increased their tax burden, NYT's Gretchen Morgenson explained in a weekend analysis. Some upstream energy MLPs are being forced to restructure their debts to stave off bankruptcy, and when they do, MLP owners must pay income taxes on their share of debt forgiven by creditors, even though unitholders received no actual income as a result of the restructuring; partnership tax expert Robert Willens told Morgenson that a lot of upstream MLP investors will be surprised by such a tax bill in the coming years. Linn Energy (NASDAQ:LINE) was discussed in the article as a case in point: As part of its November restructuring, creditors forgave $1B in debt, which will trigger taxes to its investors, and more restructuring likely is on the way. Most of the more widely-held midstream MLPs are holding up, so this particular tax hit is not a risk, Barron's Amey Stone notes, but even some midstream MLPs could need to restructure if energy prices stay low for a long time.ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, YMLP, TYG, SRV, KYE, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, MLPA, KMF, EMLP, FMO, FEI, JMF, MLPN, SRF, CBA, MLPG, MLPX, GMZ, EMO, MLPS, MLPY, TTP, CTR, AMZA, GER, ZMLP, CEN, YMLI, AMU, SMM, MIE, DSE, FPL, ENFR, ATMP, JMLP, MLPC, MLPW, IMLP

Report: UBS sees record monthly pace for MLP net inflows

 Over the past 90 days, 20 (or 80%) of the 25 worst performing exchange-traded products are ETFs or ETNs related to oil and natural gas, and nine of those 20 products are dedicated MLPs, a Benzinga article notes signs of investors making contrarian moves in MLP ETFs. "After record net outflows in MLP's in November/December 2015, UBS Retail has turned net buyers in 2016, with February on pace for the largest month of net inflows in MLP's we have ever recorded," says Rareview Macro's Neil Azous, citing data from UBS Electronic Trading. Less than a month after redeeming two MLP ETNs, UBS introduced two new, double-leveraged MLP ETNs earlier this week.ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, MLPL, YMLP, TYG, SRV, KYE, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, MLPA, KMF, EMLP, FMO, FEI, JMF, MLPN, SRF, CBA, MLPG, MLPX, GMZ, EMO, MLPS, MLPY, TTP, CTR, AMZA, GER, ZMLP, CEN, YMLI, AMU, MLPJ, SMM, MIE, DSE, FPL, ENFR, ATMP, JMLP, MLPC, MLPW, IMLP

"The worst isn't over" for MLPs, Kaiser says

 The MLP sector needs to "absorb more pain" before it can represent a "compelling investment," Hedgeye's Kevin Kaiser said in a Barron's weekend profile of the controversial analyst, adding that the "pain" can come in but one form: a reduction in distributions that investors cherish. The longtime MLP bear disagrees with the analysts and MLP investors who think the sector is deeply  undervalued now that the benchmark Alerian MLP index is down 45%, countering that “we’re in the early innings of the MLP down-cycle. We had a 15-year up-cycle, and now we’re a year and a half into the downturn.” Kaiser first gained Wall Street attention as the only bear among more than 20 analysts that covered Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI); while most of the damage has been done, Kaiser  thinks KMI could fall further, to below $10, as he sees KMI  still overleveraged with $41B of net debt, more than 5x annual cash flow. On Linn Energy (LINE, LNCO) and Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK), "we said those stocks could be going to zero, and I think we’re going to be right," Kaiser adds.ETFs: AMLP, AMJ, KYN, MLPL, YMLP, TYG, SRV, KYE, CEM, MLPI, NML, FEN, NTG, MLPA, KMF, EMLP, FMO, FEI, JMF, MLPN, SRF, CBA, MLPG, MLPX, GMZ, EMO, MLPS, MLPY, TTP, CTR, AMZA, GER, ZMLP, CEN, AMU, YMLI, SMM, MIE, DSE, FPL, ENFR, ATMP, JMLP, MLPC, MLPW

			Equity
			: Master Limited Partnership (MLP) Funds



			About Master Limited Partnership (MLP) Funds

			MLPs are publicly traded partnerships primarily operating businesses in the natural resources and energy
			industries. MLPs own real, hard assets critical to the U.S. economy. Energy MLPs are typically formed
			by larger energy companies to re-capitalize lower growth assets. They help to finance various portions
			of the crude oil and natural gas value chains. As shown below, they typically own transportation and
			storage assets in these chains, and also production assets within the natural gas value chain.
		





			MLPs are a US-only investment, because one of their primary features is advantageous U.S. federal tax
			treatment. Typically, about 80% of their distributions are tax-deferred, though this can change when
			MLPs are included in pooled investment vehicles like closed-end funds.

			The total return of MLP investments is typically based on their distributions and on demand for energy.
			Because they are highly concentrated in the energy sector, however, they can be more negatively affected
			by a downturn in the energy sector. In addition, their tax-advantaged distributions could be negatively
			affected by changes in the U.S. tax code regarding treatment of MLPs.

			For more information, see http://naptp.org/ the National Association
			of Publicly Traded Partnerships.
		



					About Nuveen MLP Closed-End Funds
				

					Nuveen currently offers one MLP closed-end fund.

The Nuveen MLP Total Return Fund (JMF)
					seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of master limited partnerships
					(“MLPs”) in the energy sector. The Fund believes that MLPs represent a timely investment opportunity
					since MLPs typically generate a high level of tax-deferred income and offer the potential for increased
					distributions and capital appreciation over time. To implement its strategy, the Fund’s portfolio management
					team combines its top-down strategic investment style with its rigorous, bottom-up investment process.
					The Fund seeks to identify MLPs that it believes have the most attractive current yields and total return
					potential. In seeking to mitigate certain key risks of MLP investing, the Fund may use various hedging
					techniques consistent with its top-down investment style with the goal of enhancing its risk-adjusted
					total return over the longer term.
				






								Investor Profile

								Are these CEFs right for you?
The features and investment objectives of these funds may be an appropriate investment for you if
								you are seeking the potential for:

Tax-advantaged quarterly distributions; 
Capital appreciation and distribution growth over time; 
Portfolio diversification and an investment that may serve as a hedge against inflation;
An efficient, single-investment opportunity providing access to a diverse portfolio of MLPs in the energy
									sector.


								What are potential risks?
							

Tax Risks. These Funds invest primarily in MLPs that pay no separate corporate level tax because they
									qualify as partnerships under current tax law. A change in law or in the business of such MLPs that
									caused them to be treated as taxable corporations could negatively affect fund performance and/or distributions.
								
Energy Sector Risks. The Funds invest predominantely in MLPs in the energy sector. This concentration
									in the energy sector may present more risks than if the Fund invested in numerous sectors of the economy.
									A downturn in the energy sector could have a larger impact on the Fund than on a fund that does not
									concentrate in the sector.

Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.
