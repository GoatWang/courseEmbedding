This is a Chinese name; the family name is Wang.
Charles B. Wang (Chinese: 王嘉廉; pinyin: Wáng Jiālián; born August 19, 1944) is a businessman and philanthropist who was a co-founder and former CEO of Computer Associates International, Inc. (later renamed to CA Technologies). He is currently a minority owner of the NHL's New York Islanders[1] ice hockey team and their AHL affiliate, an investor in numerous businesses, and benefactor to charities including SmileTrain.
In 1976, at age 31, Wang launched Computer Associates, using credit cards for funding. Wang grew Computer Associates into one of the country's largest software vendors. Wang has authored two books to help executives master technology: Techno Vision (1994, McGraw-Hill) and Techno Vision II (1997, McGraw-Hill). Wang retired from Computer Associates in 2002. He is an active philanthropist, working with such organizations as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Islanders Children’s Foundation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others.

Early life[edit]
Charles B. Wang was born in Shanghai to parents Kenneth and Mary Wang. Charles has two brothers, Anthony W. Wang and Francis Wang. His father was a Supreme Court judge in the Republic of China. The Wangs moved to Queens, New York, when he was eight years old. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Wang earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Queens College and began his computer career at Columbia University's Riverside Research Institute.
New York Islanders[edit]
Charles Wang is a minority owner of the New York Islanders hockey franchise, of which he had become a part-owner in 2000, and majority owner from 2001-2016. He later bought out the share of business partner Sanjay Kumar in 2004, and acquired the original Iowa Barnstormers Arena Football League franchise, moving them to Long Island, and renaming them the New York Dragons. Wang’s sometimes unorthodox decisions as owner have received a mixture of praise and criticism.
According to former Islanders general manager Mike Milbury, Wang “assumed that nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler”. Milbury said that “He was a man of his word, a guy who desperately wanted to keep the team on the Island.”[2]
Wang initially had a willingness to spend money with the goal of making the Islanders competitive; however, recent team payrolls have decreased as the Islanders failed to reach the playoffs between the 2006–07 and 2012–13 seasons.
Wang hired Neil Smith as the Islanders' general manager during the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, but 40 days later Smith was fired due to his unwillingness to adhere to the "management by committee" style of Wang. Wang then gave the job to Garth Snow, who subsequently retired from his playing position as the team's backup goaltender. Wang said that "philosophical differences" were the basis for firing Smith. This series of personnel moves, combined with Wang’s approval of long-term contracts for Alexei Yashin and goaltender Rick DiPietro several years later, inspired a critical reaction from hockey journalists.[3] Milbury reported that he had to talk Wang out of giving Michael Peca a ten-year deal.[2]
A Forbes article investigated why certain NHL franchises could remain profitable despite poor attendance and overall league unprofitability. They found that several league owners under-reported their cable broadcast revenue; they specifically accused Wang of excluding half of the $17 million paid to the Islanders for the 2003 cable broadcast season. Wang made numerous efforts to build a new arena in Nassau County, as the Veterans Memorial Coliseum was the second-oldest active arena, and the Islanders lease ended in 2015.[4]
He was the master developer of The Lighthouse Project, a property transformation of the Nassau Coliseum and surrounding 150 acres (0.61 km2). The project was to include a five-star hotel; condominiums; an athletic complex featuring four ice rinks, a basketball facility, and a state-of-the-art health club that would have served as the Islanders’ practice facility and also be open to the public. The development would also have included a sports technology center, open-air plaza, and conference center. The project was deemed to be too large by Town of Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray, who made a counter-proposal that was about half the size of what Wang had originally intended. Wang balked at Murray's proposal, and decided to try to finance the building of a new arena for the Islanders with public funds, rather than paying for it himself as part of the Lighthouse Project. In May 2011, Wang, along with Nassau County, started an 82-day campaign for a $400 million bond to fund a new arena for the Islanders. On August 1, 2011, the proposal was defeated by a margin of 57% to 43%.[5]
Wang has stated that he would not have bought the team if he knew how difficult it would be, and would not do so if he could choose again.[6] A New York Times article detailed Wang’s “desperate” attempts to keep the team on Long Island.[7][8] Ultimately, however, Wang was unable to secure a renovated or new arena in Uniondale. Jeff Wilpon, the COO of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders from Wang and moving them adjacent to the Mets' home ballpark, Citi Field in Flushing, Queens.[9] There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders from Wang and move them to Barclays Center in Brooklyn.[10] On October 24, 2012, Wang announced that the Islanders would move to Barclays Center in 2015, after the end of their lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.[11] In various interviews, Wang said that “it was Brooklyn, or out of town”.[12] Despite the move, the franchise will remain named as the New York Islanders and they are geographically still on Long Island.[2]
In August 2014, the NHL announced that Wang had agreed to sell "a substantial minority interest in the team" to a group of investors and that the group would be "transitioning to majority ownership in two years".
Philanthropy[edit]
Wang is an active philanthropist and in 1999 established the Charles B. Wang Foundation with the goal of donating to numerous charities that focused on bettering the lives of children and the disenfranchised. He has worked with such causes as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Plainview Chinese Cultural Center and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others. His donation of over $50 million to the State University of New York at Stony Brook for the construction of the Charles B. Wang Center was, at the time, the largest in history to a SUNY school. He also funded the expansion of the Chinatown Health Clinic which was renamed the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center.
As the co-Founder and Chairman of Smile Train in 1999, Wang originally gave $30 million to cover all administrative expenses and has remained active in the charity’s efforts to help children with cleft lip and palates, in more than 80 countries.
One of the more important attributes that Wang brought to his ownership of the Islanders was to expand their community-based programs through the Islanders Children’s Foundation, which started in 2003 and has become a mainstay. The Foundation works with children’s health, education, and youth hockey development charities. In 2006, the team created Project Hope, which is focused on developing ice hockey in China. Wang recruited women's professional hockey player, Angela Ruggiero, to the project as well.[13]
In 2000, Wang and his brothers, Anthony and Francis, donated a new law school to China's Soochow University in honor of their father Kenneth Wang and in celebration of the university's 100th anniversary,[14] it opened officially in 2003.
Computer Associates[edit]
Charles Wang and partner Russell Artzt established Computer Associates in 1976, guiding the company toward its current standing as one of the largest independent software corporations in the world. One year later, Computer Associates became the first enterprise software company to provide multi-platform products, foreshadowing its ongoing emphasis on compatibility and integration. By 1989, Computer Associates became the first software company to reach $1 billion in revenues.
Wang’s tenure as CEO of Computer Associates was marked by rapid growth, frequently as a result of strict hiring practices and high expectations for executives of acquired companies. Nearly all of CA's managers were promoted from within, so very few acquired managers were kept. Newly hired salespeople had some sales experience, but not in software. It was unusual for a technician to be considered for sales because CA's training program was geared toward products instead of professional selling. The pass/fail demarcation was sharp, so perceived inadequate sales performance meant termination. All told, Wang engaged in several dozen acquisitions and those acquired facilities were repopulated with CA employees.
He was also known for his commitment to a family-oriented management style, and for promoting several women to management positions. In 1979, three years after CA's founding, Wang had installed his older brother Tony, a one-time corporate lawyer, as president and COO. Tony held the position until his retirement in 1992 to make way for Sanjay Kumar, who joined CA via its 1987 acquisition of archrival Uccel Corporation. In 1998, Nancy Li, Charles Wang's second wife, was named CA's Chief Technology Officer ("CTO"). Responding to criticism over his so-called “paternalistic” management style, Wang has argued that the investment community punished CA's stock because of his refusal to override his sense of familial loyalty to avoid the appearance of nepotism.[15]
In 1998, Wang had initiated a $9 billion hostile takeover for the shares of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). The Washington Post reported CSC management’s “concern” about the tender offer by alluding to CA's "ties to foreigners." It was a pointed reference to Wang's origin and that certain Chinese government institutions (as well as those in the US, Europe and elsewhere) were CA clients. The suggestion was that becoming linked with CA would jeopardize CSC's contracts with U.S. government agencies. Blaming what in his view was a witch-hunt with racial motivations, Wang dropped the tender offer.
In 2000, a class-action lawsuit accused Wang, then president Kumar and co-founder Artzt of wrongly reporting more than $2.5 billion in revenue in its 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 fiscal (April through March) years, in order to artificially inflate the stock price. A previous stock option set in 1995 specified that a certain number of shares would vest when Computer Associates' shares sustained a target price. The benchmark was met in 1998, and the three executives combined received nearly $1 billion in Computer Associates stock with Wang himself netting $700 million; he had already been the highest paid CEO in the US for the past four years.[16] Since then, at least four other class-action suits were filed against Computer Associates, all of which have named Wang specifically, and all of which were settled or dismissed without finding any liability on Wang’s part. As the controversy continued to dog Wang even after he returned a portion of the stock award, he quit as CEO in 2000, and later resigned as Chairman of the Board in 2002.[17][18][19][20]
Kumar resigned as chairman and chief executive in April 2004, following an investigation into the accounting scandal which improperly reported revenue. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted Kumar on fraud charges on September 22, 2004.[21] Kumar pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and securities fraud charges on April 24, 2006.[22]
Awards and honors[edit]
On May 3, 2009, Wang was honored by the Los Angeles Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in "Celebrating Chinese Americans in Sports".[23]
Long Island residence[edit]
Wang's Oyster Bay mansion on the Gold Coast of Long Island is located near Sagamore Hill, President Theodore Roosevelt's home.[24]

Early life[edit]
Charles B. Wang was born in Shanghai to parents Kenneth and Mary Wang. Charles has two brothers, Anthony W. Wang and Francis Wang. His father was a Supreme Court judge in the Republic of China. The Wangs moved to Queens, New York, when he was eight years old. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Wang earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Queens College and began his computer career at Columbia University's Riverside Research Institute.
New York Islanders[edit]
Charles Wang is a minority owner of the New York Islanders hockey franchise, of which he had become a part-owner in 2000, and majority owner from 2001-2016. He later bought out the share of business partner Sanjay Kumar in 2004, and acquired the original Iowa Barnstormers Arena Football League franchise, moving them to Long Island, and renaming them the New York Dragons. Wang’s sometimes unorthodox decisions as owner have received a mixture of praise and criticism.
According to former Islanders general manager Mike Milbury, Wang “assumed that nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler”. Milbury said that “He was a man of his word, a guy who desperately wanted to keep the team on the Island.”[2]
Wang initially had a willingness to spend money with the goal of making the Islanders competitive; however, recent team payrolls have decreased as the Islanders failed to reach the playoffs between the 2006–07 and 2012–13 seasons.
Wang hired Neil Smith as the Islanders' general manager during the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, but 40 days later Smith was fired due to his unwillingness to adhere to the "management by committee" style of Wang. Wang then gave the job to Garth Snow, who subsequently retired from his playing position as the team's backup goaltender. Wang said that "philosophical differences" were the basis for firing Smith. This series of personnel moves, combined with Wang’s approval of long-term contracts for Alexei Yashin and goaltender Rick DiPietro several years later, inspired a critical reaction from hockey journalists.[3] Milbury reported that he had to talk Wang out of giving Michael Peca a ten-year deal.[2]
A Forbes article investigated why certain NHL franchises could remain profitable despite poor attendance and overall league unprofitability. They found that several league owners under-reported their cable broadcast revenue; they specifically accused Wang of excluding half of the $17 million paid to the Islanders for the 2003 cable broadcast season. Wang made numerous efforts to build a new arena in Nassau County, as the Veterans Memorial Coliseum was the second-oldest active arena, and the Islanders lease ended in 2015.[4]
He was the master developer of The Lighthouse Project, a property transformation of the Nassau Coliseum and surrounding 150 acres (0.61 km2). The project was to include a five-star hotel; condominiums; an athletic complex featuring four ice rinks, a basketball facility, and a state-of-the-art health club that would have served as the Islanders’ practice facility and also be open to the public. The development would also have included a sports technology center, open-air plaza, and conference center. The project was deemed to be too large by Town of Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray, who made a counter-proposal that was about half the size of what Wang had originally intended. Wang balked at Murray's proposal, and decided to try to finance the building of a new arena for the Islanders with public funds, rather than paying for it himself as part of the Lighthouse Project. In May 2011, Wang, along with Nassau County, started an 82-day campaign for a $400 million bond to fund a new arena for the Islanders. On August 1, 2011, the proposal was defeated by a margin of 57% to 43%.[5]
Wang has stated that he would not have bought the team if he knew how difficult it would be, and would not do so if he could choose again.[6] A New York Times article detailed Wang’s “desperate” attempts to keep the team on Long Island.[7][8] Ultimately, however, Wang was unable to secure a renovated or new arena in Uniondale. Jeff Wilpon, the COO of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders from Wang and moving them adjacent to the Mets' home ballpark, Citi Field in Flushing, Queens.[9] There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders from Wang and move them to Barclays Center in Brooklyn.[10] On October 24, 2012, Wang announced that the Islanders would move to Barclays Center in 2015, after the end of their lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.[11] In various interviews, Wang said that “it was Brooklyn, or out of town”.[12] Despite the move, the franchise will remain named as the New York Islanders and they are geographically still on Long Island.[2]
In August 2014, the NHL announced that Wang had agreed to sell "a substantial minority interest in the team" to a group of investors and that the group would be "transitioning to majority ownership in two years".
Philanthropy[edit]
Wang is an active philanthropist and in 1999 established the Charles B. Wang Foundation with the goal of donating to numerous charities that focused on bettering the lives of children and the disenfranchised. He has worked with such causes as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Plainview Chinese Cultural Center and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others. His donation of over $50 million to the State University of New York at Stony Brook for the construction of the Charles B. Wang Center was, at the time, the largest in history to a SUNY school. He also funded the expansion of the Chinatown Health Clinic which was renamed the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center.
As the co-Founder and Chairman of Smile Train in 1999, Wang originally gave $30 million to cover all administrative expenses and has remained active in the charity’s efforts to help children with cleft lip and palates, in more than 80 countries.
One of the more important attributes that Wang brought to his ownership of the Islanders was to expand their community-based programs through the Islanders Children’s Foundation, which started in 2003 and has become a mainstay. The Foundation works with children’s health, education, and youth hockey development charities. In 2006, the team created Project Hope, which is focused on developing ice hockey in China. Wang recruited women's professional hockey player, Angela Ruggiero, to the project as well.[13]
In 2000, Wang and his brothers, Anthony and Francis, donated a new law school to China's Soochow University in honor of their father Kenneth Wang and in celebration of the university's 100th anniversary,[14] it opened officially in 2003.
Computer Associates[edit]
Charles Wang and partner Russell Artzt established Computer Associates in 1976, guiding the company toward its current standing as one of the largest independent software corporations in the world. One year later, Computer Associates became the first enterprise software company to provide multi-platform products, foreshadowing its ongoing emphasis on compatibility and integration. By 1989, Computer Associates became the first software company to reach $1 billion in revenues.
Wang’s tenure as CEO of Computer Associates was marked by rapid growth, frequently as a result of strict hiring practices and high expectations for executives of acquired companies. Nearly all of CA's managers were promoted from within, so very few acquired managers were kept. Newly hired salespeople had some sales experience, but not in software. It was unusual for a technician to be considered for sales because CA's training program was geared toward products instead of professional selling. The pass/fail demarcation was sharp, so perceived inadequate sales performance meant termination. All told, Wang engaged in several dozen acquisitions and those acquired facilities were repopulated with CA employees.
He was also known for his commitment to a family-oriented management style, and for promoting several women to management positions. In 1979, three years after CA's founding, Wang had installed his older brother Tony, a one-time corporate lawyer, as president and COO. Tony held the position until his retirement in 1992 to make way for Sanjay Kumar, who joined CA via its 1987 acquisition of archrival Uccel Corporation. In 1998, Nancy Li, Charles Wang's second wife, was named CA's Chief Technology Officer ("CTO"). Responding to criticism over his so-called “paternalistic” management style, Wang has argued that the investment community punished CA's stock because of his refusal to override his sense of familial loyalty to avoid the appearance of nepotism.[15]
In 1998, Wang had initiated a $9 billion hostile takeover for the shares of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). The Washington Post reported CSC management’s “concern” about the tender offer by alluding to CA's "ties to foreigners." It was a pointed reference to Wang's origin and that certain Chinese government institutions (as well as those in the US, Europe and elsewhere) were CA clients. The suggestion was that becoming linked with CA would jeopardize CSC's contracts with U.S. government agencies. Blaming what in his view was a witch-hunt with racial motivations, Wang dropped the tender offer.
In 2000, a class-action lawsuit accused Wang, then president Kumar and co-founder Artzt of wrongly reporting more than $2.5 billion in revenue in its 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 fiscal (April through March) years, in order to artificially inflate the stock price. A previous stock option set in 1995 specified that a certain number of shares would vest when Computer Associates' shares sustained a target price. The benchmark was met in 1998, and the three executives combined received nearly $1 billion in Computer Associates stock with Wang himself netting $700 million; he had already been the highest paid CEO in the US for the past four years.[16] Since then, at least four other class-action suits were filed against Computer Associates, all of which have named Wang specifically, and all of which were settled or dismissed without finding any liability on Wang’s part. As the controversy continued to dog Wang even after he returned a portion of the stock award, he quit as CEO in 2000, and later resigned as Chairman of the Board in 2002.[17][18][19][20]
Kumar resigned as chairman and chief executive in April 2004, following an investigation into the accounting scandal which improperly reported revenue. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted Kumar on fraud charges on September 22, 2004.[21] Kumar pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and securities fraud charges on April 24, 2006.[22]
Awards and honors[edit]
On May 3, 2009, Wang was honored by the Los Angeles Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in "Celebrating Chinese Americans in Sports".[23]
Long Island residence[edit]
Wang's Oyster Bay mansion on the Gold Coast of Long Island is located near Sagamore Hill, President Theodore Roosevelt's home.[24]

Charles Wang is a minority owner of the New York Islanders hockey franchise, of which he had become a part-owner in 2000, and majority owner from 2001-2016. He later bought out the share of business partner Sanjay Kumar in 2004, and acquired the original Iowa Barnstormers Arena Football League franchise, moving them to Long Island, and renaming them the New York Dragons.

Jeff Wilpon, the COO of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders from Wang and moving them adjacent to the Mets' home ballpark, Citi Field in Flushing, Queens.[9] There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders from Wang and move them to Barclays Center in Brooklyn.[10] On October 24, 2012, Wang announced that the Islanders would move to Barclays Center in 2015, after the end of their lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.[11] In various interviews, Wang said that “it was Brooklyn, or out of town”.[12] Despite the move, the franchise will remain named as the New York Islanders and they are geographically still on Long Island.[2]
In August 2014, the NHL announced that Wang had agreed to sell "a substantial minority interest in the team" to a group of investors and that the group would be "transitioning to majority ownership in two years".
Philanthropy[edit]
Wang is an active philanthropist and in 1999 established the Charles B. Wang Foundation with the goal of donating to numerous charities that focused on bettering the lives of children and the disenfranchised. He has worked with such causes as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Plainview Chinese Cultural Center and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others. His donation of over $50 million to the State University of New York at Stony Brook for the construction of the Charles B. Wang Center was, at the time, the largest in history to a SUNY school. He also funded the expansion of the Chinatown Health Clinic which was renamed the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center.
As the co-Founder and Chairman of Smile Train in 1999, Wang originally gave $30 million to cover all administrative expenses and has remained active in the charity’s efforts to help children with cleft lip and palates, in more than 80 countries.
One of the more important attributes that Wang brought to his ownership of the Islanders was to expand their community-based programs through the Islanders Children’s Foundation, which started in 2003 and has become a mainstay. The Foundation works with children’s health, education, and youth hockey development charities. In 2006, the team created Project Hope, which is focused on developing ice hockey in China. Wang recruited women's professional hockey player, Angela Ruggiero, to the project as well.[13]
In 2000, Wang and his brothers, Anthony and Francis, donated a new law school to China's Soochow University in honor of their father Kenneth Wang and in celebration of the university's 100th anniversary,[14] it opened officially in 2003.
Computer Associates[edit]
Charles Wang and partner Russell Artzt established Computer Associates in 1976, guiding the company toward its current standing as one of the largest independent software corporations in the world. One year later, Computer Associates became the first enterprise software company to provide multi-platform products, foreshadowing its ongoing emphasis on compatibility and integration. By 1989, Computer Associates became the first software company to reach $1 billion in revenues.
Wang’s tenure as CEO of Computer Associates was marked by rapid growth, frequently as a result of strict hiring practices and high expectations for executives of acquired companies. Nearly all of CA's managers were promoted from within, so very few acquired managers were kept. Newly hired salespeople had some sales experience, but not in software. It was unusual for a technician to be considered for sales because CA's training program was geared toward products instead of professional selling. The pass/fail demarcation was sharp, so perceived inadequate sales performance meant termination. All told, Wang engaged in several dozen acquisitions and those acquired facilities were repopulated with CA employees.
He was also known for his commitment to a family-oriented management style, and for promoting several women to management positions. In 1979, three years after CA's founding, Wang had installed his older brother Tony, a one-time corporate lawyer, as president and COO. Tony held the position until his retirement in 1992 to make way for Sanjay Kumar, who joined CA via its 1987 acquisition of archrival Uccel Corporation. In 1998, Nancy Li, Charles Wang's second wife, was named CA's Chief Technology Officer ("CTO"). Responding to criticism over his so-called “paternalistic” management style, Wang has argued that the investment community punished CA's stock because of his refusal to override his sense of familial loyalty to avoid the appearance of nepotism.[15]
In 1998, Wang had initiated a $9 billion hostile takeover for the shares of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). The Washington Post reported CSC management’s “concern” about the tender offer by alluding to CA's "ties to foreigners." It was a pointed reference to Wang's origin and that certain Chinese government institutions (as well as those in the US, Europe and elsewhere) were CA clients. The suggestion was that becoming linked with CA would jeopardize CSC's contracts with U.S. government agencies. Blaming what in his view was a witch-hunt with racial motivations, Wang dropped the tender offer.
In 2000, a class-action lawsuit accused Wang, then president Kumar and co-founder Artzt of wrongly reporting more than $2.5 billion in revenue in its 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 fiscal (April through March) years, in order to artificially inflate the stock price. A previous stock option set in 1995 specified that a certain number of shares would vest when Computer Associates' shares sustained a target price. The benchmark was met in 1998, and the three executives combined received nearly $1 billion in Computer Associates stock with Wang himself netting $700 million; he had already been the highest paid CEO in the US for the past four years.[16] Since then, at least four other class-action suits were filed against Computer Associates, all of which have named Wang specifically, and all of which were settled or dismissed without finding any liability on Wang’s part. As the controversy continued to dog Wang even after he returned a portion of the stock award, he quit as CEO in 2000, and later resigned as Chairman of the Board in 2002.[17][18][19][20]
Kumar resigned as chairman and chief executive in April 2004, following an investigation into the accounting scandal which improperly reported revenue. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted Kumar on fraud charges on September 22, 2004.[21] Kumar pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and securities fraud charges on April 24, 2006.[22]
Awards and honors[edit]
On May 3, 2009, Wang was honored by the Los Angeles Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in "Celebrating Chinese Americans in Sports".[23]
Long Island residence[edit]
Wang's Oyster Bay mansion on the Gold Coast of Long Island is located near Sagamore Hill, President Theodore Roosevelt's home.[24]

Early life[edit]
Charles B. Wang was born in Shanghai to parents Kenneth and Mary Wang. Charles has two brothers, Anthony W. Wang and Francis Wang. His father was a Supreme Court judge in the Republic of China. The Wangs moved to Queens, New York, when he was eight years old. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Wang earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Queens College and began his computer career at Columbia University's Riverside Research Institute.
New York Islanders[edit]
Charles Wang is a minority owner of the New York Islanders hockey franchise, of which he had become a part-owner in 2000, and majority owner from 2001-2016. He later bought out the share of business partner Sanjay Kumar in 2004, and acquired the original Iowa Barnstormers Arena Football League franchise, moving them to Long Island, and renaming them the New York Dragons. Wang’s sometimes unorthodox decisions as owner have received a mixture of praise and criticism.
According to former Islanders general manager Mike Milbury, Wang “assumed that nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler”. Milbury said that “He was a man of his word, a guy who desperately wanted to keep the team on the Island.”[2]
Wang initially had a willingness to spend money with the goal of making the Islanders competitive; however, recent team payrolls have decreased as the Islanders failed to reach the playoffs between the 2006–07 and 2012–13 seasons.
Wang hired Neil Smith as the Islanders' general manager during the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, but 40 days later Smith was fired due to his unwillingness to adhere to the "management by committee" style of Wang. Wang then gave the job to Garth Snow, who subsequently retired from his playing position as the team's backup goaltender. Wang said that "philosophical differences" were the basis for firing Smith. This series of personnel moves, combined with Wang’s approval of long-term contracts for Alexei Yashin and goaltender Rick DiPietro several years later, inspired a critical reaction from hockey journalists.[3] Milbury reported that he had to talk Wang out of giving Michael Peca a ten-year deal.[2]
A Forbes article investigated why certain NHL franchises could remain profitable despite poor attendance and overall league unprofitability. They found that several league owners under-reported their cable broadcast revenue; they specifically accused Wang of excluding half of the $17 million paid to the Islanders for the 2003 cable broadcast season. Wang made numerous efforts to build a new arena in Nassau County, as the Veterans Memorial Coliseum was the second-oldest active arena, and the Islanders lease ended in 2015.[4]
He was the master developer of The Lighthouse Project, a property transformation of the Nassau Coliseum and surrounding 150 acres (0.61 km2). The project was to include a five-star hotel; condominiums; an athletic complex featuring four ice rinks, a basketball facility, and a state-of-the-art health club that would have served as the Islanders’ practice facility and also be open to the public. The development would also have included a sports technology center, open-air plaza, and conference center. The project was deemed to be too large by Town of Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray, who made a counter-proposal that was about half the size of what Wang had originally intended. Wang balked at Murray's proposal, and decided to try to finance the building of a new arena for the Islanders with public funds, rather than paying for it himself as part of the Lighthouse Project. In May 2011, Wang, along with Nassau County, started an 82-day campaign for a $400 million bond to fund a new arena for the Islanders. On August 1, 2011, the proposal was defeated by a margin of 57% to 43%.[5]
Wang has stated that he would not have bought the team if he knew how difficult it would be, and would not do so if he could choose again.[6] A New York Times article detailed Wang’s “desperate” attempts to keep the team on Long Island.[7][8] Ultimately, however, Wang was unable to secure a renovated or new arena in Uniondale. Jeff Wilpon, the COO of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders from Wang and moving them adjacent to the Mets' home ballpark, Citi Field in Flushing, Queens.[9] There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders from Wang and move them to Barclays Center in Brooklyn.[10] On October 24, 2012, Wang announced that the Islanders would move to Barclays Center in 2015, after the end of their lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.[11] In various interviews, Wang said that “it was Brooklyn, or out of town”.[12] Despite the move, the franchise will remain named as the New York Islanders and they are geographically still on Long Island.[2]
In August 2014, the NHL announced that Wang had agreed to sell "a substantial minority interest in the team" to a group of investors and that the group would be "transitioning to majority ownership in two years".

Charles B. Wang (Chinese: 王嘉廉; pinyin: Wáng Jiālián; born August 19, 1944) is a businessman and philanthropist who was a co-founder and former CEO of Computer Associates International, Inc. (later renamed to CA Technologies). He is currently a minority owner of the NHL's New York Islanders[1] ice hockey team and their AHL affiliate, an investor in numerous businesses, and benefactor to charities including SmileTrain.
In 1976, at age 31, Wang launched Computer Associates, using credit cards for funding. Wang grew Computer Associates into one of the country's largest software vendors. Wang has authored two books to help executives master technology: Techno Vision (1994, McGraw-Hill) and Techno Vision II (1997, McGraw-Hill). Wang retired from Computer Associates in 2002. He is an active philanthropist, working with such organizations as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Islanders Children’s Foundation and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others.

Early life[edit]
Charles B. Wang was born in Shanghai to parents Kenneth and Mary Wang. Charles has two brothers, Anthony W. Wang and Francis Wang. His father was a Supreme Court judge in the Republic of China. The Wangs moved to Queens, New York, when he was eight years old. He attended Brooklyn Technical High School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. Wang earned a Bachelor of Science degree from Queens College and began his computer career at Columbia University's Riverside Research Institute.
New York Islanders[edit]
Charles Wang is a minority owner of the New York Islanders hockey franchise, of which he had become a part-owner in 2000, and majority owner from 2001-2016. He later bought out the share of business partner Sanjay Kumar in 2004, and acquired the original Iowa Barnstormers Arena Football League franchise, moving them to Long Island, and renaming them the New York Dragons. Wang’s sometimes unorthodox decisions as owner have received a mixture of praise and criticism.
According to former Islanders general manager Mike Milbury, Wang “assumed that nobody could put a goal past a sumo wrestler”. Milbury said that “He was a man of his word, a guy who desperately wanted to keep the team on the Island.”[2]
Wang initially had a willingness to spend money with the goal of making the Islanders competitive; however, recent team payrolls have decreased as the Islanders failed to reach the playoffs between the 2006–07 and 2012–13 seasons.
Wang hired Neil Smith as the Islanders' general manager during the 2006 Stanley Cup Finals, but 40 days later Smith was fired due to his unwillingness to adhere to the "management by committee" style of Wang. Wang then gave the job to Garth Snow, who subsequently retired from his playing position as the team's backup goaltender. Wang said that "philosophical differences" were the basis for firing Smith. This series of personnel moves, combined with Wang’s approval of long-term contracts for Alexei Yashin and goaltender Rick DiPietro several years later, inspired a critical reaction from hockey journalists.[3] Milbury reported that he had to talk Wang out of giving Michael Peca a ten-year deal.[2]
A Forbes article investigated why certain NHL franchises could remain profitable despite poor attendance and overall league unprofitability. They found that several league owners under-reported their cable broadcast revenue; they specifically accused Wang of excluding half of the $17 million paid to the Islanders for the 2003 cable broadcast season. Wang made numerous efforts to build a new arena in Nassau County, as the Veterans Memorial Coliseum was the second-oldest active arena, and the Islanders lease ended in 2015.[4]
He was the master developer of The Lighthouse Project, a property transformation of the Nassau Coliseum and surrounding 150 acres (0.61 km2). The project was to include a five-star hotel; condominiums; an athletic complex featuring four ice rinks, a basketball facility, and a state-of-the-art health club that would have served as the Islanders’ practice facility and also be open to the public. The development would also have included a sports technology center, open-air plaza, and conference center. The project was deemed to be too large by Town of Hempstead Supervisor Kate Murray, who made a counter-proposal that was about half the size of what Wang had originally intended. Wang balked at Murray's proposal, and decided to try to finance the building of a new arena for the Islanders with public funds, rather than paying for it himself as part of the Lighthouse Project. In May 2011, Wang, along with Nassau County, started an 82-day campaign for a $400 million bond to fund a new arena for the Islanders. On August 1, 2011, the proposal was defeated by a margin of 57% to 43%.[5]
Wang has stated that he would not have bought the team if he knew how difficult it would be, and would not do so if he could choose again.[6] A New York Times article detailed Wang’s “desperate” attempts to keep the team on Long Island.[7][8] Ultimately, however, Wang was unable to secure a renovated or new arena in Uniondale. Jeff Wilpon, the COO of Major League Baseball's New York Mets, discussed the possibility of buying the Islanders from Wang and moving them adjacent to the Mets' home ballpark, Citi Field in Flushing, Queens.[9] There were also reports that businessman Nelson Peltz wanted to buy the Islanders from Wang and move them to Barclays Center in Brooklyn.[10] On October 24, 2012, Wang announced that the Islanders would move to Barclays Center in 2015, after the end of their lease at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.[11] In various interviews, Wang said that “it was Brooklyn, or out of town”.[12] Despite the move, the franchise will remain named as the New York Islanders and they are geographically still on Long Island.[2]
In August 2014, the NHL announced that Wang had agreed to sell "a substantial minority interest in the team" to a group of investors and that the group would be "transitioning to majority ownership in two years".
Philanthropy[edit]
Wang is an active philanthropist and in 1999 established the Charles B. Wang Foundation with the goal of donating to numerous charities that focused on bettering the lives of children and the disenfranchised. He has worked with such causes as Smile Train, the World Childhood Foundation, the Plainview Chinese Cultural Center and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, among others. His donation of over $50 million to the State University of New York at Stony Brook for the construction of the Charles B. Wang Center was, at the time, the largest in history to a SUNY school. He also funded the expansion of the Chinatown Health Clinic which was renamed the Charles B. Wang Community Health Center.
As the co-Founder and Chairman of Smile Train in 1999, Wang originally gave $30 million to cover all administrative expenses and has remained active in the charity’s efforts to help children with cleft lip and palates, in more than 80 countries.
One of the more important attributes that Wang brought to his ownership of the Islanders was to expand their community-based programs through the Islanders Children’s Foundation, which started in 2003 and has become a mainstay. The Foundation works with children’s health, education, and youth hockey development charities. In 2006, the team created Project Hope, which is focused on developing ice hockey in China. Wang recruited women's professional hockey player, Angela Ruggiero, to the project as well.[13]
In 2000, Wang and his brothers, Anthony and Francis, donated a new law school to China's Soochow University in honor of their father Kenneth Wang and in celebration of the university's 100th anniversary,[14] it opened officially in 2003.
Computer Associates[edit]
Charles Wang and partner Russell Artzt established Computer Associates in 1976, guiding the company toward its current standing as one of the largest independent software corporations in the world. One year later, Computer Associates became the first enterprise software company to provide multi-platform products, foreshadowing its ongoing emphasis on compatibility and integration. By 1989, Computer Associates became the first software company to reach $1 billion in revenues.
Wang’s tenure as CEO of Computer Associates was marked by rapid growth, frequently as a result of strict hiring practices and high expectations for executives of acquired companies. Nearly all of CA's managers were promoted from within, so very few acquired managers were kept. Newly hired salespeople had some sales experience, but not in software. It was unusual for a technician to be considered for sales because CA's training program was geared toward products instead of professional selling. The pass/fail demarcation was sharp, so perceived inadequate sales performance meant termination. All told, Wang engaged in several dozen acquisitions and those acquired facilities were repopulated with CA employees.
He was also known for his commitment to a family-oriented management style, and for promoting several women to management positions. In 1979, three years after CA's founding, Wang had installed his older brother Tony, a one-time corporate lawyer, as president and COO. Tony held the position until his retirement in 1992 to make way for Sanjay Kumar, who joined CA via its 1987 acquisition of archrival Uccel Corporation. In 1998, Nancy Li, Charles Wang's second wife, was named CA's Chief Technology Officer ("CTO"). Responding to criticism over his so-called “paternalistic” management style, Wang has argued that the investment community punished CA's stock because of his refusal to override his sense of familial loyalty to avoid the appearance of nepotism.[15]
In 1998, Wang had initiated a $9 billion hostile takeover for the shares of Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). The Washington Post reported CSC management’s “concern” about the tender offer by alluding to CA's "ties to foreigners." It was a pointed reference to Wang's origin and that certain Chinese government institutions (as well as those in the US, Europe and elsewhere) were CA clients. The suggestion was that becoming linked with CA would jeopardize CSC's contracts with U.S. government agencies. Blaming what in his view was a witch-hunt with racial motivations, Wang dropped the tender offer.
In 2000, a class-action lawsuit accused Wang, then president Kumar and co-founder Artzt of wrongly reporting more than $2.5 billion in revenue in its 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 fiscal (April through March) years, in order to artificially inflate the stock price. A previous stock option set in 1995 specified that a certain number of shares would vest when Computer Associates' shares sustained a target price. The benchmark was met in 1998, and the three executives combined received nearly $1 billion in Computer Associates stock with Wang himself netting $700 million; he had already been the highest paid CEO in the US for the past four years.[16] Since then, at least four other class-action suits were filed against Computer Associates, all of which have named Wang specifically, and all of which were settled or dismissed without finding any liability on Wang’s part. As the controversy continued to dog Wang even after he returned a portion of the stock award, he quit as CEO in 2000, and later resigned as Chairman of the Board in 2002.[17][18][19][20]
Kumar resigned as chairman and chief executive in April 2004, following an investigation into the accounting scandal which improperly reported revenue. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted Kumar on fraud charges on September 22, 2004.[21] Kumar pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and securities fraud charges on April 24, 2006.[22]
Awards and honors[edit]
On May 3, 2009, Wang was honored by the Los Angeles Chinese Historical Society of Southern California in "Celebrating Chinese Americans in Sports".[23]
Long Island residence[edit]
Wang's Oyster Bay mansion on the Gold Coast of Long Island is located near Sagamore Hill, President Theodore Roosevelt's home.[24]

Charles B. WangFounder
Charles B. Wang is Founder and Chair Emeritus of Computer Associates, co-owner of
                  New York Islanders, and philanthropist. Coming to America from Shanghai as a child
                  of eight, Charles Wang proved a keen athlete, star student, and an outstanding businessman
                  whose software company, Computer Associates International Inc., became a world leader.
                  Wang embodies the American dream, but he is also steeped in an older heritage: "As
                  a Chinese-American I cherish the land of my birth," he says, "and I cherish the land
                  that gave me a home. I am indeed doubly blessed. It’s a long way from Shanghai to
                  Stony Brook, but thanks to technology, the world is shrinking every day, and that’s
                  a very good thing for us. As we all get to know one another, as we get to interact
                  with different cultures and different countries, the walls that divide us begin to
                  crumble."
               
Wang founded Computer Associates International, Inc. with three associates in 1976.
                  Born in Shanghai, China, in 1944, he moved to the United States with his family in
                  1952. He earned a BS degree in mathematics from Queen’s College and began his computer
                  career at Columbia University’s Riverside Research Institute as a programming trainee.
                  He is the author of Techno Vision II: Every Executive’s Guide to Understanding and Mastering Technology
                     and the Internet, which educates decision-makers about the e-Business Revolution. He serves on several
                  corporate boards and has been active in charitable causes such as the Smile Train,
                  the Make a Wish Foundation, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
                  He believes passionately that he should share the benefits of his unique experience
                  and success. As a beneficiary of public education, Wang chose to endow Stony Brook
                  University to reach those young people, many of them also immigrants, who will use
                  the gift as a gateway to success.
               P.H. TuanArchitect
Wang Center designer P.H. Tuan was born in Shanghai, China, where he completed his
                  secondary school education. After a brief stay in Hong Kong, he immigrated to America
                  in 1955. He received his architectural degree from the University of Michigan in 1961.
                  Tuan gained his early training and experience at SOM, Perkins & Will and Victor Gruen,
                  before establishing his own practice nearly thirty years ago. His practice usually
                  includes both design and construction management, based on the traditional concept
                  that the architect is responsible for the design and construction of a building, from
                  conception to completion. Tuan has described the Wang Center's unique design as "an
                  introduction to Asian architecture." Although Tuan's work is greatly influenced by
                  international currents, he resists being labelled as an "international style" architect.
               
Tuan recently designed a new university law school for 2000 students in Suzhou, China.
                  On his many trips to China, he noted that new construction has been prolific, but
                  discovered very few new buildings can be identified with China in a contemporary sense.
                  For this reason, he formed a non-profit organization, the Institute for the Advancement
                  of Contemporary Chinese Architecture (IACCA), with the long-term goal to promote a
                  new style of contemporary Chinese architecture. IACCA is currently funded by private
                  contributions.
               Jinyoung A. JinDirector, Cultural ProgramsAppointed in September 2013, Jinyoung Jin is the second director of the Charles B.
                  Wang Center at Stony Brook University. For the past ten years Jinyoung Jin was the
                  Gallery Director in the Arts Department of The Korea Society located in Manhattan.
                  A curator of modern and contemporary Asian art, Jin received her M.A in art history
                  from Columbia University. She brings to Stony Brook's Charles B. Wang Center a wide
                  range of academic training and institutional experience in cultural and artistic matters.
               
During her tenure at The Korea Society, Jin played a critical role in establishing
                  the Arts Department. She introduced diverse programs including in-house and traveling
                  exhibitions, musical performances, films, lectures and workshops that provided a wider
                  understanding of Korea and its culture to United States audiences. Jin's particular
                  focus is on visual culture, where she often explores unique subjects and materials.
                  Some of the exhibitions that Jin curated include The Hidden Beauty of Korea Captured by Five Artists from Abroad 1920s-1950s (2013), 10,000 Threads: The Collected Works of Quilt Master Kim Haeja (2011), Missionary Photography in Korea: Encountering the West Through Christianity (2009), North Korean Images at Utopia’s Edge (2008), Toy Stories: Souvenirs from Korean Childhood (2008), Korean Funerary Figures: Companions for the Journey to the Other World (2007), Gods, Demons, and Generals: Icons of Korean Shamanism (2006) and Korean Comics: A Society Through Small Frames (2005). Jin's exhibitions often garnered major laudatory reviews in the New York Times, Japan Times, L.A. Weekly and a number of academic journals.
               
As Director of Cultural Programs, Jin's primary role is to establish the Charles B.
                  Wang Center as a premier cultural venue that promotes cross-cultural exchanges and
                  an understanding of Asian and Asian-American cultures.
               
Jin has been successful in reinvigorating the Wang Center's cultural activities. She
                     envisions each exhibition as a unique jewel where the extraordinary assemblage of
                     content illuminates an aspect of Asian culture that is too little known. She strives

If He'd Never Met Charles Wang, Would ReiJane Huai Be Alive Today?

Last Monday, ReiJane Huai, the co-founder and former president and CEO of FalconStor Software, committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest in front of his Long Island home. The suicide came the day before Huai was to plead guilty to charges related to a bribery scheme that led to his ouster from FalconStor a year ago. That story has gotten fairly extensive coverage in the Long Island press. What hasn't gotten the coverage it deserves is the fact that Huai was a crony of Charles Wang, the co-founder and former CEO of Computer Associates (now CA), and that Wang and another of his cronies showed up at Huai's home sometime later on the day of the suicide. 

Huai and Wang had been close friends for years, dating back to 1996, when CA acquired Cheyenne Software, where Huai worked as the chief architect of Cheyenne's flagship ARCserve backup software product. Huai went on to become CA's executive vice president and general manager for Asia. He left CA in 2000 to start FalconStor, where he served as CEO until the bribery scheme caught up with him. That scheme involved $185,000 in payments to an employee of JPMorgan Chase to secure millions of dollars worth of business for FalconStor. What followed were an SEC investigation of FalconStor's accounting practices, a criminal proceeding by the U.S. Attorney's office, and class-action lawsuits brought by FalconStor shareholders. That brings us to this excerpt from the New York Post's coverage of the suicide:His friends -- billionaire New York Islanders owner Charles Wang and Huai's longtime legal adviser, Roy Reichbach -- arrived at the scene of the gruesome suicide [on Monday].   "They had a close working relationship for years," said a source close to Wang. "These men were very close, both professionally and personally. Mr. Wang is shocked." Wang, whose Computer Associates in 1996 paid $1.2 billion for Cheyenne Software Inc., one of Huai's former companies, surveyed the scene from behind the tinted windows of a black BMW, while Reichbach went into the mansion.




 Reichbach, Huai's "longtime legal adviser," is also Wang's longtime legal adviser. Reichbach was vice president, legal, at Computer Associates from 1994 to 2000, and he currently serves as corporate secretary and general counsel at NeuLion, Wang's struggling IPTV services provider that I wrote about in December in my post, "As Charles Wang's World Crumbles, Justice is Served." NeuLion has been hemorrhaging money that Wang's crumbling financial empire can ill afford-it lost over $19 million in 2009, over $17 million in 2010, and another $7.2 million in the first six months of this year. According to the New York Post report, Huai lived in the home with his wife, but it wasn't known if she was home at the time of the suicide, which occurred around 9:00 a.m. It's unclear who, if anyone, was home by the time Wang and Reichbach arrived. In any event, it was a peculiar scene. If Huai's wife was home, why didn't Wang go in to console her? If she wasn't, why did Reichbach go into the home while Wang stayed in his car, peering out of the tinted windows? It just seems odd. It's worth reiterating here for the benefit of anyone who's unfamiliar with the Wang saga that Wang's history at Computer Associates was a seedy one. Although he managed to dodge criminal prosecution in the accounting fraud scandal that landed his successor, Sanjay Kumar, in prison, CA's board of directors determined that Wang was the mastermind behind it all. The New York Times encapsulated the board's findings in a 2007 report:Charles B. Wang, the founder and former chairman of Computer Associates, oversaw an accounting fraud lasting more than a decade at the software company, according to a scathing report released [on April 13, 2007] by the company's board.   Mr. Wang, who owns the New York Islanders and is among the most politically influential people on Long Island, masterminded accounting gimmicks that led his company to report inflated sales and profits, the report states. As a result of the fraud, the company has been forced to spend over $500 million on fines and internal investigations. It is still struggling to rebuild the trust of employees and shareholders, the report says. In a statement, Mr. Wang said he sharply disagreed with the report's conclusions and blamed Sanjay Kumar, his hand-picked successor, for the fraud. Mr. Wang created a "culture of fear" at Computer Associates - now called CA - and deliberately put inexperienced executives in senior positions so that he would have more control, according to the report. He discouraged executives from meeting with each other and arbitrarily fired managers or employees who disagreed with him. "Fraud pervaded the entire CA organization at every level, and was embedded in CA's culture, as instilled by Mr. Wang, almost from the company's inception," the report said. Before Huai became one of Wang's Long Island cronies, he epitomized the American dream. He came to this country from Taiwan on a college scholarship, worked relentlessly and made what would be far-reaching contributions to the software industry here. He raised a family, enjoyed hard-earned financial success, and was widely admired as a software visionary. So what happened? What were the drivers of his downfall? Was he influenced by others whose skewed sense of ethics and morality made the path he ultimately chose seem acceptable? Those questions raise the one that ultimately needs to be asked: If Huai had not fallen in with the Wang crowd, would he still be alive today?

"Mr. Wang created a 'culture of fear' at Computer Associates - now called CA - and deliberately put inexperienced executives in senior positions so that he would have more control, "This may explain some quality issues with CA products I used in the early 2000s leaving a bad taste in my mouth since then.Huai "committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest"I'm no expert on suicide, but a shot to the chest seems odd.  This World Health Organization study took on the morbid task of researching average methods of suicide: http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/86/9/07-043489/en/.  The factors supporting this as a suicide are the weapon of choice (shotgun is least likely to be used in a suicide), gender (male), location (on his property), the number of bullets fired (1), and studies suggest that Asian-Americans are more likely to attempt suicide because of pressures to succeed. Shots to the chest aren't unheard of, just not the most popular method.  I think that his shady past naturally makes people wonder if he was dispatched by someone else who perhaps held a grudge - or perhaps who didn't want information to come to light in a trial.  My guess is that a "professional" would have also read the same WHO report and could easily stage a suicide.  This is all just speculation on my part, but there was certainly motive.  Sanjay Kumar is doing time for a crime that Huai was the mastermind.  That would make me just a tad bit angry.  Then again maybe Kumar is the wrong angle.  This guy left behind a trail of fraud involving major corporations and powerful players across the world.  There are probably more than a few people breathing a sigh of relief right now, and more than a few people with motive.This has all the makings of a murder mystery.  You've just got to look over the mound of evidence screaming "suicide".  Are the police quietly exploring other angles?http://libn.com/2011/09/27/ex-falconstor-ceo-dies-in-apparent-suicide/Detective Vincent Garcia, a spokesman for the Nassau County Police, said. 'We don't comment on a suicide unless it was in a public place. This was at a private residence.'The police have motive to publicly call this a suicide and buy time.  Conveniently they don't need to discuss this with the media since it occurred at a private residence.  So I wonder if it is really "case closed".

"Sanjay Kumar is doing time for a crime that Huai was the mastermind."Just to get the players straight, Wang was the mastermind behind what happened at CA, not Huai. Reply

All due respect, I am not a legal expert, only a hockey fan but writing an article claiming would someone be dead if they had not met Charles Wang or another individual is over the top. We all get you hate Wang (do you work for Sam Wyly also investigated by the government who despises CW like you?) but at some point you have to produce documented evidence that CW caused this man to kill himself or give it a rest or you are only a man with a vendetta. Lets just say for a minute all you are claiming is true? How come you did not include Sam Wyly and CA board agreeing to leave Wang alone, then months later Wyly leading the charge again to sue him and breaking his agreement? Where are the links to the articles of Wyly being investigated by the Government himself for his own business dealings? Who forced Kumar or any of these people to not call the police and resign as soon as Wang told them to do something illegal? Every December I see this article Mr Tennant, and now we get one early because one of his friends tragically took his own life. Meanwhile the governor, county execs, and politicians everywhere seem to speak with CW, who despite losing on Mangano's referendum got 67,000 people to agree to have their taxes raised for thirty years. What's next you going to tell us Kate Murray, Joe Mondello, Mangano, Suozzi, Tom Gulotta are solid, honest citizens. Did you hear Democratic Party Chairman, Jay Jacobs come off like a complete moron discussing Coliseum financing. I guess I missed the part where you included Al D'Amato in this somewhere because there is no one anywhere on Long Island with his hands in more deals with his own past scandals, not even Mondello and his mouthpiece, Kate Murray. BTW, if Wang is such a horrible person why would someone with Scott Rechler's background agree to do the Lighthouse project with him and invest 3.7 billion of likely Reckson's money? By 2005 when they combined and given the project all this information was common knowledge. How come not one elected official in the last decade has simply made these charges and outright said we will do nothing with the Islanders as long as Wang owns them because of them? Many people would support those politicians for taking such a stance.  Reply

Now I can double down on my bet that Sanjay Kumar will simply do his 12 years and not "commit suicide" when he gets out of jail.  That means he got the message to keep his mouth shut.   Reply

Article excerpt

We are witness to an immense shake-up transforming corporate North America. Organizations in the 1990s are refocusing their efforts around access to information. Until a few years ago, most centralized organizations relied on research and development and marketing to stimulate growth. Today, with the increasing emphasis on decentralized business units and the rate of technological change in our global economy, technology and information have become as critical as R&D and marketing as keys to future success. Companies that thrive and survive in our global marketplace will be information-based. Millions of dollars, including the survival of the company, are on the line to a much more intense degree than ever before. Without accurate data, companies are more at risk for every decision that must be made.  For at least the last 10 years, senior business and information systems executives have struggled with how to bring information technology and business into closer alignment, to bridge the disconnect. As business needs multiplied and the gap widened between the solutions information technology offered and the business challenges managers faced, enlightened representatives of both camps redoubled their commitment to ending the disconnect. The ideal they have been striving toward is an alignment that will optimize the provision of information technology and service to the user community.  The focus of information systems has changed from automating internal (back room) processes to enabling multifaceted mechanisms for directly delivering products or services to the customer. The increased complexity of these systems is compounded by the fact that many are used for competitive advantage, giving them life-or-death urgency. The central argument now becomes how to organize information technology to achieve higher levels of competitive advantage.  With today's shorter product cycles, the old information technology culture leads inevitably to large development backlogs and missed delivery targets. Corporate efforts to hold down total information technology costs also are symptoms of the old mentality and can be problematic, given strenuous business unit competition for available, sometimes even scarce, information technology resources.  Notwithstanding a greater melding of information technology and business units, alignment efforts must maintain standards for professional information technology work and systems, and allow information technology professionals practical career options. If you can get opportunity and technology together, you have a better chance to identify competitive-advantage systems.  Companies that have internalized these new realities have substantially eliminated the disconnect. Sometimes they are termed learning organizations. Others call them virtual organizations. By whatever name they are called, these companies have the ability to access and process information on global competitive intelligence, new product information, research and development, market trends, and environmental and regulatory impacts. Having done so, they can quickly act and then move on to the next challenge. Eliminating the disconnect removes many of the obstacles that keep today's organizations paralyzed.  Many methods for aligning information technology resources and business goals are already in use at many companies. I am privileged to visit hundreds of companies every year and I have observed many methods and strategies for aligning business and technology. My conclusion is that there are as many strategies as there are companies. Every organization presents a unique set of constraints and opportunities. Yet in the course of visits to companies, large and small, I have found that a core set of business strategies is common to the most successful companies. I have identified five key strategies that learning organizations can take to eliminate the disconnect. A combination of these methods is probably the best guarantee of across-the-board success because each of these strategies has its own inherent risks. …
