 Investment Highlights  M&A-based business model is in line with broader market trends 	Continually seeking early-stage companies with strong growth potential 	Compelling array of valuable resources 	Clearly demonstrated ability to attract growth-oriented companies 	Visionary management team with more than a century of combined experience     Business Strategy  iGambit, Inc. (IGMB) leverages the experience of its diversified management team to acquire and develop other companies with recurring revenue models. Following acquisition, management provides the guidance, solutions and synergies needed to promote accelerated growth and high-margin earnings. The ultimate goal is to help the acquired entities emerge as industry leaders with steady growth patterns. Companies who partner with iGambit benefit from the financial and technical management experience of a leadership team with direct hands-on experience building multi-million dollar businesses in short time frames. iGambit prides itself on enabling talented entrepreneurs to focus their energies on building a business and not having to worry about raising capital or dealing with investors.    ArcMail Subsidiary  Founded in 2005 and acquired as a wholly owned subsidiary of iGambit in 2015, ArcMail provides enterprise information and email archiving solutions for businesses of all sizes across a wide range of vertical markets. The company's primary aim is to help businesses and public sector organizations implement effective email archiving programs, boost email server performance and satisfy regulatory requirements. ArcMail's deployment options include a turnkey appliance, a virtual machine (VM) software (VMware or MS Hyper-V), a storage gateway (which can store to a SAN, NAS, or any cloud-based storage provider), and fully hosted. In 2016, ArcMail was recognized as a "Top 20 Enterprise Security Company" by CIOReview and "One of the 50 Most Innovative Companies to Watch" by The Silicon Review. The company's archiving solutions help organizations create and implement a fully compliant enterprise information and email archiving strategy, as well offers a host of benefits for their various archiving needs, including:  Ease of use/ease of deployment 	Compliance and eDiscovery tools and capabilities 	Storage management and server performance 	Archiving data sources beyond email 	Flexible deployment models 	Quality and expertise of customer support  Email Archiving Organizations in regulated environments must evaluate their archiving capabilities to ensure they are mitigating risks and fully capable of complying with eDiscovery requests and regulatory compliance requirements. Without the proper tools and processes, this can be extremely time consuming and if not properly done can put the company at risk. ArcMail's enterprise information and email archiving solutions support all eDiscovery requests for electronically stored information, making the product ideal for regulated industries - such as healthcare, financial services, legal services, government, education and more – in which an organization is required to keep email messages for possible legal proceedings or compliance audits. Although the bulk of electronic data subject to eDiscovery is email, requests can also include corporate social media posts, databases, photos, videos and other office documents and file types. ArcMail's archiving products are designed to mitigate risk with an easy-to-deploy and easy-to-manage solution that works simply, affordably and effectively.   Archiving Appliances The award-winning ArcMail Defender line of archiving appliances offers 1-32 TB of data storage and can easily and economically be scaled beyond that to meet a company's growing data requirements. The Defender takes into account all the latest platforms and technologies, so that every content type – including email attachments -- is indexed, archived and readily accessible. Whether a company uses multiple email domains, messaging, or collaboration platforms, the Defender archives all important business data and integrates and automates it so it works together under a single archiving repository. ArcMail's Defender ensures that its customers' most valuable content is there when they need it and out of the way when they don't.   Cloud/On-Premise Hybrid Gateway ArcMail's Cloud/On-Premise Hybrid Gateway securely encrypts electronic communications and attachments and stores them in the remote location of the customer's choice, and for as long as is desired. Customers can also choose to store locally on their SAN or NAS storage solution using Fibre channel or iSCSI connectivity and can select any mixture of on-site and cloud storage. For the highly regulated healthcare, financial services, and government industries, ArcMail's Cloud/On-Premise Hybrid Gateway enables the organization to scale archived data in a cost-effective and simple manner. Additionally, instead of being locked into a cloud storage vendor, Hybrid Gateway customers have the freedom to choose virtually any cloud storage partner -- Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud Files, Microsoft Azure and OpenStack, among others.   Fully Hosted Archiving Services Archiving and protecting an enterprise's most valuable electronic data has become increasingly complex. The broader IT ecosystem is made up of more data types and higher volumes than ever before, and the stakes are incredibly high. The risk of lost or unavailable data and the time required to manage electronic data, deal with an eDiscovery request, and/or respond to a regulatory audit can be overwhelming for already overburdened IT team. For companies who are better served by outsourcing their email and other electronic data archiving, ArcMail's Fully-Hosted Archiving Service is a simple solution, whether archiving is required for eDiscovery, compliance, or ongoing information governance. ArcMail's Fully-Hosted Archiving Service provides a turnkey approach to reliable and secure managed enterprise archiving. Because archived data is in a secure off-site location, an organization has no additional storage to manage, no more bogged down servers, and can trust in a secure, redundant data repository for its business.    M&A Market Trends  The annual Deloitte M&A Trends Report provides insights and year-to-year data on anticipated M&A activity, deal dynamics, top sectors and geographies. The 2016 report showed that while 2015 was a record year for mergers and acquisitions, many market leaders are forecasting deal activity to hold steady if not climb higher. Deloitte's survey taps into the expertise of 2,292 executives involved in M&A at U.S. corporations (78%) and private equity firms (22%). The 2016 survey reveals increases in smaller strategic deals and divestitures, as well as continued interest in cross-border opportunities and the use of data analytics. Additionally, despite some areas of concern, 87% of executives at U.S. corporations and private equity firms predict their organizations' deal volume will continue, if not increase in 2016. For the third consecutive year, technology remains the hottest sector for deal-making, followed by oil & gas and then healthcare. "The convergence of technology across industries is adding a new dimension to deal making. For instance, banks are working to deepen their capabilities by acquiring financial technology firms, automobile companies have turned their attention to connected vehicles, and similar activity is happening in health care. As sectors converge with technology, the strong impacts these deals have on financial markets will continue, and analyzing deal activity will need to evolve to account for the new hybrid sectors emerging," Russell Thomson, managing partner of Deloitte's U.S. merger and acquisitions services practice, stated in the news release announcing the report. In line with the patterns found in the third annual M&A report, iGambit is positioned to leverage the momentum of the broader M&A market and utilize its expertise to acquire revenue-generating companies and help them emerge as industry leaders. With its acquisition of ArcMail, iGambit demonstrates its ability and foresight to participate in advantageous markets.    Management     Rory Welch - President and Chief Executive Officer of ArcMail With 20+ years of senior management experience cutting across multiple industries and global geographies, Rory Welch brings important perspective and expertise to serving many vertical markets as he leads ArcMail through its next phase of growth.
