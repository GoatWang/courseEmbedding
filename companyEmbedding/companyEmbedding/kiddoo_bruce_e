What are analysts saying about Maxim Integrated Products stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Maxim Integrated Products stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Maxim is an OEM of analog and mixed signal ICs. The fiscal third-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. Maxim has a solid portfolio that generates steady design wins, a highly profitable and well-diversified core business, a policy of maintaining efficiency that has led to cost cutting measures and regular cash returns.  Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks. However, the diversification of the consumer revenue across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals and smartphones is adding stability to the company’s business profile." (6/28/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "MXIM delivered another round of beat/raise results with F3Q (March) sales/EPS of $581M/$0.56 besting the Street’s $576M/$0.52, and F4Q (June) guidance of $610M/ $0.62 easily ahead of consensus $598M/$0.58. Auto/industrial (~50% of sales) is driving upside. GM of 65.2% was just ahead of mgmt’s LT target and expected up another 100bps Q/Q in F4Q. Investors would typically cheer such a solid upside result/ outlook; however, mgmt commentary concerning slowing auto orders could temper enthusiasm near term. In addition to MXIM, semiconductor auto bellwethers include NXPI, ADI, and TXN." (4/21/2017)

MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: $47.13 (4.49% upside)

Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code).

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.
