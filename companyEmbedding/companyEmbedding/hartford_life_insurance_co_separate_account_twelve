Under the provisions of FATCA, insurers may need to obtain withholding certificates (IRS Forms W-8 or W-9) from their business partners. Typically, a W-8 is provided by non-U.S. entities and a W-9 is provided by U.S. entities. Business partners conducting business with The Hartford may request copies of these completed forms from taxcompliance2@thehartford.com.
 
Additionally, copies of blank IRS forms (W-8 and W-9) and further information can be found on the IRS website.

	Great rates and rewards on car insurance from The Hartford.
Switch your car insurance to the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford1 and save. Enjoy great rates that recognize your experience and the extra benefits you deserve as an AARP member. You may even be eligible for additional savings. To learn more about the added automobile insurance savings and benefits for which you are eligible, get a quote. It’s easy!
 

Lifetime Renewability
Once you have an auto insurance policy with The Hartford, your coverage will be renewed for as long as you’re able to drive. Just meet a few simple requirements such as maintaining a valid driver's license and paying your premiums.†
 



12-Month Rate Protection
You can relax knowing your low auto insurance premium is locked-in for a full year. This sets us apart from other insurers who may change rates every six months or even sooner.
 

RecoverCare – Assistance After an Accident
The Hartford is here for you if you're injured in an automobile accident. This coverage provides reimbursement for essential home services you cannot perform yourself, such as house cleaning, lawn maintenance, and even dog walking. This coverage applies when injuries are not already covered by Medicare or health insurance.§
 

New Car Replacement Coverage
If you total your new car within the first 15 months or 15,000 miles after you buy it (whichever comes first), we’ll pay to replace it with a new vehicle of the same make, model and equipment – with no deduction for depreciation.§§
 

Lifetime Car Repair Assurance
Use one of the 1,600+ authorized repair shops in our approved network, and we’ll stand behind the workmanship of covered repairs for as long as you own or lease your vehicle. With this great coverage, you won’t have to go through the hassle of finding a trusted repair service after an accident.
 

24/7 Claims Hotline
Accidents can happen any time of day or night and you deserve an automobile insurance company that can respond immediately no matter what time you call. You can reach our claims reporting service 24/7, and we’ll walk you through the car insurance claims process. Our 6-Point Claim Commitment is your assurance of getting prompt, caring service from the start of your claim to the end.
 

Enjoy even more car insurance protection.


ADVANTAGE PLUS Program‡
In addition to the features and benefits mentioned above, the Advantage PLUS package includes:
 

First Accident Forgiveness 
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while. Once you qualify, if you’re involved in an accident, that first accident will be forgiven and your premium won’t increase as a result. To qualify, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for five consecutive years.
 

Disappearing Deductible
We believe in rewarding great drivers. With our disappearing deductible, your collision deductible on your car insurance policy will go down each year – all the way to $0 – as long as you maintain a clean driving record.‡
 

One Deductible
If you file a claim for a loss involving two of your vehicles that are covered by a car insurance policy with The Hartford, you'll pay only one deductible – whichever is higher – for the covered losses to the vehicles. This benefit also applies if your car and home are involved in the same covered loss and you carry homeowners insurance with The Hartford. You'll pay only the highest deductible.‡
 

Waiver of Deductible for a Not-At-Fault Accident
In most cases, if you are not at fault in an accident, The Hartford will waive your deductible.
 

$100 Deductible Reduction
Typically, even if you’re not at fault, you may have to pay out of pocket for repair costs that fall below the deductible amount of your car insurance policy. With The Hartford, you can have your car repaired at any shop you choose. However, when you elect to use a Hartford-authorized shop for vehicle repair, we’ll reduce your collision deductible by $100. Not available in all states.
 
 
† If you are age 50 or older, once you're insured through this Program for at least 60 days, you cannot be refused renewal as long as applicable premiums are paid when due. Also, you and other customary drivers of your vehicles must retain valid licenses, remain physically and mentally capable of operating an automobile, have no convictions for driving while intoxicated and must not have obtained your policy through material misrepresentation. Benefit currently not available in HI, MI, NH and NC.
 

§ Availability of RecoverCare benefit and benefit levels vary by state. The Hartford RecoverCare Advantage® is a registered mark of The Hartford.
 
§§ Limitations apply.
 
‡ Some benefits, including First Accident Forgiveness and the Disappearing Deductible, are only available with the Advantage Plus package. A policy without these benefits is also available. [Call for details.] To qualify for the Accident Forgiveness benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record (no accidents or violations) for five consecutive years. First Accident Forgiveness is not available to CA policyholders. To qualify for the Disappearing Collision Deductible benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for three consecutive years. NY drivers are not eligible for the complete disappearance of the deductible, although it will be reduced to a minimum of $100. The Advantage Plus package option, the Disappearing Deductible benefit and the Accident Forgiveness benefit are not available in all states.

	Tailor your car insurance at a rate you can afford.

With the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford, you don’t have to sacrifice to save. You can tailor your car insurance coverage to suit your needs at a rate you can afford.
 
A cracked windshield. A dented fender. Injuries that require medical care. Accidents can be costly. Feel confident behind the wheel knowing you have the car insurance coverage you need. Here’s how our coverages help protect you:
 

Collision Coverage
Helps pay for damage done to your car in the event of a collision – whether it’s with another vehicle or an object. For example, if you back into a tree and damage your car, this coverage could help pay the repair fees.
 
Learn About Collision
 

Non-Collision Damage
Also known as “comprehensive,” this car insurance coverage helps pay for “non-collision” damage to your car resulting from things like natural disasters, theft and vandalism. For example, if you park your car under a tree during a snowstorm and heavy snow takes down a branch and breaks your windshield, non-collision damage insurance could help pay the cost to repair the damage to your car.

 
Learn About Non-Collision
 


Car Insurance Medical Payments
Helps cover medical care, recovery, rehab, and remedial care for you and your family after an auto accident.

 
Learn About Medical Payments
 


Auto Policy Bodily Injury Liability
This coverage can protect you against financial loss and helps pay the legal costs in the event you cause an auto accident injuring another person. For example, if you accidentally run a red light, or spin out in the snow and end up injuring another person, this coverage could help cover the costs of those injuries.

 
Learn About Bodily Injury
 


Property Damage Liability
Pays for damage your vehicle causes to other people's property (e.g. fences, mailboxes, other vehicles). For example, if your car slides out in the rain and you take out a neighbor’s mailbox or damage their landscaping, this insurance could help pay for the damages.

 
Learn About Property Damage
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury
Pays bodily injury and death expenses for you and your passengers if you're hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver.

 
Learn About Uninsured Bodily Injury
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Property Damage
Helps pay for damage to your vehicle if your vehicle is struck by an uninsured driver, a hit-and-run driver, or an insured driver whose property damage liability limit is too low to cover the losses, this coverage helps pay for the damage.

 
Learn About Uninsured Property Damage
 


Personal Injury Protection a.k.a. “No-Fault Insurance”
Pays for losses tied only to injuries – regardless of who caused the accident. This can be especially helpful after an accident that involves multiple cars. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About No-Fault Insurance
 


Glass Coverage
Full glass coverage pays the amount of a covered glass loss with no deductible. For example, let’s say your car gets broken into overnight and a window is smashed. The estimate to repair it comes in at $600. If you have comprehensive automobile insurance but not auto glass coverage, you will have to pay your deductible before insurance begins to cover the cost to repair the windshield.
 
If you have full glass coverage, the expense of repairing the window is covered in full with no out-of-pocket costs to you. This coverage is optional on your auto insurance policy and can be purchased for an additional premium. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About Glass
 


Towing Coverage
This coverage helps pay towing and labor charges associated with getting your vehicle running again in the event of a break down. For example, if your car battery dies on the interstate, this coverage could help pay for the costs of having your vehicle jumped started.

 
Learn About Towing
 


Rental Car Expense
Transportation Expense coverage helps to pay for a rental car in the event of a covered comprehensive or collision loss. For example, you slide off a wet road crashing into a tree, this coverage could help pay for the charges to rent a replacement vehicle while yours is in the shop for repairs.

 
Learn About Rental Expense
 


Personal Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella coverage goes beyond accidents and damages and helps when a covered loss exceeds the liability coverage limits of your home or auto policies. For example, if you are sued and the legal costs exceed the limits of your primary coverage, umbrella coverage can help cover the excess costs.

DRAFT

Enhance Your Variable Annuity Options
�
The Hartford�s Enhanced Surrender Value Offer
�
You�re eligible for an offer that may enhance the surrender value of your variable annuity with The Hartford.
�
When you purchased a variable annuity with The Hartford, you most likely did so to meet your needs for the future, including retirement.
�
The Lifetime Income Builder II optional benefit you purchased as part of your variable annuity is designed to provide a stream of guaranteed lifetime income that will not decrease due to negative market performance and has the potential to increase based on increases in the Contract Value due to positive market performance.
�
Your needs may have changed since you purchased your annuity with The Hartford. For example, you may have an unexpected need for liquidity that your variable annuity doesn�t provide or you would like access to your Contract Value.
�
This brochure is designed to help provide information as you consider this offer. You should discuss this offer carefully with your financial advisor to determine whether it�s right for you.
�
Who does this offer apply to?
�
This offer applies to Director M and Leaders 3 variable annuities (generally offered between August�2006 and October�2008) with the Lifetime Income Builder II optional benefit rider.� For full eligibility rules, please refer to your prospectus supplement.
�
Being eligible does not always equate to this offer having an increased surrender value for you. This offer is entirely voluntary and you should discuss the offer with your financial advisor to determine if it�s appropriate for you.
�
What are my options?
�
1.������������� Participate in the Enhanced Surrender Value offer. If you do so, you�ll surrender your contract and either receive an amount greater than your current Contract Value or avoid incurring certain charges associated with a full surrender of your contract.
�
2.������������� Determine that you don�t want to participate in this offer. If you choose not to participate, you don�t need to do anything. We�ll continue to service your contract and are committed to honoring our obligations to you.
�
You should discuss your options with your financial advisor. This offer may not be available in all states.
�




�
Why is The Hartford making me this offer?
�
As part of the company�s long-term strategy, we are currently taking steps to reduce the risks associated with our annuity business. We also realize that for some contract holders, taking advantage of this offer may help meet current financial needs that differ from the ones you identified when you purchased your variable annuity.
�
What do I receive if I participate in this program?
�
You�ll receive the greater of:
�
������������������ Your Contract Value OR
�
������������������ Your Contract Value plus 20% of your Payment Base, not to exceed a cap of 90% of your Payment Base.
�
For the purposes of this offer, your Payment Base is locked in as of your offer date noted in the enclosed letter, and no automatic Payment Base increases will apply. The cap will be adjusted for any Partial Surrenders taken between the offer date and the Valuation Day the Enhanced Surrender Value is calculated. Your Contract Value will continue to fluctuate based on market performance.
�
If you decide not to accept this offer, your contract will retain the Lifetime Income Builder II benefit riders (including Payment Base increases, if applicable), and any benefits provided under other riders you may own including death benefits.
�
What benefits do I give up if I participate in this offer?
�
The decision to accept this offer is irrevocable and you must surrender your annuity contract.� This means that you�ll no longer be able to receive Lifetime Benefit Payments as guaranteed by your Lifetime Income Builder II rider.� Also, any death benefit guarantee ceases upon the surrender of your annuity contract.
�
How do I participate in this offer?
�
If you decide you want to accept this offer, you must complete the enclosed acknowledgement form along with a full surrender request or request to send the proceeds to another provider. While this offer is in effect, any request for a full surrender of your contract received in good order but without a completed acknowledgement form will not receive the benefit of this offer. Again, we recommend that you discuss your options and the specifics of your situation in detail with your financial advisor.
�
Is there a deadline?
�
The Hartford reserves the right to end the offer at any time; however a deadline has not been set. Prior to the offer expiring we�ll notify you in writing.
�
What should I consider as I make my decision?
�
If you participate in this offer, you will fully surrender your Director M or Leaders 3 variable annuity, as well as your Lifetime Income Builder II rider benefits, and any benefits provided under other riders you may own including death benefits. This means you�ll no longer receive Lifetime Benefit Payments and Death Benefit protection provided under the Lifetime Income Builder II rider. Your contract will be terminated and the benefits cannot be reinstated after accepting this offer.
�
This offer may not be right for everyone and you have full discretion regarding whether to accept this offer or not. We�ll continue to honor all of our financial obligations to our contract holders and are here to support you as you consult with your financial advisor to determine what the right decision is for you.
�

EXAMPLES:
�
Upon a full surrender, the Offer provides the greater of:
�
(1)�the Contract Value (CV) plus 20% of the Payment Base (PB), capped at 90% of Payment Base
(2)�the Contract Value, applicable charges will be waived
�
Example #1 � Offer is the contract value plus 20% of the PB
Contract Value = $60,000
Payment Base = $100,000
90% of Payment Base = $90,000
(CV) $60,000 + (20% x (PB) $100,000) = $80,000
Offer = $80,000
�
Example #2 � Offer is capped at 90% of the PB
Contract Value = $80,000
Payment Base = $110,000
90% of Payment Base = $99,000
(CV) $80,000 + (20% x (PB) $110,000) = $102,000
Offer = $99,000
�
Example #2 � Offer is contract value, applicable charges waived
Contract Value = $120,000
Payment Base = $125,000
90% of Payment Base = 112,500
The Contract Value is already above the ESV cap of 90% of the PB
Offer = $120,000

Group Retiree Health

















	Reduce your risk, not their coverage.


Baby boomers are retiring at record levels, which means companies that offer retiree health insurance are at greater risk, especially those that self-fund their plan. The Hartford can help. For over 25 years, we’ve offered flexible group retiree health insurance solutions that shift the risk away from employers while providing flexible solutions to meet the unique needs of their retirees.
 

Retiree health coverage makes sense.
In today’s economy, medical inflation is putting great pressure on retirees and the medical plans they rely on. As administrative resources continue to shrink, the retirement population is expanding. Fortunately, The Hartford’s Group Retiree Insurance Plan is a solution that can work for employers and their retirees.
 

Be good to your retirees and your budget.
Our Group Retiree Insurance Plan helps employers accomplish 3 key goals:
 


		Fulfills an important obligation to retirees.

		Integrates with Medicare, taking advantage of Medicare's cost-containment measures.

		Takes retirees out of the active employee medical plan, which can improve the efficiency of the employee plan.
		 





We’ll help integrate your plan with Medicare.
The Hartford's fully insured Group Retiree Health Insurance Plan can help pay Medicare-eligible deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket medical expenses not covered by Medicare. This helps relieve companies of the retirement benefit burden and may even lower their costs. Here are some other benefits employers can expect from The Hartford:
 


		We can support multiple group sizes, from as few as two to thousands and can customize plans for groups of 100 or more.

		Retirees, their spouses, widow(er)s, and domestic partners age 65+ who are entitled to Medicare are all eligible and coverage is guaranteed (subject to any applicable pre-existing condition limitation).

		We can help employers better control overall costs by segmenting age 65+ retirees into our voluntary and non-contributory plans.

		Rx Prescription Drug Plans can be accessed through separate providers with the ability to combine billing with medical.

		Employers can choose from a variety of prescription drug plan options to best suit the needs of their retirees.

		Retirees have access to any provider or hospital nationwide – at home or away. (There are no medical networks to worry about.)

		Our plan integrates with Medicare Parts A and B. Medicare pays first; our group plan pays second.
		 


Your employees will love these optional enhancements.
Offer custom fit coverage to your employees with these great enhancements1:
 
Hearing – Provides:
 


		One routine hearing and balance exam every 12 months.

		Two hearing aids every three years.

		One hearing aid fitting evaluation every three years.

		Flexible plan design options with various calendar year maximums and deductibles.

 
Vision – Provides:
 


		One routine vision exam every 12 months.

		One pair of glasses every 12 months, or a 12 month supply of contact lenses.

		Flexible plan design options with various calendar year maximums and deductibles.


 

Annual Physical – Provides:
 


		Review of medical history.

		Check of memory and mental quickness.

		Check of blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate and temperature.

		Examination of the heart, lungs, head and neck, abdominal, neurological, and dermatological areas.

		Laboratory testing for a complete blood count, chemistry panel, and lipid panel.



Add great coverage enhancements not typically covered by Medicare1:


Acupuncture

Acupuncture has been known to treat conditions such as anxiety, arthritis, chronic pain, stress and more.  Although Medicare doesn’t cover these types of services, our Group Retiree Health Plan gives retirees access to this traditional practice.
 


Chiropractic

Chiropractic care focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system and is used most often to treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including but not limited to back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches. Although Medicare doesn’t cover chiropractic services, your Group Retiree Health Plan can. 
 

Making it easier to administer.
Why shoulder the administrative burden when it can be offloaded to The Hartford's approved third-party administrators? Our services help ensure employers receive the best administration support:
 


		A choice of billing options including list, direct or a combination, with the ability to manage all types of vesting schedules.

		A variety of enrollment options to meet employer needs.

		Electronic claims processing and payment.

		A toll-free customer service number for retirees, employers and providers.

		Online capabilities to support inquiries about benefits and claims.

		Customer service representatives trained in senior care relations.

		HIPAA compliant administration.

 

Flexible alternatives for outpatient Rx.
Medicare participants now have access to prescription drug coverage through Medicare Part D. This allows for more cost-saving options through Medicare programs. The Hartford offers a flexible alternative to include prescription drug coverage through our partnership with a leading Medicare Part D carrier. Some of the benefits of this approach include:
 


		Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) solutions using CMS-approved group products.

		One plan to cover all of an employer’s retirees located in the United States.

		Access to pharmacies across the country, and coverage under a broad formulary for retirees.

		Combined billing with our medical plans – a simplified approach provided by The Hartford.



	We support a wide demographic of eligible enrollees.
We extend our coverage to one of the broadest demographics in the insurance industry. These are some of the many groups that we cover:
 


		Retirees plus their spouses, widow(er)s, and domestic partners who are 65+ and entitled to Medicare

		Corporations

		Partnerships

		Individual employers

		Labor unions

		Religious organizations

		Multiple Employer Trusts (MET)

		Most government agencies or departments

 
Customized plans are available for groups of 100 or more.

the Premium Payments invested in a particular Fund) and approximately $36
million ((excluding corporate-sponsorship related perquisites) or approximately
0.05% based on average total individual variable annuity assets), respectively.



LEGAL MATTERS



There continues to be significant federal and state regulatory activity relating
to financial services companies. Like other insurance companies, we are involved
in lawsuits, arbitrations, and regulatory/legal proceedings. Certain of the
lawsuits and legal actions the Company is involved in assert claims for
substantial amounts. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the
ultimate outcome of any pending or future case, legal proceeding or regulatory
action, we do not expect the ultimate result of any of these actions to result
in a material adverse effect on the Company or its Separate Accounts.
Nonetheless, given the large or indeterminate amounts sought in certain of these
actions, and the inherent unpredictability of litigation, an adverse outcome in
certain matters could, from time to time, have a material adverse effect on the
Company's results of operations or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual
periods.

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

External recognition[edit]
In 2008, the Ethisphere Institute named The Hartford one of the "World’s Most Ethical Companies" for the first time,[9] and was subsequently recognized in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.[10]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
