Key precursors of perceived customer value included in the model are valence of on-line shopping experience, perceived product quality, perceived risk, and product price. Relationships among these variables (as well as mediating variables) and their relationship to on-line shoppers' value perceptions are explored. The theoretical framework proposed in this work expands on previous efforts on perceived customer value by including new variables relevant to an e-commerce setting and by integrating several key variables into one model. The preliminary findings lead to several implications. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Specialties of Dubinsky David J Attorney:

Attorneys













Attorneys: A lawyer is a person who practices law, as an advocate, barrister, attorney, counselor or solicitor or chartered legal executive. Working as a lawyer involves the practical application of abstract legal theories and knowledge to solve specific individualized problems, or to advance the interests of those who hire lawyers to perform legal services. The role of the lawyer varies greatly across legal jurisdictions, and so it can be treated here in only the most general terms.
