FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements of expected future developments, as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business, operations and industry that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements regarding our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our future results and financial condition may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under "Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements." This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is based on financial data derived from the financial statements prepared in accordance with the United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and certain other financial data that is prepared using non-GAAP measures. For a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP components, see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" at the end of this Item, and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Our MD&A is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to assist readers in understanding our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Overview SunCoke Energy, Inc. ("SunCoke Energy," "Company," "we," "our" and "us") is the largest independent producer of high-quality coke in the Americas, as measured by tons of coke produced each year, and has more than 50 years of coke production experience. Coke is a principal raw material in the blast furnace steelmaking process. Coke is generally produced by heating metallurgical coal in a refractory oven, which releases certain volatile components from the coal, thus transforming the coal into coke. We have designed, developed, built, own and operate five cokemaking facilities in the United States ("U.S."), which consist of our Haverhill Coke Company LLC ("Haverhill"), Middletown Coke Company, LLC ("Middletown"), Gateway Energy and Coke Company, LLC ("Granite City"), Jewell Coke Company, L.P. ("Jewell") and Indiana Harbor Coke Company ("Indiana Harbor") cokemaking facilities. These five cokemaking facilities have collective nameplate capacity to produce approximately 4.2 million tons of coke per year. Additionally, we have designed and operate one cokemaking facility in Brazil under licensing and operating agreements on behalf of our customers. All of our U.S. coke sales are made pursuant to long-term, take-or-pay agreements. These coke sales agreements have an average remaining term of approximately seven years and contain pass-through provisions for costs we incur in the cokemaking process, including coal costs (subject to meeting contractual coal-to-coke yields), operating and maintenance expenses, costs related to the transportation of coke to our customers, taxes (other than income taxes) and costs associated with changes in regulation. The coke sales agreement and energy sales agreement with AK Steel Holding Corporation ("AK Steel") at our Haverhill facility are subject to early termination by AK Steel under limited circumstances and provided that AK Steel has given at least two years prior notice of its intention to terminate the agreements and certain other conditions are met. No other coke sales contract has an early termination clause. Our core business model is predicated on providing steelmakers an alternative to investing capital in their own captive coke production facilities. We direct our marketing efforts principally towards steelmaking customers that require coke for use in their blast furnaces. While our steelmaking customers are operating in an environment that is challenged by global overcapacity, our customers have continued to see increases in steel pricing and positive signals on trade and infrastructure during the first half of 2017. Despite the improved market trends over the last year, AK Steel and United States Steel Corporation ("U.S. Steel") have kept portions of their Ashland Kentucky Works facility and Granite City Works facility idled as they await further signs of market stability. While market challenges remain, our customers continue to comply with the terms of their long-term, take-or-pay contracts with us. Our Granite City facility and the first phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill I have steam generation facilities, which use hot flue gas from the cokemaking process to produce steam for sale to customers, pursuant to steam supply and purchase agreements. Granite City sells steam to U.S. Steel and Haverhill I provides steam, at minimal cost, to Altivia Petrochemicals, LLC ("Altivia"). Our Middletown facility and the second phase of our Haverhill facility, or Haverhill II, have cogeneration plants that use the hot flue gas created by the cokemaking process to generate electricity, which either is sold into the regional power market or to AK Steel pursuant to energy sales agreements.  Table of Contents  The following table sets forth information about our cokemaking facilities and our coke and energy sales agreements as of June 30, 2017:   Annual Cokemaking Year of Contract Number of Capacity Facility Location Customer Start Up Expiration Coke Ovens (thousands of tons) Use of Waste Heat Owned and Operated: Jewell Vansant, Virginia ArcelorMittal 1962 2020 142 720 Partially used for thermal coal drying Indiana Harbor East Chicago, Indiana ArcelorMittal 1998 2023 268 1,220 Heat for power generation Haverhill Phase I Franklin Furnace, Ohio ArcelorMittal 2005 2020 100 550 Process steam Haverhill Phase II Franklin Furnace, Ohio AK Steel 2008 2022 100 550 Power generation Granite City Granite City, Illinois U.S. Steel 2009 2025 120 650 Steam for power generation Middletown(1) Middletown, Ohio AK Steel 2011 2032 100 550 Power generation 830 4,240 Operated: Vit�ria Vit�ria, Brazil ArcelorMittal 2007 2023 320 1,700 Steam for power generation 1,150 5,940 Equity Method Investment: VISA SunCoke(2) Odisha, India Various 2007 NA 88 440 Steam for power generation Total 1,238 6,380  (1) Cokemaking capacity represents stated capacity for production of blast furnace coke. The Middletown coke sales agreement provides for coke sales on a "run of oven" basis, which includes both blast furnace coke and small coke. Middletown nameplate capacity on a "run of oven" basis is 578 thousand tons per year.  (2) We hold a 49 percent investment in a cokemaking joint venture with VISA Steel Limited in India ("VISA SunCoke"), which was fully impaired in 2015, and consequently, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2015, we no longer included our share of VISA SunCoke in our financial results. Cokemaking capacity represents 100 percent of VISA SunCoke.  The Partnership owns and operates a coal logistics business, which provides coal handling and/or mixing services to third-party customers as well as to our own cokemaking facilities. The Partnership's coal logistics business consists of Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT"), Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT") and SunCoke Lake Terminal, LLC ("Lake Terminal"). The Partnership's coal logistics business has collective capacity to mix and/or transload approximately 40 million tons of coal annually and store approximately 3 million tons. CMT is one of the largest export terminals on the U.S. gulf coast and has direct rail access and the capability to transload approximately 15 million tons of coal annually through its operations in Convent, Louisiana. The facility is supported by long-term, take-or-pay contracts with volume commitments covering 10 million tons of its current capacity. KRT is a leading metallurgical and thermal coal mixing and handling terminal service provider with collective capacity to mix and transload approximately 25 million tons of coal annually through operations in West Virginia. The Partnership's terminal located in East Chicago, Indiana, Lake Terminal, provides coal handling and mixing services to our Indiana Harbor cokemaking operations. The Company also owns Dismal River Terminal LLC ("DRT"), which is located in Virginia adjacent to our Jewell cokemaking facility and was formed to accommodate Jewell in its direct procurement of third-party coal, beginning in 2016. Coal is transported from the mine site in numerous ways, including rail, truck, barge or ship. The Partnership's coal terminals act as intermediaries between coal producers and coal end users by providing transloading, storage and mixing services. The Partnership does not take possession of coal in its coal logistics business, but instead earns revenue by providing coal handling and/or mixing services to its customers on a fee per ton basis. Mixing and/or handling services are provided to steel, coke (including some of our domestic cokemaking facilities), electric utility and coal producing customers.  Table of Contents  The financial performance of the Partnership's coal logistics business is substantially dependent upon a limited number of customers. The Partnership's CMT customers are impacted by seaborne export market dynamics. Fluctuations in the benchmark price for coal delivery into northwest Europe, as referenced in the Argus/McCloskey's Coal Price Index report ("API2 index price"), contribute to the Partnership's customers' decisions to place tons into the export market and thus impact transloading volumes through the Partnership's terminal facility. The Partnership's KRT terminals are primarily impacted by the domestic coal markets in which its customers operate and generally benefit from extreme weather conditions.  In April 2017, the Company announced the termination of discussions with the Conflicts Committee of the Board of Directors of the Partnership regarding our proposal to acquire all of the Partnership's common units not already owned by the Company ("Simplification Transaction"), announced on October 31, 2016. The Conflicts Committee and its independent advisors reviewed the proposal made by the Company and had several discussions with the Company regarding the potential transaction. At this time, the parties determined that they will not be able to reach an agreement and have therefore terminated discussions regarding the proposed Simplification Transaction.  See "Items Impacting Comparability" below for further details on the Partnership's debt refinancing.   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Increase Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Sales and other operating revenue(1) $ 323.2 $ 292.7 $ 30.5 $ 632.9 $ 603.8 $ 29.1 Net cash provided by operating activities(2) $ 24.9 $ 92.1 $ (67.2 ) $ 54.4 $ 121.5 $ (67.1 ) Adjusted EBITDA(1) $ 47.5 $ 46.5 $ 1.0 $ 103.1 $ 90.3 $ 12.8  (1) See analysis of changes described in "Analysis of Segment Results."  (2) See analysis of changes described in "Liquidity and Capital Resources."  Table of Contents  Items Impacting Comparability Debt Activities. During the second quarter of 2017, the Partnership refinanced its debt obligations. The Partnership received $620.6 million of proceeds, net of an original issue discount of $9.4 million, from the issuance of the 7.5 percent 2025 Partnership Notes and $100.0 million of proceeds from borrowings under the Partnership's amended and restated credit facility. The Partnership used these proceeds to purchase and redeem all of its 7.375 percent 2020 Partnership Notes, including principal of $463.0 million and a premium of $18.7 million, to repay the $50.0 million outstanding on the Partnership Term Loan and to repay $172.0 million on the Partnership Revolver. In connection with the debt issuance, the Company and the Partnership incurred debt issuance costs of $15.9 million, which were included in long-term debt and financing obligation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2017.  As a result of the debt refinancing, the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 included a loss on extinguishment of debt on the Consolidated Statement of Operations of $20.2 million and $20.3 million, respectively, which consisted primarily of the premium paid of $18.7 million.   IRS Final Regulations on Qualifying Income. In January 2017, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations (the "Final Regulations") issued under section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships. However, the Final Regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the Final Regulations. The Partnership previously received a will-level opinion from its counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP, that the Partnership's cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the Final Regulations. Therefore, the Partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period. Cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations on January 1, 2028, after the transition period ends.  As a result of the Final Regulations, the Partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of $148.6 million to set up its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of 2017, primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets, which are expected to exist at the end of the 10-year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable. As the Company consolidates the Partnership, the entire deferred income tax expense was recognized during the first quarter of 2017. However, the Company had already recorded $84.4 million of the deferred income tax liability in its financial statements related to the Company's share of the deferred tax liability for the book and tax differences in its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the net impact to the Company's deferred tax expense was $64.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017. This incremental tax impact is solely attributable to the Partnership's public unitholders. As such, an equal reduction to noncontrolling interest was recorded. As a result, the Final Regulations have no impact to net income attributable to the Company.  In 2014, we finalized the required permitting and engineering plan for a potential new cokemaking facility to be constructed in Kentucky. However, in June 2017, due to our focus on renewing our existing customer contracts and the lack of any long-term customer commitment for a majority of the facility's capacity, we decided to terminate the project. As a result, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company wrote-off previously capitalized engineering and land deposit costs of $5.3 million. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company  Table of Contents  wrote-off expiring land deposits related to the project of $1.9 million. These costs were included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.   Jewell Coke's Reimbursable Coal Costs. The reimbursable coal component of our Jewell cokemaking facility is fixed annually for each calendar year based on the weighted-average contract price of third-party coal purchases at our Haverhill I cokemaking facility ("HHI Benchmark"). Historically, Jewell's actual coal costs have been higher than the HHI Benchmark, resulting in an under-recovery of coal costs at Jewell. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we have narrowed the difference between the HHI Benchmark and Jewell's actual coal costs, lessening the under-recovery and improving Adjusted EBITDA by $1.0 million and $3.4 million as compared to the same prior year periods, respectively. Pass Through Coal Cost Under-Recovery. During the fourth quarter of 2016, as part of our ordinary course coal sourcing activities, Haverhill, Middletown and AK Steel each entered into arrangements with a coal supplier for 2017 fulfillment. As a result of unfulfilled coal supply commitments by this coal supplier, substitute coal suppliers are currently meeting the shortfall, resulting in a higher price. Presently, we are aggressively pursuing the coal supplier and sharing a portion of the increased coal cost differential with AK Steel, resulting in a negative impact to revenue and Adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 million and $2.8 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. We expect this impact to lower revenue and Adjusted EBITDA by approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Coal Mining Business Divestiture and Impairment. In April 2016, the Company successfully disposed of its coal mining business to Revelation Energy, LLC ("Revelation"), who assumed substantially all of our remaining coal mining assets, mineral leases, real estate and a substantial portion of our mining reclamation obligations. Under the terms of the agreement, Revelation received $12.1 million from the Company to take ownership of the assets and liabilities during the second quarter of 2016. The Company paid an additional $0.7 million in the third quarter of 2016 to transfer certain retirement obligations to Revelation. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recognized total losses associated with this divestiture of $5.1 million and $14.7 million, respectively, which included a $10.7 million asset impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2016. Cost savings due to the absence of the coal mining business improved Adjusted EBITDA results by $0.3 million and $3.1 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, as compared to the same prior year periods. Contingent Consideration. In connection with the CMT acquisition, the Partnership entered into a contingent consideration arrangement that requires the Partnership to make future payments to The Cline Group based on future volumes over a specified threshold, price, and contract renewals. During the first quarter of 2016, the Partnership amended the contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group, which resulted in a $3.7 million gain recognized as a reduction to costs of products sold and operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations The following table sets forth amounts from the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively: Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, Increase Increase 2017 2016 (Decrease) 2017 2016 (Decrease) (Dollars in millions) Revenues Sales and other operating revenue $ 323.2 $ 292.7 $ 30.5 $ 632.9 $ 603.8 $ 29.1 Costs and operating expenses Cost of products sold and operating expenses 257.2 224.4 32.8 491.6 464.9 26.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses 24.1 23.7 0.4 43.8 47.0 (3.2 ) Depreciation and amortization expense 33.3 28.6 4.7 66.6 56.8 9.8 Loss on divestiture of business(1) - 5.1 (5.1 ) - 14.7 (14.7 ) Total costs and operating expenses 314.6 281.8 32.8 602.0 583.4 18.6 Operating income 8.6 10.9 (2.3 ) 30.9 20.4 10.5 Interest expense, net 15.2 13.4 1.8 28.9 27.4 1.5 Loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt(1) 20.2 (3.5 ) 23.7 20.3 (23.9 ) 44.2 (Loss) income before income tax expense (26.8 ) 1.0 (27.8 ) (18.3 ) 16.9 (35.2 ) Income tax expense 4.7 - 4.7 70.9 3.3 67.6 Net (loss) income (31.5 ) 1.0 (32.5 ) (89.2 ) 13.6 (102.8 ) Less: Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests (7.3 ) 5.6 (12.9 ) (66.0 ) 22.3 (88.3 ) Net loss attributable to SunCoke Energy, Inc. $ (24.2 ) $ (4.6 ) $ (19.6 ) $ (23.2 ) $ (8.7 ) $ (14.5 ) . . .

(Gateway) own and operate the facility located in Granite City, Illinois. SunCoke, Haverhill and Gateway are incorporated in the State of Delaware. SunCoke is also an owner of three other Non-Recovery Coking plants in the United States.  SunCoke and its partners are the only companies using the Non-Recovery Coking method in the United States.
The coke making process involves carbonization of coal at high temperatures to concentrate the carbon. Commercial coke is generally made in one of two ways: (1) By-Product Coking and (2) Non-Recovery/Heat Recovery Coking. A majority of the coke produced in the United States comes from By-Product Coking, where the coal is carbonized in large ovens and the off-gas is collected and processed to recover various carbon-based by-products, such as napthalene, benzene, toluene and xylene. 
In facilities using the Non-Recovery Coking process, the ovens are heated differently such that no external heat source is required. The volatile products from the coal are combusted with oxygen in the chamber providing heat from above, and gas flues in the bottom of the chamber collect the combustion gases and provide heat from below. The typical carbon-based pollutants from carbonizing the coal in the By-Product Coking process (e.g., benzene) are not present in the gas stream exiting the coke ovens because they are collected, recirculated to the oven, and combusted to provide heat. Because there are no coking by-products to recover, the process is called Non-Recovery Coking Process.
The gas stream from the Non-Recovery Coking process is vented through a stack to create a natural draft for the negative-pressure process. These gases cannot be sent directly to pollution control equipment because of the high temperatures. The gases are, however, sent to a waste heat recovery boiler, where cooling takes place, such that the gases can then continue to pollution control equipment such as flue gas desulfurization for sulfur control and bag houses for particulate control. The Non-Recovery Coking process offers advantages over the By-Product Coking process in that it reduces the coking cycle and results in better quality coke, if operated correctly.

Violations
The majority of the violations at issue in this case resulted from chronic, excessive by-passing of the heat recovery steam generators (HRSGs) and emission control equipment during malfunctions, maintenance, or other operational problems. Both facilities’ permits contain a limited number of allowable bypass hours for each bypass stack (e.g., 192 hrs/yr/stack), along with hourly and yearly emission limits for SO2, NOx, CO, PM, and lead. In addition, the Illinois permit contains emission limits for sulfuric acid and volatile organic compounds, while the Ohio permit contains emission limits for mercury and hydrochloric acid. Both the Illinois and Ohio facilities exceeded permit limits for hours of bypass and for the corresponding emissions of SO2, PM, and lead.

Injunctive Relief
Under the proposed settlement, the Companies will install redundant HRSGs at the two facilities that will minimize the need to vent directly to the atmosphere when a problem occurs or maintenance is needed at a primary HRSG. The Companies estimate that the design and installation of the redundant HRSGs will cost approximately $100 million. The Companies are required to amend their permits to reflect the reduced bypass hours and emissions. In addition, the Companies must minimize emissions for all anticipated bypass vents by reducing the coal charge and sulfur content.  The Companies must also conduct a root cause analysis for all bypass venting lasting longer than a total of thirty minutes in a 24 hour period in order to ensure that bypass venting is limited to either planned maintenance or malfunctions. Bypass venting not associated with these causes may be subject to stipulated penalties if not in accordance with good engineering pollution control practices.  Finally, the Companies will install monitoring equipment at each facility to continuously monitor sulfur dioxide emissions from certain bypass vents, at an estimated cost of $700,000.

Pollutant Reductions
When fully implemented, EPA estimates that the actions required by the proposed consent decree will reduce emissions of SO2 by approximately 1,204 tpy, PM by 131 tpy, and lead by 1,839 lbs/yr.  Other estimated emission reductions stemming from the injunctive relief embodied in the proposed consent decree include mercury (32 lbs/yr), hydrochloric acid (180 tpy), sulfuric acid (72 tpy), VOCs (3.4 tpy), nitrogen oxides (84 tpy), and carbon monoxide (16 tpy).  Furthermore, the installation of redundant HRSGs is reasonably expected to have a collateral impact on total greenhouse gases because both facilities sell electricity to the local grids. Currently, when bypassing occurs, the energy in the gas is wasted. Arguably, other fossil fuel burning facilities will likely have to compensate for energy loss, resulting in greater greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.

Health and Environmental Benefits
Health and environmental impacts from the pollutants addressed in this settlement include the following:
Particulate Matter – Particulate matter has been linked to a range of serious respiratory and cardiovascular health problems. The key effects associated with exposure to ambient particulate matter include: premature mortality, aggravation of respiratory and cardiovascular disease, aggravated asthma, acute respiratory symptoms, chronic bronchitis, decreased lung function, and increased risk of myocardial infarction. Recent epidemiologic studies estimate that exposures to particulate matter may result in tens of thousands of excess deaths per year, and many more cases of illness nation wide.
Sulfur Dioxide – Sulfur dioxides can be converted to fine particulate matter once in the air. High concentrations of SO2 affect breathing and may aggravate existing respiratory and cardiovascular disease. Sensitive populations include asthmatics, individuals with bronchitis or emphysema, children and the elderly. Sulfur dioxide is also a primary contributor to acid deposition, or acid rain.

Lead - The effects of lead are the same whether it enters the body through breathing or swallowing. Lead can affect almost every organ and system in the body. The nervous system is the main target for lead toxicity, both in adults and children. Long-term exposure of adults can result weakness in extremities. Lead exposure also causes small increases in blood pressure, particularly in middle-aged and older people. Exposure to high lead levels can severely damage the brain and kidneys in adults or children and ultimately cause death. In pregnant women, high levels of exposure to lead may cause miscarriage. High level exposure in men can damage reproductive organs.

Supplemental Environmental Projects
The proposed settlement includes a lead abatement project at residential facilities surrounding the Gateway facility to reduce lead hazards in owner-occupied low-income residences with priority given to families with young children or pregnant women. The Companies must complete the lead abatement project within two years of the effective date of the proposed Consent Decree. 
Top of Page
Civil Penalty
The Companies have agreed to pay $1.995 million to resolve the claims in the complaint. The United States will receive a cash payment of $1.27 million. Illinois will receive a cash payment of $575,000. Ohio will receive a cash payment of $150,000. Under the settlement, the Companies must also spend at least $255,000 on a lead abatement project.

LISLE, Ill., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Net loss attributable to SXC was $24.2 million, or $0.38 per share, in the current period compared to a loss of $4.6 million, or $0.07 per share, in the prior year period 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47.5 million, up $1.0 million versus the prior year period 
Purchased approximately 1.5 million SXCP units in the quarter; 1.6 million total units through July 26, 2017 
Reaffirm full-year 2017 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $220 million to $235 million









SunCoke Energy, Inc. (NYSE:    SXC) today reported results for the second quarter 2017, which reflect comparable consolidated operating results and current period charges related to the debt refinancing completed in the quarter.
"Our second quarter operating performance finished in line with our expectations and positions us to achieve our full-year financial guidance targets in 2017," said Fritz Henderson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy, Inc. "In the quarter, work commenced on our 2017 Indiana Harbor oven rebuild campaign and we successfully completed our scheduled outage at Granite City."
Additionally, the company began executing against its capital allocation strategy to purchase SXCP units in the open market. Through July 26, 2017, the company had spent approximately $27 million to acquire 1.6 million SXCP units. The company also completed its debt refinancing at both SXC and SXCP.
Henderson continued, "We remained focused on allocating capital in the most efficient manner for SXC shareholders and are pleased with the execution of our SXCP unit purchases to-date. Additionally, we successfully completed our debt refinancing which extends our revolver and SXCP note maturities and provides the flexibility to execute our growth and capital allocation strategies going forward."

Revenues during the second quarter 2017 increased $30.5 million compared to the same prior year period, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment as well as higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment.
Adjusted EBITDA during the second quarter 2017 increased $1.0 million to $47.5 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment and higher technology and licensing fees earned in our Brazil Coke segment. These improvements were partially offset by lower Adjusted EBITDA in our Domestic Coke segment, driven primarily by the impact of oven rebuilds at our Indiana Harbor facility as well as the planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current year period.
Net loss attributable to SXC was $24.2 million, or $0.38 per share, for the second quarter 2017 which is $19.6 million unfavorable to second quarter 2016 loss of $4.6 million, or $0.07 per share. This change is driven primarily by $20.2 million of debt extinguishment costs related to our refinancing activities in the current year period. 
SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS

Revenues increased $22.5 million, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of 39 thousand tons, primarily due to lower production at Indiana Harbor associated with oven rebuilds in the current year period. Revenue was also impacted by lower energy sales due to the planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current year period. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $7.0 million, reflecting lower volumes as discussed above, $3.5 million in higher operating and maintenance spending at Indiana Harbor due primarily to the oven rebuilds, as well as lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance spend for the planned outage at Granite City. Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by $1.0 million of favorable contracted coal prices at our Jewell facility in the current year period.

Coal LogisticsCoal Logistics consists of the coal handling and mixing services operated by SXCP at Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT") located on the Mississippi river in Louisiana, Lake Terminal in East Chicago, Indiana and Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT"), which has terminals along the Ohio and Kanawha rivers in West Virginia.  Additionally, Dismal River Terminal ("DRT"), located in Virginia adjacent to our Jewell Cokemaking facility, is operated by SXC.  DRT was formed to accommodate Jewell in its direct procurement of third-party coal, beginning in 2016.

Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA were up $4.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, driven by higher sales volumes at our CMT and KRT terminals in the current year period.

Brazil Coke
Brazil Coke consists of a cokemaking facility in Vitória, Brazil, which we operate for an affiliate of ArcelorMittal.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.1 million to $4.5 million, driven primarily by incremental technology and licensing fees related to the addition of certain patents to our existing intellectual property licensing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Corporate and OtherCorporate and other expenses, which include costs related to our legacy coal mining business, were $11.0 million in second quarter 2017, an improvement of $1.3 million versus second quarter 2016. The improvement was driven partly by lower legal costs.
2017 OUTLOOK
Our 2017 guidance is as follows:

Domestic coke production is expected to be approximately 3.9 million tons 
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $220 million and $235 million 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC is expected to be between $130 million and $141 million, reflecting the impact of public ownership in SXCP 
Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $80 million 
Cash flow from operations is estimated to be between $128 million and $143 million (updated post-refinancing) 
Cash taxes are projected to be between $6 million and $10 million (updated post-refinancing)

DEFINITIONS

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), adjusted for impairments, coal rationalization costs, changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of CMT and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Company's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC represents Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.

 (1) 
 The Partnership recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of its debt refinancing activities during the second quarter of 2017. The Partnership recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of senior note repurchases through the first half of 2016. 






 (2) 
 In January 2017, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations (the "Final Regulations") issued under section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships. However, the Final Regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the Final Regulations. The Partnership previously received a will-level opinion from its counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP, that the Partnership's cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the Final Regulations. Therefore, the Partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period. Cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations on January 1, 2028, after the transition period ends.   







 As a result of the Final Regulations, the Partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of $148.6 million to set up its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of 2017, primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets, which are expected to exist at the end of the 10-year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable.  As the Company consolidates the Partnership, the entire deferred income tax expense was recognized during the first quarter of 2017. However, the Company had already recorded $84.4 million of the deferred income tax liability in its financial statements related to the Company's share of the deferred tax liability for the book and tax differences in its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the net impact to the Company's deferred tax expense was $64.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017. This incremental tax impact is solely attributable to the Partnership's public unitholders. As such, an equal reduction to noncontrolling interest was recorded. As a result, the Final Regulations have no impact to net income attributable to the Company.

 (1) 
 Prior to the divestiture of our coal mining business, the Company incurred coal rationalization costs including employee severance, contract termination costs and other costs to idle mines incurred during the execution of our coal rationalization plan.  


 (2) 
 As a result of the increase in fair value of the contingent consideration liability during the second quarter of 2017, the Partnership recognized expense of $0.3 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The Partnership amended its contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group during the first quarter of 2016.  This amendment resulted in a gain of $3.7 million recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  


 (3) 
 In 2014, we finalized the required permitting and engineering plan for a potential new cokemaking facility to be constructed in Kentucky.  However, in June 2017, due to our focus on renewing our existing customer contracts and the lack of any long-term customer commitment for a majority of the facility's capacity, we decided to terminate the project. As a result, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company wrote-off previously capitalized engineering and land deposit costs of $5.3 million. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company wrote-off expiring land deposits related to the project of $1.9 million.  


 (4) 
 In accordance with the SEC's May 2016 update of its guidance on the appropriate use of non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA does not include Coal Logistics deferred revenue until it is recognized as GAAP revenue.

LISLE, Ill., July 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- 

Net loss attributable to SXC was $24.2 million, or $0.38 per share, in the current period compared to a loss of $4.6 million, or $0.07 per share, in the prior year period 
Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $47.5 million, up $1.0 million versus the prior year period 
Purchased approximately 1.5 million SXCP units in the quarter; 1.6 million total units through July 26, 2017 
Reaffirm full-year 2017 Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA guidance of $220 million to $235 million









SunCoke Energy, Inc. (NYSE:    SXC) today reported results for the second quarter 2017, which reflect comparable consolidated operating results and current period charges related to the debt refinancing completed in the quarter.
"Our second quarter operating performance finished in line with our expectations and positions us to achieve our full-year financial guidance targets in 2017," said Fritz Henderson, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of SunCoke Energy, Inc. "In the quarter, work commenced on our 2017 Indiana Harbor oven rebuild campaign and we successfully completed our scheduled outage at Granite City."
Additionally, the company began executing against its capital allocation strategy to purchase SXCP units in the open market. Through July 26, 2017, the company had spent approximately $27 million to acquire 1.6 million SXCP units. The company also completed its debt refinancing at both SXC and SXCP.
Henderson continued, "We remained focused on allocating capital in the most efficient manner for SXC shareholders and are pleased with the execution of our SXCP unit purchases to-date. Additionally, we successfully completed our debt refinancing which extends our revolver and SXCP note maturities and provides the flexibility to execute our growth and capital allocation strategies going forward."

Revenues during the second quarter 2017 increased $30.5 million compared to the same prior year period, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment as well as higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment.
Adjusted EBITDA during the second quarter 2017 increased $1.0 million to $47.5 million, primarily due to higher sales volumes in our Coal Logistics segment and higher technology and licensing fees earned in our Brazil Coke segment. These improvements were partially offset by lower Adjusted EBITDA in our Domestic Coke segment, driven primarily by the impact of oven rebuilds at our Indiana Harbor facility as well as the planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current year period.
Net loss attributable to SXC was $24.2 million, or $0.38 per share, for the second quarter 2017 which is $19.6 million unfavorable to second quarter 2016 loss of $4.6 million, or $0.07 per share. This change is driven primarily by $20.2 million of debt extinguishment costs related to our refinancing activities in the current year period. 
SECOND QUARTER SEGMENT RESULTS
Domestic CokeDomestic Coke consists of cokemaking facilities and heat recovery operations at our Jewell, Indiana Harbor, Haverhill, Granite City and Middletown plants.

Revenues increased $22.5 million, reflecting the pass-through of higher coal prices in our Domestic Coke segment, partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of 39 thousand tons, primarily due to lower production at Indiana Harbor associated with oven rebuilds in the current year period. Revenue was also impacted by lower energy sales due to the planned outage at our Granite City facility in the current year period. 
Adjusted EBITDA decreased $7.0 million, reflecting lower volumes as discussed above, $3.5 million in higher operating and maintenance spending at Indiana Harbor due primarily to the oven rebuilds, as well as lower energy sales and higher operating and maintenance spend for the planned outage at Granite City. Adjusted EBITDA was also impacted by $1.0 million of favorable contracted coal prices at our Jewell facility in the current year period.

Coal LogisticsCoal Logistics consists of the coal handling and mixing services operated by SXCP at Convent Marine Terminal ("CMT") located on the Mississippi river in Louisiana, Lake Terminal in East Chicago, Indiana and Kanawha River Terminals, LLC ("KRT"), which has terminals along the Ohio and Kanawha rivers in West Virginia.  Additionally, Dismal River Terminal ("DRT"), located in Virginia adjacent to our Jewell Cokemaking facility, is operated by SXC.  DRT was formed to accommodate Jewell in its direct procurement of third-party coal, beginning in 2016.

Revenues and Adjusted EBITDA were up $4.9 million and $4.6 million, respectively, driven by higher sales volumes at our CMT and KRT terminals in the current year period.

Brazil Coke
Brazil Coke consists of a cokemaking facility in Vitória, Brazil, which we operate for an affiliate of ArcelorMittal.

Adjusted EBITDA increased $2.1 million to $4.5 million, driven primarily by incremental technology and licensing fees related to the addition of certain patents to our existing intellectual property licensing agreement in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Corporate and OtherCorporate and other expenses, which include costs related to our legacy coal mining business, were $11.0 million in second quarter 2017, an improvement of $1.3 million versus second quarter 2016. The improvement was driven partly by lower legal costs.
2017 OUTLOOK
Our 2017 guidance is as follows:

Domestic coke production is expected to be approximately 3.9 million tons 
Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be between $220 million and $235 million 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC is expected to be between $130 million and $141 million, reflecting the impact of public ownership in SXCP 
Capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $80 million 
Cash flow from operations is estimated to be between $128 million and $143 million (updated post-refinancing) 
Cash taxes are projected to be between $6 million and $10 million (updated post-refinancing)

DEFINITIONS

Adjusted EBITDA represents earnings before interest, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), adjusted for impairments, coal rationalization costs, changes to our contingent consideration liability related to our acquisition of CMT and the expiration of certain acquired contractual obligations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not represent and should not be considered alternatives to net income or operating income under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures in other businesses. Management believes Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of the operating performance and liquidity of the Company's net assets and its ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make distributions. Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it highlights trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP measures and because it eliminates items that have less bearing on our operating performance and liquidity. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for net income, operating cash flow or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. 
Adjusted EBITDA attributable to SXC represents Adjusted EBITDA less Adjusted EBITDA attributable to noncontrolling interests.

 (1) 
 The Partnership recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt as a result of its debt refinancing activities during the second quarter of 2017. The Partnership recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt as a result of senior note repurchases through the first half of 2016. 






 (2) 
 In January 2017, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") announced its decision to exclude cokemaking as a qualifying income generating activity in its final regulations (the "Final Regulations") issued under section 7704(d)(1)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the qualifying income exception for publicly traded partnerships. However, the Final Regulations include a transition period for activities that were reasonably interpreted to be qualifying income and carried on by publicly traded partnerships prior to the Final Regulations. The Partnership previously received a will-level opinion from its counsel, Vinson & Elkins LLP, that the Partnership's cokemaking operations generated qualifying income prior to the Final Regulations. Therefore, the Partnership believes it had a reasonable basis to conclude its cokemaking operations were considered qualifying income before the issuance of the new regulations and as such expects to maintain its treatment as a partnership through the transition period. Cokemaking entities in the Partnership will become taxable as corporations on January 1, 2028, after the transition period ends.   







 As a result of the Final Regulations, the Partnership recorded deferred income tax expense of $148.6 million to set up its initial deferred income tax liability during the first quarter of 2017, primarily related to differences in the book and tax basis of fixed assets, which are expected to exist at the end of the 10-year transition period when the cokemaking operations become taxable.  As the Company consolidates the Partnership, the entire deferred income tax expense was recognized during the first quarter of 2017. However, the Company had already recorded $84.4 million of the deferred income tax liability in its financial statements related to the Company's share of the deferred tax liability for the book and tax differences in its investment in the Partnership. Therefore, the net impact to the Company's deferred tax expense was $64.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017. This incremental tax impact is solely attributable to the Partnership's public unitholders. As such, an equal reduction to noncontrolling interest was recorded. As a result, the Final Regulations have no impact to net income attributable to the Company.

 (1) 
 Prior to the divestiture of our coal mining business, the Company incurred coal rationalization costs including employee severance, contract termination costs and other costs to idle mines incurred during the execution of our coal rationalization plan.  


 (2) 
 As a result of the increase in fair value of the contingent consideration liability during the second quarter of 2017, the Partnership recognized expense of $0.3 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The Partnership amended its contingent consideration terms with The Cline Group during the first quarter of 2016.  This amendment resulted in a gain of $3.7 million recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  


 (3) 
 In 2014, we finalized the required permitting and engineering plan for a potential new cokemaking facility to be constructed in Kentucky.  However, in June 2017, due to our focus on renewing our existing customer contracts and the lack of any long-term customer commitment for a majority of the facility's capacity, we decided to terminate the project. As a result, during the second quarter of 2017, the Company wrote-off previously capitalized engineering and land deposit costs of $5.3 million. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company wrote-off expiring land deposits related to the project of $1.9 million.  


 (4) 
 In accordance with the SEC's May 2016 update of its guidance on the appropriate use of non-GAAP financial measures, Adjusted EBITDA does not include Coal Logistics deferred revenue until it is recognized as GAAP revenue.  


 (5) 
 Reflects noncontrolling interest in Indiana Harbor and the portion of the Partnership owned by public unitholders.
