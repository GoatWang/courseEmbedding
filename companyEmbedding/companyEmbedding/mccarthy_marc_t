			Marc McCarthy has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors since our formation on June 3, 2016 and as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the general partner of Mammoth Partners since September 17, 2014. Mr. McCarthy is currently a Senior Managing Director at Wexford, having joined Wexford in June 2008. Mr. McCarthy has served as a director of Penn Virginia Corporation, an independent exploration and production company, since September 2016.

From September 2009 until June 2013, Mr. McCarthy served as Chairman of the Board and a director of EPL Oil & Gas, Inc., an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company. He also served on the Nominating and Governance Committee of EPL Oil & Gas, Inc. Before joining Wexford, Mr. McCarthy was a Senior Managing Director at Bear Stearns & Co., Inc. within its Global Equity Research Department having been responsible for coverage of the international oil and gas sector. Mr. McCarthy joined Bear Stearns & Co. in 1997 and held various positions of increasing responsibility until his departure in June 2008. Prior to 1997, he worked in equity research at Prudential Securities, also following the oil and gas sector. Mr. McCarthy is a Chartered Financial Analyst and received a B.A. in Economics from Tufts University. We believe Mr. McCarthy's experience as a director of both publicly-traded and private oil and gas companies, as well as his experience in evaluating financial, strategic and operational aspects of companies in our industry at Wexford, qualifies him for service as a member of our board of directors.
