12,000 and 12-year on all models of Lear 20, 30, and 50 series, and all
inspections except 12,000 and 12-year on Lear 60 series.
We also provide full inspection services on

Hangar doors are 110' wide by 20 1/2 ' high.  The hangar is capable of
year-round operations as it is heated and protected by an overhead fire
extinguishing system.  The avionics/instruments, accessories, and sheet
metal shops are integral to the facility.  Our team of FAA licensed
technicians has decades of experience supporting the operation of the Repair
Station.
