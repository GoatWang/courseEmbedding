Origins[edit]
Adam & Eve was founded in 1970 by physician Tim Black and Phil Harvey. It started as a small storefront on one of Chapel Hill, North Carolina's main streets, selling condoms and lubricants. It soon became a mail-order catalog selling contraceptives through non-medical channels.[1]
Harvey, having just returned from India as a part of the CARE pre-school feeding program, concluded that poor family planning was the source of many social problems. While still a graduate student at the University of North Carolina's School of Public Health, Harvey and Mueller conceived Adam & Eve to fund a non-profit organization in hopes of using the profits to finance family-planning programs in developing countries,.[3] With a Ford Foundation fellowship, the two men devised a plan to use social marketing in the U.S., and with university consent, they began writing witty ad copy ("What will you get her this Christmas -- pregnant?") [3] and advertising condoms in the mail. After running ads in 300 of the largest U.S. college newspapers, the orders started and did not stop. Though selling condoms via the mail was in violation of the Comstock Act (not overturned judicially in its entirety until 1972), Harvey and Mueller knew the law was rarely enforced. Success ensued, and the men began to see a profit, stating, "The mail-order condom market was just sitting there waiting for somebody," recalls Harvey. "We'd sit down at the end of the week and pay our bills and I'd say, 'There seems to be some money leftover here.' That's about how much we knew about business. He also gives authors a chance to write for his videos." [3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Population Services International[edit]
Main article: Population Services International
With business generating more than enough revenue to cover costs, the partners wondered if the condom business could create enough of a profit to finance overseas social-marketing projects. If so, they would have the ability to bypass conventional donors and function with complete autonomy. With that, the men launched Population Services International (PSI), and by 1975 were conducting condom marketing programs in Bangladesh and Kenya. Though Harvey left his position as the director in the late 1970s, PSI still sells birth control and health products in over 60 countries and is prominent in international family planning.
DKT International[edit]
Main article: DKT International
In the late 1970s, Harvey focused more on running Adam & Eve, but in 1989, he launched DKT International (DKT), an organization that promotes family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.[1][4] Much of DKT's revenue comes from its sales of low-cost contraceptives, but Adam & Eve also donates more than 25% of its profits to DKT.[4][5] While DKT's biggest programs draw funding from government agencies and foundations, its private funding allows it to be a more innovative and agile participant in its discipline.[6] DKT's social marketing strategies have included advertising, creating location-specific brands, working with local social networks and militaries, and targeting high-risk groups.[6][7][8][9][10]
Company Overview[edit]
Along with Adam & Eve's signature brand of erotic toys, Adam & Eve carries a variety of items for men, women and couples. In 2004, Adam & Eve started franchising its stores in the U.S. In 2009, the company donated funds to the Free Speech Coalition.[11] Its contract stars to date have included Juli Ashton, Mari Possa, Austyn Moore,[12][13] Carmen Luvana,[14][15] Ava Rose,[16] Sophia Lynn, Bree Olson, Kayden Kross, Alexis Ford, and Teagan Presley.

Adam & Eve is a conglomerate company that sells sex toys, vibrators, condoms, and lingerie, as well as funding non-profit social marketing organizations that address issues such as population growth, disease control and sex education in developing countries. In 2006, it was described by Reuters as one of the handful of studios that dominate the U.S. porn industry.[2] The company is the largest mail-order distributor of condoms, sex toys, and erotica in the United States.[1] Founder Phil Harvey has been called "one of the most influential figures in the American sex industry today".[1] Its parent company, PHE Inc., is the largest private employer in Hillsborough, North Carolina, where its headquarters are situated.[1]

Origins[edit]
Adam & Eve was founded in 1970 by physician Tim Black and Phil Harvey. It started as a small storefront on one of Chapel Hill, North Carolina's main streets, selling condoms and lubricants. It soon became a mail-order catalog selling contraceptives through non-medical channels.[1]
Harvey, having just returned from India as a part of the CARE pre-school feeding program, concluded that poor family planning was the source of many social problems. While still a graduate student at the University of North Carolina's School of Public Health, Harvey and Mueller conceived Adam & Eve to fund a non-profit organization in hopes of using the profits to finance family-planning programs in developing countries,.[3] With a Ford Foundation fellowship, the two men devised a plan to use social marketing in the U.S., and with university consent, they began writing witty ad copy ("What will you get her this Christmas -- pregnant?") [3] and advertising condoms in the mail. After running ads in 300 of the largest U.S. college newspapers, the orders started and did not stop. Though selling condoms via the mail was in violation of the Comstock Act (not overturned judicially in its entirety until 1972), Harvey and Mueller knew the law was rarely enforced. Success ensued, and the men began to see a profit, stating, "The mail-order condom market was just sitting there waiting for somebody," recalls Harvey. "We'd sit down at the end of the week and pay our bills and I'd say, 'There seems to be some money leftover here.' That's about how much we knew about business. He also gives authors a chance to write for his videos." [3]
Philanthropy[edit]
Population Services International[edit]
Main article: Population Services International
With business generating more than enough revenue to cover costs, the partners wondered if the condom business could create enough of a profit to finance overseas social-marketing projects. If so, they would have the ability to bypass conventional donors and function with complete autonomy. With that, the men launched Population Services International (PSI), and by 1975 were conducting condom marketing programs in Bangladesh and Kenya. Though Harvey left his position as the director in the late 1970s, PSI still sells birth control and health products in over 60 countries and is prominent in international family planning.
DKT International[edit]
Main article: DKT International
In the late 1970s, Harvey focused more on running Adam & Eve, but in 1989, he launched DKT International (DKT), an organization that promotes family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.[1][4] Much of DKT's revenue comes from its sales of low-cost contraceptives, but Adam & Eve also donates more than 25% of its profits to DKT.[4][5] While DKT's biggest programs draw funding from government agencies and foundations, its private funding allows it to be a more innovative and agile participant in its discipline.[6] DKT's social marketing strategies have included advertising, creating location-specific brands, working with local social networks and militaries, and targeting high-risk groups.[6][7][8][9][10]
Company Overview[edit]
Along with Adam & Eve's signature brand of erotic toys, Adam & Eve carries a variety of items for men, women and couples. In 2004, Adam & Eve started franchising its stores in the U.S. In 2009, the company donated funds to the Free Speech Coalition.[11] Its contract stars to date have included Juli Ashton, Mari Possa, Austyn Moore,[12][13] Carmen Luvana,[14][15] Ava Rose,[16] Sophia Lynn, Bree Olson, Kayden Kross, Alexis Ford, and Teagan Presley.

Will Adam - Love
 



	Published Monday 5th December 2016








Will Adam - Love 
STYLE: Pop
RATING           
OUR PRODUCT CODE: 161211-23899
LABEL: Independent 
FORMAT: CD Album
This product is currently not available from Cross Rhythms DirectReviewed by Tony CummingsWill Adam is a British composer who's penned plenty of music for film and TV and here he brings his considerable keyboard and production skills to bear on an impressive worship project with all the sales going to the Vision Rescue charity. New wave synth pop has seldom sounded better with some unknown but pretty good singers - Jenny Deacon, Clinton Janz, Pratik Kore, Miggy Dela Rosa - featured here, the effect is of warm, upbeat worship with Will's impressive nimble, inventive programming. I particularly enjoyed the hypnotic instrumental opener "Upside Down", the slow and worshipful "Heart Wide" and the decidedly funky "Free" on which Clinton leads us on a surging chorus. If you're tired of the stereotypical sound of much modern worship this is an album you will need to locate to give your home or car worship times a lift.

Reader CommentsPosted by Linda in Salford  @ 16:36 on Dec 6 2016I agree totally with Tony's  review. This album is sharp,
edgy, fresh & has great biblical content. It's part of my
favourite playlist. Recommended. [reply] [report abuse]

Claws: All New Sundays at 9/8c | TNT


Play all


        Claws is a midnight-dark, wickedly funny meditation on female badness set in a South Florida nail salon. It follows the rise of five diverse and treacherous manicurists working at the Nail Artisan of Manatee County salon, where there is a lot more going on than silk wraps and pedicures. Claws is about good women caught in bad places with worse men. It's the story of hardworking women trying to get by in this economy, set against the surreal, bright, gritty landscape of Florida and the luscious, absurd, extreme excesses of the crime world.

Publisher's Description▼▲
Where is God when tragedy and suffering strike?  When the ground shakes, and a poor nations economy is destroyed; when the waters rise, washing away a communitys hopes and dreams; when a child suffers neglect and abuse; when violence tears apart nations; where is God?  If God is all powerful, and if each one of us is a beloved child of God, then how can God allow tragedy and suffering to infest his creation?   In Why?, best-selling author Adam Hamilton brings fresh insight to the age-old question of how to understand the will of God. Rejecting simplistic answers and unexamined assumptions, he lays out core ideas for comprehending Gods plan for the world, including:    God will not take away our free will, even when we use it to grieve him. God will never abandon us, especially in the midst of our suffering. While God is not the author of suffering, God will bring blessing out of tragedy.

Publisher's Weekly▼▲
In this slim volume, a Methodist pastor of a large Kansas City church attempts to tackle the formidable issue of theodicy: if God is good, why do bad things happen? Hamilton (24 Hours that Changed the World) does so without resorting to big-name philosophers or Latin-sounding constructions. He has a comforting story-telling approach to writing that will be appreciated by readers wanting to soothe their sores more than grapple with the complexities of this age-old question. Hamilton proposes that God has given human beings responsibility and free will to manage their lives and oversee the created order. He sidesteps the issue of why God is necessary if people are essentially left to their own devices. Instead, he offers faith in a larger Christian scheme, a divine narrative that the gifted theologian and writer Frederick Buechner summed up by saying that "the worst thing is never the last thing," or, in more traditional language, life will overcome death and good will triumph over evil.

                This review was written for Why?: Making Sense of God's Will - eBook.
            
 
            How do pastors reconcile faith with experience?  Adam Hamilton presents an honest, concise and cogent survey of the troubling issues challenging the faith of many Christians, tempered by his personal experiences, study, prayer and reflection.  Of course, it is impossible to fully rationalize God through mortal minds, leaving some things to trust and obedience alone.  But Hamilton does provide a framework for better understanding human suffering, unanswered prayers and God's guiding presence in our lives in sensible propositions based on scriptural truths and personal witness.  Ultimately, Hamilton anchors his understanding on faith in the ultimate power and love of God for humankind, and His desire for us to seek eternal fellowship with him through steadfast faith in the risen Lord, manifest in righteous living made possible by grace, and through mutual love and support for each other.

            I participated in a summer Bible study group using this book along with Scripture. I enjoyed it so much that I recommended it to my Sunday school class and now we are using it for our class study. I disagreed with the author on a couple of issues, but overall found the book to be sound scripturally. The author really gives you food for thought and discussion.

            After reading and studying this book with my sunday school class I bought copies for all they guys in my bible study group. Great, thought provoking look at some tough questions we all deal with at one time or another.


A little too expensive for a small book though.

            A friend of mine handed me this book a short time back knowing how I admire Adam Hamilton's sermons and writings. He is the senior pastor of The United Methodist Church of the Resurrection in Leawood, Kansas.


WHY? is a small book, only about a third of an inch thick, about four inches wide by seven high, but it's packed with wisdom from cover to cover.


The book is dedicated to two friends Pastor Hamilton held in high regard, Gary and Danny Patterson. The two suffered what he classified as "an untimely death," and the book is Pastor Hamilton's attempt to make sense of their senseless deaths.


He talks about why innocents suffer, why prayers seem to go unanswered, why God's will seems obscure, and why God's love prevails. If these questions have plagued you, too, you might want to pick up a copy.
