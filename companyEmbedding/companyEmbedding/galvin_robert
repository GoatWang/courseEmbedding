Robert W. Galvin, Who Ushered Motorola Into the Modern Era, Dies at 89

Robert W. Galvin, who took the reins of Motorola from his father and built a family-run business that pioneered Depression-era car radios and wartime walkie-talkies into a global maker of color television sets, cellphones and other ubiquities of the electronic age, died early Tuesday in Chicago. He was 89.His family announced the death, providing no other details.From arm-weary days as a stockroom apprentice in 1940 to the midlife pressures of the executive suite and an autumnal retirement-in-name-only as chairman in 1990, Mr. Galvin spent his working life with Motorola, leaving it only for military service in World War II. By the time he stepped down, he had transformed the company from a moderately successful postwar enterprise into a high-tech international giant in a fast-changing, highly competitive business.One of America’s most visionary entrepreneurs, he led a company that developed cellular phones, pagers and other wireless devices; produced police radio systems, hearing aids and semiconductors for consumer electronics; and laid foundations for missile guidance systems and satellite communications.The keys to success, he often said, were the foresight to exploit new markets; diversified, high-quality product lines; and progressive management. He practiced them by giving priority to new technologies, moving into Asian and European markets, enforcing quality controls and customer-satisfaction goals, and establishing early profit-sharing plans for employees.

In the three decades after Mr. Galvin took control in the late 1950s, annual sales leaped to $10.8 billion from $290 million. Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., built factories, hired thousands of workers, expanded its products and set high standards for innovation. Wall Street applauded, employees pitched in, and Mr. Galvin was often compared to leaders of I.B.M., General Electric and other corporate giants. Continue reading the main story

There were mistakes. Motorola began making color TV sets in 1957, before color programs were widely available (although it brought them back in the 1960s to set an industry standard). The company gave up too soon on flat-screen computers, and it squandered billions on a satellite communications system that could not compete with ground-based technologies.But Mr. Galvin was the force behind a company that forged trends in radio, television and integrated circuits for computers and other products; sent communication devices to Mars aboard Viking probes and to the Moon on manned rockets; and produced smaller, ever-more-efficient cellphones that, for better or worse, have put much of the talkative world in constant touch.“He had this amazing ability to see what was coming down the pike,” said Harry Mark Petrakis, a novelist and short-story writer who has produced books about Motorola, its leaders and its founders, Paul and Joseph Galvin.

Robert William Galvin was born in Marshfield, Wis., on Oct. 9, 1922, the only child of Paul and Lillian Guinan Galvin. He grew up in Chicago, where his father and uncle had founded the Galvin Manufacturing Corporation in 1928, and in suburban Evanston, where he graduated from Evanston Township High School, a top student who excelled in debate and drama and was class president. He attended Notre Dame and the University of Chicago briefly, but quit college at 18 to work for his father’s company.The company had begun by making “battery eliminators,” devices to plug radios into electrical systems in homes and cars. (Radios were originally battery-operated.) By 1940, Galvin Manufacturing had evolved into America’s premier maker of car radios and two-way radios, called Handie-Talkies. After World War II broke out they became walkie-talkies, and the Army bought $10 million worth. Galvin also prospered in government contracts for radar systems.During the war, Robert served in the Army Signal Corps. In 1942, his mother was killed by robbers who had invaded the Galvin home in Evanston. With her death, inheritance taxes forced the family to take the company public in 1943 with the sale of 40,000 shares. Joseph Galvin, in charge of labor relations and production, died in 1944, leaving Robert as sole heir. The same year, Robert married Mary Barnes.

In 1945, Robert, who had worked in all the factory and business departments, was named a director. In 1947, the company changed its name to Motorola, a fusion of motor and Victrola. It also set up a profit-sharing plan for employees and began making television sets. During the Korean War, Motorola made mobile radio equipment and began to develop microwave-relay communications systems.Mr. Galvin became president in 1956 and took over day-to-day operations from his father, who was chairman and chief executive until his death in 1959. The son succeeded him in both posts, and in the 1960s embarked on new paths: guided missile designs, space communications, radios for ships and aircraft, components and integrated circuits for TV sets, car ignitions and hundreds of other products.

Motorola produced the first hand-held mobile phone in 1973. In the 1980s, after Mr. Galvin showed one to President Ronald Reagan, the White House supported open competition for portable phones instead of an AT&T monopoly. Motorola later dominated the cellphone hardware business.While leading a fight to open Japanese markets to American goods, Mr. Galvin adopted Japanese quality-control methods. In 1981, Motorola set a goal of making 99.99966 percent of its products free of defects. It cost millions to train 150,000 employees, but it sharply increased sales, particularly for cellphones.Mr. Galvin is survived by his wife of 67 years; his daughters, Gail Galvin Ellis and Dawn Galvin Meiners; his sons, Christopher and Michael; 13 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.Mr. Galvin, a tall, soft-spoken man who was a member of various corporate boards and government and industry trade organizations, gave up Motorola’s chairmanship in 1990, but continued for more than a decade to serve on its board and advise his son, Christopher, who succeeded him in 1997. Christopher Galvin resigned in 2003 after Motorola surrendered its edge in cellphones and lost billions in a satellite communications venture, Iridium, which could not compete with the spread of ground-based cell networks.For Mr. Galvin, it was a disappointment, but taking risks and distrusting conventional wisdom had always been his guiding principle. “If it’s intuitive, it’s probably wrong,” he told a leadership symposium. “The absolutely distinguishing quality of a leader is that a leader takes us elsewhere.”

Motorola career[edit]
Born in Marshfield, Wisconsin, Galvin went to work for Motorola in 1940. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1944.[1] In 1956 he was named president of the company. Two years later he succeeded his father as chief executive officer.
In 1986, Bob Galvin gave up the title of CEO while remaining chairman of the board. Under his leadership, Motorola sales had grown from $216.6 million in 1958 to $6.7 billion in 1987 and cash flow per share had grown from 89 cents to $6.10. Bob Galvin also was instrumental, along with Dr Mikel J Harry and Motorola engineer Bill Smith, in implementing the Six Sigma quality system at Motorola.
As a result of the Six Sigma program, Motorola received the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1988, which is given by the President of the United States. Later, the Six Sigma processes subsequently were adopted at the General Electric Corporation. Jack Welch said: "Six Sigma changed the DNA of GE."[2] The Six Sigma process requires 99.99967% error free processes and products, (or 3.4 parts per million defects or less).[3]
Other initiatives[edit]
In 2005, Galvin created the Galvin Electricity Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the electrical grid so that it meets with Six Sigma standards of quality.
Along with his two sons Christopher and Michael, Galvin recently started a real estate investment firm, Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, named for the street where his father and uncle started Motorola (originally named "Galvin Manufacturing").
Awards[edit]
Galvin was a longtime supporter of Illinois Institute of Technology and became a trustee in 1953. He served as chairman from 1979 to 1990 and sat on three steering bodies on the future of IIT, in 1975, 1985, and as chairman in 1993. At the time of his death he served as a University Regent. In 1990, IIT presented Galvin with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, and in 1996, he received the university’s Henry Heald Award. IIT dedicated the Paul V. Galvin Library in 1985 to recognize the Galvin family’s commitment to the institution.
In 1991, Galvin was inducted into Junior Achievement's U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1993, he received the Bower Award in Business Leadership. In 2000 he was awarded the IEEE Founder's Medal for "For his distinguished leadership in promoting quality, technological excellence and' cooperation between government and the private sector, and expanding the applications of electronics and communications technology globally."[4] In 2005, he was awarded the Vannevar Bush Award for "his visionary leadership to enhance U.S. innovation, competitiveness, and excellence at the interface of science and technology with the Nation’s industrial enterprise. In the counsels of government, industry, and academe, he unselfishly gave the Nation the benefit of his knowledge, experience and creative wisdom while leading his company in its great contribution to the computing and telecommunications transformation of society."[5] In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum "Making History Award" for Distinction in Civic Leadership.
Personal life[edit]
Galvin lived in Barrington, Illinois with his wife, Mary Barnes Galvin. Together they have four children and thirteen grandchildren. Galvin, who was a Christian, died in October 2011 in Chicago, Illinois.[6][7]

Motorola career[edit]
Born in Marshfield, Wisconsin, Galvin went to work for Motorola in 1940. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1944.[1] In 1956 he was named president of the company. Two years later he succeeded his father as chief executive officer.
In 1986, Bob Galvin gave up the title of CEO while remaining chairman of the board. Under his leadership, Motorola sales had grown from $216.6 million in 1958 to $6.7 billion in 1987 and cash flow per share had grown from 89 cents to $6.10. Bob Galvin also was instrumental, along with Dr Mikel J Harry and Motorola engineer Bill Smith, in implementing the Six Sigma quality system at Motorola.
As a result of the Six Sigma program, Motorola received the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1988, which is given by the President of the United States. Later, the Six Sigma processes subsequently were adopted at the General Electric Corporation. Jack Welch said: "Six Sigma changed the DNA of GE."[2] The Six Sigma process requires 99.99967% error free processes and products, (or 3.4 parts per million defects or less).[3]
Other initiatives[edit]
In 2005, Galvin created the Galvin Electricity Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the electrical grid so that it meets with Six Sigma standards of quality.
Along with his two sons Christopher and Michael, Galvin recently started a real estate investment firm, Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, named for the street where his father and uncle started Motorola (originally named "Galvin Manufacturing").
Awards[edit]
Galvin was a longtime supporter of Illinois Institute of Technology and became a trustee in 1953. He served as chairman from 1979 to 1990 and sat on three steering bodies on the future of IIT, in 1975, 1985, and as chairman in 1993. At the time of his death he served as a University Regent. In 1990, IIT presented Galvin with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, and in 1996, he received the university’s Henry Heald Award. IIT dedicated the Paul V. Galvin Library in 1985 to recognize the Galvin family’s commitment to the institution.
In 1991, Galvin was inducted into Junior Achievement's U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1993, he received the Bower Award in Business Leadership. In 2000 he was awarded the IEEE Founder's Medal for "For his distinguished leadership in promoting quality, technological excellence and' cooperation between government and the private sector, and expanding the applications of electronics and communications technology globally."[4] In 2005, he was awarded the Vannevar Bush Award for "his visionary leadership to enhance U.S. innovation, competitiveness, and excellence at the interface of science and technology with the Nation’s industrial enterprise. In the counsels of government, industry, and academe, he unselfishly gave the Nation the benefit of his knowledge, experience and creative wisdom while leading his company in its great contribution to the computing and telecommunications transformation of society."[5] In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum "Making History Award" for Distinction in Civic Leadership.
Personal life[edit]
Galvin lived in Barrington, Illinois with his wife, Mary Barnes Galvin. Together they have four children and thirteen grandchildren. Galvin, who was a Christian, died in October 2011 in Chicago, Illinois.[6][7]

Motorola career[edit]
Born in Marshfield, Wisconsin, Galvin went to work for Motorola in 1940. He graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1944.[1] In 1956 he was named president of the company. Two years later he succeeded his father as chief executive officer.
In 1986, Bob Galvin gave up the title of CEO while remaining chairman of the board. Under his leadership, Motorola sales had grown from $216.6 million in 1958 to $6.7 billion in 1987 and cash flow per share had grown from 89 cents to $6.10. Bob Galvin also was instrumental, along with Dr Mikel J Harry and Motorola engineer Bill Smith, in implementing the Six Sigma quality system at Motorola.
As a result of the Six Sigma program, Motorola received the first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1988, which is given by the President of the United States. Later, the Six Sigma processes subsequently were adopted at the General Electric Corporation. Jack Welch said: "Six Sigma changed the DNA of GE."[2] The Six Sigma process requires 99.99967% error free processes and products, (or 3.4 parts per million defects or less).[3]
Other initiatives[edit]
In 2005, Galvin created the Galvin Electricity Initiative, a nonprofit organization dedicated to transforming the electrical grid so that it meets with Six Sigma standards of quality.
Along with his two sons Christopher and Michael, Galvin recently started a real estate investment firm, Harrison Street Real Estate Capital, named for the street where his father and uncle started Motorola (originally named "Galvin Manufacturing").
Awards[edit]
Galvin was a longtime supporter of Illinois Institute of Technology and became a trustee in 1953. He served as chairman from 1979 to 1990 and sat on three steering bodies on the future of IIT, in 1975, 1985, and as chairman in 1993. At the time of his death he served as a University Regent. In 1990, IIT presented Galvin with an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree, and in 1996, he received the university’s Henry Heald Award. IIT dedicated the Paul V. Galvin Library in 1985 to recognize the Galvin family’s commitment to the institution.
In 1991, Galvin was inducted into Junior Achievement's U.S. Business Hall of Fame. In 1993, he received the Bower Award in Business Leadership. In 2000 he was awarded the IEEE Founder's Medal for "For his distinguished leadership in promoting quality, technological excellence and' cooperation between government and the private sector, and expanding the applications of electronics and communications technology globally."[4] In 2005, he was awarded the Vannevar Bush Award for "his visionary leadership to enhance U.S. innovation, competitiveness, and excellence at the interface of science and technology with the Nation’s industrial enterprise. In the counsels of government, industry, and academe, he unselfishly gave the Nation the benefit of his knowledge, experience and creative wisdom while leading his company in its great contribution to the computing and telecommunications transformation of society."[5] In 1995, he received the Chicago History Museum "Making History Award" for Distinction in Civic Leadership.
Personal life[edit]
Galvin lived in Barrington, Illinois with his wife, Mary Barnes Galvin. Together they have four children and thirteen grandchildren. Galvin, who was a Christian, died in October 2011 in Chicago, Illinois.[6][7]

CHICAGO, Oct. 12, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Robert ("Bob") William Galvin, the longtime chief executive officer of Motorola Inc., died peacefully during the night of October 11, 2011 in Chicago. Galvin – a transformative global business leader, innovator, author, and philanthropist – was 89 years old.
(Photo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20111012/NY85227)
Galvin oversaw remarkable growth and innovation during his 29-year tenure as CEO of Motorola. When he took over in 1959 on the death of his father, Motorola founder Paul V. Galvin, the company had annual sales of $290 million, primarily in North America. Building on the strong foundation he established with his father in Communications, Automotive, Military Electronics, Semiconductor and Consumer products, Galvin transformed Motorola into a global technology leader with $10.8 billion in sales in 1990, the year he stepped down as chairman. Due in large part to his vision and leadership, Motorola received the U.S. Commerce Department's first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for Manufacturing in 1988.
Galvin was born in 1922 in Marshfield, Wisconsin.  He attended Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Illinois, where he excelled in academics, student government, the debating society, and sports. He went on to attend the University of Notre Dame. Starting full-time with Motorola in 1944, Galvin earned his way up through various positions before being named president in 1956. He was chief executive officer of Motorola from 1959 to 1988 and retained senior-most executive responsibility as chairman of the company throughout a planned succession completed in 1990. He retired from the board of directors in 2001. 
Throughout his life, Galvin was committed to innovation. "At times we must engage an act of faith," he said, "that key things are doable that are not provable."  Under his guidance, Motorola became a world leader in semiconductor, paging, two-way radio, space and military communication, and automotive embedded control technologies. Motorola's semiconductor products were particularly seminal, enabling a generation of computing and data communications start-ups in the 1980s and 1990s. 
Under Galvin, Motorola led the creation of the global cellular telephone industry. It installed the first prototype cell phone demonstration system in Washington DC in 1971; unveiled the first portable cell phone prototype, the DynaTAC, in 1973; enabled the first commercial cell phone call, which was made on the DynaTAC by Ameritech, in Chicago in 1983; and introduced MicroTAC, the industry's first compact cell phone, in 1989. Finally, in 1996, with Galvin serving on Motorola's board, the company manufactured the first pocket-sized 'flip phone', the StarTAC. These innovations paved the way to a cell phone market that now includes some 3.8 billion subscribers worldwide. Throughout his career, Galvin made crucial investments in cellular R&D and advocated tirelessly for competitive telecom regulation across the globe, never wavering in his belief that cellular technology would revolutionize the way people communicated.
He was profoundly grateful to the dedicated and talented employees of Motorola. "People are Motorola's most important asset," he often said. Galvin instilled his vision for a workplace marked by dignity, respect, integrity, trust, training, and fair pay in Motorola's global management team, and he urged heads of government and policymakers to encourage such workplace policies in order to enhance the opportunity for innovation and wealth creation in their countries. He measured himself and his executive team by the company's treatment of its workforce, and he was proud that Motorola employees never felt the need to unionize in any of its global operations. He insisted that all Motorola employees address him simply as 'Bob.'
Among many accomplishments in international business, Galvin moved Motorola into Europe, Southeast Asia, Israel, India, Japan, Latin America and China. An influential force in global telecom regulation and fair trade, he initiated Motorola's "Japan Challenge" and partnered with Robert Strauss, then US Trade Representative, to open Japan's domestic semiconductor markets. Seeing that China would soon evolve into a major global market, he committed the company to a $100 million investment there in 1987. By the time he retired from the board, Motorola was one of China's largest foreign investors.
Galvin was a trusted advisor to generations of US presidents and cabinet leaders from the Eisenhower to the Bush administrations. He served a term on the US Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and was lead business liaison in numerous US Trade Representative, State Department, and Defense and Intelligence delegations. He also chaired the Commission to Reorganize US National Laboratories (known as 'the Galvin Commission'), the Commission on the Future for the National Science Foundation, and Sematech, the government initiative to revitalize US semiconductor competitiveness. He also served as President of the Electronic Industry Association. 
In addition to technology and public affairs, Galvin also left his mark on the fields of management theory and change management. Under his leadership, Motorola developed the Six Sigma Quality improvement system and disseminated its findings across the globe.  Insistent that process change management was important to the growth of large companies, he helped to pioneer Technology Road-mapping and the Participative Management Program, founded Motorola University, and experimented continuously with other promising change management initiatives. 
Galvin's long-term vision was for Motorola to continue to advance a highly diversified technology platform to inform and enable the creation of new global technology industries while remaining true to the timeless principles that his father, Paul Galvin, imbued in the company as its founder. By doing both, he believed Motorola could eventually grow global sales by another factor of 10. He was, therefore, deeply disappointed when Motorola's board chose to deviate from that path in late 2003 and force out his son Christopher, the third generation Galvin CEO, just as Motorola was completing the most significant turnaround in its history. Galvin went on to join his sons, Chris and Michael, in founding Harrison Street Capital, an investment management firm focused on real estate, defense services and high technology.
During his retirement, Galvin established two non-profit think tanks to tackle major infrastructure problems. The first, originally the Galvin Electricity Initiative and now the Perfect Power Institute, aims to transform the electricity industry, as envisioned in a book Galvin co-authored called Perfect Power. The second, the Galvin Transportation Initiative, sought to eliminate urban auto congestion using a program laid out in the book Mobility First, which Galvin helped to inspire. Galvin's overriding objective in these projects was to create one million permanent jobs in the United States over 50 years.
Galvin wrote several books in his retirement years, including The Genius of People and America's Founding Secret, both on the influence of the Scottish Enlightenment on the founding of the United States, and The Idea of Ideas, a compilation of business philosophies that shaped Motorola.
Committed to the cause of education, Galvin focused much of his philanthropic energy on the Illinois Institute of Technology ("IIT"), which he never attended but considered essential to Chicago and the world.  He served on IIT's board for over 50 years, chairing it for 10. The Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at IIT is named in his honor.  He also supported a variety of other non-profit causes over the years, including inner city schools, universities, hospitals, the arts, and science research.  
Business groups, industry associations, governments and academic institutions around the world have recognized Galvin's leadership and vision. The recipient of several honorary doctoral degrees, he was elected to the American National Business Hall of Fame and awarded the National Medal of Technology, the Vannevar Bush Award,  the French Legion of Honor medal and the Founders Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Recently, he received the Marconi Society Lifetime Achievement Award. He also served on the Advisory Boards of the Santa Fe Institute and the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry and was an active member of the Young Presidents Organization.
Above all, Galvin was a devoted husband of 67 years to Mary Barnes Galvin and an inspiring and loving father to his four children – Gail Galvin Ellis, Dawn Galvin Meiners, and Christopher and Michael Galvin – and their extended families, collectively comprised of 13 grandchildren, 10 great grandchildren (with one more on the way) and 8 valued in-laws. 
He delighted in passing time with family and friends, singing on the player piano and debating policy, books and ideas around the dining table. He loved playing tennis, snow skiing, waterskiing, windsurfing and sculling, among other sports. 
Galvin discovered his highest passions pursuing the principles of leadership, innovation, creativity, ethics, and dignity and respect for all. His was an inspiring, principled, loving and accomplished American life.
In lieu of flowers, the family requests that gifts in memory of Bob be directed to the Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at Illinois Institute of Technology; please send to the attention of Betsy Hughes at Illinois Institute of Technology, 10 W. 35th St., Ste. 1700, Chicago, IL 60616 (312-567-5045).

CHICAGO, Oct. 12, 2011 /PRNewswire/ -- Robert ("Bob") William Galvin, the longtime chief executive officer of Motorola Inc., died peacefully during the night of October 11, 2011 in Chicago. Galvin – a transformative global business leader, innovator, author, and philanthropist – was 89 years old.
(Photo:  http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20111012/NY85227)
Galvin oversaw remarkable growth and innovation during his 29-year tenure as CEO of Motorola. When he took over in 1959 on the death of his father, Motorola founder Paul V. Galvin, the company had annual sales of $290 million, primarily in North America. Building on the strong foundation he established with his father in Communications, Automotive, Military Electronics, Semiconductor and Consumer products, Galvin transformed Motorola into a global technology leader with $10.8 billion in sales in 1990, the year he stepped down as chairman. Due in large part to his vision and leadership, Motorola received the U.S. Commerce Department's first Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for Manufacturing in 1988.
Galvin was born in 1922 in Marshfield, Wisconsin.  He attended Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Illinois, where he excelled in academics, student government, the debating society, and sports. He went on to attend the University of Notre Dame. Starting full-time with Motorola in 1944, Galvin earned his way up through various positions before being named president in 1956. He was chief executive officer of Motorola from 1959 to 1988 and retained senior-most executive responsibility as chairman of the company throughout a planned succession completed in 1990. He retired from the board of directors in 2001. 
Throughout his life, Galvin was committed to innovation. "At times we must engage an act of faith," he said, "that key things are doable that are not provable."  Under his guidance, Motorola became a world leader in semiconductor, paging, two-way radio, space and military communication, and automotive embedded control technologies. Motorola's semiconductor products were particularly seminal, enabling a generation of computing and data communications start-ups in the 1980s and 1990s. 
Under Galvin, Motorola led the creation of the global cellular telephone industry. It installed the first prototype cell phone demonstration system in Washington DC in 1971; unveiled the first portable cell phone prototype, the DynaTAC, in 1973; enabled the first commercial cell phone call, which was made on the DynaTAC by Ameritech, in Chicago in 1983; and introduced MicroTAC, the industry's first compact cell phone, in 1989. Finally, in 1996, with Galvin serving on Motorola's board, the company manufactured the first pocket-sized 'flip phone', the StarTAC. These innovations paved the way to a cell phone market that now includes some 3.8 billion subscribers worldwide. Throughout his career, Galvin made crucial investments in cellular R&D and advocated tirelessly for competitive telecom regulation across the globe, never wavering in his belief that cellular technology would revolutionize the way people communicated.
He was profoundly grateful to the dedicated and talented employees of Motorola. "People are Motorola's most important asset," he often said. Galvin instilled his vision for a workplace marked by dignity, respect, integrity, trust, training, and fair pay in Motorola's global management team, and he urged heads of government and policymakers to encourage such workplace policies in order to enhance the opportunity for innovation and wealth creation in their countries. He measured himself and his executive team by the company's treatment of its workforce, and he was proud that Motorola employees never felt the need to unionize in any of its global operations. He insisted that all Motorola employees address him simply as 'Bob.'
Among many accomplishments in international business, Galvin moved Motorola into Europe, Southeast Asia, Israel, India, Japan, Latin America and China. An influential force in global telecom regulation and fair trade, he initiated Motorola's "Japan Challenge" and partnered with Robert Strauss, then US Trade Representative, to open Japan's domestic semiconductor markets. Seeing that China would soon evolve into a major global market, he committed the company to a $100 million investment there in 1987. By the time he retired from the board, Motorola was one of China's largest foreign investors.
Galvin was a trusted advisor to generations of US presidents and cabinet leaders from the Eisenhower to the Bush administrations. He served a term on the US Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and was lead business liaison in numerous US Trade Representative, State Department, and Defense and Intelligence delegations. He also chaired the Commission to Reorganize US National Laboratories (known as 'the Galvin Commission'), the Commission on the Future for the National Science Foundation, and Sematech, the government initiative to revitalize US semiconductor competitiveness. He also served as President of the Electronic Industry Association. 
In addition to technology and public affairs, Galvin also left his mark on the fields of management theory and change management. Under his leadership, Motorola developed the Six Sigma Quality improvement system and disseminated its findings across the globe.  Insistent that process change management was important to the growth of large companies, he helped to pioneer Technology Road-mapping and the Participative Management Program, founded Motorola University, and experimented continuously with other promising change management initiatives. 
Galvin's long-term vision was for Motorola to continue to advance a highly diversified technology platform to inform and enable the creation of new global technology industries while remaining true to the timeless principles that his father, Paul Galvin, imbued in the company as its founder. By doing both, he believed Motorola could eventually grow global sales by another factor of 10. He was, therefore, deeply disappointed when Motorola's board chose to deviate from that path in late 2003 and force out his son Christopher, the third generation Galvin CEO, just as Motorola was completing the most significant turnaround in its history. Galvin went on to join his sons, Chris and Michael, in founding Harrison Street Capital, an investment management firm focused on real estate, defense services and high technology.
During his retirement, Galvin established two non-profit think tanks to tackle major infrastructure problems. The first, originally the Galvin Electricity Initiative and now the Perfect Power Institute, aims to transform the electricity industry, as envisioned in a book Galvin co-authored called Perfect Power. The second, the Galvin Transportation Initiative, sought to eliminate urban auto congestion using a program laid out in the book Mobility First, which Galvin helped to inspire. Galvin's overriding objective in these projects was to create one million permanent jobs in the United States over 50 years.
Galvin wrote several books in his retirement years, including The Genius of People and America's Founding Secret, both on the influence of the Scottish Enlightenment on the founding of the United States, and The Idea of Ideas, a compilation of business philosophies that shaped Motorola.
Committed to the cause of education, Galvin focused much of his philanthropic energy on the Illinois Institute of Technology ("IIT"), which he never attended but considered essential to Chicago and the world.  He served on IIT's board for over 50 years, chairing it for 10. The Robert W. Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at IIT is named in his honor.  He also supported a variety of other non-profit causes over the years, including inner city schools, universities, hospitals, the arts, and science research.  
Business groups, industry associations, governments and academic institutions around the world have recognized Galvin's leadership and vision. The recipient of several honorary doctoral degrees, he was elected to the American National Business Hall of Fame and awarded the National Medal of Technology, the Vannevar Bush Award,  the French Legion of Honor medal and the Founders Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Recently, he received the Marconi Society Lifetime Achievement Award. He also served on the Advisory Boards of the Santa Fe Institute and the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry and was an active member of the Young Presidents Organization.
Above all, Galvin was a devoted husband of 67 years to Mary Barnes Galvin and an inspiring and loving father to his four children – Gail Galvin Ellis, Dawn Galvin Meiners, and Christopher and Michael Galvin – and their extended families, collectively comprised of 13 grandchildren, 10 great grandchildren (with one more on the way) and 8 valued in-laws. 
He delighted in passing time with family and friends, singing on the player piano and debating policy, books and ideas around the dining table. He loved playing tennis, snow skiing, waterskiing, windsurfing and sculling, among other sports. 
Galvin discovered his highest passions pursuing the principles of leadership, innovation, creativity, ethics, and dignity and respect for all. His was an inspiring, principled, loving and accomplished American life.

Galvin Center for Electricity Innovation at Illinois Institute of Technology; please send to the attention of Betsy Hughes at Illinois Institute of Technology, 10 W. 35th St., Ste. 1700, Chicago, IL 60616 (312-567-5045).
