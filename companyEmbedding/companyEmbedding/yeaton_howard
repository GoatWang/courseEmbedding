I am meeting with Dr Yeaton on 10/27 I'm a little nervous but he's close and sounds good by the comments posted.10/27/03: Met Dr but he did not continue with consult as I had my 2 yr old with me. I was very upset but it worked out that I could go the following week with my sister who had an appt 11/3. After meeting both Dr Anderson and Yeaton we were on a high and thrilled we found someone so close to home.They are thorough and down to earth. answered our questions and weren't afraid to answer some of the hard pressed ones about the hospital or their experience. We are delighted so far.There is a support group, and follow up care. They have referrals to the dietician and Psych (who does not take my insurance or my sisters - go figure)I trust their skills and they are both very sweet.12/26 postop - Dr Yeaton can be short, and I was not pleased with his attitude when I came home and nearly passed out. He was not helpful with my husband wondering what to do with me. Also, don't expect him to give support afterwards, go to the support group. Caroline or Jamie are the co leaders and are very helpful. Have your aftercare support set up before hand. Also, My followup appt was set for 17 days after surgery, I took out my own stitches and am healing well.1/5/03 Saw Dr Anderson for my follow up as Yeaton was out and the staff thought maybe I should be seen. he was positive, shook my hand and I liked him a whole lot better than Yeaton. Scheduled my next followup with him ,too.7/8 They have stopped surgeries for good after losing a couple of patients. The Hospital won't let them since January I guess. I'm glad I had it done but I would pick someone with more experience if I did it again. You should too.

Robbien Q. 




Dr Yeaton was very friendly upon meeting him. He was very matter of fact and honest with information re: pre op, post op, aftercare, and risks, as well as benefits. I liked him and I appreciated his honesty. 


Jan. 22, 2004






















Tricia A. 




Dr. Yeaton,was very straight forward. He has got a good well structured program and very strict about follow up. Being a nurse i know what i wanted from my MD and also checked with peers around the captial district he has got an excellent reputation. his office staff is friendly, they did all the work on the pre-approval. my mother also had the surgery but when they went in found some unexpected surprises he handled it like a pro, and my mother was a handful. If you decide to go for the surgery i would recommend him. He is very serious and will only take you if your are sure this is what you want. This is a serious step and he is very strict.

My first impression was a bit abrupt, he was talking to someone on the phone. But when he came into the room, that changed a great deal. He made me feel very comfortable and that he cared. He did not make feel rushed, he told me every thing I had read and even answered question I had even before I asked them, he did notice that I had my list and I had told him of my research. He made me feel important to him. His office staff were very pleasent. And they take care of all the paper work and phone calls, which was a relief.I can't say there was any thing I disliked about him or the staff.He went into great detail of the aftercare program and urged that I particpate in the support group. He did address the risk of the surgery. I would so far rate him a 7. I feel that surgical competence and beside manner are both important when you are putting your life into their hands. If I feel the 1st bit uncomfortable with him I would not continue with the procedure and what made me feel better even was the fact that he does not allow some interns to come in do the work, only himself and his associate will be doing it. The was a good thing.And to top it off, he is a very handsome man.

TRACEY C. 




DR. YEATON WAS WONDERFUL! THE GIRLS AT HIS OFFICE ARE GREAT. PRIOR TO MY CONSULT WITH HIM I CALLED QUITE A FEW TIMES AND ASKED QUESTIONS AND THEY WERE ALWAYS VERY FRIENDLY AND WILLING TO ANSWER WHATEVER THEY COULD. MY CALLS HAVE BEEN PROMPTLY RETURNED AND QUESTIONS ANSWERED QUICKLY AND FULLY. DR. YEATON HIMSELF WAS GREAT! HE WAS VERY CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDING. I NEVER FELT UNCOMFORTABLE OR EMBARRESSED. THE OFFICE GOT ME IN VERY QUICKLY AND ARRANGED FOR OTHER TESTS TO BE DONE RIGHT AWAY. MY OVERALL IMPRESSION WAS THAT DR. YEATON AND HIS STAFF ARE GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE.

I met Doctor Yeaton on May 5, 2003 for my consultation. He was very friendly and gave me great advice.His office staff seemed very friendly and helped me with some of my questions.


May 12, 2003






















Jennifer M. 




My first impression of him was a good one- very informative and no sugar coating -he told it like is and lets you know the pros and cons of it.His office staff needs a little work-I think because this is a fairly new procedure for him the staff is still learning the ropes of it. Very friendly though which helps make up the difference. Being a nurse myself and working in Saratoga has been very helpful -I know that Dr Yeaton is the best Surgeon in Saratoga and is highly recommended by every physician I know . I feel very comfortable w/ him and have the upmost confidence in his surgical ability.
