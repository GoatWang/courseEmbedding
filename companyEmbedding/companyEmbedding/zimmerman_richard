JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREWalk With Me To Another Land: A Narrative Approach To Transitional Ministryby Zimmerman, Richard P.The loss of a pastor throws a congregation into emotional turmoil. Sometimes bad circumstances force a pastor to leave. Sometimes an effective pastor moves to a new congregation or retires. Either way, the congregation is thrust into a unique journey through change and loss. People often fail to identify or understand the emotions of loss churning under the surface. Whether a congregation embraces a good future or gets stuck in the dynamics of the past depends in part on skillful and wise leadership. When faced with confusing signs, transitional leaders seek wisdom about the unique dynamics of a congregational system in flux. How can one leader adapt to the sudden and surprising needs inherent in transitional leadership? Firmly rooted in the biblical narratives of leading through journeys of transition, this book matches those narratives with case studies and other stories to connect the present practice of transitional leadership with the deep wisdom in the biblical accounts. The perseverance and hope inherent in the Bible's story of redemption deeply engages the dynamics of transition, suggesting ways to lead congregations to embrace a renewed mission. This combination of narratives points to a new level of understanding what is happening within communities in transition. ""Pastor Rich reminds us that God does amazing work in times of transition, struggle, or searching. His insights comparing the stories of scripture to real-life church situations are eye opening and encouraging. This book is a must-read for any pastor or church leader. --Brian Craker, Transitional Ministry Specialist ""Part insightful biblical exegesis, part practical manual grounded in wisdom and experience, Walk with Me to Another Land is indispensable not just for interim pastors, but anybody leading in any kind of transition. --Scott Dudley, Senior Pastor, Bellevue Presbyterian Church, Bellevue, WA ""Rich Zimmerman is a seasoned pastor who has reflected in depth on his experience of transitional ministry. He alternates stories of biblical characters in seasons and moments of transition with stories of interim ministers facing paradigmatic grief and conflicts. In the process he invites pastors to walk with their congregations toward healing and thriving."" --Gary Neal Hansen, Author of Kneeling with Giants: Learning to Pray with History's Best Teachers Richard P. Zimmerman is Stated Clerk of ECO's Presbytery of the Northwest. Following 18 years of pastoral service to congregations in Alaska and Oregon, he began leading churches through transition. His degrees include a BA from the University of Washington, an MDiv from Princeton Theological Seminary, a ThM from Regent College, and a DMin from Columbia Theological Seminary. He writes from 25 years of pastoral experience and his journey of leading two churches through pastoral transitions.TheologyCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
