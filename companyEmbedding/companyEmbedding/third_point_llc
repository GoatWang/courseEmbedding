Stakeholdings[edit]
Massey Energy[edit]
After a proxy fight, Third Point announced in June 2006 that Loeb and an ally, Todd Q. Swanson, would join the board of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States. The New York Times reported that Third Point owned 5.9% of Massey and that Loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months”, criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the Bahamas, Las Vegas, and West Palm Beach, Florida, on the company jet.
In one note, Loeb wrote, “Massey's C.E.O. is provided a company-owned home to live in ... In fact, after he leaves the company, the house is to be given to him as a parting gift. No one else at the company gets free housing, much less an entire home as a retirement gift. What kind of example does it set when a C.E.O. who makes $33.7 million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers?”[5]
Acorda Therapeutics[edit]
In February 2007, Loeb asked Acorda Therapeutics, in which Third Point had a 9.9% stake, to sell itself to a larger U.S. pharmaceutical firm, arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite Fampridine SR”, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Acorda, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process "and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently”. He argued that if Acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported Fampridine SR's development”. His letter sent Acorda shares up nearly 6.9%.[6]
Acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders”.[7] In May 2007, Third Point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in Acorda to 4.1%.[8]
Yahoo[edit]
Board appointment[edit]
After Third Point disclosed its stake in Yahoo on September 8, 2011, calling for the resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up a conference call with Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”.[9]
Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest outside shareholder, I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in-Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”.[10]
In a May 2012 letter to Yahoo's directors, Loeb noted that according to Yahoo's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, newly hired CEO Scott Thompson had a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science, whereas a simple Google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only”; Thompson resigned ten days later.[11] On the same day, Loeb, Wilson, and another Third Point candidate, Michael J. Wolf, were named to the Yahoo's board.[12]
Resignation from board[edit]
Marissa Mayer's appointment as CEO to replace Thompson was seen as the culmination of Loeb's efforts to transform Yahoo. Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf submitted their resignations from Yahoo's board in July 2013, and Yahoo bought back 40 million shares from Third Point, leaving the hedge fund's ownership at less than 2%, so the three executives had to leave. However, the hedge fund gained a profit of $1 billion. Marissa Mayer issued a statement praising Loeb: “Daniel Loeb had the vision to see Yahoo for its immense potential...While there's still a lot of work ahead, they've given us a great foundation”.[13] Steven Davidoff of New York Times observed that Yahoo "seem[ed] like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors, Daniel S. Loeb”, noting that Yahoo's share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail, or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away”.[14]
According to a January 2014 Vanity Fair profile, when Loeb told Mayer he wanted to sell "20 million shares, or one-third of his remaining holdings", Mayer stated Yahoo would (buy back the stock at a guaranteed $29.11 per share)—but only if he sold 40 million shares. This transaction would "bring Loeb’s stake below the 2 percent threshold, which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board".[15] Loeb also signed a standstill agreement in 2013 that bars him from activist investing in Yahoo until 2018.[16]
Sotheby's[edit]
Loeb's announcement in August 2013 stated that he acquired a 5.7% stake in Sotheby's, causing its shares to rise 3%.[17] Sotheby's announced in September 2013 that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend”, a response to Third Point's having raised its stake in the company. The New York Times reported that Sotheby's share price had “climbed about 5 percent since Third Point disclosed its increased stake”.[18]
Loeb disclosed on October 2, 2013, that he was now Sotheby's largest shareholder, with a 9.3% stake. On the same date he announced his desire to join Sotheby's board and called for the resignation of chairman and CEO William F. Ruprecht. “Sotheby's is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”, Loeb wrote in a letter to the SEC, charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture”, as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's”, Sotheby's main competitor. The firm, he wrote, required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and CEO to be filled by two different persons, not one. In a later statement, Loeb said that “Sotheby's malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels”, criticized Ruprecht's $6.3 million salary, and chastised the Sotheby's directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet.[19]
Sotheby's replied to Loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the Standard & Poor's MidCap Index over the one, five and ten year periods”.[20]
Adam Lindeman of the New York Observer, in an article headlined “Barbarians at Sotheby's Gate?”, suggested that the “firefight” between Loeb and Sotheby's would “benefit Sotheby's”, a place Lindeman described as having “a British, clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree”, compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of Christie's.[21]
Ruprecht announced his resignation in November 2014, sending Sotheby's shares up around 7% a day.[22]
Sony[edit]
Loeb criticized the poor performance of Sony's summer 2013 films After Earth and White House Down in a letter issued that year, expressing concern that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released 2013’s versions of Waterworld and Ishtar back-to-back”. Loeb proposed a "partial spinoff" (handing about 15% to 20% to existing shareholders) of Sony's entertainment business", and even offered to "backstop the initial public offering up to $2 billion to ensure its success".[23][24] “Given entertainment's perpetual underperformance”, Loeb wrote, “perhaps Sony's reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from (understandable) embarrassment”.[25] In addition to asking Sony to spin off its entertainment assets, Loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division. Loeb's letter sent Sony stock up about 10%. At the time Third Point was Sony’s largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake.[12]
Sony's board announced on May 22, 2013, that it was considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment division. “We will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on Sony's response ... [I]t is an important matter that relates to Sony's core businesses and management, so the board must hold ample discussions”, Hirai said. The New York Times noted that Japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls”.[26]
Hirai ultimately rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying, “Sony's entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth, and I am firmly committed to assuring their growth, to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business”. One factor in Hirai's decision was the counsel of advisers who argued, “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded”. Sony's sole concession to Loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment unit's financials”. Third Point expressed disappointment in Sony's decision, but welcomed “Sony's commitment to greater transparency”.[27]
MGM[edit]
The Hollywood Reporter reported in May 2013 that Loeb was buying up shares of MGM,[12] leading CNBC commentators to note that Loeb, who already owned stakes in Yahoo, Sony, and Virgin Media, seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul".[28] Bloomberg noted in September 2013 that Third Point was now “one of MGM’s top five owners, according to a person with knowledge of the situation”.[29]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb has met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, who are aiming to "shak[e] up companies’ slothful boards."[30]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
After Ligand Pharmaceuticals hired John Higgins as its new CEO in January 2007, Third Point Management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses. Since 2011, Ligand Pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to $65 million.[31]
Baxter International[edit]
In August 2015, Third Point took a 7 percent stake, over $2 billion, in Baxter International.[32] In a letter to Baxter's board, Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new CEO and requested for Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson for two seats on the board.[33][34] Baxter reached a settlement with Third Point agreeing to add Munib Islam to its board.[35] Loeb also disapproved of the board's current setup, in which directors do not face re-election every year, and described it as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.”[36] Baxter then agreed to hold annual elections for its board of directors after Loeb's criticism.[35]
Third Point funds[edit]
Third Point LLC serves as the investment manager of Third Point Partners Qualified L.P., Third Point Partners L.P., Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., and Third Point Ultra Master Fund L.P.[37] Third Point Partners is Third Point's oldest fund.[38]
According to CNBC, Third Point has ranked among the industry's best performers, returning an average of 19 percent a year since its launch.[39]
Third Point Re[edit]
Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., through its class 4 reinsurance company, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd., is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsure. Together they are known as Third Point Re. The firm was incorporated on October 6, 2011. Its investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, and Loeb is one of its founding shareholders. Third Point Re directly owns its own investments, which, according to its website, “are held in a separate account and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund”. A.M. Best Company gave Third Point Re an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating in January 2012.[38] Since 1995, Third Point Re has generated one of the best long-term investment track records in history, averaging 19.5% annual returns.[40]
Third Point Re raised approximately $276 million in an IPO in August 2013. That same month, it was reported that Third Point Re qualified as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.[41]
Third Point Offshore Investors Ltd.[edit]
Third Point Offshore Investors Limited is a closed-ended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in Guernsey.[41][42] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “We believe that we will be the first U.S. hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the London Stock Exchange”, Loeb said.[43]
2010 letter about Bernanke[edit]
In a December 2010 letter to investors, Loeb described a recent 60 Minutes interview with Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview”. In the letter he largely rejected the "narrative" that Bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the Fed's response to it.
Bernanke's “narrative arc...posits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the Great Depression had the Fed not intervened to rescue the financial system. Having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial Armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the Fed’s intervention blindly again, Chairman Bernanke’s next chapter states that the Fed’s latest $600 billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment, which otherwise would continue indefinitely”, Loeb complained, rejecting Bernanke's “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the Fed's admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview”. Loeb called “Bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking”, adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong”, not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision”.
Loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as Bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing”. At Third Point, Loeb wrote, “we are truth seekers and problem solvers. We must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for, and ultimately fabricating, absolute truths. The only thing we are 100 percent confident in is that we are fallible, we don't have all the answers, and we will make some mistakes”.[44]
Fairfax lawsuit[edit]
The Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sued Third Point and other hedge funds in a New Jersey state court in March 2011, charging that Loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short Fairfax-related positions” was the result of extensive research.[45] New Jersey State Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of Third Point LLC, Daniel S. Loeb, and Jeffrey Perry in December 2011, dismissing the charges against them. “We are gratified that the Judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources”, said Third Point, describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping [and] a cynical attempt by Fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about Fairfax's financial position”.[46]

Stakeholdings[edit]
Massey Energy[edit]
After a proxy fight, Third Point announced in June 2006 that Loeb and an ally, Todd Q. Swanson, would join the board of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States. The New York Times reported that Third Point owned 5.9% of Massey and that Loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months”, criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the Bahamas, Las Vegas, and West Palm Beach, Florida, on the company jet.
In one note, Loeb wrote, “Massey's C.E.O. is provided a company-owned home to live in ... In fact, after he leaves the company, the house is to be given to him as a parting gift. No one else at the company gets free housing, much less an entire home as a retirement gift. What kind of example does it set when a C.E.O. who makes $33.7 million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers?”[5]
Acorda Therapeutics[edit]
In February 2007, Loeb asked Acorda Therapeutics, in which Third Point had a 9.9% stake, to sell itself to a larger U.S. pharmaceutical firm, arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite Fampridine SR”, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Acorda, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process "and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently”. He argued that if Acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported Fampridine SR's development”. His letter sent Acorda shares up nearly 6.9%.[6]
Acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders”.[7] In May 2007, Third Point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in Acorda to 4.1%.[8]
Yahoo[edit]
Board appointment[edit]
After Third Point disclosed its stake in Yahoo on September 8, 2011, calling for the resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up a conference call with Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”.[9]
Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest outside shareholder, I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in-Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”.[10]
In a May 2012 letter to Yahoo's directors, Loeb noted that according to Yahoo's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, newly hired CEO Scott Thompson had a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science, whereas a simple Google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only”; Thompson resigned ten days later.[11] On the same day, Loeb, Wilson, and another Third Point candidate, Michael J. Wolf, were named to the Yahoo's board.[12]
Resignation from board[edit]
Marissa Mayer's appointment as CEO to replace Thompson was seen as the culmination of Loeb's efforts to transform Yahoo. Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf submitted their resignations from Yahoo's board in July 2013, and Yahoo bought back 40 million shares from Third Point, leaving the hedge fund's ownership at less than 2%, so the three executives had to leave. However, the hedge fund gained a profit of $1 billion. Marissa Mayer issued a statement praising Loeb: “Daniel Loeb had the vision to see Yahoo for its immense potential...While there's still a lot of work ahead, they've given us a great foundation”.[13] Steven Davidoff of New York Times observed that Yahoo "seem[ed] like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors, Daniel S. Loeb”, noting that Yahoo's share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail, or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away”.[14]
According to a January 2014 Vanity Fair profile, when Loeb told Mayer he wanted to sell "20 million shares, or one-third of his remaining holdings", Mayer stated Yahoo would (buy back the stock at a guaranteed $29.11 per share)—but only if he sold 40 million shares. This transaction would "bring Loeb’s stake below the 2 percent threshold, which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board".[15] Loeb also signed a standstill agreement in 2013 that bars him from activist investing in Yahoo until 2018.[16]
Sotheby's[edit]
Loeb's announcement in August 2013 stated that he acquired a 5.7% stake in Sotheby's, causing its shares to rise 3%.[17] Sotheby's announced in September 2013 that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend”, a response to Third Point's having raised its stake in the company. The New York Times reported that Sotheby's share price had “climbed about 5 percent since Third Point disclosed its increased stake”.[18]
Loeb disclosed on October 2, 2013, that he was now Sotheby's largest shareholder, with a 9.3% stake. On the same date he announced his desire to join Sotheby's board and called for the resignation of chairman and CEO William F. Ruprecht. “Sotheby's is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”, Loeb wrote in a letter to the SEC, charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture”, as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's”, Sotheby's main competitor. The firm, he wrote, required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and CEO to be filled by two different persons, not one. In a later statement, Loeb said that “Sotheby's malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels”, criticized Ruprecht's $6.3 million salary, and chastised the Sotheby's directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet.[19]
Sotheby's replied to Loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the Standard & Poor's MidCap Index over the one, five and ten year periods”.[20]
Adam Lindeman of the New York Observer, in an article headlined “Barbarians at Sotheby's Gate?”, suggested that the “firefight” between Loeb and Sotheby's would “benefit Sotheby's”, a place Lindeman described as having “a British, clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree”, compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of Christie's.[21]
Ruprecht announced his resignation in November 2014, sending Sotheby's shares up around 7% a day.[22]
Sony[edit]
Loeb criticized the poor performance of Sony's summer 2013 films After Earth and White House Down in a letter issued that year, expressing concern that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released 2013’s versions of Waterworld and Ishtar back-to-back”. Loeb proposed a "partial spinoff" (handing about 15% to 20% to existing shareholders) of Sony's entertainment business", and even offered to "backstop the initial public offering up to $2 billion to ensure its success".[23][24] “Given entertainment's perpetual underperformance”, Loeb wrote, “perhaps Sony's reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from (understandable) embarrassment”.[25] In addition to asking Sony to spin off its entertainment assets, Loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division. Loeb's letter sent Sony stock up about 10%. At the time Third Point was Sony’s largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake.[12]
Sony's board announced on May 22, 2013, that it was considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment division. “We will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on Sony's response ... [I]t is an important matter that relates to Sony's core businesses and management, so the board must hold ample discussions”, Hirai said. The New York Times noted that Japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls”.[26]
Hirai ultimately rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying, “Sony's entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth, and I am firmly committed to assuring their growth, to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business”. One factor in Hirai's decision was the counsel of advisers who argued, “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded”. Sony's sole concession to Loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment unit's financials”. Third Point expressed disappointment in Sony's decision, but welcomed “Sony's commitment to greater transparency”.[27]
MGM[edit]
The Hollywood Reporter reported in May 2013 that Loeb was buying up shares of MGM,[12] leading CNBC commentators to note that Loeb, who already owned stakes in Yahoo, Sony, and Virgin Media, seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul".[28] Bloomberg noted in September 2013 that Third Point was now “one of MGM’s top five owners, according to a person with knowledge of the situation”.[29]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb has met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, who are aiming to "shak[e] up companies’ slothful boards."[30]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
After Ligand Pharmaceuticals hired John Higgins as its new CEO in January 2007, Third Point Management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses. Since 2011, Ligand Pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to $65 million.[31]
Baxter International[edit]
In August 2015, Third Point took a 7 percent stake, over $2 billion, in Baxter International.[32] In a letter to Baxter's board, Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new CEO and requested for Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson for two seats on the board.[33][34] Baxter reached a settlement with Third Point agreeing to add Munib Islam to its board.[35] Loeb also disapproved of the board's current setup, in which directors do not face re-election every year, and described it as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.”[36] Baxter then agreed to hold annual elections for its board of directors after Loeb's criticism.[35]
Third Point funds[edit]
Third Point LLC serves as the investment manager of Third Point Partners Qualified L.P., Third Point Partners L.P., Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., and Third Point Ultra Master Fund L.P.[37] Third Point Partners is Third Point's oldest fund.[38]
According to CNBC, Third Point has ranked among the industry's best performers, returning an average of 19 percent a year since its launch.[39]
Third Point Re[edit]
Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., through its class 4 reinsurance company, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd., is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsure. Together they are known as Third Point Re. The firm was incorporated on October 6, 2011. Its investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, and Loeb is one of its founding shareholders. Third Point Re directly owns its own investments, which, according to its website, “are held in a separate account and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund”. A.M. Best Company gave Third Point Re an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating in January 2012.[38] Since 1995, Third Point Re has generated one of the best long-term investment track records in history, averaging 19.5% annual returns.[40]
Third Point Re raised approximately $276 million in an IPO in August 2013. That same month, it was reported that Third Point Re qualified as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.[41]
Third Point Offshore Investors Ltd.[edit]
Third Point Offshore Investors Limited is a closed-ended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in Guernsey.[41][42] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “We believe that we will be the first U.S. hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the London Stock Exchange”, Loeb said.[43]
2010 letter about Bernanke[edit]
In a December 2010 letter to investors, Loeb described a recent 60 Minutes interview with Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview”. In the letter he largely rejected the "narrative" that Bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the Fed's response to it.
Bernanke's “narrative arc...posits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the Great Depression had the Fed not intervened to rescue the financial system. Having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial Armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the Fed’s intervention blindly again, Chairman Bernanke’s next chapter states that the Fed’s latest $600 billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment, which otherwise would continue indefinitely”, Loeb complained, rejecting Bernanke's “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the Fed's admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview”. Loeb called “Bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking”, adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong”, not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision”.
Loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as Bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing”. At Third Point, Loeb wrote, “we are truth seekers and problem solvers. We must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for, and ultimately fabricating, absolute truths. The only thing we are 100 percent confident in is that we are fallible, we don't have all the answers, and we will make some mistakes”.[44]
Fairfax lawsuit[edit]
The Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sued Third Point and other hedge funds in a New Jersey state court in March 2011, charging that Loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short Fairfax-related positions” was the result of extensive research.[45] New Jersey State Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of Third Point LLC, Daniel S. Loeb, and Jeffrey Perry in December 2011, dismissing the charges against them. “We are gratified that the Judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources”, said Third Point, describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping [and] a cynical attempt by Fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about Fairfax's financial position”.[46]

Stakeholdings[edit]
Massey Energy[edit]
After a proxy fight, Third Point announced in June 2006 that Loeb and an ally, Todd Q. Swanson, would join the board of Massey Energy, the fourth-largest coal producer in the United States. The New York Times reported that Third Point owned 5.9% of Massey and that Loeb had been “feuding with the company for several months”, criticizing the management and bringing attention to executive trips to the Bahamas, Las Vegas, and West Palm Beach, Florida, on the company jet.
In one note, Loeb wrote, “Massey's C.E.O. is provided a company-owned home to live in ... In fact, after he leaves the company, the house is to be given to him as a parting gift. No one else at the company gets free housing, much less an entire home as a retirement gift. What kind of example does it set when a C.E.O. who makes $33.7 million in a single year is given free housing while the company is having difficulty retaining its mine workers?”[5]
Acorda Therapeutics[edit]
In February 2007, Loeb asked Acorda Therapeutics, in which Third Point had a 9.9% stake, to sell itself to a larger U.S. pharmaceutical firm, arguing that a larger company with more experience “would be able to expedite Fampridine SR”, a multiple sclerosis drug produced by Acorda, through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process "and into the hands of patients more quickly and efficiently”. He argued that if Acorda to continue going it alone or to seek partnership with a European firm “would be a tremendous injustice not only to multiple sclerosis patients, who should receive such an effective drug in the most expeditious manner possible, but also to your public shareholders, who have supported Fampridine SR's development”. His letter sent Acorda shares up nearly 6.9%.[6]
Acorda responded with a statement indicating that its board of directors “continually evaluates ways to maximize shareholder value and to serve the best interests of all shareholders”.[7] In May 2007, Third Point disclosed that it had lowered its stake in Acorda to 4.1%.[8]
Yahoo[edit]
Board appointment[edit]
After Third Point disclosed its stake in Yahoo on September 8, 2011, calling for the resignations of four directors, Yahoo set up a conference call with Loeb, Jerry Yang of Yahoo, and one of the directors in question, Roy Bostock. Loeb said that the conversation concluded with “Mr. Bostock’s abrupt unilateral termination of the call”. Bostock, however, claimed that he had “said that he had other shareholders to attend to and ended the phone call”.[9]
Loeb informed Yahoo CEO Scott Thompson in a March 2012 letter that Third Point wanted four seats on the firm's board. At the time Third Point owned about 5.3% of the firm. Yahoo sought to compromise by accepting one of Loeb's board nominees, Harry Wilson, a restructuring specialist, plus “another candidate acceptable to the two sides”, but Loeb insisted on being added himself to the board. Yahoo refused, telling Loeb, according to his own account, that “my experience and knowledge 'would not be additive to the Board' and that as Yahoo's largest outside shareholder, I would be 'conflicted' as a Director. ... Only in an illogical Alice-in-Wonderland world would a shareholder be deemed to be conflicted from representing the interests of other shareholders because he is, well, a shareholder too.” Loeb charged that the “Board's evaluation of our candidates” made “a mockery of good principles of corporate governance”. In response to Yahoo's charge that Third Point was a “short-term investor”, Loeb responded that “this 'long-term vs. short-term' excuse is a canard and particularly inapt in the case of Yahoo. If there ever was a company in need of a sense of urgency, it is this one”. Loeb added that the “real issue is not short-term versus long-term but about Board representatives who have skin in the game and will exercise sound business judgment”.[10]
In a May 2012 letter to Yahoo's directors, Loeb noted that according to Yahoo's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, newly hired CEO Scott Thompson had a bachelor's degree in accounting and computer science, whereas a simple Google search revealed that his degree was “in accounting only”; Thompson resigned ten days later.[11] On the same day, Loeb, Wilson, and another Third Point candidate, Michael J. Wolf, were named to the Yahoo's board.[12]
Resignation from board[edit]
Marissa Mayer's appointment as CEO to replace Thompson was seen as the culmination of Loeb's efforts to transform Yahoo. Loeb, Wilson, and Wolf submitted their resignations from Yahoo's board in July 2013, and Yahoo bought back 40 million shares from Third Point, leaving the hedge fund's ownership at less than 2%, so the three executives had to leave. However, the hedge fund gained a profit of $1 billion. Marissa Mayer issued a statement praising Loeb: “Daniel Loeb had the vision to see Yahoo for its immense potential...While there's still a lot of work ahead, they've given us a great foundation”.[13] Steven Davidoff of New York Times observed that Yahoo "seem[ed] like damaged goods now that it has been abandoned by one of its biggest investors, Daniel S. Loeb”, noting that Yahoo's share buyback had “the whiff of greenmail, or repurchasing stock to make an investor go away”.[14]
According to a January 2014 Vanity Fair profile, when Loeb told Mayer he wanted to sell "20 million shares, or one-third of his remaining holdings", Mayer stated Yahoo would (buy back the stock at a guaranteed $29.11 per share)—but only if he sold 40 million shares. This transaction would "bring Loeb’s stake below the 2 percent threshold, which meant that he and the other two representatives would have to leave the board".[15] Loeb also signed a standstill agreement in 2013 that bars him from activist investing in Yahoo until 2018.[16]
Sotheby's[edit]
Loeb's announcement in August 2013 stated that he acquired a 5.7% stake in Sotheby's, causing its shares to rise 3%.[17] Sotheby's announced in September 2013 that it “was considering moves like a share repurchase or raising its dividend”, a response to Third Point's having raised its stake in the company. The New York Times reported that Sotheby's share price had “climbed about 5 percent since Third Point disclosed its increased stake”.[18]
Loeb disclosed on October 2, 2013, that he was now Sotheby's largest shareholder, with a 9.3% stake. On the same date he announced his desire to join Sotheby's board and called for the resignation of chairman and CEO William F. Ruprecht. “Sotheby's is like an old master painting in desperate need of restoration”, Loeb wrote in a letter to the SEC, charging that a “crisis of management” at the firm had resulted in “dysfunctional divisions and a fractured culture”, as well as “chronically weak operating margins and deteriorating competitive position relative to Christie's”, Sotheby's main competitor. The firm, he wrote, required new directors and needed for the positions of chairman and CEO to be filled by two different persons, not one. In a later statement, Loeb said that “Sotheby's malaise is a result of a lack of leadership and strategic vision at its highest levels”, criticized Ruprecht's $6.3 million salary, and chastised the Sotheby's directors for spending “hundreds of thousands of dollars” in shareholder funds on a single extravagant meal banquet.[19]
Sotheby's replied to Loeb with a statement maintaining that its “actions as a leader in the global art business have been producing superior results—including a share price increase exceeding the Standard & Poor's MidCap Index over the one, five and ten year periods”.[20]
Adam Lindeman of the New York Observer, in an article headlined “Barbarians at Sotheby's Gate?”, suggested that the “firefight” between Loeb and Sotheby's would “benefit Sotheby's”, a place Lindeman described as having “a British, clubby feeling of privilege and stuffy pedigree”, compared to the “considerably warmer” feel of Christie's.[21]
Ruprecht announced his resignation in November 2014, sending Sotheby's shares up around 7% a day.[22]
Sony[edit]
Loeb criticized the poor performance of Sony's summer 2013 films After Earth and White House Down in a letter issued that year, expressing concern that Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai “does not worry about a division that has just released 2013’s versions of Waterworld and Ishtar back-to-back”. Loeb proposed a "partial spinoff" (handing about 15% to 20% to existing shareholders) of Sony's entertainment business", and even offered to "backstop the initial public offering up to $2 billion to ensure its success".[23][24] “Given entertainment's perpetual underperformance”, Loeb wrote, “perhaps Sony's reluctance to discuss it candidly stems from (understandable) embarrassment”.[25] In addition to asking Sony to spin off its entertainment assets, Loeb sought a spinoff of its financial services division. Loeb's letter sent Sony stock up about 10%. At the time Third Point was Sony’s largest shareholder with a 6.5% stake.[12]
Sony's board announced on May 22, 2013, that it was considering Loeb's proposal to spin off its entertainment division. “We will engage in thorough discussions at the board level to decide on Sony's response ... [I]t is an important matter that relates to Sony's core businesses and management, so the board must hold ample discussions”, Hirai said. The New York Times noted that Japanese corporations “have a history of ignoring letters from shareholders calling for overhauls”.[26]
Hirai ultimately rejected Loeb's suggestion, saying, “Sony's entertainment businesses are critical to our corporate strategy and will be important drivers of growth, and I am firmly committed to assuring their growth, to improving their profitability and to aggressively leveraging their collaboration with our electronics and service business”. One factor in Hirai's decision was the counsel of advisers who argued, “that subsidiary initial public offerings have rarely succeeded”. Sony's sole concession to Loeb was an agreement “to disclose more information about the entertainment unit's financials”. Third Point expressed disappointment in Sony's decision, but welcomed “Sony's commitment to greater transparency”.[27]
MGM[edit]
The Hollywood Reporter reported in May 2013 that Loeb was buying up shares of MGM,[12] leading CNBC commentators to note that Loeb, who already owned stakes in Yahoo, Sony, and Virgin Media, seemed to be “becoming something of a media mogul".[28] Bloomberg noted in September 2013 that Third Point was now “one of MGM’s top five owners, according to a person with knowledge of the situation”.[29]
Fanuc[edit]
In late 2014, Third Point took a stake in Fanuc, a robotics and computer numerical controls firm. Prior, Fanuc seldom made direct contact with its investors but in March 2014, the company decided "it would start talking to shareholders" and "return some of its cash to them." Loeb has met with Fanuc's President, Yoshiharu Inaba, with encouragement from Japan's government officials, who are aiming to "shak[e] up companies’ slothful boards."[30]
Ligand Pharmaceuticals[edit]
After Ligand Pharmaceuticals hired John Higgins as its new CEO in January 2007, Third Point Management invested in the biotech firm and was able to cut its losses. Since 2011, Ligand Pharmaceuticals tripled its stocks and doubled its revenue to $65 million.[31]
Baxter International[edit]
In August 2015, Third Point took a 7 percent stake, over $2 billion, in Baxter International.[32] In a letter to Baxter's board, Loeb wrote that he was “most impressed” by the company’s willingness to consider adding new directors to go along with a new CEO and requested for Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson for two seats on the board.[33][34] Baxter reached a settlement with Third Point agreeing to add Munib Islam to its board.[35] Loeb also disapproved of the board's current setup, in which directors do not face re-election every year, and described it as “shareholder-unfriendly and archaic.”[36] Baxter then agreed to hold annual elections for its board of directors after Loeb's criticism.[35]
Third Point funds[edit]
Third Point LLC serves as the investment manager of Third Point Partners Qualified L.P., Third Point Partners L.P., Third Point Offshore Master Fund L.P., and Third Point Ultra Master Fund L.P.[37] Third Point Partners is Third Point's oldest fund.[38]
According to CNBC, Third Point has ranked among the industry's best performers, returning an average of 19 percent a year since its launch.[39]
Third Point Re[edit]
Third Point Reinsurance Ltd., through its class 4 reinsurance company, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd., is a Bermuda-based specialty property and casualty reinsure. Together they are known as Third Point Re. The firm was incorporated on October 6, 2011. Its investable assets are managed by Third Point LLC, and Loeb is one of its founding shareholders. Third Point Re directly owns its own investments, which, according to its website, “are held in a separate account and managed by Third Point LLC on substantially the same basis as its main hedge funds, including Third Point Partners L.P., the original Third Point LLC hedge fund”. A.M. Best Company gave Third Point Re an A- (Excellent) financial strength rating in January 2012.[38] Since 1995, Third Point Re has generated one of the best long-term investment track records in history, averaging 19.5% annual returns.[40]
Third Point Re raised approximately $276 million in an IPO in August 2013. That same month, it was reported that Third Point Re qualified as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act.[41]
Third Point Offshore Investors Ltd.[edit]
Third Point Offshore Investors Limited is a closed-ended limited liability investment company registered and incorporated in Guernsey.[41][42] It was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2007. “We believe that we will be the first U.S. hedge fund to list a single manager fund on the London Stock Exchange”, Loeb said.[43]
2010 letter about Bernanke[edit]
In a December 2010 letter to investors, Loeb described a recent 60 Minutes interview with Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke as “a staged infomercial rather than a serious interview”. In the letter he largely rejected the "narrative" that Bernanke had constructed around the global financial crisis and the Fed's response to it.
Bernanke's “narrative arc...posits that the global economy would have collapsed and unemployment would have exceeded levels of the Great Depression had the Fed not intervened to rescue the financial system. Having set the stage for how we were saved from global financial Armageddon once before and therefore ought to trust the Fed’s intervention blindly again, Chairman Bernanke’s next chapter states that the Fed’s latest $600 billion market intervention will alleviate our seemingly intractable high levels of unemployment, which otherwise would continue indefinitely”, Loeb complained, rejecting Bernanke's “narrative” as contrary to “certain facts and our own experience – like the Fed's admitted inability to see the crisis coming or to regulate effectively the banks under its purview”. Loeb called “Bernanke’s devotion to the righteousness of his narrative” “striking”, adding that “every actor in the financial system still ought to be asking how things went so terribly wrong”, not inventing a narrative “that emancipates one from blame and promises future forecasting precision”.
Loeb warned of “the dangers of believing too much in the stories we tell ourselves” and said that highly placed individual such as Bernanke should “be willing to search out facts and admit wrongdoing”. At Third Point, Loeb wrote, “we are truth seekers and problem solvers. We must satisfy ourselves with determining ranges of outcomes and potential scenarios rather than searching for, and ultimately fabricating, absolute truths. The only thing we are 100 percent confident in is that we are fallible, we don't have all the answers, and we will make some mistakes”.[44]
Fairfax lawsuit[edit]
The Canadian insurance firm Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. sued Third Point and other hedge funds in a New Jersey state court in March 2011, charging that Loeb lied to investors when he stated that his “decision to short Fairfax-related positions” was the result of extensive research.[45] New Jersey State Court Judge Stephan C. Hansbury granted the summary judgment motions of Third Point LLC, Daniel S. Loeb, and Jeffrey Perry in December 2011, dismissing the charges against them. “We are gratified that the Judge has put an end to this colossal waste of time and resources”, said Third Point, describing the case as “a blatant case of forum shopping [and] a cynical attempt by Fairfax to manipulate the judicial system and to intimidate institutional investors who had legitimate concerns about Fairfax's financial position”.[46]

Third Point LLC 390 Park Avenue New York, NY 10022 Tel 212 715 3880 

June 25, 2017 Dear Investor: Third Point currently owns roughly 40 million shares of Nestlé. We hold this stake in our funds and in a special purpose vehicle raised for this opportunity. Our investment, including options, currently amounts to over $3.5 billion. Nestlé, with an over $250 billion market capitalization, is the largest food business in the world 

and home to some of the world’s greatest brand

s. Its portfolio, including 34 brands that generate more than CHF 1 billion in sales annually, had roughly CHF 90 billion in total sales last year. The company operates across a number of advantaged categories including coffee, infant formula, pet food, and bottled water. Nestlé also has a strong footprint in emerging markets. The category and geographic mix of the portfolio is excellent and offers the company a long runway for growth as emerging market customers increase consumption and developed market consumers trade up. However, despite having arguably the best positioned portfolio in the consumer packaged goods industry, Nestlé shares have significantly underperformed most of their US and European consumer staples peers on a three year, five year, and ten year total shareholder return basis. 

One year returns have been driven largely by the market’s anticipation that 

with a newly appointed CEO, Nestlé will improve. 
























 

2 

Exhibit A: One, Three, Five and Ten Year Consumer 

Industry TSR’s

 

Nestlé has fallen behind over the past decade in an environment where growth has slowed due to changes in consumer tastes and shopping habits, as well as an influx of new competition from smaller, local brands. While its peers have adapted to this lower growth world, Nestlé has remained stuck in its old ways, making it impossible to deliver on the 

once reliable “

Nestlé 

model” that called for 5

-6% organic sales growth annually and continuous margin improvement. As a result, earnings per share have not grown in five years. This has had a knock-on effect on dividend growth, which has slowed to low single digits in recent years, and 

Nestlé’s

 payout ratio now stands at the upper end of the peer group range at 66%. Without addressing the 

company’s stalled earnings, further dividend 

increases will be unsustainable at historical rates. While Nestlé has stood still, its peers have pursued productivity increases aggressively and made other changes in order to deliver earnings growth and create shareholder value in a slower sales growth world. Third Point invested in Nestlé because we recognized a familiar set of conditions that make it ripe for improvement and change: a conglomerate with unrealized potential for margin

improvement and innovation in its core businesses, an unoptimized balance sheet, a number of non-core assets, and a recent history of meaningful under-performance versus peers. It is rare to find a business of 

Nestlé’s

 quality with so many avenues for improvement. Like other investors, we are also confident that Nestlé is prepared for change because of 

the company’s

 wise decision last year to hire a new Chief Executive with a high caliber pedigree from outside its ranks for the first time in nearly a century. 

Nestlé’s new leader,

 Dr. Ulf Mark Schneider, had an impressive track record of value creation as the CEO of Fresenius, a German medical supply company, from 2003 until he joined Nestlé. He delivered strong organic sales growth and executed well on transformational M&A, and shares appreciated at a roughly 20% CAGR during his tenure. As he settles into his role at Nestlé, we think he has the ability to execute on the kinds of new initiatives the company must pursue. However, we feel strongly that in order to succeed, Dr. Schneider will need to articulate a decisive and bold action plan that addresses the staid culture and tendency 

towards incrementalism that has typified the company’s prior leade

rship and resulted in its long-term underperformance. Our observations and insights about the company have been bolstered by Jan Bennink, one of the 

world’s 

recognized leaders in the packaged goods space, who we have retained to advise us on this investment. Among other roles, Jan was a successful CEO of Royal Numico, which was the largest baby food company in Europe when he became its chief executive. At Numico, Jan divested non-core assets and cut costs in order to reinvest in the core business. His actions helped dramatically reaccelerate organic sales growth and expand margins before the company was sold to Danone for a huge premium. He then became the Executive Chairman of Sara Lee, where he oversaw its separation into two 

“pure play” companies:

 a North American branded meat company called Hillshire Brands, and a global tea & coffee company called DE Master Blenders 1753. He then led Master Blenders until it was sold to the Joh. A. Benckiser group.

LONDON — Over the past two decades, the hedge fund mogul Daniel S. Loeb has established himself as one of the biggest activist investors around. Now, he has set his sights on one of Europe’s largest corporate citizens: Nestlé, the global food giant.In a letter to investors sent on Sunday, his Third Point hedge fund argued that Nestlé, a Swiss conglomerate whose wares range from candy to baby food to pet food, should sell its stake in L’Oréal and sell off nonessential operations as part of a broad shake-up.It is the latest ambitious move by an activist investor to rattle the leaders of the corporate world. Flush with cash, these funds have taken stakes in ever-bigger companies, hoping to goad them into selling themselves or breaking themselves up to improve their stock prices.


            How Nestlé Makes Its Money        

            Nestlé’s products include candy, water, dairy and pet food, though its candy business has waned, especially as fewer Americans have displayed an appetite for sweets.

Jana Partners, for instance, prodded change at Whole Foods Market. This month, that grocery store chain announced that it was selling itself to Amazon for $13.4 billion. And Trian Fund Management took a $3.5 billion stake in Procter & Gamble, a consumer products behemoth that has sought a way to improve stagnant sales. Continue reading the main story

Third Point disclosed that it owned about 40 million shares in Nestlé, a stake that amounts to about $3.5 billion in stock. That would make the hedge fund the Swiss company’s sixth-largest shareholder, according to Standard & Poor’s Global Market Intelligence.

Behind Third Point’s investment in Nestlé is a conviction that the company must do more to reshape its product portfolio and adapt to changing consumer tastes and competition from smaller, local brands. The hedge fund argued that the company’s earnings per share figure had not meaningfully improved over the last five years.Shares in Nestlé have risen nearly 15 percent over the last 12 months, trailing those of its fellow consumer conglomerate Unilever but outpacing those of other food companies like Mondelez and Kraft Heinz.


            On the Chocolate Block?        

            Third Point said Nestle should sell off nonessential operations. This is what it does.        




 



“Third Point invested in Nestlé because we recognized a familiar set of conditions that make it ripe for improvement and change,” the hedge fund wrote in its investor letter. “It is rare to find a business of Nestlé’s quality with so many avenues for improvement.”A representative for Nestlé was not available for comment.Third Point said it was encouraged by Nestlé’s announcement this month that it was weighing the sale of its American candy business, which produces stalwart sweets like Butterfingers and Gobstoppers.But the hedge fund argued that Nestlé should also sell its 23 percent stake in L’Oréal, the big cosmetics maker whose products include its namesake beauty brand and luxury products like Kiehl’s. The fund argued that the holding was nonstrategic and could be sold off without incurring huge taxes.In a change from previous investments, in which Mr. Loeb was known for his venomous attacks on the chief executives of the targeted companies, Third Point has praised Nestlé’s leader, Ulf Mark Schneider. The hedge fund pointed positively to his earlier tenure at the German medical supply company Fresenius. But to succeed at Nestlé, the hedge fund argued, he needs to present a bold strategy that would overhaul the food giant’s performance.

Mr. Loeb may not have read Nestle’s news releases over the last few weeks. In May, the company announced that it had teamed up with Amazon to offer a cooking companion with step-by-step recipe instructions, visual aids, skill demonstrations and other content to help consumers prepare meals.The same month, it announced it was retooling its Maggi line to eliminate ingredients consumers do not like and add vegetables, grains and other more nutritional items.

The company also announced this month that it was the lead investor in a $77 million investment in Freshly, a subscription meal service.In addition, the company has worked over the last several years to strip preservatives and other ingredients from its ice creams and decidedly improve its vast frozen foods portfolio.Third Point said it had hired Jan Bennink, a former executive chairman of Sara Lee, to advise the hedge fund on its investment.

Third Point Encourages Nestlé To Sell Off Its Stake In L'Oréal
Jun 26 17
A hedge fund owned by Dan Loeb, Third Point LLC, has built a $3.5 billion stake in Nestlé S.A. (SWX:NESN) and is encouraging Nestlé to sell off its stake in L'Oréal S.A. (ENXTPA:OR), as well as what it deems nonessential operations, including the U.S. confectionery business.


Third Point Urges Nestlé To Seek Acquisition
Jun 26 17
Dan Loeb’s Third Point LLC issued a letter on June 25, 2017 stating that it now owns about 40 million shares in Nestlé S.A. (SWX:NESN) which is in the process of moving its U.S. headquarters to Rosslyn, Va. - and laid out its intentions to set the company on a new course "with a greater sense of urgency." "Nestle has fallen behind over the past decade in an environment where growth has slowed due to changes in consumer tastes and shopping habits, as well as an influx of new competition from smaller, local brands," Third Point wrote in the letter. Third Point said it is "past time" for Nestle to undertake a comprehensive portfolio review of its more than 2,000 brands in food and beverage and health-science fields. It is urging the company to pursue acquisitions in "high growth and advantaged categories."

First Quarter 2017 Investor Letter

 

Review and Outlook 

During the First Quarter of 2017, volatility declined and most markets rose in anticipation of global reflation. Third Point generated returns across credit and equity strategies and most sectors through successful security selection and portfolio repositioning. New investments during the quarter were initiated primarily in the financials, industrials, and energy sectors. We expect the favorable environment for our investing style to continue for three reasons: 1) Corporate activity should pick up as President Trump’s tax plans are detailed and enacted; 2) Opportunities for activist and constructivist investing are robust; and 3) Combining security selection with a reasonable interpretation of the macro continues to be critical. While we recognize that we are in the late stages of an economic cycle, experience has taught us not to miss the end of an expansive period. This is especially true following Trump’s election. Animal spirits matter in markets and despite the obstacles that the new administration will face in passing legislation, the overall pro-business environment is in sharp contrast to the last “you didn’t build it” administration’s attitude towards business, enterprise, and free markets. We have been more focused on improving global growth than on the “Trump trade”. The Goldman Sachs global GDP forecast for 2017 is +4.2% vs. +2% a year ago. We are seeing more opportunities in Europe because of strong and improving economic data, a trend that will likely continue now that the French elections have passed without incident. Although S&P earnings were flat over the past three years, we are expecting earnings growth to drive gains and cyclical names to get a tailwind from US policy shifts this year. 
























 

2 

So what are the risks? While we think legislative failure on tax reform could be negative in the back half of this year, we are encouraged that BAT seems to be off the table. There is a risk of inflation catching the Fed flat-footed, but we see this surfacing later in 2018 or 2019, if at all. Recent dampening of data in the US, particularly in consumer spending, has raised a red flag and we will know more when we see Q1 GDP. Chinese nominal GDP growth has potentially peaked, but the main event there will be the change of government this fall and so we expect a muted status quo until then. We have actively positioned our portfolio to absorb modest S&P sell-offs in order to remain aggressive buyers at appealing prices. For example, we were able to temporarily reduce over 20% of our equity exposure in advance of the French election at a relatively inexpensive cost of about 20 basis points. We continue to maintain the bulk of our exposure in equities, including in several new initiatives where we believe the environment is ripe to take actions to remedy poor performance. 

Quarterly Results

 Set forth below are our results through March 31, 2017: Third Point Offshore Ltd. S&P 500 



 

2017 YTD Performance* 5.9% 6.1% Annualized Return Since Inception** 15.8% 7.8% *Through March 31, 2017. **Return from inception, December 1996 for TP Offshore and S&P 500. 

Equity Investment: Honeywell International Inc. (“Honeywell”) 

Honeywell is an industrial conglomerate with a $100 billion market capitalization organized into four primary business segments: Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions, and Performance Materials and Technologies. The company is a key player in an IoT (Internet of Things) world that is

becoming more automated, connected, and energy efficient. Honeywell recently named Darius Adamczyk to succeed long-time CEO David Cote. We are pleased by Mr. Adamczyk’s appointment based on his track record, initial communications to shareholders, and our personal interactions with him. During Mr. Cote’s tenure, Honeywell shareholders enjoyed an 11.5% annualized return (with dividends reinvested) versus the comparable 7% return of the S&P 500. During this period, Honeywell executed a successful operational turnaround and achieved peer-leading earnings growth and returns on invested capital. Through disciplined capital allocation, such as the recent acquisitions of Elster and Intelligrated, as well the AdvanSix spin off, the portfolio has been gradually upgraded in quality. However, despite the attractive positioning and financial characteristics of Honeywell’s assets today, the stock trades at a substantial discount to its industrial peer group. Mr. Adamczyk has committed to enhancing the company’s organic growth profile and is actively evaluating the portfolio with the assistance of the Board of Directors. Third Point believes that a separation of the Aerospace unit via a spin off transaction would result in a sustained increase in shareholder value in excess of $20 billion. Spinning off Aerospace would transform Honeywell into an industrial growth company with a focus on automation and productivity. The large-cap industrial peer group that most closely resembles Honeywell (ex-Aerospace) in terms of profitability, returns on capital, growth characteristics, and end market exposures consists of Emerson Electric, 3M, Fortive, Rockwell Automation, and Illinois Tool Works. This peer group currently trades at an average forward P/E multiple of 23x, a nearly 30% premium to Honeywell’s forward P/E multiple of 18x. A more focused Honeywell should match or exceed the multiples of its peer group, especially if management delivers on its commitment to return to free cash flow conversion in excess of 100% by 2018. It is clear to us, as well as several sell-side analysts, that Aerospace’s presence in the portfolio is the chief cause of Honeywell’s discounted valuation and that Aerospace would be better off as a stand-alone entity. Its organic growth has lagged its US large-cap
