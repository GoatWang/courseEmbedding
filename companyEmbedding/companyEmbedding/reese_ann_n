For Xerox Director Ann N. Reese, a Disastrous Tenure

The dust has settled after Xerox Corp. (NYSE: XRX) announced another poor quarter. Its share price hovers around a 52-week low. Someone has to be accountable for the catastrophe that has continued to destroy the low-tech company, but who?
Ann N. Reese acts as the lead director of Xerox. In that position, the co-founder of the Center for Adoption Policy has as much a voice in the fate of drowning CEO Ursula M. Burns as any other member of the board. The board knows as well as any other group that Burns has continued to cripple Xerox, as its financial results have deteriorated for years. 


Reese is also the longest-serving director at Xerox, after her appointment in 2003. Burns joined the board in 2007, the year she was appointed president. Burns became CEO in 2009 and chairman in 2010. Reese has had the chance to watch Burns. Reese also has been a party to the approval of Burns’s extravagant compensation, which reached $22.2 million in 2014.
The Xerox proxy defines the job Reese holds:
Our lead independent director’s responsibilities include: presiding at executive sessions of the independent directors; calling special meetings of the independent directors, as needed; addressing individual Board member performance matters, as needed; and serving as liaison on Board-wide issues between the independent directors and the CEO, as needed. Under our Corporate Governance Guidelines, each regularly scheduled Board meeting must include an executive session of all directors and the CEO and a separate executive session attended only by the independent directors.
This means Reese supervises meetings during which the performance of Burns is examined. That examination, to the extent it has gone on, has not helped shareholders at all.

In an analysis of Burns’s recent performance and her comments about the results of the most recently reported quarter, 24/7 Wall St. recently wrote:
Burns was upbeat in comments about the most recent period, as she usually is, no matter what the numbers:
Our earnings are in-line with the guidance we provided. Results in Document Technology, which included the increased impact from foreign currency, largely met our expectations. Several of our Services businesses performed well, but overall Services segment results fell short of our expectations driven by higher implementation costs in certain Health Enterprise platform accounts.
Hitting guidance is not a badge of honor. This is especially true when revenue drops and net profits collapse. Xerox’s revenue dropped 6% in the March quarter to $4.5 billion. Net income fell 20% to $225 million. Operating margins were 7.6%, which Xerox management says was off 1.1 percentage points from the same quarter a year ago.
As for its forecast:
We expect increased currency headwinds, softer signings and acquisition timing to impact revenue; and Services margin to be impacted by increased implementation costs in legacy Health Enterprise accounts. As a result, we are adjusting our full year expectations.
Burns became Xerox’s CEO well over five years ago. She engineered the buyout of Affiliated Computer Services, which cost Xerox $6.4 billion. Meant to help Xerox move beyond its roots in document production, it is hard to find evidence that the strategy worked. In the past five years, Xerox shares have risen 10% while the S&P 500 has moved higher by over 78%.
It is time for Reese to claim some measure of responsibility, and credibility, and to press for Burns to leave.
Note: Reese also sits on the board of retail failure Sears Holdings Corp. (NASDAQ: SHLD).

She also co-wrote and testified in favor of Louisiana’s Daubert statute, which governs the admissibility of expert opinions.

Is a negotiator and has a demonstrated record of resolving many disputes soon after litigation begins.In the legal community, Leigh Ann served in various roles with the International Association of Defense Counsel (IADC) for many years. Within the IADC, she served as social media chair of the Civil Justice Response Committee and as chairman and vice chairman of the Legislative, Judicial, and Governmental Affairs Committee.

Abraham Reese (Reece) was my 5X great grandfather. He lived in the area of Deep Creek in North Carolina. His daughter Mary married David Walker. Their son John Thornton Walker moved from NC to Indiana, where his daughter, Martha Jane Walker met and married George Washington Dean.  They moved to Morristown, Minnesota.  Their daughter Martha "Mattie" Dean married a recent Norwegian immigrant by the name of Louis (Ludvik) Larson.  Their son William Oliver Larson was my much-loved maternal grandfather. 




                Comment by Patricia A  Zorman on June 30, 2016 at 10:11am            

I am from the Reece family from Indiana. I believe they came from North Carolina on the way to Iowa, some of the family moved to Indiana. Around Hancock County. They were Quakers. My direct Reece is my Grandmother Margaret G. Reece. Her father was Elwood. Her grandfather was Elanka Reece. Before that was Jesse, Eli, Solomon, Abraham Reese. 




                Comment by Kari Lemons on September 17, 2015 at 10:10am            

I have 2 Reece/Reese women in my tree believed to be sisters who married Lemmons brothers.  They were married in 1830's in Rhea County TN.
Amy Reece b1810 married William Lemmons b1798
Sarah Reece b1815 married John Lemmons b1802
I am trying to find out who their parents were and how they might have connected to other TN Reece families.
In the Rhea tax records there are listed the following men:
1825 Roger Reece, Henry Reece
1833 Roger Reece, Jesse Reese, Jesse Reese Jr, William Reese
Does anyone have info about the Reece/Reese family in Rhea county TN??  




                Comment by Patricia A  Zorman on September 17, 2015 at 8:44am            

Yes, I have the same problem. There are some word of mouth, stories and 1 marriage certificate for Solomon Reece and a book segment, about the marriage of Sarah Boone and Solomon Reece. 




                Comment by John D Reece on July 29, 2013 at 4:04pm            

Hi all,
I just started looking into my family tree.  I was surprised how far back I could get before I hit a wall.  It seems my 3G grandfather was Abraham Reece from North Carolina.  There seems to be a lot of mystery as to who his parents were and thus that's as far back as I can go.  If anyone has any information that would help I'd love to hear it.
Thanks
John Reece 




                Comment by Brittney Layne Reeves on June 12, 2012 at 10:55am            

Hi everyone! I found this page while researching my Reese family. My great-grandfather was John Earnest Reese, son of Thomas and Jennie Reese, born in 1914. He was adopted by Willie Wellons Ferrell and Alsie Florence Kinton from Mecklenburg, VA. My grandmother has been trying to find her fathers biological family for years now. John received a letter from a man named Charles claiming to be his brother but that letter has long been lost. None of John's adoptive brothers and sisters have any information other than his adoption papers. If anyone has any information, I'd love to make my grandmothers dreams come true. Johns adopted mother, Alsie Kinton had an aunt Mary Ann Kinton that married a B. F. Reese. According to their marriage certificate found on FamilySearch.com, his name was Benjamin F. Reese from Petersburg VA born 1857 and married in Lunenburg to Mary Ann Kinton when he was 46. They had no children but I'm guessing he may have been married previously and had children. Mecklenburg (where John was adopted) is the next county over from Lunenburg. I'm thinking John was really Alsie's cousin's child. I'm hoping that I can find a connection. I'm trying to talk my Grandmother's nephew into doing the DNa test but I don't know how successful that will be. Thank you so much in advance.

I just posted to my page, but am not sure how to let everyone see it, a photo album on the Reeseville, Pennsylvania Veteran's Memorial.  Reeseville is in Etna, Shaler Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. 




                Comment by C.C. Williams on September 26, 2011 at 11:34am            

Hi.  I am new here and I am interested finding REECE connections.  I have very little to go on and have been hitting brick walls for many years.  My great grandfather was GEORGE W. REECE, born April 1, 1863 or 1864 in Western NC or even possibly East TN.  He died in April 1951 in Morganton, Burke County, NC.   He was married to my great-grandmother CELIA CHURCH and they lived in Wilkes County and Ashe County, NC,  They are both buried near Lenoir, NC in Collettsville.   I have never been able to find George before the 1900 census  (In 1900, they live in Jobs Cabin District of Ashe County).  I have no siblings or parents for George...hoping to find a breakthrough.   I appreciate any info!  Thanks. 




                Comment by Lee Reese on July 22, 2011 at 11:33am            

DL,
My greatgrandfather Clementine hendrix (Ned) Reese worked in the oil industry
in hidalgo county Texas. 




                Comment by Sally Nelson on July 22, 2011 at 8:05am            

DL and others.  Here is a kinship report for my Benjamin Franklin Reese.  I have not verified all of these relationships but am working towards it.  I hope this will be of help to someone.  The location is basically Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, USA.

Reese, Jane Jennie Louise b. 16 May 1863                                 Sister
Reese, Francis Mary  b. 29 Aug 1877                                         Sister

Again, please treat these as clues not as fact.  Much of this information was taken from my grandmother's memories and notes and I am still trying to verify everything.

Shipping Information
We use UPS for most of our shipments. We want you to get your products as fast as possible and in excellent condition. That is why we normally use UPS - the leader in the package delivery business to get you your order as soon as possible. 98% of our orders get to our customers within 4 - 5 business days. Remember, none of the major package delivery carriers (UPS included) deliver on the weekends.
Depending on the size of your package and its destination, we may at our discretion ship your order via another carrier.
We do have a few restrictions on our shipping. We cannot ship to Puerto Rico, P.O. Boxes or to APO/FPO addresses. We can ship to Hawaii - 2nd Day UPS Air. We currently do not ship to Mexico, Canada or anywhere outside North America. We reserve the right to add shipping expense onto orders that are special case orders - this is very rare, but we needed to state it here and we would advise you of these charges at the time of your order. If you have any questions about our shipping policies - please do not hesitate to call us.
Special free freight offers are available and are valid on most orders.  Some oversized items and truck shipments may have additional charges applied.  Again, we will advise you at the time of your order of any exceptions.
All truck freight shipments must be shipped to a commercial business address.  Truck shipments to residential addresses will have additional service charges applied.
Refused shipments that we have not been notified of in advance will be charged for outbound and return freight charges and may require additional handling charges of up to 15%.

Unlike some other e-commerce sites, we are not just marketers of other company's products who take your order and then drop ship those products to you. We stock everything we sell on this website. That means faster service, better order fill and tighter quality control.
Choosing the right trailer hitch can be a real challenge and having someone to guide you through that process can be a great help. The professional customer service team here at ReeseHitches.com is here to help. Give us a call or drop us an email and we'll be happy to put our years of experience and hands-on product knowledge to work for you. 
Thanks for stopping by. If you don't find what you're looking for please let us know. We have access to thousands of hard-to-find parts available from leading manufacturers throughout the world. Our friendly and courteous staff will be happy to help you find whatever you need.
We are an independent authorized dealer for Reese products, not affiliated with Horizon Global Corp.

Shipping Information
We use UPS for most of our shipments. We want you to get your products as fast as possible and in excellent condition. That is why we normally use UPS - the leader in the package delivery business to get you your order as soon as possible. 98% of our orders get to our customers within 4 - 5 business days. Remember, none of the major package delivery carriers (UPS included) deliver on the weekends.
Depending on the size of your package and its destination, we may at our discretion ship your order via another carrier.
We do have a few restrictions on our shipping. We cannot ship to Puerto Rico, P.O. Boxes or to APO/FPO addresses. We can ship to Hawaii - 2nd Day UPS Air. We currently do not ship to Mexico, Canada or anywhere outside North America. We reserve the right to add shipping expense onto orders that are special case orders - this is very rare, but we needed to state it here and we would advise you of these charges at the time of your order. If you have any questions about our shipping policies - please do not hesitate to call us.
Special free freight offers are available and are valid on most orders.  Some oversized items and truck shipments may have additional charges applied.  Again, we will advise you at the time of your order of any exceptions.
All truck freight shipments must be shipped to a commercial business address.  Truck shipments to residential addresses will have additional service charges applied.
Refused shipments that we have not been notified of in advance will be charged for outbound and return freight charges and may require additional handling charges of up to 15%.
