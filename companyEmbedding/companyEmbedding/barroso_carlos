Campbell Appoints Carlos Barroso Senior Vice President, Global Research & Development


Share on Facebook 



 



    CAMDEN, N.J.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Jul. 1, 2013–
Campbell Soup Company (NYSE:CPB) today appointed Carlos
      Barroso Senior Vice President, Global Research & Development (R&D),
      reporting to Campbell’s President and Chief Executive Officer Denise
      Morrison. Barroso’s appointment is effective July 31, 2013.
    

      “Research & Development is an essential ingredient in our recipe for
      delivering the meaningful, consumer-focused innovation needed to change
      our company’s growth trajectory,” said Morrison. “Carlos brings
      extensive R&D food and consumer packaged goods expertise to Campbell at
      a very important time. His knowledge of emerging markets and open
      innovation, coupled with his experience in baked snacks and flavor
      science, makes him an excellent fit for our organization.”
    

      Barroso, 54, joins Campbell with more than 20 years of experience as an
      R&D professional. Most recently, he ran his own R&D consulting practice,
      where he worked with many Fortune 100 clients.
    

      Previously, Barroso was Senior Vice President of R&D at PepsiCo, where
      he oversaw all R&D for PepsiCo Foods, including Frito-Lay North America
      and Quaker Foods and Snacks, a $27 billion business with more than 800
      R&D employees. Prior to that, he held several roles of increasing
      responsibility within the PepsiCo Foods R&D organization in the United
      States and internationally. Barroso began his career at Procter & Gamble.
    

      “I’m looking forward to joining Campbell and partnering with our
      business leaders, R&D associates and outside partners to accelerate
      innovation worldwide,” said Barroso. “Campbell is aggressively
      reinvigorating its innovation pipeline and reshaping its portfolio, and
      the R&D team must be a critical partner to help drive that growth
      agenda.”
    

      Barroso will be a member of Campbell’s corporate leadership team.
    

      Barroso earned his bachelor of science degree in Chemical Engineering
      from the Georgia Institute of Technology, where he currently serves as
      Chair of the External Advisory Board for the School of Chemical and
      Biomolecular Engineering. His significant expertise in flavor science

Specialties & ExpertiseDr. Carlos Barroso has the following 1 area of expertise and  1 specialty.                     General Practice
    A general practitioner is similar to a family practitioner in that they treat patients of all ages with a variety of health concerns. These doctors treat everyday ailments, some acute and chronic diseases, and also provid health checkups, physicals, inoculations and preventative care.


    General practitioners differ from family practitioners because they are not required to complete an additional residency in family medicine after completing their medical school residency. Like family practitioners, general practitioners will also provide referrals to patients who are in need of a specialist.
