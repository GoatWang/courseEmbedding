The final race of the 148th Belmont Stakes is right around the corner, and we’ve gathered all the pertinent info about the Mount Everest of horse races. Here are 5 things you need to know about the huge equine event!
Are you ready for the third and most important Belmont Stakes event? The race of the year is happening tomorrow, June 11, which means there’s still plenty of time for you to learn all about it. Read on to find out about the race details, including the entertainment lineup, how to watch it, which horses are competing and more!

[hl_amazon_single url=”https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DYJJU5E/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01DYJJU5E&linkCode=as2&tag=hollywoocom-20&linkId=d4be62e0b4a9b05e47d27e99ab5fe4ab&#8221; header=”Shop Belmont Merch!” title=”148th Belmont Stakes Glass”]







1. Tomorrow’s race is the final jewel in Thoroughbred horse racing’s American Triple Crown series.
The 148th running of the Belmont Stakes is 1 1⁄2-mile (2,400 m) long, and is sometimes referred to as “The Test of the Champion” or “The Run for the Carnations”. It’s held annually at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York, and is one of the top attended racing events.
2. You can watch it live on TV!
The race will be broadcast by NBC beginning at 5:00 PM EDT, and you can check out pre-race coverage on NBCSN starting at 3:00 PM. Be sure to head to HollywoodLife.com to watch via livestream!
3. There’s no Triple Crown at stake this year.
Derby winner Nyquist lost in the Preakness due to illness — so sad! That means that no one horse will have won the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes this year.
4. Rock band Daughtry will perform after the race.
Fortunately for people who aren’t too interested in the race but like to attend for the festivities, they’ll get to enjoy a performance by Daughtry! Attendees will also get to see a trackside performance from the popular Broadway musical BEAUTIFUL on Belmont Stakes Day.
5. 13 horses are competing in the race, with Exaggerator standing out as the favorite.
Governor Malibu, Destin, Cherry Wine, Suddenbreakingnews, Stradivari, Gettysburg, Seeking the Soul, Forever d’Oro, Trojan Nation, Lani, Exaggerator, Brody’s Cause and Creator have been preparing their whole horsey lives for tomorrow’s race!
Be sure to come to HollywoodLife.com tomorrow for full coverage of the Belmont Stakes!

 Stream music, completely unlimited and ad-free, RIGHT HERE
HollywoodLifers, will you be tuning into the race tomorrow? What are you most excited for?
