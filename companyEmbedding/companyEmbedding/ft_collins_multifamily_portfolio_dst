Inland Private Capital Corporation Completes Its Largest DST Offering 
      with a Multifamily Portfolio in Colorado




Portfolio Includes Three Class A Multifamily Apartment Communities in 
      the Denver Area






August 05, 2015 12:00 PM Eastern Daylight Time



OAK BROOK, Ill.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Inland Private Capital Corporation (“IPCC”) today announced that the 
      private investment offering of the Colorado Multifamily Portfolio DST 
      (the “Colorado DST”), an IPCC-sponsored Delaware statutory trust, has 
      been fully subscribed by investors. The Colorado DST raised over $90 
      million in capital, and is the largest offering sponsored by IPCC to 
      date.
    


      The Colorado DST owns a portfolio of three Class A apartment communities 
      featuring unique floor plans, premium amenities and located in upscale 
      suburban communities: The Greens at Van de Water in Loveland, Colorado; 
      Lake Vista at Centerra Apartments in Loveland, Colorado; and Arbour 
      Square at Orchard Town Center in Westminster, Colorado.
    

      “Bringing larger, more diversified DST offerings to market has been a 
      strategic focus of IPCC,” said Keith Lampi, president and chief 
      operating officer of IPCC. “These larger scale offerings generally allow 
      for greater diversification and typically have a longer duration, 
      providing independent broker dealers broader access to a quality 
      solution for their investor base.”
    

      “IPCC’s Colorado DST offering marks the largest securitized 1031 
      offering in our industry’s history,” said Taylor Garrett, managing 
      director of Mountain Dell Consulting, a leading market research and 
      analytics firm focused on the securitized 1031 exchange marketplace.
    

The Greens at Van de Water, Loveland


      Located at 2900 Mountain Lion Drive, The Greens at Van de Water is a 
      252-unit multifamily complex. Built in 2012, the property is comprised 
      of 10 buildings, consisting of nine three-story apartment buildings and 
      one single-story clubhouse. The clubhouse features premium amenities 
      including a theater room, cyber café, fitness center, barbeque area and 
      resort-style pool and spa. Each apartment unit includes nine-foot 
      ceilings, full-sized washers and dryers and a gourmet kitchen.
    

Lake Vista at Centerra Apartments, Loveland


      Constructed in 2011 and located at 2235 Rocky Mountain Avenue, Lake 
      Vista at Centerra Apartments is a 303-unit multifamily property. The 
      complex is comprised of 17 three-story apartment buildings, one 
      single-story clubhouse, four garage buildings, one pool equipment 
      building and one garden shed. The clubhouse includes a theater room, 
      fitness center, cyber café, commercial kitchen and resort-style pool and 
      spa. The residential units feature premium amenities including nine-foot 
      ceilings, patio and balcony decks with lake views, a gourmet kitchen and 
      full-sized washers and dryers.
    

Arbour Square at Orchard Town Center, 
      Westminster


      Arbour Square at Orchard Town Center is a 300-unit apartment community 
      located at 14770 Orchard Parkway. The property was built in 2011 and is

      courtyard building. The property’s upscale amenities include a 
      resort-style pool and spa, zen garden, golf simulator, theater room, 
      cyber café, fitness room and a Sky Lounge with a terrace. Each apartment 
      unit includes nine-foot ceilings, full-sized washers and dryers and a 
      gourmet kitchen.
    

      “The multifamily sector is experiencing significant demand driven by the 
      changing demographics of millennials,” continued Lampi. “We were 
      thrilled to offer such high quality real estate in the expanding Denver 
      and Fort Collins areas, where job and income growth is expected to 
      exceed regional and national averages.”
    

      The Colorado properties are managed by Inland Residential Real Estate 
      Services, LLC (“Inland Residential”), an affiliate of IPCC. Inland 
      Residential currently manages 23 multifamily properties, with more than

      aggregate value of approximately $1 billion. Inland Residential’s total

Inland Private Capital Completes Its Largest DST Offering with a Multifamily Portfolio in ColoradoAugust 6, 2015



OAK BROOK, IL - Inland Private Capital Corporation announced that the private investment offering of the Colorado Multifamily Portfolio DST, an IPCC-sponsored Delaware statutory trust, has been fully subscribed by investors. The Colorado DST raised over $90 million in capital, and is the largest offering sponsored by IPCC to date.
The Colorado DST owns a portfolio of three Class A apartment communities featuring unique floor plans, premium amenities and located in upscale suburban communities: The Greens at Van de Water in Loveland, Colorado; Lake Vista at Centerra Apartments in Loveland, Colorado; and Arbour Square at Orchard Town Center in Westminster, Colorado.
“Bringing larger, more diversified DST offerings to market has been a strategic focus of IPCC,” said Keith Lampi, president and chief operating officer of IPCC. “These larger scale offerings generally allow for greater diversification and typically have a longer duration, providing independent broker dealers broader access to a quality solution for their investor base.”
“IPCC’s Colorado DST offering marks the largest securitized 1031 offering in our industry’s history,” said Taylor Garrett, managing director of Mountain Dell Consulting, a leading market research and analytics firm focused on the securitized 1031 exchange marketplace.
The Greens at Van de Water, Loveland
Located at 2900 Mountain Lion Drive, The Greens at Van de Water is a 252-unit multifamily complex. Built in 2012, the property is comprised of 10 buildings, consisting of nine three-story apartment buildings and one single-story clubhouse. The clubhouse features premium amenities including a theater room, cyber café, fitness center, barbeque area and resort-style pool and spa. Each apartment unit includes nine-foot ceilings, full-sized washers and dryers and a gourmet kitchen.
Lake Vista at Centerra Apartments, Loveland
Constructed in 2011 and located at 2235 Rocky Mountain Avenue, Lake Vista at Centerra Apartments is a 303-unit multifamily property. The complex is comprised of 17 three-story apartment buildings, one single-story clubhouse, four garage buildings, one pool equipment building and one garden shed. The clubhouse includes a theater room, fitness center, cyber café, commercial kitchen and resort-style pool and spa. The residential units feature premium amenities including nine-foot ceilings, patio and balcony decks with lake views, a gourmet kitchen and full-sized washers and dryers.
Arbour Square at Orchard Town Center, Westminster
Arbour Square at Orchard Town Center is a 300-unit apartment community located at 14770 Orchard Parkway. The property was built in 2011 and is comprised of seven three-story residential buildings and one four-story courtyard building. The property’s upscale amenities include a resort-style pool and spa, zen garden, golf simulator, theater room, cyber café, fitness room and a Sky Lounge with a terrace. Each apartment unit includes nine-foot ceilings, full-sized washers and dryers and a gourmet kitchen.
“The multifamily sector is experiencing significant demand driven by the changing demographics of millennials,” continued Lampi. “We were thrilled to offer such high quality real estate in the expanding Denver and Fort Collins areas, where job and income growth is expected to exceed regional and national averages.”
The Colorado properties are managed by Inland Residential Real Estate Services, an affiliate of IPCC. Inland Residential currently manages 23 multifamily properties, with more than 5,500 apartment units, in seven states on behalf of IPCC, with a total aggregate value of approximately $1 billion. Inland Residential’s total portfolio under management includes 29 multifamily properties, with approximately 6,446 apartment units, in nine states.
