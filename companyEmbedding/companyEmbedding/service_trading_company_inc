Announcement




European Natural Food & Trading Co, Inc. of Paterson, NJ is recalling Brian's Cauliflower 83 oz.  due to undeclared sulfites. People who have an allergy or severe sensitivity to sulfites run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reaction if they consume these products. Brian's Cauliflower 83 oz. was distributed in NY, MA, CT and NJ where it reached consumers through retail stores. The product is pickled cauliflower and was sold in large clear, glass jars with the brand name Brian's and UPC 858567002421. The expiration date is 28/11/2016. The product was shipped during 2013 and 2014. No illnesses have been reported to date. The recall was initiated after it was discovered by NYSDAM Laboratory sampling and analysis that product containing sulfites were distributed in packaging that did not reveal the presence of sulfites. Subsequent investigation indicates the problem was caused by temporary breakdown in the company's production and packaging processes. Consumers who have purchased Brian's Cauliflower 83 oz. are urged to return it to the place of purchase for a full refund. Consumers with questions may contact the company at (973) 553-1896, Monday - Friday from 9am - 5pm (Eastern Time Zone).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

American Trading International, Inc. (ATI) is a service-oriented export trading company providing domestic and international companies the opportunity to import and export products to new and existing markets.
With a philosophy deeply rooted in extensive market knowledge and personal relationships, the objectives of all the business entities involved are always carefully evaluated in order to execute flawless and profitable transactions. Through comprehensive business relationships worldwide, varying from shipping logistics to U.S. government backed trade finance, ATI has developed unparalleled networking capabilities for profitable international business. These established associations are invaluable assets for the promotion of trade and international business.
Established in 1995 and based in California, the country’s largest agricultural producer and exporter with more than $18 billion in exports, ATI operates as an intermediary between North American manufacturers and their international counterparts to better satisfy the needs and interests of both. With an international staff composed of professionals with diverse cultural and educational backgrounds, ATI can minimize the impact of cultural differences while maximizing trade potential for all parties involved.







“American Trading International, Inc. is dedicated to the philosophy of facilitating trade between potential business venues through international awareness and sensitivity.”


Western businesses may be extremely interested in the prospect of doing business internationally, but are unclear about the practices, opportunities, necessary documentation and vital overseas market characteristics. Likewise, overseas buyers may have a great interest in American products, but may not know how to best search the market for products, or speak the language proficiently. Both aspects are essential for negotiating the best prices or effectively customizing products and documentation to meet local import/export laws. ATI’s knowledge and philosophy help promote the right enterprising environment for export-ready manufacturers and their import-ready counterparts.

ATI has the capabilities and knowledge to handle a variety of often potentially risky transactions, in the international trade environment. With such an interest and demand for American goods and products, ATI’s knowledge of cultures and business practices, combined with excellent connections, market research, and a developed image, will provide your business with rewarding opportunities.

Awards & Recognition
 
Seth Merrick Wilen Named to Agricultural Trade Advisory Committee
WASHINGTON D.C., January 15, 2017 – Mr. Seth Merrick Wilen, President & CEO of American Trading International, Inc. was appointed by U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Thomas J. Vilsack and United States Trade Representative Ambassador Michael Froman to serve on the private-sector trade advisory committee for U.S. foods and beverages.
Congress established the advisory committee system to ensure a private-sector voice in establishing U.S. agricultural trade policy objectives to reflect U.S. commercial and economic interests.  This committee is to ensure that U.S. trade policy and trade negotiation priorities adequately reflect U.S. public and private sector interests.  Mr. Wilen accepts this 4-year appointment with honor and enthusiasm joining the committee alongside some of the largest and most influential food & beverage companies in the U.S.

The President’s E-Award

At the World Trade Week ceremonies at the White House in Washington D.C., American Trading International, Inc. was awarded with the Presidential “E” Award for Exports. This prestigious award is the highest recognition any U.S. entity may receive for making a significant contribution to the expansion of U.S. exports and was handed down by U.S. Commerce Secretary John Bryson personally. 
“I am pleased to recognize American Trading International for receiving the President’s “E” Award, which honors companies that make significant contributions toward increasing U.S. exports,” said Secretary Bryson. “This Administration is committed to leveling the playing field for American businesses and workers to help U.S. companies build things here and sell them around the world. “E” Awards winners like American Trading International have excelled in this effort, demonstrating years of successive export growth. It is companies like this that are helping to grow our economy and put more Americans back to work.”

“Exporting continues to be the foundation of our sales growth, and we are honored to receive the “E” Award,” said Seth Merrick Wilen, ATI’s President and CEO. “Our first export of American foods & beverages was in 1995 and we are proud to still be a 100% export company.”
 Through close relationships with the U.S. Department of Commerce, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and U.S. Export/Import Bank, ATI has continually exhibited U.S. products at the largest Food & Beverage trade shows around the globe. ATI has been successful in both developing markets abroad for new products, and developing previously limited international markets for the exportation of U.S. products. This strength has allowed for sustained growth in sales and a broadening global reach. 
U.S. companies are nominated for the “E” Awards for their significant contribution to U.S. export expansion that is measurable, innovative, sustainable, and has broad impact. All nominations are reviewed by the “E” Award Committee, which is chaired by the Department of Commerce, and includes representatives of Ex-Im Bank, the Small Business Administration, and the Departments of Agriculture, Labor, State, and Transportation. 
This year marks 50th anniversary of the first presentation of the President’s “E” Award by President John F. Kennedy. The President’s “E” Award was created by Executive Order in 1961 to encourage U.S. companies to sell their products abroad. A second award, the President’s “E Star” Award, was authorized by the Secretary of Commerce in 1969 to recognize “E” Award recipients for their continuing significant contributions to U.S. export expansion.

U.S. Department of Commerce Export Achievement Awards 

In accordance with U.S. President Barack Obama’s ambitious export initiative, several key individuals in the international business community were recently selected to discuss important issues in the global market and to exchange ideas regarding future export objectives.  Mr. Seth Wilen, President of American Trading International, Inc. (ATI), was invited to participate in the National Export Initiative Roundtable and Reception, where he spoke on topics related to his expertise in the export industry.  Recognized for recent accomplishments in the global marketplace, Mr. Wilen proudly accepted the U.S. Department of Commerce Export Achievement Certificate on behalf of ATI and was honored for his direct influence on export expansion.

Attendees to this event were able to hear from and network with subject-matter experts on how to effectively export their products to China, Japan and South Korea.

Mr. Wilen spoke not only about the opportunities that are available for manufacturers looking to expand their operations to the region, but also the challenges that come with the differing laws and regulations overseas gained from experience exporting to more than 80 markets worldwide.

As the most globally-connected state and the number one food and agricultural producer in the United States, California has served as an excellent base of operations for ATI during its 20 years of operation.

ATI has a large and growing customer base in the Asia-Pacific region, including customers in American Samoa, Aruba, Australia, China, Guam, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Macau, Malaysia, Mongolia, Nepal, New Zealand, Pakistan, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Tahiti / French Polynesia, Taiwan, Thailand, Tonga, and Vietnam.

For Buyers

Name Brand Products


Many famous North American Name Brand items are available for export. When they are, our good relationships with our manufactures and our extremely competitive shipping rates make us your ideal US choice for exports. 



Generic Products


When the top name brand is not available, or is too high priced, we offer a wide variety of other brand names. The quality and packaging are just as good, but at a more competitive price. Generics include national brands as well as manufacturer’s house labels. 



Private Label


Many companies prefer to have their own name on items they import. This is possible through our Private Label program. If you already have your own name and label designed, we can find the right price and quality to match your market demands. Our Marketing and Design Departments can also help you refine your label once you have identified the product you want. 



Raw Ingredients


Are you a manufacturer/processor who wants a competitive edge? We supply many items for further processing including: bulk pulses and seeds; soft drink and juice concentrates, crude edible oils and even ice cream powders. All raw food & beverage ingredients for your processing or manufacturing needs.




Consolidation


We can offer our U.S. and foreign clients consolidation services, relieving the pressure of ordering full container loads of a single product at once.





For Suppliers

Risk of International Business


We will handle everything from transportation and insurance logistics to foreign currency payments. We absorb the risk of doing international business because we become your local customer rather than you having to deal with an unknown and potentially risky overseas entity. 



Financing


We are always able to offer our overseas buyers the most creative and desirable financing options available, many of which are not available from manufacturers or other trading company directly. Terms such as 30, 60, and even 90 days can be made available to foreign buyers often without any prior business history. 



Skilled Negotiators


With a multi-lingual staff familiar with different cultural behaviors and business negotiation styles, your company and/or products are never accidentally misrepresented. 



Lower Shipping Rates


Many times we can offer lower shipping rates as we work with shipping lines and trucking companies directly. New customers can take full advantage of our pre-existing contract rates already set up for shipping routes in certain countries. 



Consolidation


We can offer our U.S. and foreign clients consolidation services, relieving the pressure of ordering full container loads of a single product at once.
