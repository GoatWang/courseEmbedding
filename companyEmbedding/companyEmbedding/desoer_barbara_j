Barbara J. Desoer

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Barbara J. Desoer is CEO for Citibank, N.A. beginning April 1, 2014, and was the COO for Citibank, N.A. from October 2013 to April 1, 2014. She was president of Bank of America Home Loans, a leading U.S. mortgage originator and servicer. She was a member of the senior management team of Bank of America Corporation, having previously reporting to CEO Brian Moynihan. Desoer led a business accounting for about 20 percent of the U.S. mortgage origination market, with a $2 trillion servicing portfolio serving nearly 14 million customers—nearly one in five mortgages in the U.S. She also managed Bank of America's home equity business and oversaw a leading insurance service organization.
Desoer assumed her role in mid-2008 when she was asked to lead the integration of Countrywide Financial Corporation, which Bank of America acquired July 1, 2008. She led the April 2009 launch of the Bank of America Home Loans brand.
Prior to her mortgage role, Desoer served as chief technology and operations officer, managing the bank's global technology platforms and operations capabilities. She joined Bank of America in 1977 and has held leadership rols in commercial lending, consumer products, retail banking and marketing.
In 2008, Desoer was recognized by US Banker, ranking second in their annual ranking of "25 Most Powerful Women in Banking." She was also recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the "50 Most Powerful Women in Business" and ranked third on The Wall Street Journal's "50 women to watch" list.[1] In 2007, she was named "Business Leader of the Year" by the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. In 2009, Forbes named her one of the 100 most powerful women in the world.[2]
She received her B.A. in mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1974 and her MBA from the University of California, Berkeley.
A New York Times article reported that Desoer announced her retirement in February 2012. Bank of America stated that due to restructuring her position would not be filled and her unit would report to David Darnell who oversees the consumer banking branch of the company.[3]

Aiming High: Barbara J. Desoer





				June 6, 2016 			

Published by NACD Editors

Barbara J. Desoer
Since 2001, the prominent civil rights organization Legal Momentum has honored the most successful and influential people who advance women in the business community with its Aiming High Award. Barbara J. Desoer, CEO of Citibank, N.A. (CBNA), is one of the five people being honored this year. The 16th annual Legal Momentum Aiming High Award honorees will be celebrated at a luncheon on June 7 in New York City. In addition to Desoer, this year’s award recipients are:

Lynn R. Charytan, executive vice president and general counsel, Comcast Cable, senior vice president and senior deputy general counsel Comcast Corp.
J. Michael Cook, retired chair and CEO, Deloitte
Barbara J. Desoer, CEO, Citibank, N.A.
Natasha Lamb, partner, Arjuna Capital
Tracey T. Travis, executive vice president and CFO, The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

After a 35-year career at Bank of America, Desoer joined CBNA as chief operating officer in 2013, and in April 2014 was named CBNA CEO and to its board of directors. Citibank, N.A. accounts for approximately 75 percent of Citigroup’s total assets, and it is the primary entity within which Citigroup engages in activities through branches and subsidiaries in 95 countries and territories including the United States.
In addition to other executive roles, Desoer is co-head of Citigroup’s global women’s initiative called Citi Women. Recognizing that women make up more than half of Citigroup’s workforce, Citi Women is a company-wide effort to improve the development, advancement, and retention of women at all levels of banking. Diversity programs are a hallmark of Citi’s cultural experience that has fostered employee advancement throughout the 95 countries and territories in which Citi provides commercial, retail, and private banking products and services. Aside from her board service at Citigroup, Desoer is a director on the board of DaVita HealthCare Partners and is on the board of visitors at the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned an MBA in finance from the Haas School of Business. She also holds a BA in mathematics from Mount Holyoke College.
NACD Directorship magazine asked Desoer to identify and address how personal champions and mentors have helped advance her own career. An edited transcript of this Q&A follows.
How have mentors helped you in your career?A mentor of mine is Tom Clausen, former CEO of Bank of America and president of the World Bank, with whom I worked closely while at Bank of America. He was a critical advisor to me at several points in my career—asking me probing questions that enabled me to consider different perspectives that I might otherwise have been blind to. He did not give me any answers —he helped guide and inform my thought process, which was invaluable and allowed me to accelerate my development and growth.
Who have been your greatest champions? My greatest champion is Liam McGee. While at Bank of America together, Liam threw me into countless situations that proved to be some of the most challenging and valuable opportunities that I’ve experienced. Liam had the uncanny ability to be right there when I needed him most while also knowing when to give me rope to go at it alone. It’s an approach I try to emulate with my team today. Both Tom and Liam have passed, and I miss their guidance and friendship. But their support and the lessons I learned from them resonate today and I am a better leader as a result.
Some CEOs have held town meetings with employees, while others strive to have their management and board teams set the cultural tone. Is there any approach or method to create a culture of inclusion that you would suggest based on your considerable experience? For me, it’s spending time with members of the Citi team in whatever venue I can. I get energy from my teammates, and it is an important feedback loop that can help to determine what is working and what needs to be rethought. I recently returned from two full days of meetings in Zurich with various team members, listening to their concerns, thoughts and ideas, while reinforcing the strategic context for what they are doing. Even the best and brightest need support. One should not underestimate the value of face-to-face meetings and providing well-timed context and perspective to any given body of work or initiative.
Since 2012, NACD Directorship magazine has served as the media partner for the Aiming High awards.

Barbara J. Desoer

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

Barbara J. Desoer is CEO for Citibank, N.A. beginning April 1, 2014, and was the COO for Citibank, N.A. from October 2013 to April 1, 2014. She was president of Bank of America Home Loans, a leading U.S. mortgage originator and servicer. She was a member of the senior management team of Bank of America Corporation, having previously reporting to CEO Brian Moynihan. Desoer led a business accounting for about 20 percent of the U.S. mortgage origination market, with a $2 trillion servicing portfolio serving nearly 14 million customers—nearly one in five mortgages in the U.S. She also managed Bank of America's home equity business and oversaw a leading insurance service organization.
Desoer assumed her role in mid-2008 when she was asked to lead the integration of Countrywide Financial Corporation, which Bank of America acquired July 1, 2008. She led the April 2009 launch of the Bank of America Home Loans brand.
Prior to her mortgage role, Desoer served as chief technology and operations officer, managing the bank's global technology platforms and operations capabilities. She joined Bank of America in 1977 and has held leadership rols in commercial lending, consumer products, retail banking and marketing.
In 2008, Desoer was recognized by US Banker, ranking second in their annual ranking of "25 Most Powerful Women in Banking." She was also recognized by Fortune magazine as one of the "50 Most Powerful Women in Business" and ranked third on The Wall Street Journal's "50 women to watch" list.[1] In 2007, she was named "Business Leader of the Year" by the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. In 2009, Forbes named her one of the 100 most powerful women in the world.[2]
She received her B.A. in mathematics from Mount Holyoke College in 1974 and her MBA from the University of California, Berkeley.
A New York Times article reported that Desoer announced her retirement in February 2012. Bank of America stated that due to restructuring her position would not be filled and her unit would report to David Darnell who oversees the consumer banking branch of the company.[3]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
