George's Inc. Announce Carl George and Charles George as co-CEOs and Presidents

SPRINGDALE, Ark. – George’s Inc., one of the nation’s largest privately held poultry companies, announced Carl George and Charles George as co-CEOs/Presidents effective April 5, 2013. Previous CEO/President, Gary George, will continue as the company’s Chairman.  Executive responsibilities will continue to be shared, with Carl leading all areas of live production and processing and Charles leading sales, accounting, human resources, quality assurance and purchasing.

“Our family built this company with an uncompromising dedication to quality,” said Gary George. “We have always been committed to treating our customers, employees, and independent contract growers with respect, honesty and loyalty. Those same values will continue to guide our company as the fourth generation leads George’s.”

With the company since 1997, Carl George and Charles George have devoted time to learning all areas of the business, from live production to sales.  In 2006, they joined the executive team, and in 2009, they were both named Senior Vice President with executive responsibilities for the areas they now lead.

“We have an amazing team of dedicated people and committed contract growers who work hard to offer our customers the best service and products,” said Carl George.  “I look forward to continuing the work of growing our company and maintaining our commitment to providing these quality products.” 

“It is a privilege to work alongside my brother and the excellent team here at George’s,” said Charles George. “Providing our customers with the highest quality poultry products is a legacy that we will continue for years to come.” 

Charles George serves on the Board of Directors for both the Arkansas Poultry Federation and the U.S. Poultry & Egg Association, and he is a member of the National Chicken Council.  

Carl George serves on the Board of Directors for the National Chicken Council and is a member of the U.S Poultry & Egg Association.  He also serves on the Crystal Bridges Young Patrons Steering Committee and the Downtown Springdale Alliance, and he is Vice Chairman of the Springdale Athletic Foundation Board.  

Both Carl George and Charles George received their B.S.B.A. from Walton College of Business at the University of Arkansas.
