Investing in Great Global Businessesfor the Long-Term







Focus Growth Strategy
The Investment Strategy of our Focus Growth is straight-forward: construct a stock portfolio of companies that we believe can collectively deliver mid-teens earnings per share growth over the next five years while incurring only moderate risk. It is our aim to invest in companies best positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. Our Investment Team looks to generate returns by identifying market-leading companies that offer the potential for sustained, above-average growth in revenues and earnings. Companies must meet the following criteria:

Extremely strong balance sheets
Abundant free cash flow
ROE of 20% or more
Strong Earnings per Share Growth
Stable to Improving Margins
Shareholder-Oriented Management Team

Once a company has been added to the Portfolio, we monitor it closely. Our research-intensive Investment Process enables us to not only identify unique growth opportunities but also maintain our intimate knowledge of the company's financial and competitive position.

Investing in Great Global Businessesfor the Long-Term









 Polen Capital Focus Global Growth Fund (UCITS)
Polen Capital’s Focus Global Growth strategy was launched in a UCITS format on 29th January 2015 with the USD classes; other UCITS classes have been activated as demand arises.
“The Polen Capital Focus Global Growth Fund” is marketed outside the United States to institutional and professional investors and, where appropriate, properly accredited or high net worth investors.  Any prospective investor must qualify below before accessing the marketing materials.
This strategy and all related funds are managed by Julian Pick, the Portfolio Manager, who identifies and invests into global ‘large cap’ companies that meet Polen’s established investment philosophy.  The Global Growth strategy is an extension of the established Focus Growth strategy into a global universe of companies.

Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            In a word: horrible. Stay far, far away from this nightmare of an experience from the website to the customer service line to the joke of a mobile app. Overdraft fees are insane at $37, sometimes more if they cover it.

Amazon.com Store Card


                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees. I purchased 1400 dollars worth of stuff, and believing I had 12 months to pay off, I didn't worry about it for the first two months. The next time I looked they had hit me with 100$...show more

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                    Current                


Polen Capital Management LLC


                  Polen Capital Management (PCM) employs disciplined, bottom-up, concentrated US, Global and International equity investment strategies that focus on high-quality, large-cap growth investments. The Polen Focus Growth strategy invests in a portfolio of companies PCM believes can deliver mid-teens earnings per share growth over the next 5 years while incurring only moderate risk. The strategy invests in a concentrated portfolio of primarily large-cap, US common stocks with sustainable competitive advantages. The Polen Growth Fund is a US, large-cap US growth fund that emphasizes sustainable earnings growth and focuses on companies with high returns on capital and double digit earnings growth. It is a concentrated portfolio of approximately 30 high-quality growth companies with low portfolio turnover and long-term holding periods.PCM's Global Growth strategy is similar to their Focus Growth strategy, but with adjustments to compensate for fundamental and macro-economic influences that may have a greater effect on the relative performance of foreign stocks than domestic issues. It invests in a concentrated portfolio of outstanding US and international businesses with competitive advantages and the potential for sustained superior growth. The Polen Global Growth Fund emphasizes sustainable earnings growth and focuses on companies with high returns on capital and double digit earnings growth. It is a concentrated portfolio of approximately 30 high-quality growth companies with low portfolio turnover and long-term holding periods.The Polen International Growth strategy applies the same philosophy as the Focus Growth and Global Growth portfolios, but invests exclusively in businesses domiciled outside of the US. Adjustments are made to compensate for macro-economic and country-specific influences that can impact the relative performance of foreign stocks. The strategy invests in a concentrated portfolio of primarily large-cap, non-US businesses with competitive advantages and the potential for sustained superior growth. The Polen Capital International Growth Fund seeks to achieve long-term growth of capital with with PCM's \"\"Active Share Investment Process\"\" that relies on in-depth research to uncover competitively-advantaged companies that meet their disciplined investment criteria.
