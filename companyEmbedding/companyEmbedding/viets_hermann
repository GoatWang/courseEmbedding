MSOE’s Leadership










Dr. John Y. Walz President

MSOE is under the guidance and leadership of Dr. John Y. Walz, who began his term as the university’s fifth president on July 1, 2016.
Walz earned a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from Tulane University. After six years as a process support engineer for Shell Oil Company, Walz left to pursue a Ph.D. in chemical engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. He received his Ph.D. in 1992 and returned to Tulane as an assistant professor. In 1997, Walz joined Yale University’s faculty as an associate professor of chemical engineering and in 2002 he became the department’s chairman. In 2005 he became professor and head of the Department of Chemical Engineering at Virginia Tech and in 2012 Walz became dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Kentucky.
“I strongly believe in the MSOE mission – preparing students for exceptional careers as leaders and entrepreneurs. The success of the university in fulfilling this mission is remarkable, and there is no doubt that as our society becomes more advanced, MSOE’s importance and global impact will expand.”
Walz has received honors and awards from the universities where he has taught as well as from the National Science Foundation, who awarded him a Research Initiation Award in 1993 and a Faculty Early Career Development Award in 1997. In 2010, Virginia Tech recognized the Chemical Engineering Department’s achievements, chaired by Walz, with an Exemplary Department Award. Walz is past-chair of the American Chemical Society Division of Colloid and Surface Chemistry (2011). He and his wife Moira have three daughters: Megan, Bridget and Emily.

House Confidential
 MSOE’s Humphrey House
MSOE spent $250,000 to upgrade the 1894 Queen Anne residence of its longtime president.

The imposing home where Dr. Hermann Viets lives is a three story Cream City Brick Queen Anne residence built in 1894 as the parsonage for Grace Evangelical Lutheran Church, which is located across the street. (It’s the church with the huge stained glass portrait of Martin Luther where Jesus would be if it were any other Christian denomination).


In 1996 it was purchased from the church by the Milwaukee School of Engineering where it was used as office space for about a decade (including as the construction office for the Kern Center). In 2007, the school spent $250,000 to convert the building back to a single-family residence, which is now the home of the school’s president since 1991, the 70-year old Dr. Viets. (Viets moved there from his Lake Drive home in Shorewood.) The official name of the building is Humphrey House, in honor of the Glenn and Gertrude Humphrey Foundation, which came up with the funds for the structure. Humphrey, who died in 1983 at 78, had a stake in 30 car dealerships nationwide, and left a $10 million estate. One of those dealerships was located where MSOE’s Grohmann Museum now resides, just a block south of the Humphrey House Broadway.
Humphrey House
The building, like the rest of MSOE property, is tax-exempt, although city records value it at $22,000 for the land, $123,000 for the improvements for a total of $135,000. This sum has not changed since 2006, since the city rarely revalues exempt property. Nothin’ from nothin’ is nothin’, after all.
As the President’s residence, it is unparalleled in its proximity to campus and to downtown. Where else can you find the president of a college grilling his burgers right in full view of the public? No problem here, since the president’s patio is right on E. Juneau Ave., unobscured by fence or hedge. Viets and his wife Pam have become a fixture during the annual Storm the Bastille run, waving from their patio as the runners come down Juneau Ave and head south onto Broadway.
Furthermore, the residence is located mere feet from the president’s office, also on N. Broadway, located in a series of rooms bursting at the seams with an unending plunder paintings sent to the college by longtime benefactor Eckhart G. Grohmann.
The Rundown

Style: Single-family
Location: East Town / Juneau Town
Walk Score: 91 out of 100. The home is a “Walker’s Paradise.”
Public Transit Score: 68 out of 100. A good score, which is only bound to improve when the streetcar starts running two blocks away.
Street Smart Walk Score: 88 out of 100.
Year Built: 1894
Assessed Value: Tax-exempt

Fancy Neighbors with Wright Connections: The home immediately to the east of the Humphrey House is a three-family income property owned by U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin Judge Lynn S. Adelman, who grew up in a Fox Point home designed by Frank Lloyd Wright that now belongs to his brother, Craig Adelman after the death last January of their father, Albert “Ollie” Adelman.
How Milwaukee Is It? If Dr. Viets had to pay taxes on his residence, he would find the offices of the City of Milwaukee Treasurer a convenient four-tenths of a mile away.

About Dr. Hermann Viets
Viets, who was born in Germany during World War II, has presided over a significant amount of change at MSOE. While the university has remained true to its focus on educating engineers, it has added the Rader School of Business and the School of Nursing. Perhaps most noticeable during his tenure is the number of capital projects undertaken, including not only the purchase of the Humphrey House, but the development of the Kern Center, Grohmann Museum, Rosenberg Hall, Krueger Hall and the under-construction Athletic Field and Parking Complex. In addition the school has expanded to fill the Campus Center building at 1025 N. Broadway that was formerly home to Blatz, and later Pabst.
Viets received the World Citizen Award in 2008 from the International Institute of Wisconsin.
Before arriving at MSOE, Dr. Viets worked at a number of well-regarded institutions across the country. According to his official biography…
Viets received a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering, and both a master’s degree and Ph.D. in astronautics, all from Polytechnic University in New York City and Farmingdale, Long Island. He was a visiting scientist, aerospace engineer and research group leader for Wright Patterson Air Force Base Aerospace Research Laboratories in Dayton, Ohio; lecturer at the Von Karman Institute in Brussels, Belgium; and a research associate at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, N.Y. His other academic experience includes (whew) serving as dean of engineering at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston; associate dean for research and professor at West Virginia University, Morgantown; and professor of engineering at Wright State University, Dayton, Ohio.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
