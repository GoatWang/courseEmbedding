WARREN, Mich., July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:    ULH) announced today the planned release of second quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Thursday, July 27, 2017.  








Based on currently available information, Universal expects to report income from operations in the range of $5.0 million to $6.5 million, on total operating revenues anticipated to range from $300 million to $305 million.  This compares to $16.8 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2016 on revenues totaling $276.8 million.  Universal anticipates earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.11 for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $0.32 per share in second quarter 2016.
"During the second quarter 2017, we came to a mutual agreement with one of our customers to exit and transition certain unprofitable value-added services performed by our Mexican operation," stated Universal's Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Rogers.  "In the second quarter alone, we incurred over $8.0 million in operating losses attributable to this operation.  We believe the decision provides the best solution for both Universal and its customer, and we look forward to the continued relationship we have on several other ongoing programs.  Although we are clearly disappointed with the bottom line, there is a lot going on that I'm really excited about.  Our transportation segment is delivering solid results, we're seeing recovery in our operations supporting the heavy-truck market, and for the second quarter in a row, we grew top-line revenues across all of our service lines.  With much of the headwinds behind us, and so many signs of improvement for the industrial base of customers we serve, we look forward to returning Universal to its historical performance."

WARREN, Mich., July 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:    ULH) announced today the planned release of second quarter 2017 financial results after the market closes on Thursday, July 27, 2017.  








Based on currently available information, Universal expects to report income from operations in the range of $5.0 million to $6.5 million, on total operating revenues anticipated to range from $300 million to $305 million.  This compares to $16.8 million of operating income in the second quarter of 2016 on revenues totaling $276.8 million.  Universal anticipates earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $0.08 to $0.11 for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $0.32 per share in second quarter 2016.
"During the second quarter 2017, we came to a mutual agreement with one of our customers to exit and transition certain unprofitable value-added services performed by our Mexican operation," stated Universal's Chief Executive Officer, Jeff Rogers.  "In the second quarter alone, we incurred over $8.0 million in operating losses attributable to this operation.  We believe the decision provides the best solution for both Universal and its customer, and we look forward to the continued relationship we have on several other ongoing programs.  Although we are clearly disappointed with the bottom line, there is a lot going on that I'm really excited about.  Our transportation segment is delivering solid results, we're seeing recovery in our operations supporting the heavy-truck market, and for the second quarter in a row, we grew top-line revenues across all of our service lines.  With much of the headwinds behind us, and so many signs of improvement for the industrial base of customers we serve, we look forward to returning Universal to its historical performance."

Universal Logistics Holdings, Inc. Company Profile

   Universal Logistics Holdings (formerly Universal Truckload Services) hasn't hauled freight beyond its own galaxy, but the company does cover the US and parts of Canada (Ontario and Quebec) and Mexico. As an "asset-light" provider of truckload freight transportation, the company operates through a network of truck owner-operators rather than employing drivers and investing heavily in equipment. It can call upon a fleet of some 4,300 tractors and 6,300 trailers, including standard dry vans and flatbeds; the majority of its tractors and trailers are owned by others. Its flagship transportation segment transports general commodities such as automotive parts, building materials, paper, food, consumer goods, furniture, steel, and other metals.
  
† Some telephone numbers on the Hoover’s site may be on a country’s do not call or do not contact list including, but not limited to, the United Kingdom’s CTPS or TPS registers. It is a legal requirement that companies do not make sales or marketing calls to registered numbers. These are central opt out registers whereby corporate subscribers and individuals can register their preference not to receive unsolicited sales and marketing telephone calls. By using the information provided on the Hoover’s sites, as the direct marketer you represent and warrant that you will use such information in compliance with all applicable local, state, national or international laws and regulations, including any local do not call registers or marketing regulations, and agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Dun & Bradstreet and each of its affiliates in the event your use violates such laws and regulations.

Who is Who

Our organization

WT Logistics LLC
  Is a full service Logistics provider, Imports, Exports, DDP deliveries,
  port-to-port, domestic and international cargo, full customs services,
  warehousing and “virtual warehousing’ services, 3PL, and distribution.
WT Cargo LLC.
  Provider of Cargo Services. Registered and bonded with the “Federal
  Maritime Commission” (FMC) as Non Vessel Common Carrier Operator (NVOCC)
  and Ocean Freight Forwarder, also registered with the “FAA” as Air Freight
  Forwarder. Member of IATA, Air forwarders Association and CNS. Participates in C-TPAT and other
  security related programs with the Department of Homeland Security.
  Currently hold contracts with mayor ocean carriers and airlines with
  worldwide services. Areas on specialization are heavy cargo, oversized
  cargo, project cargo, frozen cargo and cargo requiring special handling.

With over 25 years in the market and wide experience in
transportation logistics and distribution, our main offices are located in Miami, Florida USA, just a few miles from the Miami International Airport, Port of Miami and Port Everglades (Fort Lauderdale). We service all the major Ports and Airports in the United States. 
By using the wide international network of partners and
service providers, worldwide, we offer services from any point of origin to
your destination: we provide services from and to all over the world.
Among our customers are manufacturers of capital goods,
consumer products, food and beverage, wholesalers, industrial equipment etc.
Our warehouse is equipped with state of the art information
systems as well of infrastructure allows us to handle the most diverse variety
of products.
Our Services

Our professionals offer their experience to advice and
handle the most difficult tasks, from large “one-time” projects to repetitive
services. 
In large projects, we have the experience of handling the
transportation door-to-door of large manufacturing plants, mining equipment,
truck fleets, oil rigs, large scale air conditioner units, tanks and in
general, large and heavy equipment that requires special handling, complex
coordination, professional planning and accurate execution. 
Our activities are oriented in four groups of customers:

Customers Located in the United States Importing from
  overseas.
Customers Located in the Unite States Exporting.
International Customers importing from the United States.
International Customers Exporting to the United States.

For each situation we have a group of professionals that
have the knowledge and experience to advise our customers the most economical
and efficient method to handle that operation.
From the origin to the destination.
Our customers count and rely in our services to
access the North American market and also for North American companies to
access their international customers, most frequently Latin America. We execute
their instructions and act as an extension of their operation in the market.
Importers to the United States usually request
the use of the INCOTERMS “DDP” (Duties,
Delivery Paid), in other words: door-to-door. The property of the imported good
is transferred to the buyer at his designated location. Our organization can
execute the complete process, including providing “Importer of record” and,
when required, represent the customer in the “FDA” (“Food and Drug
Administration”) registration process.
3PL Third Party Logistics

When optimizing the supply and demand, you often realize
that your customer needs do not mach with your ability to deliver. We can help
you closing this gap providing local warehousing and distribution, giving you
the sense of a “virtual warehouse” to fulfill your customer needs.
We can be as the “Importer or Records” or have your customer
to do so. We can, then, deliver your products “Just-In-Time”, access multiple
distribution centers or tailor the process as per your customer needs. We have
extensive experience in this area, ask us and our specialists will help you.
In exports, we can hold your inventory and proceed to ship
as needed; we will act and be like an extension of your operation.
Cross-Docking is a
logistics technique that eliminates the put away, storage, and order picking
functions of a warehouse while still allowing it to serve its receiving and shipping
functions. It enables firms to eliminate inventory costs and reduce
transportation costs, often at the same time.
Simply put, cross-docking moves imported product into
domestic equipment or moves domestic product into export equipment. It is becoming
more and more common in today’s logistics operations.
 
Handling of Pound or Products?

Maybe both…
The international flow of goods requires the use of multiple
steam-companies, airlines and other means of transportation.  The service is
measured by weight or by volume. The transport company product is the “box”,
“pallet” and/or the unit of transportation. The content is not their main
concern. We know that for you as a shipper or as a consignee, your concern is
your product. Our information systems as well the communication with our
customers is in their language and not in terms like “on-hands”, “airway bills”
or “bill-of-lading”. We keep track of all the references associated to the
cargo for future references.
Storage and Distribution

We service all the international Sea-ports and Airports in
the United States. We have access to distributions centers shipping and or
receiving products in the most convenient locations to minimize cost. We can
arrange and provide deliveries “JIT” (Just in Time) reducing inventory levels
and ate the same time, increase the level of service.
We can be you warehouse space in South Florida, secured,
accurate and professionally managed. See our warehouse offer.
What is Logistics?

That part of Supply chain process involving planning
implementation, efficient and effective flow of information and goods between a
point of origin and the point of consumption tailor-made according to customers
requirements
The difference between a logistic provider and a cargo
provider is that a good logistics provider deals with your “products”
and a cargo provider handles your pallets, kilos and volume. 
Our repetitive customers are the best proof that our service
is consistent and high quality. When requiring special handling and high
dedication, our group of professionals will be there to help you.
 
Consulting and Planning

Before you face a Supply Chain Management solution, a group
of professionals will analyze your needs and go through three basic steps:
Analysis
Will collect all the information about the current process,
taking notes on the strength and weakness, drawing the flow of goods, materials
and assessing the levels of information available,
Project
After the Analysis phase, we will design a working model
with your management and employees, proposing methods to optimize your current
process and placing you Supply Chain in a competitive and profitable stage.
Implementation
After the proposal approval, we will put our resources to
work, delivering the solution, coordinating the complex network that will
create the new optimized Supply Chain that will reduce your logistics cost.
