BDC Fund II
LP

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The Fund invests in common stock of publicly-traded business development companies. All the Fund's investments are in public equity securities traded on a major U.S. exchange, which are independently valued on a daily basis, and which can be liquidated on short notice. The liquidity of the Fund's investments allows SCM to quickly redeploy assets across the leveraged debt market to take advantage of investment opportunities and to meet any investor redemption requests on very short notice.
