These 10 influencers used to work at Bose, Apple, GoPro, Google and Aveda. Now they work in weed 

The cannabis industry is luring executives and influencers away from the most influential technology companies and lifestyle brands in America. Why they jumping to the weed ship, in their own words.

Not messing around: MassRoots names a top dog in the tech industry as new CTO 
 



















 News

Senate committee, rejecting request from Sessions, keeps protection for medical marijuana states





A Senate appropriations committee approved an amendment to protect state medical marijuana programs from interference from the Department of Justice.



Federal lawsuit against Sessions and DEA says marijuana’s Schedule I status unconstitutional





A diverse group of cannabis advocates filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of marijuana as Schedule I in the Controlled Substances Act.



Los Angeles might create its own bank for the cannabis industry (among others)





Los Angeles city leaders are looking into the possibility of a public bank that would do business with marijuana dispensaries, which are currently cash-only.



Growing tomatoes in Kansas led to SWAT-style weed raid. Judge says gardeners can sue





A SWAT-style raid to search for marijuana at the home of a Kansas City couple was an unjustified government intrusion, a federal appeals court judge has ruled.


Culture

I work to protect children from marijuana. My epileptic son could benefit from it.





The co-founder of Smart Colorado examines the difference between high-THC marijuana and high CBD strains, like cannabidiol oil for epileptic seizures.



Willie Nelson video interview: America’s political divide, Jeff Sessions and marijuana





In a video interview aboard his tour bus, Willie Nelson asks Attorney General Jeff Sessions to open his mind on drug policy.



A veteran cannabis farmer mourns the passing of a more paranoid, more profitable way of life





Tim Blake, owner of Healing Harvest cannabis farm and Area 101, an iconic dispensary and gathering spot in California, discusses the past and future of weed.



In Nevada, weed deliveries to homes up, hotel rooms out





Nevada’s marijuana industry is ramping up its home delivery service as demand for the drug increases following the legalization of recreational pot in the state earlier this month.


Resources

These college students lost access to legal weed — and started getting better grades





Study shows European college students with access to recreational marijuana earned worse grades and fail classes at a higher rate.



If I use cannabis topicals, will I test positive on a THC drug test?





Experts weigh in on whether cannabis topicals — which include lotions, balms and THC transdermal patches — will cause a positive marijuana drug test.



Are you consuming pesticides or other contaminants in your cannabis? Colorado recall list (updated 7/27/17)





Do you have any pesticide-peppered pot in your stash? Find out here: An updated list of all marijuana companies going through product recalls in Colorado.



Even the DEA says nobody has ever died of a marijuana overdose





Cannabis connoisseurs have been saying for years that marijuana is a safer recreational substance than alcohol. Now they can use the DEA to back up their argument. 


Food

Shrimp sauté over an avocado makes a citrusy, summery salad (recipe)





I have medicated the canna-olive oil for this salad with the hybrid strain Blue Dream. Some people like to taste the weed in their food, and some do not. Personally, I think that a hint is nice, psychologically it helps to prepare me for the medible experience.



Peanut butter and almond milk smoothies are a creamy, filling infused treat





Made with the right ingredients, a smoothie can take the place of a meal. This smoothie weed recipe is super-tasty, filling, and good for you — a delicious triple threat. 



Infused with Chef Hosea Rosenberg: Tuna poke bowl





Award-winning chef Hosea Rosenberg shared this recipe for a cannabis-infused tuna poke bowl. Follow step-by-step.  FULL RECIPE



Infused barbecue: Eight recipes to fire up the ultimate cannabis cookout





If you love both grilling and weed, these recipes will change your summer.


Strain Reviews

Snowcap (marijuana review)





Our ever-intrepid marijuana critic takes the Snowcap strain for a ride at an amusement park and sets himself up to get burned by the hybrid for the second time.



Golden Goat (marijuana review)





Golden Goat surpassed its namesake, combining an extended mild euphoric smile-fest and 30 minutes of “cool down” before bedtime. The strain hits on a flavor that I refer to as “planty.” I’ve heard others use the term “earthy.”



Afgoo (marijuana review)





If Afgoo looked out of place at a slick marijuana shop like Euflora, it’s only because it harkened back to an earlier age when strains weren’t tinkered with endlessly to produce modern super-buds. Trapped there in a display jar, it looked more like the oldest lion in the zoo. I wanted to free it.



Juicy Fruit (marijuana review)





Marijuana review: Juicy Fruit is a fruity hybrid whose smell and taste reflect its name, and whose quality reflects the current market drought in Colorado.
