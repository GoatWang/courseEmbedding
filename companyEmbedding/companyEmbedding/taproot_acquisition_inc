TapRooT® History (The rest of the story)
Equifactor® History
How Does the TapRooT® System Work?
TapRooT® Software
TapRooT® Training
Course Guarantee

TapRooT® is a systematic process, software, and training for finding the real root causes of problems. It is used by leading companies around the world to investigate and fix the root causes of major accidents, everyday incidents, minor near-misses, quality issues, human errors, maintenance problems, medical mistakes, productivity issues, manufacturing mistakes, environmental releases … in other words, all types of mission-critical problems.
What makes TapRooT® work so well? 
Here’s a short list:

System Design and Testing

Systematic process based on in-depth human factors and equipment reliability research.
Designed to keep investigators out of common investigator traps including the blame game and jumping to conclusions.
Tested by major governmental and industrial clients around the world and continuously improved to produce reliable, repeatable, explainable results.


System Features and Continuous Improvement

An expert system that leads investigators beyond their current knowledge and makes them feel like they have a human factors expert sitting beside them when analyzing human errors.
Not just a root cause analysis system, but a complete investigation process that helps investigators collect the information they need to find root causes.
Patented TapRooT® Software (either web based or individual user) to make the system more efficient and to create a database of investigation results.
Excellent training that can be as extensive or as simple as required for the needs of those being trained.
Copyrighted Root Cause Tree®, Dictionary, and Corrective Action Helper® developed by our staff of experts and continuously improved.
An advisory board of over 60 industry and governmental leaders that provides ideas for improving TapRooT®.
Equifactor® troubleshooting tables (licensed from Heinz Bloch) for troubleshooting equipment failures.
Excellent documentation in a readable, best-selling book (over 60,000 copies sold) – TapRooT®: Changing the Way the World Solves Problems


Worldwide Support

A worldwide network of exceptional instructors and investigators with extensive real world experience they bring to courses, and who are also available to assist with difficult investigations at your site.
Worldwide user network and a user discussion site (on LinkedIn) for benchmarking and networking (over 10,000 people per year are trained in TapRooT® around the world).
Three free newsletters (one weekly, one bi-monthly, and one quarterly) to promote continued learning of advanced root cause analysis, equipment troubleshooting, and performance improvement ideas.
An annual, global Summit to promote networking, benchmarking, and learning of advanced best practices and the most recent performance improvement technology.

The TapRooT® System is based on advanced, proven human performance and equipment reliability technology. This knowledge was built into the TapRooT® System so that every person investigating problems can take advantage of the knowledge of experts without having to spend years studying human and equipment performance.

TapRooT® History (The rest of the story)
The TapRooT® System, Training, and Software have a long history of R&D and improvement that continues today. Over 20 years ago, we started with 6 years of research into human performance and the best incident investigation and root cause analysis systems. Then we put our knowledge to use to build a systematic investigation process with a coherent investigation philosophy. We then used and refined the system in the field. We’ve performed formal user testing and informal focus group appraisals. In 1991, we wrote the first TapRooT® Manual that put all of this experience together into the best incident investigation system – TapRooT®!
But we didn’t stop there. We continued improving the system with feedback from thousands of users from our ever-growing international user base. We improved the TapRooT® Book and Courses. And we developed the patented TapRooT® Software to improve investigation productivity. Our groundbreaking research and development and our continuing improvement efforts are the reasons that TapRooT® is used by so many industry leaders worldwide.
But don’t take our word for it. Instead, see what TapRooT® users have to say about their successes. Read the Success Stories that explain how users stopped injuries, saved lives, improved investigation effectiveness and productivity, stopped finger pointing and blame, improved equipment reliability, and fixed operating problems that saved big bucks.
Analyzing human performance was the original focus of TapRooT®. It still is one of its biggest strengths. Mark Paradies, co-developer of the TapRooT® System, became familiar with advanced human factors technology during his studies at the University of Illinois. Mark had been in the Nuclear Navy and was familiar with errors that operators and mechanics make (even when they are well-trained & have good procedures). He learned theories behind human error and advanced concepts to correct human factors problems.
Advanced human factors concepts aren’t very accessible to plant personnel, engineers, and managers (who generally aren’t trained in human factors). So Mark built these concepts into TapRooT®. This required careful design to include advanced human performance technology without the jargon used by experts. Mark Paradies and co-developer Linda Unger crafted a system that includes advanced human performance concepts without being too complex. What advanced human factors concepts are in TapRooT®?
The list is too long to read here, but it includes:

The SOR Model of Human Performance
Rasmussen’s Skill-Rule-Knowledge Model
Knowledge of Advanced Job Performance Aids
The Systematic Approach to Training (SAT)
Application of Cockpit Resource Management
Ergonomics (anthropometrics)
Communication reliability practices
An advanced behavior change model
Charles Hopkins’ human factors theories
Chris Wickens’ concepts on mental models
James Reason’s Swiss Cheese Model of error
Paradies/Unger’s human performance troubleshooting model

You don’t have to learn these concepts, have a PhD in Psychology, or hire a human factors expert to take advantage of this technology. Just answer the questions and follow the guidance that TapRooT® provides to find the root causes of human error.
If you are interested in advanced human performance technology that can help you stop human error, learn the TapRooT® System and apply it to fix the root causes of human error.

Equifactor® History
Besides advanced human performance technology, TapRooT® also has advanced equipment troubleshooting technology built into the system.
In 1997, Mark Paradies started working with equipment reliability expert Heinz Bloch to develop a system to improve the analysis of equipment failure. Mark, Andy Marquardt, and Ken Reed have worked with Heinz to develop a system, course, and software for equipment troubleshooting and root cause analysis that combines Heinz Bloch’s techniques with the power of SnapCharT®s, Change Analysis, and the TapRooT® Root Cause Tree®. We called this advanced equipment troubleshooting technology Equifactor®. In 2000, it was fully integrated into the TapRooT® Book and Software to make TapRooT® the complete root cause analysis system for all types of problems.
More Continuous Improvement
Of course, TapRooT®‘s development didn’t stop there. People at System Improvements are constantly looking for ways to improve the TapRooT® System, Documentation, Training, and Software. In 2008, they published a completely new TapRooT® Book. In 2010 Ed Skompski and Dan Verlinde led a software development team who released the initial version 5 of the TapRooT® Software, a complete software rewrite from the ground up. Keep an eye on the Root Cause Analysis Blog for news about all the latest improvements to TapRooT®.

How Does the TapRooT® System Work?
The TapRooT® System is a 7-Step Investigation Process with built in tools that help an investigator like you:

Collect information.
Understand what happened.
Identify the problems that caused the incident.
Analyze each problem’s root causes.
Look beyond root causes for systemic, cultural, and organizational factors.
Develop fixes to improve performance and stop repeat incidents.
Present what’s been learned to management so they can understand and approve the fixes.


The first steps of the 7-Step Investigation Process are to plan the investigation, collect information, and understand what happened. The investigator draws a SnapCharT® to understand what happened and to organize the information about what happened. Below is a simple SnapCharT® that a team has started to build about a simple accident – a sprained ankle.
The initial investigation work will uncover more information about the incident’s events until the investigator or team can completely understand what happened. Then they can identify all the Causal Factors (problems) that came together to cause the accident/incident. These Causal Factors can be displayed on a more advanced SnapCharT® (as in the SnapCharT® below).
Once the investigators have identified all the Causal Factors, they can analyze each of the problems to determine the problems’ root causes. A Causal Factor can have more than one “root cause.” TapRooT® has a special tool, the Root Cause Tree® and Dictionary, to help investigators find root causes of the Causal Factors.
The Root Cause Tree® is a copyrighted, trademarked, and patented (in the software) tool for analysis of root causes. It was initially developed by Mark Paradies, David Busch, and Linda Unger to help people perform better root cause analysis of human performance and equipment reliability problems. It uses the latest human performance and equipment reliability technology to help investigators in the field find root causes. It has extensive development history including testing in many industries and feedback from users around the world.
The Root Cause Tree® has seven Basic Cause Categories. One of the Basic Cause Categories – Procedures (graphic below) – shows the root cause level that investigators strive to reach. The graphic also shows the human factors research that is built into the Procedures section.

Also built into the Root Cause Tree® is a 15-question Human Performance Troubleshooting Guide that helps investigators dig into human errors to find their root causes by considering a wide range of factors. Three of the questions are shown below to demonstrate how the Human Performance Troubleshooting Guide gets investigators to consider different areas that could contribute to human error.

To ensure consistent use of the Root Cause Tree®, the Root Cause Tree® Dictionary was written to clearly define each of the categories/root causes and guide investigators to the root causes of human performance problems.

Once all the root causes have been identified for a problem, the TapRooT® System then helps the investigator look for Generic Causes (big picture problems related to culture, systemic, and organizational problems).
Once the root and generic causes have been identified, the investigator can use the Corrective Action Helper® and SMARTER tools to develop effective corrective actions to prevent future problems.

Finally, TapRooT® tools can be used to present what was found to management and others.
That’s how the TapRooT® System helps solve problems.
The TapRooT® Training teaches investigators how to effectively use each tool in a systematic investigation process. Using TapRooT® will become second nature – as it has for the 10,000+ people who are trained each year to use TapRooT®.
Using TapRooT® can be simplified for quick, easy investigations. Thus, TapRooT® is flexible; it can be used for analyzing simple incidents or minor equipment failures or significant accidents that cost lives and millions of dollars. See the range of applications of TapRooT® by reviewing the success stories here.
The whole process is documented in the TapRooT® Book – a complete reference provided with the TapRooT® Training.

For a more detailed look at how TapRooT® works, see the environmental incident example here.

TapRooT® Software
In 1990, we started developing the TapRooT® Software. In 2002, the TapRooT® Software received a US patent. Software updates are released several times each year.

TapRooT® Software comes in two forms: Enterprise and Single-User.
The Single-User TapRooT® Software can be loaded on a PC to computerize the TapRooT® Tools. Individual investigators keep a database of their investigations. The software includes all the TapRooT® techniques. These techniques are organized in an interface built around the TapRooT® 7-Step Investigation Process so that everything is easy for the user to access.
The software also includes an incident database to store the information, a corrective action database to save and track the corrective actions, and databases to store other information (pictures, documents, procedures, …).
The Enterprise Software takes the same tools and makes them available over the company intranet. This allows easier installation, updates, administration, and backup of the software. It also allows reporting of incidents from any connected PC, collaboration of multiple investigators at separate locations over the net, and online management reviews.

TapRooT® Training
TapRooT® is the most effective, tested, documented root cause system used by industry leaders around the world. One of the most impressive parts of the TapRooT® System is the training that helps people see problems from a whole new perspective. That’s why TapRooT® Training comes with the following Money Back Guarantee:

Course Guarantee:
Attend a TapRooT® Course. Go back to work and use what you have learned to analyze accidents, incidents, near-misses, or quality problems. If you don’t find root causes that you previously would have overlooked and if you and your management don’t agree that the corrective actions that you recommend are much more effective, just return your course materials and we will refund the entire course fee. No questions asked – no hard feelings – it’s that simple.

Company Culture Root Cause Tip: Trust Me the Foreman Said…
Posted: July 28th, 2017 in Root Cause Analysis Tips
No matter what industry that you work in, if you or your peers can say, “it’s common for management to argue or ‘explain away’ my concerns when you say this is unsafe…”
STOP! 
If you do not stop, you will get to explore a root cause from the TapRooT® Root Cause Tree. The root cause will be Employee Feedback Needs Improvement. Unfortunately, it will also be associated with a causal factor that caused an incident, failed to stop an incident or made an incident worse when it occurred. Don’t forget, You are just one Causal Factor from your next major Incident. Can you prevent it?
During the root cause analysis, not only will you be exploring the culture of the company that allowed this failure not to stop, but you also will get the opportunity to understand what was broke.

Was it a knowledge issue? If yes, read more here: Root Cause Tip: Anyone Can Do The Job! Or Can They?


Was it a compliance issue with the supervisor? If yes, read more here: Root Cause Tip: “Enforcement Needs Improvement” – You Can’t Train Obedience/Compliance/Positive Behavior


Was it the fact that the person in charge was not apparent? If yes, read more here: Root Cause Tip: Accountability NI

Please be aware, that in this article and the included article links, I have only touched just the tip of each subject and introduced a very tiny part of our root cause analysis process. It is hoped that you leave with something you can use today and pay it forward. But also help you realize that there are numerous issues that must be addressed following an incident or before one occurs. We help you get there.
If you don’t want to have to read between three or four articles to do to an investigation, come to one of our public TapRooT® Courses or contact us for an onsite course. Why? Simple, each course provides Using the Essential TapRooT® Techniques to Investigate Low-to-Medium Risk Incidents, Course Workbook, the complete Root Cause Tree®, Root Cause Tree® Dictionary, and Corrective Action Helper®.

Interviewing and Evidence Collection: Prepare to Record the Scene
Posted: July 27th, 2017 in Investigations, Root Cause Analysis Tips
In TapRooT®, we use a mnemonic to quickly remember what types of evidence we may want to collect after an incident occurs: 3 Ps & an R. This stands for:
People evidence
Paper evidence
Physical evidence and
Recording evidence.
Recordings may include any photographs or video you capture. It may also include archived recordings such as computer data or security video.
Today, I have some quick reminders about things to consider in preparation of recording the scene (video or photographs).
First, ensure the battery is fully charged. I know, this is elementary right? Well, it is until you don’t do it and the battery dies in the middle of recording.
Second, remember to turn on the time and date display functions.  Then, you will have an automatic record of when the video was recorded or the photographs were taken without writing it down anywhere.
Third, clear the area of people.  Why? You do not want to record any embarrassing or inaccurate statements on video,  and you don’t want to place people at the scene who were not there originally on video or in a photograph.
To learn more about evidence collection, join me in Houston, Texas in November for a 3-day root cause analysis and evidence collection course, or just 1 day of evidence collection training.

Is There Just One Root Cause for a Major Accident?
Posted: July 26th, 2017 in Accidents, Courses, Investigations, Pictures, Root Cause Analysis Tips, Root Causes, TapRooT

Some people might say that the Officer of The Deck on the USS Fitzgerald goofed up. He turned in front of a containership and caused an accident.
Wait a second. Major accidents are NEVER that simple. There are almost always multiple things that went wrong. Multiple “Causal Factors” that could be eliminated and … if they were … would have prevented the accident or significantly reduced the accident’s consequences.
The “One Root Cause” assumption gets many investigators in trouble when performing a root cause analysis. They think they can ask why five times and find THE ROOT CAUSE.
TapRooT® Investigators never make this “single root cause” mistake. They start by developing a complete sequence of events that led to the accident. They do this by drawing a SnapCharT® (either using yellow stickies or using the TapRooT® Software).
They then use one of several methods to make sure they identify ALL the Causal Factors.
When they have identified the Causal Factors, they aren’t done. They are just getting started.
EACH of the Causal Factors are taken through the TapRooT® Root Cause Tree®, using the Root Cause Tree® Dictionary,  and all the root cause for each Causal Factor are identified.
That’s right. There may be more than one root cause for each Causal Factor. Think of it as there may be more than one best practice to implement to prevent that Causal Factor from happening again.
TapRooT® Investigators go even one step further. They look for Generic Causes.
What is a Generic Cause? The system problem that allowed the root cause to exist.
Here’s a simple example. Let’s say that you find a simple typo in a procedure. That typo cause an error.
Of course, you would fix the typo. But you would also ask …
Why was the typo allowed to exist?
Wasn’t there a proofing process? Why didn’t operators who used the procedure in the past report the problem they spotted (assuming that this is the first time there was an error and the procedure had been used before)?
You might find that there is an ineffective proofing process or that the proofing process isn’t being performed. You might find that operators had previously reported the problem but it had never been fixed.
If you find there is a Generic Cause, you then have to think about all the other procedures that might have similar problems and how to fix the system problem (or problems). Of course, ideas to help you do this are included in the TapRooT® Corrective Action Helper® Guide.
So, in a major accident like the wreck of the USS Fitzgerald, there are probably multiple mistakes that were made (multiple Causal Factors), multiple root causes, some Generic Causes, and lots of corrective actions that could improve performance and stop future collisions.

Monday Accidents and Lesson Learned: Retrofitted Busses
Posted: July 24th, 2017 in Accidents
This week’s Lesson Learned isn’t necessarily coming from an accident, but from something that was caught that could have resulted in fatalities if an accident occurs. Ultimately, the lesson here is proactivity. If you’re proactive in your investigations, you can create corrective actions to prevent accidents from ever occurring.
In Russia, it was found that the seats on busses were not bolted down effectively. Although the transportation companies complied with the regulations for seat anchoring when they were manufactured, the regulations have changed due to old seat anchoring practices being unsafe. Previously, the bolts were not properly securing the seats, therefore if there was a collision, the bolts could easily be pulled from the floor allowing the passengers to be injured or even killed.
The corrective action for this proactive investigation is to inspect all public transportation vehicles and ensure that they comply with current safety regulations. If they don’t, they need to be fixed immediately.

Where did you eat last weekend?  (or, why do companies continue to not learn from their mistakes?)
Posted: July 24th, 2017 in Current Events, Human Performance, Investigations, Quality, Root Cause Analysis Tips, Root Causes, TapRooT
Happy Monday. I hope everyone had a good weekend and got recharged for the week ahead.
Every few weeks, I get a craving for Mexican food. Maybe a sit-down meal with a combo plate and a Margarita, maybe Tex-Mex or maybe traditional. It’s all good.
Sometimes, though, a simple California Style Burrito does the trick. This weekend was one of those weekends. Let’s see, what are my choices…? Moe’s, Willy’s, Qdoba, Chipotle?

Chipotle? What??!!!

Unfortunately, Chipotle is back in the news. More sick people. Rats falling from the ceiling. Not good.
It seems like we have been here before. I must admit I did not think they would survive last time, but they did. What about this time? In the current world of social media we shall see.
For those of us in safety or quality, the story is all too familiar. The same problem keeps happening. Over and Over…and Over
So why do companies continue to not learn from mistakes? A few possible reasons:
**They don’t care
**They are incompetent
**They don’t get to true root causes when investigating problems
**They write poor corrective actions
**They don’t have the systems in place for good performance or performance improvement
TapRooT® can help with the last three. Please join us at a future course; you can see the schedule and enroll HERE 
So, what do you think? Why do companies not learn from their mistakes? Leave comments below.
By the way, my Burrito from Moe’s was great!

Interviewing and Evidence Collection Tip: The #1 mistake when collecting Paper evidence
Posted: July 20th, 2017 in Investigations, Root Cause Analysis Tips
 
In TapRooT®, we use a mnemonic to quickly remember what types of evidence we may want to collect after an incident occurs: 3 Ps & an R. This stands for:
People evidence
Paper evidence
Physical evidence and
Recording evidence.
Today we are going to discuss the #1 mistake investigators make when collecting Paper evidence. Paper evidence may include all sorts of things including:

regulatory paperwork
activity specific paperwork
personnel paperwork
policy and procedure paperwork and
equipment manuals.

What do you think the biggest mistake is when it comes to collecting Paper evidence… given all of the paper that we have in our workplaces?
The #1 mistake is: Collecting too much paper that is not relevant to the investigation!
You don’t need to collect every piece of paper at your facility. How do you know what you don’t need? By looking at your SnapCharT®! You need all the paper that supports your timeline of events and supports the facts.  If you use the TapRooT® software, you can easily upload .pdfs of this paperwork and highlight relevant pages in your report to management.
Don’t make the mistake of collecting so much paper that what you need for evidence is somewhere at the bottom of the stack. Use your SnapCharT® to guide you and keep your paper evidence organized in the TapRooT® software.
To learn more about evidence collection, join me in Houston, Texas in November for a 3-day root cause analysis and evidence collection course, or just 1 day of evidence collection training.

How Long Should a Root Cause Analysis Take?
Posted: July 18th, 2017 in Accidents, Investigations, Pictures, Root Cause Analysis Tips
How long should a root cause analysis take? This is a question that I’m frequently asked. 
Of course, the answer is … It DEPENDS!
Depends on what?

How complex is the incident?
Are there complex tests that need to be performed to troubleshoot equipment issues?
Is everyone available to be interviewed?
Is there regulatory coordination/interference (for instance … do they take control of the scene or the evidence)?
How far do you want to dig into generic causes?
What level of proof do you need to support your conclusions?

However, I believe most investigations should be completed in a couple of weeks or at most a couple of months.
Now for the exceptions…
REGULATORY DELAYS: We helped facilitate a major investigation that was progressing until the regulators took the evidence. They stated that they needed it for their investigation. Their investigation dragged on for over a year. Finally, they announced their findings and released the evidence back to the company. It turned out that none of the evidence sequestered by the government had anything to do with the reason for their investigation being delayed (they were doing complex modeling and videos to demonstrate their conclusions). After about an additional two months, the company investigation was completed. The companies investigation was delayed for over a year unnecessarily. 
SLOW INVESTIGATION DELAYED BY UNCOOPERATIVE PARTICIPANTS: One of the longest root cause analyses I’ve ever seen took four years. The agency performing the investigation is notoriously slow when performing investigations but this investigation was slow even by their standards. What happened? The investigation had multiple parties that were suing each other over the accident and some of the parties would not comply with a subpoena. The agency had to take the unwilling participant to court. Eventually, the evidence was provided but it took almost a year for the process to play out.

SLOW INVESTIGATION PROCESSES: The most recent bad example is the Alison Canyon Natural Gas Storage leak root cause analysis. The investigation started when the leak was stopped 18 months ago. But the root cause analysis still is not finished. Why? Is seems the process is mired in public hearings. The spokesperson for the California Public Utilities Commission said that the “study” was in the third phase of a five phase process. What was slowing the “study” (root cause analysis and corrective actions) down? Public hearings. Here is what an article in NGI Daily Gas Prices said:
“A California Public Utilities Commission spokesperson said the study remains in the third of a five-phase process that is to take more than three years. The third phase is expected to take up to nine months, and the fourth phase more than two months, before the final phase of “integration and interpretation” of the results is issued.“
The process is scheduled to take three years! That definitely makes any kind of timely root cause analysis impossible. 
CONCLUSION: Many people complain about the time it takes for a good root cause analysis. But most excessive delays have nothing to do with the root cause analysis process that is chosen. Excessive delays are usually political, due to uncooperative participants, or regulatory red tape. 

Don’t try to save time on an investigation by picking the fastest root causes analysis tool (for example … Spin-a-Cause™), rather pick an advanced root cause analysis tool (TapRooT®) that will get you superior results in a reasonable amount of time and effort. 
One more idea…
Learn from smaller but significant incidents to avoid major accidents that have huge public relations and regulatory complications. Learning from smaller incidents can be much faster and save considerable headaches and money.

2-Day TapRooT® Analyzing and Fixing Safety Culture Issues Course
TapRooT® has always identified culture issues in accidents and incidents, but many users didn’t see the link or understand how to go about fixing cultural issues.

This course includes:

A clear definition of safety culture
An overview of various safety culture models
An organizational culture survey from Human Synergistics International designed to identify your current culture
Why it is good business to improve safety culture
The relationship between incidents and safety culture
The importance of strong safety leadership
What some organizations are doing to strengthen their safety culture
What “puzzle pieces” you need to put in place to improve your safety culture

2-Day Understanding & Stopping Human Error Course
Humans are often considered the weakest link in the industrial or occupational system.  We are often blamed when something goes wrong in the system.  However, we are also one of the most valuable links in the system if one considers our adaptability, flexibility, tolerance for inadequate feedback, and less than optimum working conditions, and our ability to compensate for wrong or inadequate instructions and expectations.   Because we are so flexible, adaptable, tolerant and capable of the use of judgment and experience, we are in fact, a blessing and a curse.  The curse means we can make decisions and take actions that the system cannot tolerate.   While we may claim to have a goal of zero injuries or incidents, we will never have zero errors.  Human error is inevitable unless we want to somehow constrain that judgment, flexibility, adaptability and tolerance.   So, our goal is to understand human error, how humans operate….what our capacities, constraints and needs are so that we can maximize performance and minimize errors.
This course is built around the goal of helping us better understand human errors (analysis, prediction and categorization) and why we make them.   More importantly, the course will cover solutions to assist attendees in their quest to minimize errors and resulting impact in their own facilities.  The tools that will be discussed can be used in conjunction with your TapRooT® findings and can be incorporated as corrective actions as determined by your root cause analysis findings.
There will be plenty of hands-on exercises included in the two-day course.   To make the course more interesting, please bring an unsolved application (error case) from your operations and we’ll try to dissect and solve it during the course.
Upon completion of the course, attendees will receive a certificate of completion and a 90-Day Subscription to TapRooT® VI, our dynamic online software that guides you through the TapRooT® process with ease and efficiency.
GUARANTEE for 2-Day Understanding & Stopping Human Error: Attend this course, go back to work, and use the techniques you have learned to stop human error. If you don’t find root causes of human error that you previously would have overlooked, and if you and your management don’t agree that the corrective actions that you recommend are much more effective, just return your course materials and we will refund the entire course fee.

2-Day Risk Assessment and Management Best Practices
Are you frustrated that the outcomes of current risk assessments being performed in your organization lack consistency, confidence, reliability and accuracy?Do facilitators and participants of the risk assessments know the most effective methods and tools? Risk Assessments are recognized as definitely needed every time any safety-related decision needs to be made without being confused and undermined by subjective beliefs, biases and risk perceptions.
Learn Best Practices in this course being offered before the Summit (or, if you can’t attend a Pre-Summit course this year, this course is also being offered in Houston, Texas and Calgary, Canada in May, 2015).
The course has been continually improved and still covers the core Best Practices to make facilitation and participation in risk assessments as accurate and reliable as possible.
As well, a number of recent improvements include:

an interactive WORD template that takes the user through the risk assessment process and when completed serves as a diligent entry to your Risk Register;
new neuroscience-based explanations of variability of individual’s risk perceptions and risk-taking; and
participants receive a USB stick of approx. 2 Gb of course handouts, copies of slides, useful reference materials and sample PPT files accumulated and developed by the Presenter over the last 30+ years of RM consultancy & training.

The presenter is Jim Whiting, international risk management expert and long-time TapRooT® Instructor. Jim was a member of the committee that wrote the international risk management standard ISO 31000, and now the USA Standard ANSI Z690.2 and CAN/CSA/ISO 31000 has enhanced the course for 2015. Jim brings his risk management and root cause analysis experience and best practices from around the world (Australia/New Zealand, North America, Asia, Africa, and Europe) to this course. If you are interested in advancing the quality of your risk assessments, then attend this course.

2-Day Effective Interviewing & Evidence Collection Course
There is so much to remember when collecting evidence … and so much to lose if you are not prepared.

Ever have trouble completing a SnapCharT® because you lacked pieces of information?
How can you be certain what to collect?
How do you help witnesses to an incident remember important facts with better accuracy?
What is an effective sequential structure for conducting an interview?

Solid evidence collection skills are critical to finding the real root causes of incidents. Evidence collection supports the investigation with facts (not opinions), and creates a clear sequence of events.  Sharpen your skills by attending training and practicing skills through hands-on exercises.
Day 1 of this 2-day course is focused on pre-planning, emergency response and collecting evidence (physical evidence, recordings and paper evidence).  Overviews of the TapRooT® investigation processes are presented to demonstrate how evidence collection fits into the TapRooT® System.   It is essential to build an accurate timeline in an investigation, so SnapCharT® basics are also reviewed on Day 1 for those who have not taken TapRooT® Root Cause Analysis Training or those who need a refresher.
Day 2 is all about collecting people evidence.  Most investigators have not had formal training on how to conduct investigative interviews, yet people evidence is crucial to solving problems; therefore, the TapRooT® 12-Step Interviewing Process is presented in depth and practiced.  This day includes how to use TapRooT® techniques like Change Analysis, and how to use the Root Cause Tree and Dictionary, essential tools for evidence collection. Finally, attendees learn how to “hear” what’s not said during an interview by de-coding non-verbal cues.

3-Day Train-the-Trainer Course
How does one become certified to teach TapRooT® to their employees?
Here is our process …
1.  Company or Site gets a License to use 2-Day TapRooT® Training Materials.
2.  Prospective Instructor (the one who wants to become a Certified TapRooT® Instructor) attends 5-Day TapRooT® Advanced Root Cause Analysis Team Leader Training. (This helps the prospective instructor learn the system and become an expert in using it.)
3.  Prospective Instructor should use TapRooT® to analyze incidents.
4.  Prospective Instructor schedules Train-the-Trainer Course (calls contact at SI – 865-539-2139).
5.  Prospective Instructor studies 2-Day course instructor notes (part of the license package that they receive when they license the 2-Day TapRooT® Training Materials).
6.  System Improvements ships the materials to be used in the 2-Day course.
7.  On the day before the 2-day course that they will be teaching, one of System Improvements’ instructors will arrive to work with the Prospective Instructor. The Prospective Instructor will dry run the sections of the course that they plan to teach over the next two days (they will teach approximately 50% of the course). The System Improvements TapRooT® Instructor will provide them feedback on their teaching and tips to improve the delivery of the material.
8.  The Prospective Instructor and the System Improvements TapRooT® Instructor will work to together to teach the 2-Day course. The Prospective Instructor teach about 50% of the course (or 2/3 of the course if two instructors are certifying). The System Improvements Instructor provides the Prospective Instructor with feedback at the end of each day to improve their delivery of the materials.
9.  At the end of the 1-day prep and 2-day course, the Prospective Instructor becomes a Certified TapRooT® Instructor. They will receive a Certified TapRooT® Instructor Plaque after the course.
10.  To maintain their certification, the Certified TapRooT® Instructor must attend advanced TapRooT® Training prior to the TapRooT® Summit and the TapRooT® Summit at least once every two years.

Advanced Causal Development Course
After reviewing many reports from students that have attended training, we see problems defining causal factors. This course will provide alternate definitions of causal factors, relate risk to causal factors, cover common problems with defining causal factors, use the “should have, would have or could have” test and relate causal factors to the hierarchy of the TapRooT® process. Many case studies will be used including some recent major events. Students will be asked to bring a case study of their own defining the incident, a brief discussion of what happened and the causal factors they picked. Individuals that have attended Advanced TapRooT® Techniques Courses at past Summits will find a lot of repeat (about 50%) information. Participants are required to have received previous TapRooT® training to attend this course.
Upon completion of the course, attendees will receive a certificate of completion and a 90-Day Subscription to TapRooT® VI, our dynamic online software that guides you through the TapRooT® process with ease and efficiency.
GUARANTEE for Advanced Causal Development Course:  Attend this course, go back to work, and use what you have learned.  If you don’t find you are developing causal factors more effectively, just return your course materials and we will refund the entire course fee.

TapRooT® for Audits
TapRooT® is the best method for performing investigations and doing root cause analysis. But wouldn’t it be better if you never had to do the investigations in the first place? Of course, and that is why auditing is so important.
Sadly, most companies take the time and resources to do audits but do not get the desired results. Why? Because corrective actions are developed without proper root cause analysis. That is where TapRooT® comes in.
TapRooT® can be used to perform root cause analysis on any problem, so why not find the problem and do root cause analysis before these problems manifest themselves into incidents? We decided to develop a course for auditors and audit participants to see how TapRooT® works with audits. Regardless of your role in the audit process, you must understand the entire TapRooT® process to be effective, so this course is for anyone involved in auditing, from auditors themselves, to auditees, to management who is responsible for improvements.
DAY ONE

TapRooT® Process Introduction and Initial Audit
SnapCharT® and Exercise
Significant Issues and Exercise
Root Cause Tree® and Exercise
Generic Causes
Corrective Actions and Exercise

DAY TWO

The Root Cause Tree® and Preparing for Audits with Root Cause Exercise

Upon completion of the course, attendees will receive a certificate of completion and a 90-Day Subscription to TapRooT® VI, our dynamic online software that guides you through the TapRooT® process with ease and efficiency.
GUARANTEE for TapRooT® for Audits:  Attend this course, go back to work, and use what you have learned.  If you don’t find root causes that you previously would have overlooked and if you and your management don’t agree that the corrective actions that you recommend are much more effective, just return your course materials and we will refund the entire course fee.
