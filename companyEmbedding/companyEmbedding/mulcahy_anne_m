Anne Mulcahy: The Keys to Turnaround at Xerox  





LeadershipWrittenAnne Mulcahy: The Keys to Turnaround at XeroxThe Xerox CEO discusses the importance of honest communication, cost cutting, and "not taking a dollar out of the research and development budget."December 1, 2004|by
Lisa Vollmer



Email

When Anne Mulcahy was named CEO of Xerox Corp. in 2001, many people were surprised — but no one was more surprised than Mulcahy herself. "I took on this position feeling equal parts excitement and dread," she recalled. On the day that her appointment to CEO was announced, the stock dropped 15 percent. "That was a real confidence builder," she joked.
Addressing a packed auditorium as part of the 2004-05 "View From The Top" speaker series, Mulcahy described the strategy behind the company's return to profitability, or — as it was dubbed by Money magazine — "the great turnaround story of the post-crash era."
Mulcahy candidly admitted that she had never planned on becoming the CEO, let alone one who was expected to reverse the company's fortunes after a sustained period of underperformance. Although she had been at Xerox for 24 years when she was appointed to the role, she had spent 16 of those years in sales, and much of her remaining tenure as the head of human resources and the chief of staff for former CEO Paul Allaire.
"I certainly hadn't been groomed to become a CEO," Mulcahy said. "I didn't have a very sophisticated financial background, and I had to make up for my lack of formal training. I had to make up for it with intense on-the-job learning."
That was an understatement. When Mulcahy took the helm in 2001, Xerox was teetering on the verge of Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company had over $17 billion in debt and had recorded losses in each of the preceding six years. A recent reorganization of the company's sales force had not gone according to plan. Customers were unhappy and the economy had started to falter. On top of all of that, Xerox found itself in the middle of a protracted investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission of accounting improprieties in its Mexico unit. "I like to say that we were 'early adopters' of SEC scandal," Mulcahy joked.
From the beginning, Mulcahy and her team devised a bold plan for recovery. Almost immediately, she addressed the company's liquidity issues and quickly raised $2.5 billion in cash. Through a "back to basics" approach and a renewed focus on operational efficiency, the company cut its capital expenditures by 50 percent; reduced its sales, general, and administrative expenses by one-third; and slashed its total debt in half. All the while, Xerox strengthened its core business by maintaining an organization-wide focus on innovation. "Even with all of the cost cutting we did, we didn't take a dollar out of research and development," Mulcahy said.
Mulcahy said that effective communication was perhaps the single most important component of the company's successful turnaround strategy. "I feel like my title should be Chief Communication Officer, because that's really what I do," she said, emphasizing the importance of listening to customers and employees. "When I became CEO, I spent the first 90 days on planes traveling to various offices and listening to anyone who had a perspective on what was wrong with the company. I think if you spend as much time listening as talking, that's time well spent."
In addition to soliciting honest feedback, Mulcahy said both honesty and confidence are critical to effective communication, especially during times of crisis. "When your organization is struggling, you have to give people the sense that you know what's happening and that you have a strategy to fix it. Beyond that, you have to tell people what they can do to help." In return, Mulcahy accepted nothing less than total support from her executive team — or from any other Xerox employee. "I gave people a choice to make: Either roll up your sleeves and go to work or leave Xerox." Her no-nonsense, no-holds-barred approach left her with a dedicated workforce uniquely aligned around a common set of objectives.
Even when Mulcahy wondered if her aggressive turnaround plan would work, the resilience and optimism of Xerox employees fueled her resolve — and her vision. When employees asked her to describe what Xerox would look like when it emerged from the turnaround, Mulcahy initially was incredulous. "I would think to myself, 'Why aren't you asking me whether or not we're going to make it?'" Nonetheless, she committed her vision of the company's future to paper: not with a traditional vision statement, but with a fictitious Wall Street Journal article describing Xerox in the year 2005. "We outlined the things we hoped to accomplish as though we had already achieved them," said Mulcahy. "We included performance metrics — even quotes from Wall Street analysts. It was really our vision of what we wanted the company to become."
Xerox has gone a long way to making its vision a reality. "Looking back on the article now, I'd say we've already accomplished about 80 percent of things we set out to do," she said.
When a student in the audience asked Mulcahy what keeps her up at night these days, her response reflected both her honesty and her resolve. "I think I am more motivated by fear of failure than a desire to succeed," she admitted. "My experience at Xerox has taught me that crisis is a very powerful motivator. It forces you to make choices that you probably wouldn't have made otherwise. It intensifies your focus, your competitiveness, your relentless desire to attain best-in-class status. I want to do everything I can to make sure that we don't lose that now that we're back on track."

Anne Mulcahy: She's Here to Fix the Xerox


                    Can Anne Mulcahy pull off an IBM-style makeover?
                




August 6, 2001, 12:00 AM EDT








 If Anne M. Mulcahy ever does manage to save Xerox Corp. (XRX
      ), then surely June 14 will look like a turning point. Mulcahy, president and CEO-in-waiting, flew from headquarters in Stamford, Conn., to Rochester, N.Y., the home of Xerox' big operations, to deliver devastating news. The company was killing its entire line of desktop inkjet printers--a one-year-old business that employed 1,500 people worldwide and had been championed by Mulcahy herself. The division would not turn a profit for at least two years, though, and Xerox needed cash now. "In a year of tough decisions, this one was toughest," Mulcahy says.
Tough hardly does justice to the year. Xerox' directors suddenly promoted Mulcahy to president in May, 2000, after ousting G. Richard Thoman, who lasted all of 13 months, and reinstalling Chairman Paul A. Allaire as CEO. The company was close to foundering after years of weak sales and high costs; employees were as disgruntled as customers. Then things went from bad to worse: In October, Xerox reported its first quarterly loss in 16 years. Debt was piling up. And the Securities & Exchange Commission began investigating whether Xerox used accounting tricks to boost income.
Little in Mulcahy's past experience as vice-president for human resources and chief staff officer to Allaire had tested her in this kind of crisis management. But she has impressed Xerox' directors as a decisive leader. People close to Mulcahy, 48, expect she'll soon be named CEO. "It's a huge jump from senior executive to the chief executive slot," says Xerox director Ralph Larsen, who heads Johnson & Johnson. But, he adds, "she has the strategic mind and toughness to serve as CEO." (On July 26, Mulcahy was named CEO of Xerox.)








BOXED IN. No doubt this will be a closely watched handover. After all, it was Allaire's botched succession planning that brought Xerox to the low place it is today. Not only must Mulcahy continue to shore up morale after Thoman's disastrous sales-force reorganization, she also has to cut $1 billion from annual costs. And that's just to get Xerox to the point where she can make some real changes. Mulcahy believes--as do most analysts--that Xerox shouldn't be content just selling copiers, or "boxes" in company lingo. It has to focus on "solutions" that let corporations scan, store, and print digital documents tailored to their needs. But the old guard is still resistant. To succeed, she'll have to do away with more than the inkjet printers.
Some people don't think she's up to it. Skeptics say Mulcahy belongs to the old guard herself, a veteran Xeroid who started 25 years ago selling copiers. They regard her as part of a past that weighs heavily on Xerox: a culture paralyzed by politics and earlier success. Moreover, Xerox is family to Mulcahy: Her husband is a retired sales manager, and her brother Thomas J. Dolan is head of the Global Solutions Group. "The good news or the bad news is she has the soul of Xerox. The risk is, maybe she's too close to it," says a consultant and Xerox adviser. Mulcahy, though, says she's ready to shake up the culture: "There needs to be far more innovation and receptivity to new ideas. I have very little time for endless debate and consensus."
Today, she has reestablished some sense of trust between employees and management. No one talks about bankruptcy anymore, and Xerox' operations are mending steadily. Operating losses in the first quarter--typically Xerox' toughest--were far narrower than expected. Second-quarter losses contained no similar surprise, coming in as forecast. Still, the company faces enormous troubles, even if it returns to profitability in the second half, as it promises. Its bonds are rated junk by Moody's Investors Service, and it is still struggling to conserve cash and pay down its huge debt--a $7 billion loan is due next year.




CHEERLEADER. Mulcahy, who spoke briefly with BusinessWeek, is a hugely popular manager with years of experience dealing with customers. But she hasn't been involved in product development, and she doesn't have Allaire's financial expertise. What got her the job of president--and the chance to prove herself ready to be CEO--was her smart decision-making as head of Xerox' $6 billion division for small office equipment. She put together one of Xerox' biggest acquisitions, the $925 million purchase of Tektronix Inc.'s (TEK
      ) color-printing division, now a source of fast-growing revenues. As important, she proved fiercely protective of Tektronix' autonomy and even adopted some of its business practices. "The people who felt the most change were from Xerox, who said, `Wait, I thought we acquired them,"' says Gerald K. Perkel, a Tektronix veteran who is now a Xerox senior vice-president.
As president, Mulcahy has been chief cheerleader in a company where executives usually keep to themselves. During her first three months, she crisscrossed the country, holding nearly two dozen meetings with employees. She even promised to fly anywhere, anytime to help salespeople close tough deals.




Then, when Xerox' financial situation worsened last September, the company was forced to take drastic action. With Allaire fixated on repairing the balance sheet, Mulcahy focused on operations, promising to slash $1 billion from Xerox' annual costs. She's more than halfway there. Some 8,600 middle managers and factory workers have been let go; she tries to make the announcements in person. And she said she'll reduce high manufacturing costs, which have put Xerox at a decided disadvantage to competitors such as Canon Inc. (CAJ
      ), by $200 million. Xerox has not disclosed how close it is to that goal. Indeed, only three years ago it tried to cut $1 billion, but never got there.
Meanwhile, Mulcahy spreads her message with a regular memo called "Turnaround Talk," which alternates between enthusiasm ("Together We Can Do It!") and pragmatism ("When we shut off the bottled water, it's not because we want to be mean-spirited. It's because all these little expenses...can spell the difference between losing money and turning a profit").
Mulcahy has raised the energy level at Xerox. A big Bruce Springsteen fan, she's also a real gym rat. Mulcahy grew up in a Long Island (N.Y.) household with four brothers; her father was an editor in a publishing firm, and her mother took care of the kids. Now her mom looks after her two teenage sons when she is away, which is often, since Mulcahy is usually on the road three days a week. She doesn't mind traveling, even to hear criticism from employees. But they better be prepared to hear some back. "She doesn't sugarcoat it," says Perkel.
Today the company bills Mulcahy as "the future of Xerox." To her, at least, that means a Xerox that looks more like IBM (IBM
      ), offering services to help businesses manage their vast cache of documents. Paul A. Ricci, chairman of software maker ScanSoft Inc. (table
      ) and a former Xerox exec, says Mulcahy's push toward an IBM model makes sense: "What Anne's doing is smart, which is to compete in the places where Xerox is strong." That is, in large corporations.
Of course, this isn't the first time Xerox has attempted an IBM-like makeover. Thoman couldn't manage it, despite the fact he learned from the master at IBM, Louis V. Gerstner Jr. And the company has been trying to transform itself for two decades. So why would Mulcahy succeed? "It's the Nixon-in-China phenomenon," says David A. Nadler, chairman of Mercer Delta Consulting. "No one doubts her motives." Thoman, after all, was an outsider. Plus, Xerox has never been in as dire a condition as it is now.

So maybe it will take a Xeroid to dispose of the toxic parts of the company's culture that have made it so resistant to change. "There's an all-out battle going on between boxes and solutions," says James W. Lundy, a Gartner Group Inc. consultant and ex-Xeroid. Mulcahy is blunt about wanting her salespeople to learn to sell services, too. "It's the ability to walk and chew gum," she says. "We can't be [just] the giant copier company." Ditto that.

Early life and education[edit]
Mulcahy was born in Rockville Centre, New York on October 21, 1952. She received a B.A. in English and Journalism from Marymount College of Fordham University in Tarrytown, New York.[3]
Career at Xerox[edit]
Mulcahy joined Xerox as a field sales representative in 1976 and rose through the ranks. From 1992-1995, Mulcahy was vice president for human resources, responsible for compensation, benefits, human resource strategy, labor relations, management development and employee training. She became chief staff officer in 1997 and corporate senior vice president in 1998. Prior to that, she served as vice president and staff officer for Customer Operations, covering South America and Central America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and China. Though never intent on running Xerox, she was selected by the board of directors in 2001. Later in her tenure, she cut the workforce by 30% and eliminated the desktop portion of Xerox.[citation needed]
When she became CEO on Aug 1, 2001 the stock price was $8.25, and on Jan 1, 2002 when she became chairwoman the stock price was $10.05. On May 21, 2009, the day she announced her retirement as CEO, the stock price was $6.82.[citation needed]
Mulcahy served on four other Boards of Directors besides Xerox. She also served on Catalyst, Citigroup, Fuji Xerox and Target Corp. A letter sent to Citi shareholders on March 26, 2009 by the labor union, American Federation of State County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), recommended shareholders vote against re-electing six of their directors[4]
Magazine Opinion[edit]
The Wall Street Journal named Mulcahy one of 50 women to watch in 2005 and Forbes magazine ranked her at the sixth position among the Most Powerful Women in America in 2005. In 2009, she was ranked 15th.[5] In 2008, she was selected by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Leaders.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Mulcahy was born in Rockville Centre, New York on October 21, 1952. She received a B.A. in English and Journalism from Marymount College of Fordham University in Tarrytown, New York.[3]
Career at Xerox[edit]
Mulcahy joined Xerox as a field sales representative in 1976 and rose through the ranks. From 1992-1995, Mulcahy was vice president for human resources, responsible for compensation, benefits, human resource strategy, labor relations, management development and employee training. She became chief staff officer in 1997 and corporate senior vice president in 1998. Prior to that, she served as vice president and staff officer for Customer Operations, covering South America and Central America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and China. Though never intent on running Xerox, she was selected by the board of directors in 2001. Later in her tenure, she cut the workforce by 30% and eliminated the desktop portion of Xerox.[citation needed]
When she became CEO on Aug 1, 2001 the stock price was $8.25, and on Jan 1, 2002 when she became chairwoman the stock price was $10.05. On May 21, 2009, the day she announced her retirement as CEO, the stock price was $6.82.[citation needed]
Mulcahy served on four other Boards of Directors besides Xerox. She also served on Catalyst, Citigroup, Fuji Xerox and Target Corp. A letter sent to Citi shareholders on March 26, 2009 by the labor union, American Federation of State County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), recommended shareholders vote against re-electing six of their directors[4]
Magazine Opinion[edit]
The Wall Street Journal named Mulcahy one of 50 women to watch in 2005 and Forbes magazine ranked her at the sixth position among the Most Powerful Women in America in 2005. In 2009, she was ranked 15th.[5] In 2008, she was selected by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Leaders.[6]

Early life and education[edit]
Mulcahy was born in Rockville Centre, New York on October 21, 1952. She received a B.A. in English and Journalism from Marymount College of Fordham University in Tarrytown, New York.[3]
Career at Xerox[edit]
Mulcahy joined Xerox as a field sales representative in 1976 and rose through the ranks. From 1992-1995, Mulcahy was vice president for human resources, responsible for compensation, benefits, human resource strategy, labor relations, management development and employee training.

Early life and education[edit]
Mulcahy was born in Rockville Centre, New York on October 21, 1952. She received a B.A. in English and Journalism from Marymount College of Fordham University in Tarrytown, New York.[3]
Career at Xerox[edit]
Mulcahy joined Xerox as a field sales representative in 1976 and rose through the ranks. From 1992-1995, Mulcahy was vice president for human resources, responsible for compensation, benefits, human resource strategy, labor relations, management development and employee training. She became chief staff officer in 1997 and corporate senior vice president in 1998. Prior to that, she served as vice president and staff officer for Customer Operations, covering South America and Central America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and China. Though never intent on running Xerox, she was selected by the board of directors in 2001. Later in her tenure, she cut the workforce by 30% and eliminated the desktop portion of Xerox.[citation needed]
When she became CEO on Aug 1, 2001 the stock price was $8.25, and on Jan 1, 2002 when she became chairwoman the stock price was $10.05. On May 21, 2009, the day she announced her retirement as CEO, the stock price was $6.82.[citation needed]
Mulcahy served on four other Boards of Directors besides Xerox. She also served on Catalyst, Citigroup, Fuji Xerox and Target Corp. A letter sent to Citi shareholders on March 26, 2009 by the labor union, American Federation of State County & Municipal Employees (AFSCME), recommended shareholders vote against re-electing six of their directors[4]
Magazine Opinion[edit]
The Wall Street Journal named Mulcahy one of 50 women to watch in 2005 and Forbes magazine ranked her at the sixth position among the Most Powerful Women in America in 2005. In 2009, she was ranked 15th.[5] In 2008, she was selected by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's Best Leaders.[6]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Employees are a company's greatest asset - they're your competitive advantage. You want to attract and retain the best; provide them with encouragement, stimulus, and make them feel that they are an integral part of the company's mission.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Best,
Greatest,
Employees



















Employees who believe that management is concerned about them as a whole person - not just an employee - are more productive, more satisfied, more fulfilled. Satisfied employees mean satisfied customers, which leads to profitability.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Management,
Believe
























I have zero tolerance for people who don't come completely prepared. I expect contribution, I expect attendance, and I expect directors to take trips and visit the company's programs.
Anne M. Mulcahy


People,
Company,
Tolerance

Leadership,
Growth,
Goal

Anne M. Mulcahy


Love,
Live,
You



















We're long past having to defend or explain why women should be on boards, given all the data that shows how companies with female as well as male directors perform better. It's unfortunate when companies with a large percentage of women constituents don't reflect that in their boardrooms.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Women,
Past,
Data

Anne M. Mulcahy


Choices,
You,
Invest



















Not everybody is created equal, and it's important for companies to identify those high potentials and treat them differently, accelerate their development and pay them more. That process is so incredibly important to developing first-class leadership in a company.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Leadership,
Treat,
Process



















By the time I stepped down as Xerox's CEO in 2009 - and as chairman in January 2010 - Xerox had become the vibrant, profitable and revitalized company that it still is today. What made the difference was a strong turnaround plan, dedicated people and a firm commitment from company leaders.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Time,
Today,
Strong



















Whenever an earthquake or tsunami takes thousands of innocent lives, a shocked world talks of little else. I'll never forget the wrenching days I spent in Haiti last year for Save the Children just weeks after the earthquake.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Children,
World,
Forget



















If we could muster the same determination and sense of responsibility that saves a country like Japan - or a company like Xerox - then investing to save women and children who are dying in the developing world would be very good business.

Business,
Women,
Children
























Entire families work for Xerox.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Work,
Xerox,
Entire



















I learned how to be a learner. When you get in a job, the tendency is to say, 'I've got to know it. I've got to give direction to others. I'm in this job because I'm better and smarter.' I always took a different view, that the key was to identify the people who really knew and learn from them.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Job,
Learn,
Know



















My dad was an editor and a writer, and that's actually what I aspired to be.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Dad,
Writer,
Editor



















I worked in sales. It was definable, it had a quantifiable approach to accomplishment that had a great deal of importance to me. It had a degree of clarity that I loved. And of course, it was core.
Anne M. Mulcahy


Great,
Accomplishment,
Sales



















We're living in a different world now in terms of employee needs, and companies have to offer alternative methods for getting the work done. Even under the most difficult circumstances you can have creative flexibility.

Work,
World,
Creative
