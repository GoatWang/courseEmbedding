UNIVERSAL HOSE CLAMPS


 
 
 
Ideal for temporary or permanent applications on circular or irregularly-shaped objects. Its smooth band helps eliminate damage to hoses. Made of high-strength, corrosion resistant material. The vibration resistant, self-locking design will not loosen or slip under demanding operation conditions. No special tools are required for installation. The Voss Universal Hose Clamp permits reduced inventories since one size covers a range of diameters with a minimum diameter of 11/16 in. for all clamps.




SPECIAL PURPOSE BAND CLAMPS


Voss special purpose band clamps can be supplied with flared liners to protect the surface, as well as polymer or elastomer extrusion. Available to OEM, MIL/MS/AS and NSN/FSN Ordnance specifications. Contact the Voss sales department for available sizes and materials for these special purpose band clamps.

SPRING-LOADED BAND CLAMPS



Voss Spring-Loaded Band Clamps are used primarily in hose applications that are subject to repeated temperature changes that cause the hose and clamp to change diameter. Standard clamps have to be loosened and retightened to compensate for the expansion and contraction of components.
The Voss Spring-Loaded Band Clamp increases or decreases clamping diameter as the hose expands or contracts. Clamps are available in various spring rates, materials and diameters.










To help prevent damage to hose, spring-loaded band clamps can also be supplied with a formed floating bridge. This prevents the "pinching" of hose material beneath the latch and allows independent movement of the band loops during tensioning.



APPLICATIONS


Spring-loaded band clamps are recommended for critical hose leakage applications, to prevent "cold flow" of soft silicone hoses and extreme thermal expansion applications. Used on air intake, coolant and turbochargers on truck, bus, construction, marine, agricultural engines and equipment.




V-RETAINER COUPLINGS


No other single manufacturer offers as wide a range of V-retainer couplings as Voss–from economical stamped V-retainer couplings used on low-pressure pumps, to special machined couplings used on jet turbine engines. Voss V-Retainer Couplings are generally used to hold V-shaped flanges together and are available in any diameter starting at 1.5 inch, and in hundreds of profile, latch and material combinations. Contact our sales application department for complete details.






Voss V-Band Couplings are available in an extensive variety of cross sections and shapes with numerous latch styles. Designed for light, moderate and heavy-duty service in a variety of conditions, including corrosive environments and temperatures up to 1200°F. Information given on these pages pertain to V-band couplings with sheet metal retainers. However, when size and/or strength requirements are extreme, v-retainer segments can be machined.




Voss Rigid V-Couplings and mating machined flanges are used with resilient, all-metal seals on aircraft bleed air distribution ducting for de-icing and air-driven motors and pumps plus environmental control systems on both commercial and military aircraft.
Rigid V-couplings and mating machined flanges are used with all metallic seals in a variety of profiles.




Voss 1- or 2-segment stamped V-retainer couplings are economical and durable and are designed for low- to moderately high-pressure applications on sheet metal or machined flanges where frequent disassembly is not required. Typical applications are diesel exhaust systems, airbrake diaphragm bodies, pump bodies, and plastic-lined piping.

V-Flanges
 
Voss Industries has been manufacturing V-flanges almost as long as we have been manufacturing couplings. Flanges became a major product line when Voss Aerospace Division began manufacturing sheet metal and machined flanges for the aerospace industry in the 1980s. These flanges are accepted and standardized by all of the world's major airframe, jet engine and component manufacturers. Voss flanges are available to many other industries such as ground transportation, marine, food and chemical processing. Voss flanges are available in various sizes and materials.











Sheet Metal Flanges
 
Sheet metal flanges are an economical
alternative for low- to medium-pressure
industrial and aerospace applications.
Voss sheet metal flanges are designed
for joint sealing without the need for gaskets.
 
 
Manufacturing
Sheet metal flanges can be manufactured by stamping, roll forming and by axial-load bulge forming. Bulge forming offers minimal material thinning and a uniformly flat sealing surface.
 
Typical Configurations
 
 
 
 
 
 
Installation and Alignment
Voss sheet metal flanges are designed and fabricated for easy attachment to duct ends by welding. They may be supplied oversized for slip-on and seam welding, or tube-sized for butt welding. Since sheet metal flanges do not have a pilot surface, alignment during installation is critical for optimum performance.
 
Sizes
Bulge-formed flanges are normally available in diameters from 1 inch through 10 inches.
 
Roll-formed flanges are more economical and available for all diameters over 8 inches, and have a single weld.
 
Materials
Production versatility and manufacturing skills enable Voss to supply sheet metal flanges in a variety of materials to meet all ducting joint operating conditions.
 
Material/Temp. Range

Donald Voss Obituary

Donald J. Voss, 89, husband of Rose (Pinto) Voss of Rowley, and Jensen Beach, Fla., died Tuesday, July 18, 2017, in the Anna Jaques Hospital, Newburyport following his brief illness.
In addition to his wife Rose of 56 years, he is survived by his daughter, Jacqueline V. Lees and her husband Paul Lees of Rowley; three grandchildren, Olivia Rose, Rachel Anne and P.J. Lees all of Rowley, and many nephews and nieces.
He was the brother of the late Robert and Edward Voss, Jennie Hunt and Mary Burgarella all formerly of West Haven, Conn.
Born April 21, 1928, in West Haven, Conn., son of the late Jackion C. and Jennie (Triano) Voss, Don was also raised in that city, attending and graduating high school there.
He began working with his father as a carpenter briefly and then joined the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Union Local 24 in 1945 where he earned a Life Time Member Designation after 50 years.
He served as the Treasurer of Local 24 for many years. Don’s strong affiliation with the union bred his commitment to ensure he and his family bought American made products.
Don served in as a seaman in the Merchant Marines in the early 1950s. He was proud of his service and often told his family stories of his time at sea; many of which included how he stole into the kitchen at night to sneak ice cream from the cook’s locked freezer; an offense worthy of court martial.
He often engaged in serious and dangerous work on the ship but made a point of telling the lightest of tales to his family; an indication of his ever-present optimism.
In 1960, he met Rose. Once they decided to marry, they began to build their home on Voss Road in West Haven. Don’s father was a general contractor who wanted his children to live close and gave each child a lot of land.
Don and Rose built their house amidst Don’s family. The house he built was one of his proudest achievements even in the face of his work life as a master carpenter and millwright who built power plants, hospitals and bridges.
Don and Rose raised their only child, Jackie, in West Haven. While living in West Haven, Don served as a member of the West Haven Planning and Zoning Commission and as the volunteer fire chief of the West Haven Fire Department. He still carried his badge in the car if he ever “got stopped.”
After he retired, Rose and Don spent many years at Nettles Island, Florida, where they enjoyed a robust social life.
There were many afternoons in those early years lingering with friends on the dock, visiting and at the pool. Don joined the men’s club and fishing club at Nettles Island and often helped at the infamous fish fry on the Grand Canal.
In 1996, Rose and Don moved from Connecticut to Rowley, and built an in-law apartment annexed to Jackie and Paul’s house.
In Rowley, they were an integral part of all aspects of Jackie and Paul’s life. Don was passionate about his family and instilled a strong family commitment.
Don’s grandchildren were lucky to have lived with him their whole life and everyone looked forward to family dinners every night and a mean game of cards.
Don was passionate about hunting, history and reading. He also took pride in what his family called his corny jokes and had a very dry sense of humor.
Don could fix anything, figure out how anything worked, and was generous with his skill and effort. He was gentle, compassionate, intuitive, wise and patient.
His funeral will be held 10 a.m. Monday, July 24 from the Whittier-Porter Funeral Home, 6 High Street, Ipswich followed by the 11 a.m. Funeral Mass of Christian Burial in St. Mary’s Church, 202 Main St., Rowley.
Family and friends are respectfully welcomed. Visiting hours will be Sunday 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.
Memorial contributions in his name may be made to the Endicott Team at Partners HealthCare at Home; Development Office 1575 Cambridge Street, 5th Floor Cambridge, MA 02138. (617) 952-6880.
