UCANN History 
The Company’s Chief Executive and Chief Technical Officers have been involved with medical cannabis since it was permissible in California in 1999, turning their focus to Colorado during the infancy stage of legalizing medical cannabis in 2009. With the benefit of more than 30 years’ combined experience, United Cannabis has accumulated an extensive knowledgebase across the spectrum of the cannabis industry, including engineered facilities, security, regulatory compliance, genetics, cultivation, good manufacturing practices (GMP), proprietary extraction methods, branding, retail operations (SOP), marketing and wholesale distribution.
Once cannabis was approved for medical use in Colorado, the team began working closely with patients who were finding relief from a variety of chronic conditions and disease, in order to optimize their results. The results were extremely encouraging, as indicated by patient testimonials. With success, the patient base grew, providing more data, and in turn, evidence for the effectiveness of particular therapies. These cannabinoid sequencing protocols serve as the basis for United Cannabis’ Prana Bio Nutrient Medicinals and A.C.T. Now Programs.
Accredited with observational data from more than 15,000 patients to date, the Company’s success with Prana Bio Nutrients and A.C.T. Now Program garnered significant attention within the medical community, including Brent Reynolds Ph.D, William Yarosh Ph.D, and Dr. Barry Bialek  (listed below) who went on to join the United Cannabis Medical Advisory Board
United Cannabis remains dedicated to advancing the use of cannabinoids in medicine with a focus on the refinement of genetics for medical grade strains of CBD-rich cannabis plants. The Company is also steadfast in its mission to bring best practices to the industry across all aspects of operation, planning, products, governance and patient care.

Mr. Blackmon is currently an owner and the master grower at RiverRock Colorado and is responsible for the production, processing, workflow management, JIT inventory control, security, staffing, training and recruiting.

Jon Sawyer (Securities Counsel)
Jon Sawyer’s practice emphasizes Securities and Corporate Law. Sawyer served three years with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s regional office in Denver where he represented the Commission in civil and administrative enforcement actions. He participated as co-counsel with Assistant United States Attorneys in the prosecution of a criminal enforcement matter and he reviewed filings for Public Securities Offerings.

Jon graduated from the University of Wyoming (BS, Statistics, 1968) ; (J.D. 1974) ; Bar Admissions: Wyoming, 1974, Colorado, 1977.

Brent A. Reynolds, Ph.D. (Chief Medical Advisor)
Brent A. Reynolds, Ph.D., attended the University of Calgary, where he received his M.Sc. and Ph.D. in 1989 and 1994, respectively. While working on his Ph.D. thesis Reynolds co-discovered the existence of stem cells in the adult mammalian brain, a finding that overcame a century old dogma that the mature brain did not have the capacity to repair itself. After graduating, Reynolds co‑founded the first neural stem cell company, NeuroSpheres, Ltd., where he was a director and vice president of research. Here he developed a strong patent portfolio in the neural stem cell field, developing and protecting protocols related to the application of stem cell technology in brain repair. Today, these patents and technology have been licensed to numerous biotechnology companies that are testing the efficacy in over half a dozen clinical trials for diseases such as spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and pediatric disorders.  After a brief hiatus, where Reynolds studied and practiced Traditional Chinese Medicine, he returned to industry working with StemCell Technologies in Vancouver, Canada. In 2004, Reynolds returned to academic science as a professor at the Queensland Brain Institute at the University of Queensland in Australia where he continued refining the application of neural stem cells for repairing the damaged brain.  In 2008, Reynolds was recruited to the department of Neurosurgery at the University of Florida and has focused his efforts on studying aggressive pediatric and adult brain cancer and developing novel translational approaches to combat this lethal disease. Working with a multidisciplinary group of scientists, the team is taking the unique approach that cancer can be managed as a chronic disease by applying the principles that have been used in ecology to manage wildlife and pest populations. Based on the lessons learned over the past 80 years by ecologists, the team is focused on using multimodal low toxicity therapeutics to enforce a stable tumor population that exists below a threshold that has any harmful effects.  Dr. Reynolds has more than 60 publications, including papers in Science, Cell and Nature, with several manuscripts receiving over 1,000 citations. In addition, he is an inventor on 18 granted US patents.  Dr. Reynolds is currently a professor in the department of neurosurgery at UF; adjunct professor at the University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia; an honorary professor at the Queensland Brain Institute, Australia; and program director for StepAhead, Australia. NIH, NHMRC and numerous foundations have funded his lab.
Barry Bialek MD. (Medical Advisor)
Dr. Barry Bialek is a dual citizen of the USA and Canada. He received his BA Math & General Science, and his teaching certification for Secondary Education in 1974. He received his MD, Doctor of Medicine from George Washington University in 1985, and did his residency in family and community medicine at Wellesley Hospital, University of Toronto. Dr. Bialek did his fellowship in Obstetrics Mt. Sinai Hospital, University of Toronto. He was a lecturer from 93’ – 96’, Division of Emergency Medicine Department of Family & Community Medicine, University of Toronto School of Medicine. He later went on from 1999 – 2007 as the Clinical Assistant Professor, Department of Family Medicine, at the University of Arizona.
