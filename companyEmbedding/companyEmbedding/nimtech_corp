Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten basis: no minimum number of
shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The offering price per
share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of proceeds assuming the
sale of 33%, 66% and 100% respectively of the securities offered for sale by the
Company. There is no assurance that we will raise the full $90,000 as
anticipated.

Percentage of shares sold                33%       66$     100%

Other expenses                         $   100   $   800   $ 1,700

The above figures represent only estimated costs. We will establish a separate
bank account and all proceeds will be deposited into that account. If necessary,
Badria Alhussin, our president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the
company funds to complete the registration process. Also, these loans would be
necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be sufficient to implement
our business plan and maintain reporting status and quotation on the OTC
Electronic Bulletin Board. Mrs. Alhussin will not be repaid from the proceeds of
this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Mrs. Alhussin. Our director will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate revenues to pay the obligation.


Many obstacles exist in entering the market of paper dishware, and our
competition is significantly high. There are many local and international
companies providing a similar product. We will be in direct competition with
them. Many of these companies have a greater and wider client base than we do.
We may potentially lose our business because of such companies. Moreover, many
of these companies will be able to offer better prices for similar products,
which may cause us to lose potential clients.

Nimtech Corp has entered the market. We have signed a contract with Paul
Cafeteria and received payment for first consignment of products in January 23,
2015 in amount of $1,925. We also have signed a new contract with PANDA DIS
TICARET LTD and we have several more companies ready to sign agreements with us.
We have started the manufacture process and now we will became one of many paper
cup manufacturers. Almost every our competitor has significantly more financial
resources, as well as experience and management skills. Therefore, we are in a
competitively unfavorable position to produce such a product and become a
successful company in the paper cup production and supply industry. Therefore,
Nimtech Corp. may possibly not become strong in this market.


Company Description
Nimtech Corp was incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 4, 2014. We are 
a development-stage company formed to manufacture  paper  cups  using automatic
paper cup forming achines. To the date, we have developed a 12-month business 
plan, have  purchased one paper cup forming  machine 


 ATW-ZB318, and signed the 
lease agreement as of January 8, 2014 coming into force March 1, 2015 for the 
term of 2 years with  Ismail Kaya in Istanbul, Turkey, where we will locate our 
paper cup forming machine. Nimtech Corp intends to position themselves as a 
high-quality manufacturer of paper cups.

Our Company is looking into expanding its business in major cities of Turkey.

To date, we have entered into one contract for sales of our products with Paul
Cafeteria. We hope to enter into similar contracts with the following partners
in Turkey with whom we have had preliminary verbal discussions: Galata Konak 
Cafe, Ozi Pizza and Pasta, Istanbul Pizza and Kebab House, Cengelkoy Cynaralty 
and also small cafeterias in several shopping malls and entertainment centers.

We started looking for an equipment supplier and STREAMTOWN COMMERCIAL AG sells
paper cup forming machine that has attracted our attention.

We plan to purchase raw materials for making paper cups from the same supplier -
Streamtown Commercial AG as well.
