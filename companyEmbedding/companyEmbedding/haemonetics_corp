History[edit]
The company was founded in 1971. Haemonetics started out producing the containers and bags required for blood collection. The Latham Bowl was a disposable container that could automate the separation of blood by centrifugation. Through the 90's, the company added additional product lines and technologies. The company opened a manufacturing facility in Holbrook, MA in 1988.
In 1995 the company purchased the Intravenous Solutions manufacturing facility in Union, South Carolina.
Addition acquisitions grew the company and expanded its services. In the following years the company branched off to making the whole plasma collection station including the machine, supplies and software for plasma collection. These acquisitions include Canadian based 'Fifth Dimension' (5D) Information Systems in order to gain entry into the blood and plasma software industry. Further acquisitions include Chicago based Arryx in July 2006,[2] Information Data Management Inc. in January 2007,[3] the acquisition of Haemoscope in 2007,[4] Infonale in July 2007,[5] and Chico, CA based Altivation and Tucson, AZ based Sebra in 2009.
On August 21, 2007, 5D and IDM were officially merged into a new subsidiary called Haemonetics Software Solutions.[6] The employees at both Edmonton (5D) and Rosemont (IDM) continue to work from their respective offices.
Further acquisitions included the April 2009 acquisition of Neoteric Technology Ltd[7] as well as the April 2010 acquisition of California-based Global Med Technologies Inc.[8] Haemonetics acquired the Pall Corporations’ Transfusion Medicine Business on August 1, 2012.
Product Categories[edit]
Haemonetics products can be considered as belonging to two broad categories:

Donor products (marketed to the blood donation industry, these include products that automate the blood donation process, automate the processing of blood, support pathogen inactivation and bacterial detection of blood, and test blood hematocrit),
Patient products (products are marketed to the surgical suite for blood loss management for patients. The products include surgical blood salvage (or "autotransfusion") devices, surgical field blood suction systems, and blood and patient warming systems).

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

        Testimonials
    

        “With the cooperation of Haemonetics, we changed our blood management program in 2005 to our significant benefit. By eliminating preoperative blood donation and using OrthoPAT and Cell Saver extensively, we achieved a remarkable reduction in homologous blood units—up to 160 units less per year—which works out to about a savings of 50,000 € for the hospital over three years. Our blood management practice will continue in this direction for the future, with Haemonetics as our partner.”
    

         Dr. F-J. Unterburger, Head of Department, Asklepios Orthopedic Hospital Lindenlohe, Germany, 04.2009

Haemonetics Corporation is a global provider of blood and plasma supplies and services. The company was founded in Braintree, Massachusetts by Dr. Jack Latham in the 1970s.[1]
Today, the company has expanded and has offices located in 16 countries. The company employs more than 1,800 people and markets its products in over 50 countries. Revenue is derived nearly equally from its three major markets -- Asia, Europe, and the Americas.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1971. Haemonetics started out producing the containers and bags required for blood collection. The Latham Bowl was a disposable container that could automate the separation of blood by centrifugation. Through the 90's, the company added additional product lines and technologies. The company opened a manufacturing facility in Holbrook, MA in 1988.
In 1995 the company purchased the Intravenous Solutions manufacturing facility in Union, South Carolina.
Addition acquisitions grew the company and expanded its services. In the following years the company branched off to making the whole plasma collection station including the machine, supplies and software for plasma collection. These acquisitions include Canadian based 'Fifth Dimension' (5D) Information Systems in order to gain entry into the blood and plasma software industry. Further acquisitions include Chicago based Arryx in July 2006,[2] Information Data Management Inc. in January 2007,[3] the acquisition of Haemoscope in 2007,[4] Infonale in July 2007,[5] and Chico, CA based Altivation and Tucson, AZ based Sebra in 2009.
On August 21, 2007, 5D and IDM were officially merged into a new subsidiary called Haemonetics Software Solutions.[6] The employees at both Edmonton (5D) and Rosemont (IDM) continue to work from their respective offices.
Further acquisitions included the April 2009 acquisition of Neoteric Technology Ltd[7] as well as the April 2010 acquisition of California-based Global Med Technologies Inc.[8] Haemonetics acquired the Pall Corporations’ Transfusion Medicine Business on August 1, 2012.
Product Categories[edit]
Haemonetics products can be considered as belonging to two broad categories:

Donor products (marketed to the blood donation industry, these include products that automate the blood donation process, automate the processing of blood, support pathogen inactivation and bacterial detection of blood, and test blood hematocrit),
Patient products (products are marketed to the surgical suite for blood loss management for patients. The products include surgical blood salvage (or "autotransfusion") devices, surgical field blood suction systems, and blood and patient warming systems).

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1971. Haemonetics started out producing the containers and bags required for blood collection. The Latham Bowl was a disposable container that could automate the separation of blood by centrifugation. Through the 90's, the company added additional product lines and technologies. The company opened a manufacturing facility in Holbrook, MA in 1988.
In 1995 the company purchased the Intravenous Solutions manufacturing facility in Union, South Carolina.
Addition acquisitions grew the company and expanded its services. In the following years the company branched off to making the whole plasma collection station including the machine, supplies and software for plasma collection. These acquisitions include Canadian based 'Fifth Dimension' (5D) Information Systems in order to gain entry into the blood and plasma software industry. Further acquisitions include Chicago based Arryx in July 2006,[2] Information Data Management Inc. in January 2007,[3] the acquisition of Haemoscope in 2007,[4] Infonale in July 2007,[5] and Chico, CA based Altivation and Tucson, AZ based Sebra in 2009.
On August 21, 2007, 5D and IDM were officially merged into a new subsidiary called Haemonetics Software Solutions.[6] The employees at both Edmonton (5D) and Rosemont (IDM) continue to work from their respective offices.
Further acquisitions included the April 2009 acquisition of Neoteric Technology Ltd[7] as well as the April 2010 acquisition of California-based Global Med Technologies Inc.[8] Haemonetics acquired the Pall Corporations’ Transfusion Medicine Business on August 1, 2012.
Product Categories[edit]
Haemonetics products can be considered as belonging to two broad categories:

Donor products (marketed to the blood donation industry, these include products that automate the blood donation process, automate the processing of blood, support pathogen inactivation and bacterial detection of blood, and test blood hematocrit),
Patient products (products are marketed to the surgical suite for blood loss management for patients. The products include surgical blood salvage (or "autotransfusion") devices, surgical field blood suction systems, and blood and patient warming systems).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

	Cell Saver Elite+ | HAEMONETICS­®





















 


























We’ve evolved cell salvage to a higher level…yours.
Hospitals, clinicians, and patients benefit from a system that delivers excellent blood quality and optimal performance supporting exceptional patient care.

 Value Blood Quality Ease of Use Data Transfer Resources 












 The value of the Cell Saver Elite+ system
The Cell Saver Elite+ system provides hospitals with an easy-to-use, reliable way to recover and deliver back a patient’s own high-quality blood during medium to high blood loss procedures, including cardiac, orthopedic, trauma, transplant, vascular and OBGYN surgeries. The complete system is designed to be intuitive and flexible for optimal performance and to support exceptional patient care.










Blood quality 
High hematocrit1 and removal of undesirable components, including > 99% fat reduction2
By using the patient’s own blood, the Cell Saver Elite+ helps prevent allogeneic transfusion and associated risks. Its integrated SmartSuction® is gentle on red blood cells (RBC’s), preserving them for transfusion. And, its fat reduction protocol is designed for optimal performance, while still offering custom settings that allow for modifications during a procedure. 

 

This provides: 


High hematocrit with excellent RBC recovery—providing more red cells for transfusion
Optimal washout of undesirable components
Exceptional fat removal performance
Maximized patient safety—with autotransfusion and sequestration




Data on file at Haemonetics Corp. TR-OTH-100646. Actual performance results may vary depending on in-use variables. Test results are approximate using Haemonetics Default with 225 mL processing bowl.

Integrated SmartSuction

Protects RBC’s while maintaining optimal suction
Significantly reduce hemolysis compared to constant pressure3
More accurate and reliable than wall suction



















Gregoretti et al. showed that greater hemolysis is associated with higher suction forces. Hemolysis is even
greater when air mixes with blood.4

HAE: NASDAQ
Haemonetics Corporation (HAE) provides products for processing, handling and analyzing blood for each facet of the blood supply chain. Its products and services ensure that patients receive the most appropriate treatment at the right time. [1] The company was founded in 1971 and is based in Braintree, MA. [2]
Investment thesis
Anchor has followed Haemonetics for over five years and always liked the business as it is a leader in blood management and provides products that are vital to the blood supply chain. The balance sheet appears to us to be under-utilized as it has just $140M in net debt. [3] A new management team is in place and has laid out a multi-year turnaround plan, which will address productivity and organic growth. [4] As a result it hopes to achieve number one or two market positions in each segment and deliver superior returns on invested capital (ROIC). [5]
Confirmation through research
The growth outlook appears favorable for Haemonetics given attractive market fundamentals and the opportunity for more efficient use of resources. [6] Haemonetics is the only company that offers a full blood management solution, including tracking and managing blood, and the company’s products provide a very clear cost and productivity benefit to its users. [7] Haemonetics has been fighting a number of operational headwinds the last couple of years, including foreign exchange, as 43% of revenues are generated outside the U.S., a change in the number of calendar weeks, and continued declines in blood transfusions. [8]
Chris Simon, CEO, and Bill Burke, CFO, joined the company in May and August of 2016. [9] Previously, Chris led the Global Medical Products Practice at McKinsey and Bill most recently led the integration of Covidien into Medtronic. [10] Anchor believes that a strong management team is important and after spending a half day with management at the company’s headquarters, we feel that these two can achieve or even exceed the company’s turnaround plan goals, which include right sizing the business and driving growth in the high potential Plasma and Hospital segments. [11]
Variant Perception
We believe that there is additional upside beyond management’s goals. We see an opportunity for natural add-ons in the critical information space, the possibility of an expanding addressable market for devices and the option to sell less attractive segments of the business. We believe that Haemonetics is a compelling investment opportunity right now with a new management team that we expect to drive above average returns over the next several years.
