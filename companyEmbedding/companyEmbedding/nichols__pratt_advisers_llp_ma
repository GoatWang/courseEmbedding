About Nichols & Pratt


The Firm
The Partners of Nichols & Pratt are one of only a handful of independent private trustee partnerships (a 200 year-old tradition unique to this city), blending personal service, counsel and sustainable investment results for our clients. A Brief History of N&P. We act as trustees of family trusts and foundations with no large institutional overhead or bureaucracy.

Investing
We are consistent, experienced, long-term investors. We employ a single investment philosophy throughout the firm, favoring equities, establishing positions over time, and exercising portfolio discipline to avoid trying to “time the market.” Our Partners personally review portfolios and investments regularly.

Credentials
Four of our Partners have obtained the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, a highly-regarded investment certification. Five Partners are lawyers by training. Each of our Partners has over twenty years of trust experience.


The word trustee as used in Boston indicates a fiduciary capacity in the management of capital . . . Trust beneficiaries are accustomed to turn to the trustee as the logical person to act as their confidential friend and judicial adviser.
Donald Holbrook
The investor with a portfolio of sound stocks should expect their prices to fluctuate . . . market quotations are there for his convenience, either to be taken advantage of or to be ignored.
Benjamin Graham

About Profile Visibility
Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

                Nichols & Pratt, LLP Trustees and Fiduciaries our purpose is to care for families and their finances by providing high-level investment, fiduciary, and estate planning services to clients seeking privacy and superior personal service. Founded in 1977, Nichols & Pratt, LLP is managed by its partners who act as trustees for individuals and families. As trustees, we assume responsibility for the investment and custody of trust assets, record keeping for tax and probate purposes, and the exercise of discretion as to payments of income or principal.

Generally, relationships are created to last for generations. Partners of Nichols & Pratt, LLP also serve as executors of estates. We are able to complete all aspects of estate administration internally. Where clients are interested in a private foundation, Nichols & Pratt, LLP can provide a full line of services. Our capabilities include not only managing the foundation's assets, but also, through our own foundation office, developing and implementing strategies to realize the client's charitable wishes.  The partners of Nichols & Pratt, LLP through their registered investment advisory affiliate, Nichols & Pratt Advisers, LLP, offer investment advice as well as complete support services to individuals, to family trustees and to trust departments.

            Peer Reviews
            



About Peer Rating
Martindale-Hubbell® Peer Review Ratings™ are the gold standard in attorney ratings, and have been for more than a century. These ratings indicate attorneys who are widely respected by their peers for their ethical standards and legal expertise in a specific area of practice.


The Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings process is the gold standard due to its objectivity and comprehensiveness. Lawyers solicited for peer reviews include both those selected by the attorney being reviewed and lawyers independently selected by Martindale-Hubbell. All reviewers are verified as attorneys through Martindale-Hubbell's extensive attorney database. Only attorneys practicing at least three years and receiving a sufficient number of reviews from non-affiliated attorneys are eligible to receive a Rating.
What are the different Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Ratings?
AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Client Review Ratings and/or Peer Review Ratings may not be available for all firms and/or lawyers and the fact that a firm or lawyer has not been reviewed should not be construed as unfavorable.
