Nozomi Networks Inc. Key Developments

Nozomi Networks Inc. Delivers First End-To-End Platform for Improved ICS Cybersecurity and Operational Reliability
Mar 20 17
Nozomi Networks Inc. realized another industry milestone with its latest release of SCADAguardian. The trusted solution for cybersecurity risk detection is now the industry’s first solution to support both operational visibility and ICS cybersecurity with new modules for Asset Management and Vulnerability Assessment. It also introduced innovative Dynamic Learning for configuration-free deployments. This gives energy utilities, oil and gas operators and manufacturers the industry’s only single solution to comprehensively monitor control networks for cybersecurity and operational anomalies.


Nozomi Networks Delivers Most Advanced and Proven Cybersecurity and Operational Visibility for Industrial Networks
Oct 24 16
Nozomi Networks announced the latest release of SCADAguardian, making it faster and easier for cybersecurity engineers and plant operators to guard against cybersecurity attacks, monitor processes and manage ICS environments. SCADAguardian allows users to rapidly detect cyber incidents and process anomalies. Nozomi Networks bridges the science of automation, machine learning and network behavior analytics with ICS cybersecurity for deep detection of ICS risks and rapid prevention or mitigation of impacts. SCADAguardian’s Time Machine capabilities provides network and process snapshots to support forensic investigations and compliance reporting. It also provides automation capabilities to help with response and remediation. SCADAguardian supports zero-day detection, integration with firewalls and SIEMs, ICS incident alerting and notification; and end-to-end detection of attack activities, from recognizance, to command-and-control, to malicious actions. SCADAguardian allows users to monitor processes with real-time insights. It supports real-time process monitoring and baselining with high granularity. Non-intrusive real-time mapping, monitoring and visualization provide immediate insights for faster troubleshooting and remediation of IT and operational issues without impacting industrial processes. The latest release of SCADAguardian is available now from Nozomi Networks and includes the enhancements: Incident Management automatically aggregates multiple alerts and messages into incidents, using intelligent correlation heuristics. Instead of receiving multiple alerts that need to be associated to their logical cause, SCADAguardian groups those alerts by incident, providing an explanation of the cause, and making it more actionable for the operator. Operators can easily manage their networks at a level that makes the most sense. Customizable Portable Dashboards simplify and streamline the standardization of corporate policy, security monitoring, and operational reporting across plants, entities, and even industries. Not only can industrial operators share and standardize dashboards between their plants, system integrators and resellers can also incorporate SCADAguardian’s dashboards into the compliance or operational services they sell. Time Machine allows operators to compare a complete model of their plant and process at two different times in order to understand and visualize changes in the ICS environment with the high possible context and granularity. Performance Optimizationdelivers a 20x improvement on response times giving customers instantaneous answers to complex ad-hoc queries and assertions along with compliance checks against NIST or NERC that are now are continuous and in real-time.

                Fortinet and Nozomi Networks Secure Industrial Control Systems Through Joint Partnership
            

                Collaboration Brings Sophisticated Security Solutions to Critical Infrastructure Operators as Frequency of Cyberattacks Increases
            
SUNNYVALE, Calif. and LUGANO, Switzerland – May 16, 2016 –
Patrice Perche, senior executive vice president, Worldwide Sales and Support, Fortinet
“The cybercrime world is expanding with each passing day and has led to a growing threat for global critical infrastructure systems. The convergence of IT and critical infrastructure requires operators and government agencies to apply robust security solutions that can scale and accommodate the complex interactions between IT and physical processes within these environments. Together with Nozomi Networks, we are providing the most complete Security Fabric designed to support the full range of industrial installations bringing seamless protection to critical infrastructures worldwide.”
News Summary:
Fortinet (NASDAQ: FTNT), the global leader in high-performance cyber security solutions, and Nozomi Networks, a leading provider of real-time visibility and advanced monitoring capabilities for industrial networks, are collaborating to provide a new and innovative security solution for Industrial Control Systems (ICS).   

Nozomi’s SCADAguardian and Fortinet’s Security Fabric deployed together provide ICS customers with comprehensive cybersecurity protection, from real time anomaly detection to swift corrective action.
SCADAguardian non-intrusively detects anomalies and suspicious behavior in the ICS network and alerts Fortinet’s FortiGate enterprise firewalls to block the suspicious traffic, optimizing industrial operational efficiency by preventing system downtime and data loss.
Fortinet’s Security Fabric is an intelligent and adaptive architecture designed to deliver distributed security for protections against threats from the Internet of Things (IoT) and remote devices, through the infrastructure core, and into the cloud. It also enables the implementation of end-to-end segmentation and other innovative security strategies for comprehensive threat protection to help industrial customers protect their critical assets across the expanding attack surface.
Fortinet’s Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) framework enables dynamic generation of local threat intelligence and automated response coupled with FortiGuard services for global threat intelligence protections.

Andrea Carcano, founder and CEO of Nozomi Networks

“When you combine Nozomi Networks’ non-intrusive anomaly detection with Fortinet's in-line enforcement and network segmentation capabilities, the integrated solution enhances visibility and security beyond what each product could do on its own. This collaboration provides our joint customers with a comprehensive and proactive SCADA security solution enabling them to deploy the most robust ICS security solution on the market today.”
Unparalleled Combination of Detection and Security for Critical Infrastructure
Research indicates that critical infrastructure organizations are under a state of constant cyberattack. As these attacks get more sophisticated and increase in frequency, infrastructure operators from utility companies, transportation groups, natural resource producers, and more, must solve security gaps that will continue to grow wider over time.
In part, this is a consequence of the inevitable convergence of Operational Technology (OT) with Information Technology (IT), leaving industrial control systems (ICS) exposed to the same security breaches experienced by IT networks. However, while the impact of a security breach on most IT systems is limited to financial loss, attacks on ICS have the added potential to destroy equipment, threaten national security, and even endanger human life.
Much of the underpinning technology of ICS, while extremely robust and reliable, was never designed to be accessible from remote networks. Solving ICS security issues requires a holistic approach that unifies the best of current IT network security capabilities with an extensive understanding of ICS processes and protocols.
Industrial customers will benefit from the combination of Fortinet’s extensive cybersecurity infrastructure expertise and Nozomi Networks’ deep understanding of ICS networks, protocols and device behavior. Together, Nozomi Networks and Fortinet will help industrial customers to better protect their critical assets from both cybercriminals and employees that unintentionally leave ICS systems vulnerable.

Fortinet’s Security Fabric enables granular security policies that can be enforced based on criteria such as user identity, application, location, and device type.
FortiGate’s end-to-end segmentation capabilities implemented throughout the ICS network can provide greater visibility and scale to large ICS deployments making them even more secure.
Fortinet’s Advanced Persistent Threat Protection Framework detects and analyzes advanced attacks that might bypass more traditional signature-based defenses.
FortiGate’s rugged next-generation firewalls are built to withstand the extreme temperatures, harsh climates and hazardous locations that are common in remote ICS environments.
Nozomi SCADAguardian is a network monitoring and protection solution developed specifically for ICS. An integrated discovery and learning capability for ICS, it facilitates the creation of tailored security profiles and automatically detects critical anomalies. Additionally, underlying industrial processes are constantly monitored at the deepest level through an innovative Industrial Virtual Image Technology.

"When we moved corporate headquarters to San Francisco and added Edgard (Capdevielle) to the team in October we expected it to be a solid year for Nozomi Networks," said Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Andrea Carcano. "The progress we've made so far has exceeded our expectations. I believe this latest recognition from Gartner, as well as significant customer growth and the industry talent joining our team, is a testament to the strength of our company, our product and our vision; and an indicator of much more to come in the months ahead."

Nozomi Networks Named a 2017 Gartner Cool Vendor

 June 14, 2017  GlobeNewswire

Multimedia/Internet/Online Services, Stock/Other Market News 



SAN FRANCISCO, June  14, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Nozomi Networks, Inc., the pioneer in real-time cybersecurity and operational visibility for industrial control systems (ICS), today announced that it has been selected by Gartner, Inc., as a 2017 Cool Vendor*. Cool Vendor reports identify companies who are recognized for their innovation, impact and intrigue in the markets they serve.
“It’s an honor for us to be a Gartner Cool Vendor. We are proud of our innovation and its positive impact on our global customers,” said Nozomi Networks CEO Edgard Capdevielle. “We believe this is strong validation of the strength of our product and its proven value to customers around the globe. Our employees are gratified to see Nozomi Networks recognized by Gartner and know technology executives and boards can rely on Gartner for valuable insights.”
