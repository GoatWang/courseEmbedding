Form 10-K
A 10-K is a comprehensive summary report of a company's performance that must be submitted annually to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Typically, the 10-K contains much more detail than the annual report. It includes information such as company history, organizational structure, equity, holdings, earnings per share, subsidiaries, etc. 

The 10-K must be filed within 60 days (it used to be 90 days) after the end of the fiscal year.
Form 10-K/A
Amended Form 10-K
Form 10-Q
The SEC form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of a company's performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their financial position. The form must be submitted on time, and the information should be available to all interested parties. 

The 10-Q is due 35 days (it used to be 45 days) after each of the first three fiscal quarters. There is no filing after the fourth quarter because that is when the 10-K is filed.
Form 10-Q/A
Amended Form 10-Q
Form 3
A document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by an insider affiliated with a public company's operation or by any investor owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding shares

This document must be filed with the SEC no later than 10 days after an insider becomes affiliated with a company, and it must be filed for each company in which a person is an insider, regardless of whether or not the insider has an equity position in the company at that time.
Form 3/A
Amended Form 3
Form 4
A Form 4 is a document that must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) whenever there is a material change in the holdings of company insiders. Insiders required to submit a Form 4 include directors and officers of the company as well as any shareholders owning 10% or more of the company's outstanding stock.

This two-page document covers any buy-and-sell orders on the open market as well as the exercise of company stock options. A Form 4 is mandatory within two business days starting from the end of the day the material transaction occurred. This filing is related to Form 3 and the Form 5, which also cover changes to the company insider holdings.
Form 4/A
Amended Form 4
Form 5
The annual statement of beneficial ownership of securities.
Form 5/A
Amended Form 5
Form 8-K
An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Examples of events reported on an 8-K include acquisition, bankruptcy, resignation of directors, or a change in the fiscal year. Also known as Form 8k.
Form D
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) required for companies that are selling securities in reliance on a Regulation D exemption or Section 4(6) exemption provisions. 

Form D is a brief notice of a company's executive officers and stock promoters, in lieu of the regular reports required when no exemption under Regulation D exists. 

Form D must be filed no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities.

Form D is also known as the Notice of Sale of Securities and is a requirement under Regulation D, Section 4(6) and/or the Uniform Limited Offering Exemption of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933. 

This act, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms, providing essential facts, are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act - requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered and prohibiting fraud in the sale of the offered securities.
Form D/A
Amended Form D
Form DEF 14A
A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that must be filed by or on behalf of a registrant when a shareholder vote is required. SEC Form DEF 14A is most commonly used in conjunction with an annual meeting proxy. The form should provide security holders with sufficient information to allow them to make an informed vote at an upcoming security holders' meeting or to authorize a proxy to vote on their behalf. It includes information about the date, time and place of the meeting of security holders; revocability of proxy; dissenter's right of appraisal; persons making the solicitation; direct or indirect interest of certain persons in matters to be acted upon; modification or exchange of securities; financial statements; voting procedures; and other details. 

All other filed by non-management definitive proxy statements - typically an annual meeting proxy.

Form DEF 14A, which is also known as "definitive proxy statement", is required under Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This form is filed with the SEC when a definitive proxy statement is given to shareholders and helps the SEC ensure that shareholders' rights are upheld.
Form S-1
The SEC form S-1 is the initial registration form for new securities required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for public companies. Any security that meets the criteria must have an S-1 filing before shares can be listed on a national exchange. 

Form S-1 requires companies to provide information on the planned use of capital proceeds, detail the current business model and competition, as well provide a a brief prospectus of the planned security itself, offering price methodology, and any dilution that will occur to other listed securities. The SEC also requires the disclosure of any material business dealings between the company and its directors and outside counsel. 

Form S-1 is also known as the "Registration Statement Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1933". 

Investors can view S-1 filings online to perform due diligence on new offerings prior to their issue. The form is sometimes amended as material information changes or general market conditions cause a delay in the offering. 

The Securities Exchange Act of 1933, often referred to as the "truth in securities" law, requires that these registration forms are filed to disclose important information upon registration of a company's securities. This helps the SEC achieve the objectives of this act, which is requiring investors to receive significant information regarding securities offered, and to prohibit fraud in the sale of the offered securities. 

A less rigid registration form is the S-3, which is for companies that don't have the same ongoing reporting requirements.

Emlyn Davies


1927 - 2015
Obituary
Condolences

































 Emlyn Barrasford (Barry) Davies1927-2015Emlyn Barrasford (Barry) Davies, 88, passed from this life on Monday, July 20, 2015. He was born on February 23, 1927 in Minnedosa, Manitoba, Canada, the youngest of three boys of Enoch Christopher Davies and Ada Bullock Davies. Barry graduated with honors from the University of Manitoba in 1948 and earned both a Masters in Mathematics in 1951 and a PhD in Physics in 1953 from Pennsylvania State University.Barry was proceeded in death by his parents as well as his two brothers, James Ivor Davies and George Christopher Davies. Barry is survived by his loving wife of 52 years, Lina D. Davies, as well as his daughter, Adrienne Schwenke and husband Mark Schwenke, his son, Owen Davies and wife Carol Davies and his son, Stuart Davies and his wife Dana Davies. He was also a proud grandfather of seven grandchildren, Jessica and Amanda Schwenke, Aeron and Briana Davies, and Bronwyn, Haydn and Gavyn Davies. Barry served in the Corps of Engineers and Missile Battalion of the U.S. Army from 1955-1957.Barry began his career as a geophysicist in the Research Department of the Gulf Oil Corporation in 1953. After his military service, he returned to Gulf Oil where he worked for Gulf and then Chevron Geosciences for a combined 35 years. In earning his PhD in Physics, Dr. Davies published works relating to the study of shock waves, and therefore, he was naturally involved in a number of early research projects for Gulf involving developing and improving seismic techniques. In 1968, Dr. Davies co-authored a paper on "Multichannel deconvolution of field recorded seismic data", Geophysics, Vol. 33, No. 5. This paper was selected to appear in the silver anniversary issue of Geophysics published by the Society of Exploration Geologists.He joined Chevron Geosciences in 1985 as an Assistant to the President where he was involved in merging Gulf's upstream technology and technical staff into Chevron's upstream companies. He retired from Chevron in 1988, holding the position of Vice President of Development and Implementation of Chevron Geoscience Company. In 1989, along with a colleague of many years, he formed North American Geotechnical Company where he conducted research on developing methods for detecting scour, or erosion, around bridge foundations, which was sponsored by the National Science Foundation and conducted at the Allied Geophysical Lab at the University of Houston. From 2000-2002, Dr. Davies published a series of papers on this topic and was appointed an Adjunct Associate Professor at the University of Houston for his work.Dr. Davies was a member of the Geophysical Society of Houston, the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the European Association of Exploration Geophysicists, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the American Physical Society and the Acoustical Society of America.Barry was a loving husband, a devoted father, a caring grandfather, a spirited coach, a patient mentor and a concerned friend. Funeral Services celebrating Barry's life will be held on Sunday, July 26 at 1:00 PM at Ascension Episcopal Church at 2525 Seagler Rd, Houston, TX with the Reverend Todd Bryant officiating. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests that donations be made in his name to Ascension Episcopal Church, Strake Jesuit College Preparatory or St. Agnes Academy.
