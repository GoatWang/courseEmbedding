1 Source: Barron's “Top 100 Financial Advisors,” April 17, 2017. Barron's “Top 100 Financial Advisors” bases its ratings on qualitative criteria: professionals with a minimum of seven years of financial services experience, acceptable compliance records, client retention reports, customer satisfaction, and more. Financial Advisors are quantitatively rated based on varying types of revenues and assets advised by the financial professional, with weightings associated for each. Because individual client portfolio performance varies and is typically unaudited, this rating focuses on customer satisfaction and quality of advice. The rating may not be representative of any one client’s experience because it reflects a sample of all of the experiences of the Financial Advisor’s clients.

  Dedicated to local

 
  
  
  and global communities

 
since 1935

Our firm was founded with commitment to community as our guiding principle. And we’ve been making a difference ever since.












































1935
Laying The Foundation

Morgan Stanley formally opens its doors for business at 2 Wall Street, New York City, on September 16, 1935. In its first year,  the firm handles $1.1 billion in public offerings and private placements—a 24 percent market share.



1940
Caring for Children

Founding partner Harold Stanley establishes the firm’s commitment to children’s health by raising $1.5 million (equal to nearly $25 million in 2014) for the US Committee for the Care of European Children.



1941-1942
Reorganizing and Expanding

The firm undergoes a reorganization as a partnership to allow for rapidly expanding activity in the securities business. The following year, Morgan Stanley joins the New York Stock Exchange.



1952
Rebuilding Countries

As Europe struggles to recover after World War II, Morgan Stanley co-manages the World Bank’s $50 million bond offering to help finance European reconstruction efforts.



1961-1969
Stronger Starts

The Morgan Stanley Foundation launches in 1961. The following year, Morgan Stanley develops the first computer model for financial analysts. In 1967, the firm establishes Morgan & Cie International in Paris to pursue the growing European securities market.



1970-1979
Increased Capabilities

Morgan Stanley becomes the first international investment bank to establish a representative office in Tokyo, Japan, in 1970. In the following years, the Sales and Trading, Research, Investment Management, Realty and Private Wealth Management departments launch.



1980-1989
Going Public

Morgan Stanley develops TAPS – the first automated trade processing system – in 1984, with the Fixed Income Division launching the following year. In 1986, the firm goes public to raise capital for further growth. Over the course of the decade, the firm opens offices in Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Melbourne, Milan, Sydney and Zurich, as well as expanding in London and Tokyo.



1990-1999
Global Impact

In 1995, Morgan Stanley enters China as a cornerstone investor in China International Capital Corporation (CICC) and establishes the Morgan Stanley International Foundation. The 1997 merger of Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and Dean, Witter, Discover & Co. creates the world’s largest securities firm to date. Over the course of the decade, the firm expands further in Asia and Latin America.



2000-2007
Community Commitment

In addition to handling some of the largest tech IPOs, security offerings and acquisitions in the world, Morgan Stanley stands firm behind its commitments to community—from a joint effort by the firm and its employees to raise $60 million to build Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, to employee-led relief efforts following the September 11 terrorist attacks.



2008-2013
Transitions and Strategic Alliances

In 2008, Morgan Stanley becomes a bank holding company and forms a strategic alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). Morgan Stanley completes the purchase of the Morgan Stanley Wealth Management joint venture in 2013, becoming 100% owner of one of the world’s leading wealth management franchises.



2013-2014
Dedication to Sustainability

The firm looks to the future by launching the Investing with Impact platform and the Morgan Stanley Institute for Sustainable Investing-a pair of initiatives dedicated to inspiring positive social impact and fostering large-scale global sustainability.

Morgan Stanley debuts fiduciary product for small 401(k) plans, with eye toward DOL rule
The wirehouse offers a way for non-fiduciary brokers working with 401(k) plans to continue working with clients in the small-plan market






Mar 9, 2017 @ 2:28 pm
By 
	Greg Iacurci






















+ Zoom




      Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is making a push into the small 401(k) marketplace, debuting a fiduciary product exclusively available to its advisers and offering a risk-controlled way to continue servicing those plans when the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule comes into force.The wirehouse partnered with Ascensus, a retirement plan record keeper, on the product, called ClearFit, available to 401(k) plans with less than $10 million in assets.Ascensus will perform the plan record keeping and administration, while Morgan Stanley, which has an adviser force of more than 15,000, will offer a uniform lineup of investments for the 401(k) plans and assume a fiduciary role.
				



It's Morgan Stanley's first fiduciary product for the small and micro 401(k) market, and gives the brokerage a level of blanket protection for 401(k) business under the DOL fiduciary rule, which raises investment-advice standards in retirement accounts. "This program allows every single one of our advisers … to act in a fiduciary advisory capacity with their clients," said Eric Garofalo, the firm's executive director of corporate retirement services.Observers believe the DOL rule — which is coming into force April 10, but which may be delayed at least 60 days and eventually amended or rescinded — is going to have an outsized effect on advisers servicing small 401(k) plans. Advisers servicing that market are often non-fiduciary brokers, whose investment advice would likely become fiduciary in nature under the rule, thereby exposing brokerage firms to more risk if they were to continue doing business the same way.However, with ClearFit, because the Morgan Stanley organization takes responsibility for the investment fiduciary functions away from its advisers, the firm can mitigate risk while allowing its advisers to maintain or enter into new relationships with small-market clients.The adviser could continue providing services such as non-fiduciary investment education."Whether the regulation moves forward or whether it doesn't, the concepts that are a part of that [DOL] regulation were very much considered as the product was built out," said Kathleen Connelly, executive vice president of client experience and relationship management at Ascensus.Previously, only advisers Morgan Stanley designates as "retirement specialists" were able to enter into fiduciary advisory contracts with 401(k) clients. (The firm has roughly 300 designated specialists.) The remaining advisers engaged plans in a non-fiduciary, commission-based fashion.Now, those non-specialists have three options when engaging retirement plan clients, said spokesman Christine Jockle: commission-based business; the ClearFit advisory approach; and a partnership with a retirement specialist, who would take on fiduciary responsibilities. "Some of the broker-dealer firms are working with [the rule] that way to make sure they don't lose the business from the less experienced advisers, but at the same time they're protecting the firm and serving the interest of the client by having someone experienced actually work on the plan," said Bruce Ashton, a partner at Drinker Biddle & Reath.Several record keepers offer plans and advisers the capability to outsource investment fiduciary functions to providers such as Mesirow Financial, Wilshire Associates, Morningstar Investment Management and Envestnet Retirement Solutions."Most have been, in my experience, investment advisory firms and not necessarily a broker-dealer, so in that sense [Morgan Stanley's] may be a little bit unique," Mr. Ashton said of outsourced fiduciary services.They're typically used by small-market plans, because larger plans tend to engage their own fiduciary adviser, he added.Morgan Stanley's role in its new product will be as a 3(38) investment fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, meaning it will take discretion to add or remove funds and subadvisers from the investment lineup.The menu is comprised of 18 collective investment trust funds, some of which have multiple subadvisers, and a target-date asset allocation model that uses the collective funds on the menu. The unweighted investment cost for the fund menu is roughly 0.38%, Ms. Jockle said.Ascensus charges a flat dollar fee for record keeping – the base fee, which accommodates the first 25 plan participants, is $3,950, and there's a per-participant fee for anyone additional, the cost of which is based on plan size. There's also an annual benchmarking report delivered by Fiduciary Benchmarks to the plan adviser on an annual basis.

        Few pluses in Morgan Stanley's 'structured' product
    






















By


                                        ChuckJaffe









BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- The simple explanation sounds great: Double the market's upside -- to about 13% a year -- without any change in the downside. It's pitched as a way for an investor to get solid returns, even in a year when the market is only modestly positive. But anything with a name like "Performance Leveraged Upside Securities" (PLUS) is not so simple, and investors digging deeply into the Morgan Stanley PLUS that's tied to the Standard & Poor's 500 index are likely to come away thinking they've uncovered a Stupid Investment of the Week. Stupid Investment of the Week showcases the conditions and characteristics that make a security less than ideal for the average investor, in the hope that spotlighting trouble in one situation will make it easier for the reader to ferret out elsewhere. Morgan Stanley's family of PLUS securities represent what brokers call "structured products," part of a growing type of similar offerings pushed under a variety of names by a number of the major investment firms.  The PLUS is a form of unsecured note, traded on a stock exchange, where the return is pegged to the performance of an underlying index. The terms and conditions vary, so that the PLUS based on the value of the Standard & Poor's 500 index is very different from the PLUS for the AMEX China Index. The S&P 500 PLUS product -- traded on the American Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SPU 

                            
                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                  
                                    SPU, -0.95%

                            
                                  
      
      
      
      
      
      
      
                                         -- promises a souped-up bet on a bull market. The "leveraged upside" of this PLUS is 200% of the gain of the S&P 500 index over a 16-month period. While PLUS products trade on an exchange, they are offered at a specific issue price and tend to be held like notes, more than stocks; the SPU was issued in November of 2006 and matures in March 2008. Functionally, the SPU is a bet on a middling market, one where large-cap stocks return 5% to 6%, a bit lower than historical norms. If the index gains that much, the leverage of the PLUS should double that amount, allowing an investor to produce a double-digit return in an ordinary year for the market. The problems come in execution. For starters, while the SPU turbocharges the market's gains, it offers no protection from losses. If the index falls prior to maturity, so does the value of the note. There's also a cost to getting the high-powered upside. After the agent's commission, the investor could pay big because of how the index return is calculated. Specifically, the SPU bases its return on the level of the index, not its total return. That's a complicated way of saying "Kiss dividends goodbye." Currently, the yield on the S&P 500 is about 1.7%. Own an index fund and you capture those dividends, which act as a cushion if the market falls; own the PLUS and the payouts don't factor into your gain or mitigate a loss. Next, there is the cap, which restricts your gains. Issuers of structured products must protect against having to pay the enormous leveraged gains that would occur if the index skyrockets; the SPU is capped at a maximum index gain of 6.75% over the 16-month term. Double the gain to reflect the leverage and the maximum gain is 13.5% over 16 months. Window of opportunity Simply put, there's a small window of index returns where the SPU is better than or equal to owning an index fund. If you factor in the missed dividends, hat window runs from about 2% to 12%. In every other return scenario, a basic S&P index fund would be a superior investment. Eric Lewis, chief investment officer at Bedrock Capital in Los Altos, Calif., suggests that an examination of the SPU based on historic returns and standard deviations shows that the product will work out in favor of the investor about one year in four. Morgan Stanley, however, suggests a higher success rate, based on the fact that it structures the notes not on historical returns but on the company's own forecasts. Contacted for this column, the company issued the following statement: "For an index that has historically, over the long term, had high single-digit returns, the ability to double those returns to a maximum cap in the teens can benefit our clients -- particularly in an environment where our expectations for that index are moderate." But even Morgan Stanley insiders and brokers acknowledge that investors can do the same thing on their own, without structured notes. There are a number of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds which offer a leveraged play on indexes, where an investor who feels optimistic about the market can goose returns; those funds are built as trading vehicles, while the SPU -- despite being traded on an exchange -- is built to be held to maturity. A strategy of using an S&P 500 index fund combined with options on the index could also create the double-the-upside situation with the dividends reducing the loss potential. Many of the PLUS notes are based on more esoteric index products, making them harder to replicate and putting the investors in a position where the product provides a unique strategy for a specific asset class. The S&P 500, however, is not that kind of hard-to-replicate investment. But perhaps the biggest drawback is that the SPU is so complicated that the average investor only latches on to the simple explanation, without understanding what they've really bought. It's a pretty good bet that no investor wakes up in the morning and says "I need a 'performance leveraged upside security' today," instead relying on what was heard in a sales pitch. Says Lewis: "For someone who wants to take a position that the market is going to go up and leverage the bet, there are a lot of different ways to do it. This seems to be a particularly ineffective way."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
