What is currently known as Associated Banc Corp started out as First National Bank of Neenah, Wisconsin in 1861.  The year 1970 was pivotal due to the merging of the Neenah Bank with two other Northeast Wisconsin banks—Kellogg Citizens Bank of Green Bay and Manitowoc Savings Bank. The second key event earning Associated Banc its name was the 1997 merger of First Financial and Associated Bank, resulting in the retaining of the latter name. Today, approximately 150 years later, Associated Banc Corp is one of the top 50 publicly traded, bank holding companies in the United States based out of Green Bay, Wisconsin.  The bank offers a variety of financial products and services in over 200 banking locations in more than 100 communities throughout Wisconsin, Illinois and Minnesota, including offering commercial financial services in Indiana, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Texas.
 



The Good

Features and services
Preferred interest rates
Unique feature product

Features and Services
Associated Banc Corp has a list of varied products and services for its Midwest customers. The three that stand out are its Associated Checking, Associated Savings and especially its Fixed Rate Add-on Certificate of Deposit (CD).
First up is Associated Banc's Associated Checking account. This is a personal checking account designated for people wanting a basic, no-frills transaction account to deposit their money that is easy and convenient to access at anytime.
This account satisfies those qualifications. Here are the basic features:

Minimum opening balance: $100
$11 monthly service fee

The monthly service fee can be waived by doing one of the following:

$1,000 minimum daily balance
$2,500 in combined balances (deposits and/or investments)
Direct deposit a total of $500 or more per statement
Be under the age of 24 and go paperless with eStatements

As far as easy, convenient access, Associated Checking offers the following:

Free ATM access at more than 20,000 surcharge-free network ATMs
Free Online Banking and Bill Pay
Associated Mobile Banking
24/7 Customer Care Center assistance
Hundreds of branch locations in Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin

Some related bonuses include:

Free Associated Bank Debit MasterCard

A few available Associated Checking debit card options are:

Free team affiliation debit card
Associated Bank VISA Signature Rewards Credit Card
Zero Liability Fraud Protection

The next highlight is the Associated Savings Account. This account is designed to be simple for new savers to begin putting money away.
The account has low fees, including:

a minimum of $25 to open
a monthly fee of $5

The $5 monthly service fee can be waived with one of the following:

$300 minimum daily balance
$25 or more per month in recurring automatic deposits, such as ACH, Online Banking transfers from another account or direct deposit
Be under the age of 18

Preferred Interest Rates
If customers already have an Associated Checking Account they will get preferred interest rates. They will also get protection against overdrafts when they link their savings account to their Associated Checking account.
A few other savings account benefits include:

Unlimited free ATM withdrawals from Associated Bank ATMs
2 free non- Associated Bank ATM withdrawals per statement cycle  ($2.50 each withdrawal thereafter)
Free online banking

Unique Feature Product
Associated Banc's most unique feature product is its Fixed Rate Add- On Certificate of Deposit (CD). This CD has unusual features for customers needing lower cost with higher flexibility.
Here are the features:

an unusually low opening balance of $100 (compared to the typical $1000)
unlimited additional deposits of any amount, at any time (CDs don't allow deposits after term begins)
12 month term
Option to have interest payment transferred to another Associated account or issued by check if CD account balance is $5,000 or more.

There is also a flexible grace period allowing the account owner 10 calendar days after maturity (one year) to withdraw the funds without penalty. (Interest is not paid during the grace period unless the funds from this Certificate of Deposit are deposited into another Associated Bank Certificate of Deposit).



The Bad

Missing components
Requirements
Ask to link accounts

Missing Components
There seems to be two components missing with Associated Banc's Associated Checking account based on its target audience:

It claims to be a basic checking account for customers wanting to save money but has both a high opening balance of $100 (typically $50 at most banks, as low as $25 or even $0 at 100% online banks like Discover Bank)


A high maintenance balance of $1000 to avoid monthly fees. Many banks offer more competitive checking with no minimum balance and no monthly fees.

To be a basic account designated for people wanting simplicity and low maintenance, the Associated Checking has fallen short of its promise for its target customers, which are typically individuals without a lot of money to begin with.
The Associated Savings Account does have low fees, such as a $5 monthly fee that can be waived by:

$300 minimum daily balance
$25 or more per month in recurring automatic deposits, such as ACH, Online Banking transfers from another account or direct deposit
Be under the age of 18

Requirements
The issue is the same as the basic checking account: its target customers would not necessarily be equipped to meet the listed requirements. Many people with this kind of account do not make monthly account deposits. To set up automatic deposits can be inconvenient and direct deposits usually are done with checking accounts for people without a lot of money to move around.
Ask to Link Accounts
Customers should also be sure to ask their banker to link their savings and checking accounts. Closing one's checking account means applicable minimum balance requirements and maintenance fees will apply on the linked accounts. This perhaps should be more emphasized instead of being buried in the fine print.



The Bottom Line
Since the 1970's, Associated Banc Corp has been offering a variety of financial products and services to its MidWest customers, priding itself for great customer service. Its most standout features are the Associated Savings Account and the Fixed Rate Add-on CD (Certificate of Deposit) account.  In fact, with its flexible benefits, customers may find the Fixed Rate Add-On CD to function as a better, more efficient savings account than the actual Associated Savings account. The Associated Checking account is a main feature, too with some convenient benefits (especially with its Debit Card), but perhaps needs to revise its high balance requirements for everyday customers seeking a true basic, economical checking account-which in today's digital banking world, is not hard to find elsewhere.

GREEN BAY and MILWAUKEE, Wis., July 20, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Associated Banc-Corp (NYSE:    ASB) ("Associated") and Bank Mutual Corporation (NASDAQ:    BKMU) ("Bank Mutual"), jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which Bank Mutual will merge with and into Associated. Bank Mutual's bank subsidiary will also merge with and into Associated's bank subsidiary, Associated Bank, N.A. The all stock transaction is valued at approximately $482 million, based on Associated's July 19, 2017, closing stock price of $24.60 per share. 








Associated and Bank Mutual share a proud heritage of serving Wisconsin and other Midwest communities for 156 and 125 years, respectively.  Based in Green Bay, Associated Bank N.A. is the largest bank headquartered in Wisconsin. It serves more than one million customers in 100 communities across eight states. Bank Mutual is the holding company for the largest Milwaukee-based bank. It serves more than 120,000 customer accounts through banking locations in Wisconsin and Minnesota. As a result of this transaction, Associated will strengthen its Wisconsin network and expand services into nearly a dozen additional communities. 
"We have deep respect for Bank Mutual and its dedicated team of colleagues. Both of our organizations are built around customer-centric strategies and understand the importance of delivering increasing value to customers, colleagues, communities and shareholders," said Associated president and CEO Philip B. Flynn. "The acquisition of Bank Mutual provides significant opportunity to increase our Wisconsin presence and improve the scale of our operations. Ultimately, this positions us to gain efficiencies while also making investments to better support the customer experience."
"I am confident the merger will benefit our customers and the communities we serve," said Bank Mutual president and CEO David Baumgarten. "In addition, Bank Mutual shareholders should benefit from Associated's strong and consistent financial performance and the potential growth opportunities going forward." 
Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, Bank Mutual shareholders will receive 0.422 shares of Associated common stock for each share of Bank Mutual common stock. The per common share consideration is valued at $10.38 per share based on the closing price of Associated common stock on July 19, 2017. 
Upon consummation of the merger, Mr. Baumgarten will serve as a consultant to the CEO of Associated. In his new capacity, he will focus on client retention and employee engagement while also serving as an ambassador for the bank's community involvement. Bank Mutual chairman Michael T. Crowley, Jr. will be appointed to the combined companies' board of directors. 
"I am extremely proud of what we have accomplished at Bank Mutual and look forward to working with the board of directors for the benefit of all our stakeholders as our companies come together," said Crowley. 
The companies' boards anticipate that shareholders of both companies will benefit from expected cost savings from branch and operational synergies. Due to Associated's strong presence in Wisconsin, the companies also anticipate significant, ongoing opportunities for employees of both organizations to contribute to the franchise over the long-term. "We typically have around 300 job openings at any given time. We hope to fill these with banking professionals already serving our combined customers and communities," Flynn said. 
Associated and Bank Mutual play an active role in supporting the socioeconomic health of their communities and will continue this commitment in the markets the combined companies will serve. Together, the companies had more than $1 billion in lending and investments to minority and low- to-moderate-income customers and communities and provided more than 62,000 hours of volunteer services in 2016. 
Subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the Bank Mutual shareholders, the transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018.
Associated expects this acquisition to be accretive to earnings per common share in 2019, excluding one-time charges, and expects the transaction to deliver strong returns on capital. The transaction is expected to produce less than 1% tangible book value per share dilution at closing. 
Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC served as financial advisor, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz served as legal advisor to Associated in this transaction. RBC Capital Markets, LLC served as financial advisor, and Quarles & Brady LLP served as legal advisor to Bank Mutual in this transaction.

Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time and are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Neither Associated nor Bank Mutual assumes any duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are by their nature, to different degrees, uncertain and subject to assumptions, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that Associated or Bank Mutual anticipated in its forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance.

These risks, as well as other risks associated with the proposed transaction, will be more fully discussed in the proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the registration statement on Form S-4 that will be filed with the SEC in connection with the proposed transaction. While the list of factors presented here is, and the list of factors presented in the registration statement on Form S-4 will be, considered representative, no such lists should be considered to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. Unlisted factors may present significant additional obstacles to the realization of forward-looking statements. For any forward-looking statements made in this joint press release or in any documents, Associated and Bank Mutual claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Associated and Bank Mutual annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
