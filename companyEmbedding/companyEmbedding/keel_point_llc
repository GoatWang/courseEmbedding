History



  




Keel Point is the joining together of families and advisors to achieve each family’s mission, vision, values and goals. 
15 years ago, a group of successful families came together with David Parks and his team to create a firm to serve the global financial, estate, tax, business and philanthropic needs of the wealth-creators and their spouses, children and children’s children. 
About the same time, Robert Mayes left a large financial institution to establish a firm which could more faithfully serve the financial, estate, education, retirement and tax needs of his family clients. 
In 2015, the two firms came together to form Keel Point, a wealth advisor to families, companies, endowments and foundations. Later that same year, Keel Point was joined by teams in Chattanooga and Huntsville which saw in Keel Point the opportunity to better serve their current and future clientele.
Keel Point is a community of families who believe that wealth comes with the opportunity to be a blessing to family and community, and of experienced professionals dedicated to providing families with guidance and wisdom around their financial lives.
Keel Point brings to each client, small and large, the best of its diverse heritage: financial and strategic advice for families just starting out and for families with multi-generational wealth, and investment management designed to allow each family to reach their financial goals.











  



Our Philosophy






We begin every relationship by understanding you and your family. We work with you to identify your family’s mission, vision, values and goals … your personal “Keel Point.” Our advisory and investment teams bring wisdom, clarity and vision to stay on course through times of prosperity and turbulence. Keel Point is determined to walk alongside its families for the long run … for generations … helping families realize the possibilities and manage the responsibilities of wealth.


Keel Point. Invest in Your Purpose®.

Keel Point Horizon ServicesKeel Point Horizon is for people with substantial, multi-generational wealth in need of a more tailored approach to managing life and wealth. We provide educated counsel, unwavering capability, and highly personal service to help our clients leave an indelible impact.



  




Life Planning
Significant wealth requires a shared purpose to unite generations and direct financial and non-financial decisions. We guide our Horizon families through a collaborative process that builds clarity and consensus around their challenges, opportunities, and intentions. With this purpose in place, we then help families design and drive a unique plan of their own.

Investment Management
Managing a substantial investment portfolio requires a sophisticated, hands-on approach, one that protects principal yet also capitalizes on opportunities for growth in a way that makes sense for each family. Keel Point Horizon will create a unique, world-class investment strategy and continually monitor performance, recalibrating along the way as circumstances dictate.

Meaningful Impact. Multiple Generations.


Significant wealth brings great possibilities yet also great responsibility. Separating the self-worth from the balance sheet can be challenging, stirring emotions and straining relationships.

We then design and deliver a customized strategy, allowing families to invest with more confidence, give with more conviction, and create a meaningful legacy that will guide generations to come.

Keel Point for InstitutionsWe serve our institutional clients as both advisor and consultant, customizing strategies in accordance with the greater purpose of your organization. 



  


KP Institutional Partnerships


We work alongside your team to develop, implement and continually evaluate a cohesive organization-wide strategy that is consistent with your mission, vision, values and goals.
Development
We start by understanding your culture, objectives and the challenges you’re facing. We then use what we’ve discovered to inform the development of policy statements and a risk and return framework to guide all asset management decisions. Working with your team, we establish a communication process for evaluation and ongoing management and present a portfolio strategic plan for input and approval.
Implementation
We construct your portfolio with an optimized framework that implements your unique strategic plan across entities and a spectrum of asset classes. We provide in-house expertise in private investments and targeted asset classes (strategic, tactical, and risk management) and seamless investment manager integration using a well-established business model and a systemic selection and evaluation process.
We then continue to partner with you through the process, delivering detailed segmented and consolidated reporting, consistent communication and education, and a strong process for ongoing management.


KP Institutional Advisory


We provide institutional clients with the guidance needed to be smart with their assets and persistent in their mission.
Investment Management

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 11/17/2005
            

                BBB has determined that Keel Point, LLC meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

History



  




Keel Point is the joining together of families and advisors to achieve each family’s mission, vision, values and goals. 
15 years ago, a group of successful families came together with David Parks and his team to create a firm to serve the global financial, estate, tax, business and philanthropic needs of the wealth-creators and their spouses, children and children’s children. 
About the same time, Robert Mayes left a large financial institution to establish a firm which could more faithfully serve the financial, estate, education, retirement and tax needs of his family clients. 
In 2015, the two firms came together to form Keel Point, a wealth advisor to families, companies, endowments and foundations. Later that same year, Keel Point was joined by teams in Chattanooga and Huntsville which saw in Keel Point the opportunity to better serve their current and future clientele.
Keel Point is a community of families who believe that wealth comes with the opportunity to be a blessing to family and community, and of experienced professionals dedicated to providing families with guidance and wisdom around their financial lives.
Keel Point brings to each client, small and large, the best of its diverse heritage: financial and strategic advice for families just starting out and for families with multi-generational wealth, and investment management designed to allow each family to reach their financial goals.











  



Our Philosophy






We begin every relationship by understanding you and your family. We work with you to identify your family’s mission, vision, values and goals … your personal “Keel Point.” Our advisory and investment teams bring wisdom, clarity and vision to stay on course through times of prosperity and turbulence. Keel Point is determined to walk alongside its families for the long run … for generations … helping families realize the possibilities and manage the responsibilities of wealth.


Keel Point. Invest in Your Purpose®.
