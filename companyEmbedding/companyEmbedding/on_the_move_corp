On the Move Corp. Planning Big Move Into Florida
Company expects to acquire 50 c-stores next year.

November 6, 2015, 03:15 pm



 



BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — On the Move will make a big move into Florida.
NAS Acquisition Inc. Thursday completed a share exchange agreement with the shareholders of Boynton Beach-based On the Move Corp., which was founded in 2014 to engage in the acquisition of convenience stores.
Now that this transaction is complete, On the Move Corp. will, subject to financing, acquire up to 50 c-stores in 2016 in the Sunshine State, most of which will be operated under the On the Move brand.
“We are very excited to bring the On the Move vision to the state of Florida,” said Jay Seewald, On the Move’s president and chief operating officer. “It is our mission to deliver a ‘good day sunshine’ experience 365 days a year to all of our customers.”
On the Move stores will offer fresh food offerings under its proprietary brand, as well as national chains such as Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, Godfathers Pizza and sandwiches; beverage and tobacco products; health and beauty aids; automotive products; and other nonfood items. In addition, it will be involved in the retail sale of gasoline or gasohol on a self-service basis.
As for why On the Move favors the state of Florida, the company said it believes the Sunshine State offers one the best opportunities for growth and expansion during the next 10 years.
“Currently, the state of Florida consumes over 12 billion gallons of gas on an annual basis and grows by 1,000 new residents each day,” the company stated in a news release. “The principles of On the Move have owned and operated convenience stores in Florida for more than 20 years.”

As part of the share exchange agreement, the following officers and directors in addition to Seewald were appointed by the NAS board at closing: R.J. Reitano, chairman and CEO, and Russell Parker, executive vice president, chief business officer and director.
NAS Acquisition Inc. was founded in Nevada in 2014. It seeks out business opportunities with entities that have recently commenced operations, or wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand into new products or markets, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes.

On the Move Corp. Wants 50 Units by Year's End
Company leaders believe Florida is ripe for growth.

February 2, 2016, 01:10 pm



 



BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — On the Move Corp. (OTM) is making inroads to hit its goal of 50 locations by the end of the year.
On the Move added three convenience stores with gas in South Florida to its portfolio, bringing the number of new locations in the past 30 days to five. The latest three c-stores are in Jupiter, Wellington and Boynton Beach. They join the two units opened in Royal Palm Beach, Fla., in December.
Management estimates the five new locations will generate $45 million in revenue in 2016.
"With the closing of these convenience stores, we have put in place the necessary foundation to begin generating substantial revenue," said R.J. Reitano, chairman and CEO of OTM. "The past 30 days have been exciting. We are fast on our way to add up to 50 units by the end of 2016."
The newly acquired convenience stores, which were purchased from a related party, will undergo major improvements in the coming months and all will be rebranded and retrofitted under the On the Move name.
"Competitively, we need to strive to differentiate ourselves against Wawa and RaceTrac," Reitano added.

Boynton Beach-based On the Move Corp. was founded in 2014 to engage in the acquisition of convenience stores. On the Move intends, subject to the availability of financing, to acquire up to 50 convenience stores in 2016 and open 25 Stewart's Express restaurants, most of which will be in Florida. Each restaurant will be operated under the On the Move brand. 
In management's opinion, Florida offers one of the best opportunities for growth and expansion over the next 10 years. 
"I am excited to bring in these three locations to add to our growing presence in South Florida," said Jay Seewald, president and chief operating officer of OTM. "With these locations, we intend to roll out our fresh food offerings through our exclusive partnership with Stewart's. Now, South Florida can enjoy a full menu of burgers, frankfurters, cheesesteaks, fries, Stewart's Root Beer and unique flavored ice cream floats, shakes, cones and sundaes 24/7."

On the Move Corporation Signs Exclusive 12 Year Development Deal with Iconic Restaurant Brand Stewart�s to Bring 250 Locations to the State of Florida & Georgia
 Boynton Beach, FL,  December 15, 2015 --(PR.com)-- On the Move Corporation (“OTM”) and Stewart’s All American Corp announced today the signing of an exclusive development agreement. The 12 year agreement calls for the development of 250 Stewart’s locations exclusive to On the Move convenience stores, throughout the States of Florida and Georgia to compete with Wawa, Race Trac and Quik Trip.“We couldn’t be more excited to bring an iconic brand like Stewart’s, with its rich history to compete with Wawa, Race Trac and other convenience store chains. We expect that Stewart’s history and following from the Northeast U.S. will contribute to our rapid expansion plans for the states of Florida and Georgia throughout 2016,” said R. J. Reitano, Chairman and CEO of OTM.OTM’s plans are to include a Stewart’s in as many On the Move Convenience stores as possible. Customers will enjoy a full menu of burgers, frankfurters, cheese-steaks, fries, Stewart’s Root Beer and unique flavored ice cream floats, shakes, cones and sundaes, 24/7. Management has identified five locations in the South Florida market to begin the process along with 50 additional acquisition targets throughout the State of Florida.“I am extremely impressed with the vast knowledge that the principals of On the Move have in the convenience store markets in Florida and Georgia. I am even more excited about the synergies we can put in place to grow Stewart’s and On the Move moving forward in unique ways," said Jim LaGanke, President of Stewart's All American Corp. “We have great opportunities in growing the Stewart’s franchise brand in the Northeast and now we have the perfect relationship with On the Move to expand with 250 more locations in the Southeast.”“We believe it’s a brand differentiator from Speedway, Dailey’s and stopping at a 7-11. There is no doubt in my mind that Jim and his team at Stewart’s have the expertise to develop something special at On the Move everyday. This will also gives our customers an alternative to the dominant fast food chains such as Subway, Burger King and McDonalds with a higher quality product competitively priced. We expect that our customers are going to enjoy this delicious menu no matter what time of day or night they visit us," added Reitano.Along with Stewart’s Express restaurants going in the to be developed On the Move convenience stores, On the Move, will also develop stand alone units, separate from it’s convenience stores, such as Sheetz, and bring the truly all-America menu to malls, airports and universities throughout Florida and Georgia.About On the Move CorporationOn the Move Corporation., is a publicly reporting company.

The principals of On the Move have owned and operated convenience stores in Florida for more than 20 years.About Stewart’s All American Corp.Established In 1924, Frank Stewart set out to create the world’s creamiest, best tasting root beer. Together with a chemist, blending 20 different extracts of roots, herbs, and berries, their special blend became an immediate hit! The first restaurant opened in Mansfield OH. Over the years, juicy hamburgers, frankfurters, tasty french fries with toppings, local specialties and desserts were added to the menu. Many franchises opened up, mostly as car-hops throughout the United States. Today current sites include full-service sit down restaurants, express kiosks and mobile concession trailers. No two Stewart’s Restaurants look exactly alike, but you can always expect to enjoy traditional American food and beverages with local fare at a “family-friendly” price. Today, Stewart’s is proud to stand as a unique & classic part of each community, just like the first roadside stand.Forward-Looking StatementsCertain statements in this press release contain or may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause On the Move Corporation's actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

On The Move Systems Corp. (OTC Pink: OMVS) operates within the transportation and logistical services industry. Shares of the company are down 17.95%, through early trading on Friday, June 9, 2017. Over the past month, On The Move Systems Corp. has seen average daily volume of 2.68 million shares. However, volume of 1.66 million shares or dollar volume of $99,600, has already exchanged hands on Friday.
Shares of On The Move Systems Corp. are facing pressure on Friday, after the company announced that its Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD) was featured at Verizon Communications, Inc. (NYSE: VZ)’s Operation Convergent Response Conference. Attendees and clients of the conference include law enforcement, military, private sector security, first responders, and more. The company demonstrated the use of its SMP S5 Security Robot in security and disaster response. Here is the full press release detailing of the RAD demonstration:
On The Move Systems Corp. Press Release:
HENDERSON, NV — (Marketwired) — 06/08/17 — On the Move Systems Corp. (OTC PINK: OMVS) is pleased to announce that Robotic Assistance Devices (RAD – www.roboticassistancedevices.com) presented at the Verizon Operation Convergent Response Conference to over 100 Verizon clients. RAD joined first responders, law enforcement, military, private sector experts and leading tech companies to demonstrate that its SMP S5 Security Guard Robot can play an integral role in disaster and security response scenarios.
The two-day event showcased the ability of RAD’s technology to:

Provide high-level security to affected areas, relieving manpower for other purposes.
Add medical triage support through autonomous or remote control delivery and pickup of medical supplies
Provide force multiplication for authorities to issue commands using long-range paging and two-way voice
Provide safe “eyes and ears” in hostage or active-shooter situations.

“This event was an opportunity for RAD to showcase how integral a security guard robot can be to disaster-response teams in a variety of situations from natural disaster, to active shooter and beyond,” said Steve Reinharz, Founder and President of RAD. “As emergency agencies continue to refine their response procedures, RAD looks forward to being a part of the collaboration to ensure the safety of our communities.”
RAD expects to deploy robots to end users in July. To date RAD has commitments for 15 robots for total contract values of approximately $1.5 million. OMVS is continuing its due diligence process on RAD as part of the binding LOI that was entered into last week for the purchase of 100% of RAD by OMVS. It is anticipated that the acquisition will close before August 10, 2017.
RAD currently has a sales pipeline of over 50 Fortune 500 companies and over 25 qualified dealers and distributors that have a combined customer base of more than 35,000 end user corporations.

NAS Is 'On the Move' in FloridaAcquiring c-store company in Sunshine State; looking for additional opportunities









December 02, 2014
MIAMI LAKES & BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. -- NAS Acquisition Inc. has announced that it has signed a letter of intent with On the Move Corp. to enter into a share exchange and plan of reorganization that will result in On the Move shareholders owning 98% of the outstanding shares of common stock and all shares of the preferred stock of the reorganized company.On the Move was founded in 2014 to engage in the acquisition of convenience stores in the state of Florida under the On the Move retail brand. It currently owns and operates five retail outlets in Lake, Orange and Palm Beach counties in Florida. Its stores offer a selection of food, including national chains such as Dunkin Donuts, Subway, Godfathers Pizza, sandwiches; beverage and tobacco products; health and beauty aids; automotive products; and other nonfood items. In addition, it is involved in the retail sale of gasoline or gasohol on a self-service basis.Boynton Beach, Fla.-based On the Move said it intends to acquire additional convenience stores in Florida because it believes the state offers the greatest opportunity for growth and expansion over the next 20 years.Miami Lakes, Fla.-based NAS is a publicly reporting company incorporated in Nevada in 2014; it is seeking to acquire business opportunities with new entities and will use the public marketplace to raise additional capital to expand into new products or markets, to develop new products or services or for other corporate purposes. It will not restrict its search to any specific business, industry or geographical location.The transaction is subject to the execution of definitive documents, an effective registration statement with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) and the reconfirmation of investors in the company's offering and approval of the company's shareholders.The company expects the transaction to close in early 2015, and it anticipates initiating the steps to commence public trading of its common stock.Related Content

Transfer to Wyoming
Transfer to Wyoming
Tired of your state raising your fees, tripling what you used to pay, billing you for a business license that they said last year you did not have to pay, now billing you for two years and putting a late charge on top of it?
If your company is current with the state it is in, we can re-domicile or file for Continuation (transfer) to move your company to Wyoming for, in some cases, less than what you are being charged this year for fees.  And next year your Wyoming state fees, in most cases, will be $50! (You can move a company from any state or country).
Here are the details for moving your business or corporation to a Wyoming corporation:

You can move any type of US company. An LLC, corporation, partnership, or public company to Wyoming. This is also called a Continuance.
Your company must be current with your state. The date for it’s renewal needs to be at least 2 to 4 weeks away from the time you give us the order, to transfer the corporation to Wyoming.
We will send you an electronic document to sign giving us the right to move the company. Then we will order a Certificate of Good Standing and Certified copies of the Articles from your state.  Once we have those in hand we will combine those with the paperwork for Wyoming and submit it.
About a week after that, we will send you a new corporate kit. It will include 20 new share certificates, new corporate seal and suggested meetings.  We will also include the Articles of Dissolution that you must file with your current state.  You may have to pay them a fee to file this.
Once that is done you are done paying your state. Your company will show as dissolved in your state’s database.  In Wyoming database it will show that it was a company formed in your state on such and such a date, moved to Wyoming on the date it was recorded in Wyoming.

You will gain the following benefits with a Wyoming Corporation: 

Your yearly fee to the State of Wyoming will be $50, assuming that you have no assets located inside the state.
Your company could come under the best asset protection laws in the nation.
You will retain the original formation date of the company.
You will retain the same tax id number.
You will not have to move assets to a newly formed company, risking federal taxes.
You will get the benefit of dealing with a company that has been doing this for over 14 years.

Reasons to move out of Nevada
In 2016 you will have to file a tax return with Nevada, even if you are under the gross receipts tax limit. This is going to provide Nevada with inside information in regards your company. Information that Wyoming does not ask for.
In 2016 your minimum State fee to Nevada for a corporation, will be at least $650. If you had a Wyoming corporation, in most cases this fee would be $50.
In 2016 you may be required to list owners with Nevada. Wyoming does not ask for this information.
Reasons to move out of Delaware
Wyoming corporate law is clear in that Wyoming corporations may engage in stock buy-back programs without any restrictions.  The restrictions that apply to payment of corporate dividends, in Delaware, are not included in the provision of Wyoming law that specifically authorizes stock buy-backs.  The legal certainty provided by Wyoming law on this point is a clear advantage over the present state of Delaware corporate and case law.  Additionally, there are substantial savings on state franchise tax.  We have had public companies save over $250,000 per year in state fees, by re-domiciling to Wyoming.
The cost to re-domicile is $595 plus any fees that your current state charges for documents and filings.
If you are moving a company, check with your attorney to see if your company is doing anything that would require it to be registered in the state you are moving from.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
