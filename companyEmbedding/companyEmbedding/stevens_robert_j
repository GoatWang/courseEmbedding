Early life[edit]
Born in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, Stevens is a summa cum laude graduate of Slippery Rock University from which he received the Distinguished Alumni Award. He earned a master's degree in engineering and management from Polytechnic University of New York and, with a Fairchild Fellowship, earned a master's degree in business administration from Columbia Business School in 1987.[1] He is a graduate of the Department of Defense Systems Management College Program Management course and also served in the United States Marine Corps.
Awards[edit]
He has been recognized by the National Management Association as Executive of the Year, by Government Computer News as the Industry Executive of the Year, by the Partnership for Public Service with the Private Sector Council Leadership Award, and by the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation with the Globe and Anchor Award.
In 2010, he received the Marine Corps Heritage Foundation’s inaugural LeJeune Recognition for Exemplary Leadership, and in 2011 he was recognized by the National Defense Industrial Association with the James Forrestal Industry Leadership Award and inducted into the Washington Business Hall of Fame. In May 2012, Stevens was recognized by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics with its highest honor, Honorary Fellow. In October 2012, he was presented the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Chairman’s Award, and in December 2012, Stevens became the 65th recipient of the National Aeronautic Association Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy,[2] which is presented annually for “significant public service of enduring value to aviation in the United States.” In March 2013, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation’s highest award, the Circle of Honor Award, and the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation’s Semper Fidelis Award, and in September 2014, he was awarded the Lone Sailor Award by the U.S. Navy Memorial Foundation.
Career[edit]
Stevens served as Lockheed Martin's CEO from August 2004 through December 2012, and was elected Chairman in April 2005 and served as Executive Chairman from January through December 2013.
Previously, he held a variety of increasingly responsible executive positions with the Corporation, including Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and head of Strategic Planning through a career that has included experience in program management, finance, manufacturing, and operations.
Stevens currently serves as the Lead Director of the Monsanto Company, and is a member of the Board of Directors of the United States Steel Corporation, the Congressional Medal of Honor Foundation, the Marine Corps Scholarship Foundation, and the Atlantic Council. He is a Fellow of the American Astronautical Society, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the Royal Aeronautical Society, and the International Academy of Astronautics, and he is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
In 2001, Stevens served on President George W. Bush's Commission to Examine the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry. In January 2012, he was appointed by President Barack Obama to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations and he currently serves as Chairman of the Director of National Intelligence Senior Advisory Group.
In October 2000, Stevens became President and Chief Operating Officer when Louis R. Hughes resigned[3] after only six months.[4] During 2001 and 2002, Stevens served on President Bush’s Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry. On August 5, 2004, he was elected Chief Executive Officer of Lockheed Martin by its board of directors, succeeding Vance Coffman. In 2004, he was recognized by the National Management Association as Executive of the Year. He was elected Chairman on April 28, 2005, retaining his previous responsibilities as President and CEO.[5] He has held a variety of executive positions including Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and head of Strategic Planning.
In 2009, Stevens was considered one of "The TopGun CEOs" by Brendan Wood International, an advisory agency.[6][7]
On April 26, 2012 it was announced that Robert J. Stevens would be retiring in December 2012 with then President and COO Chris Kubasik being promoted to CEO effective January 1, 2013.[8] However, in November 2012, an ethics violation forced Chris Kubasik to resign,[9] effectively making Marillyn Hewson (then Executive Vice President, Electronic Systems) the new President and COO immediately, with her taking the helm as CEO in January 2013. Bob Stevens was elected to remain as Executive Chairman through 2013.[10]

Peer reviewedVan Meter, Peggy; Stevens, Robert J. – Journal of Experimental Education, 2000Discusses the role of theory in each article of this special issue, showing how the authors make the case that there is real need to integrate theories and integrate findings related to questions of collaborative reasoning. Shows how a cohesive, integrated theory of group processes can be adopted.

The first study investigated the use of STR in 20 experimental sixth-grade classes in three schools matched with 39 classes in three control schools. The second study investigated the use of STR and STW in sixth, seventh,…Descriptors: Cooperative Learning, Instructional Effectiveness, Junior High Schools, Middle Schools

WELCOME TO STEVENS PRODUCTS

Stevens Products Inc. has been in business for over 70 years manufacturing quality electronic insulation. We are expert, niche manufacturers of custom tight tolerance rigid thermoset tubing from high temperature dielectric resistant resins and woven fiberglass cloth. Fiberglass epoxy, Nema grade G-10, G-11 is class F-rated for 155ºC continuous operating temperatures and has FR4 flame retardant properties. Fiberglass silicone, Nema grade G-7, is class H-rated for 180ºC and fiberglass polyimide material, Nema grade G-30, our highest temp material is 230ºC rated.
All material are Mil-Spec approved. Stevens’ expertise can interleave various substrates to provide higher dielectric resistance, RF shielding and moisture-proof barriers in tubing.

Lengths of tubing manufactured from these materials can be supplied in bulk size or cut to specific customer sizes for coilform winding. We bond custom coil bobbins and transformer housings. Custom made “header plates”, or endcaps, can be bonded to tubing or supplied loose for encapsulation cup applications. In addition, tubing can be cut into angles, “U” and “C” channels or other specific shapes per your structural  requirements.
Tubing is available from thousands of stock mandrels eliminating costly tooling charges. We offer everything from .049" round ID micro miniature sizes up to 13" plus ID. Square and rectangular offerings start at .020" X .079" ID and go up to 8" square in size.
In addition to tubing we have custom molding facilities as well. Match metal dies and custom steel rule trim dies produce a variety of motor winding end turn insulators and caps.
Stevens Products has developed a custom line of printed circuit board manufacturing aides. Our “gold finger gloves” cover gold contacts can eliminate use of costly Kapton tape. PCB stiffeners clip on board edges and incorporate our proprietary fiberglass epoxy pultruded rod. The rod has 150,000 PSI flexural strength and prevents board twist and warp through wave solder, re-flow and other processes. PCB board “carriers” clip on board edges to facilitate leveling and conveyor belt contact issues. An infinite array of “connector covers” can be fabricated to fit specific needs from our vast open stock tooling.
