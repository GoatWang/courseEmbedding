FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

	WHY INVEST IN STAG?
There are countless places to invest your money - and it’s not always easy to determine the right choice. With a proven investment strategy and a stable, diversified portfolio, we offer a powerful combination of income plus growth. Our track record speaks for itself, but it’s our unique asset acquisition strategy that sets us apart:

	Our Investment Strategy
 

	Overlay portfolio risk management guidelines to ensure diversification by tenant, industry, lease term, and geography.
	 


 Our Market 
The US industrial market is a large, attractive market providing us with extensive opportunities for accretive growth.


			The industrial market in the United States is a large (est. $1 trillion)(2) and fragmented market that offers sustainable acquisition opportunities throughout all economic cycles. STAG estimates its target market (single-tenant, industrial properties anticipated to meet our investment criteria) to be $250+ billion.

			Industrial property ownership is extraordinarily fragmented with the largest owner controlling less than 3%. Ownership in our target asset class tends to be local or regional, non-institutional owners.

			Our strategy is further aided by industrial trends, such as the on-shoring of manufacturing, shortening/fattening of supply chains and the growth in e-commerce and the related shifting of product from retail stores into warehouses.


		 





Our Platform 


			Founded in 2003 to focus solely on our target asset class.

			Experienced team of 70+ professionals has acquired $2 billion of our target assets since IPO.

			Asset profile and platform architecture allows us to scale our business efficiently.







Our Performance(3) 


			185% total return since IPO in 2011.

			Acquired over $2 billion of target properties since IPO, containing approximately 56 million square feet representing asset growth of 386%.

			Dividend yield of 5.6% paid monthly – compounded annual dividend growth of 5% since IPO.

(2) Based on STAG management’s estimates using publicly available data on industrial square footage in the United States and an assumed value per square foot. 
		(3) The above facts and figures have been updated as of quarter ended 3/31/2017

	COMPANY OVERVIEW


STAG Industrial, Inc. (NYSE: STAG) is a Boston-based real estate investment trust focused on the acquisition and operation of single-tenant, industrial properties throughout the United States. 
Since IPO, we have deployed over $2 billion of capital, representing the acquisition of 275 buildings totaling approximately 56 million rentable square feet.




	Business Strategy


Mission
	To be a disciplined relative value investor and the preeminent institutional owner and operator of single-tenant, industrial properties in the United States


Opportunity
	Individual, single-tenant, industrial properties are priced according to the binary nature of their cash flows. The acquisition and contribution of these binary risk cash flows to a diversified portfolio is a value add proposition in all market environments


Business Model
	Identify relative value across all markets, industries, and tenants through the principled application of our proprietary risk assessment model. A sophisticated, institutional platform will have myriad execution and operational advantages in a fragmented, non-institutional market.


Target Result
	To consistently deliver best-in-class shareholder returns in all market environments by providing a fully covered dividend combined with significant accretive growth
