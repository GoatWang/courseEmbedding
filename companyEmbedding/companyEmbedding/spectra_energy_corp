Spectra Energy Corp, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operates in three key areas of the natural gas industry: transmission and storage, distribution, and gathering and processing. Spectra was formed in late 2006 from the spin-off from Duke Energy. Spectra owns the Texas Eastern Pipeline (TETCo), a major natural gas pipeline which brings gas from the Gulf of Mexico coast in Texas to the New York City area. It is one of the largest pipeline systems in the United States.[3] Spectra also operates three oil pipelines.[4]

History[edit]
In 2002, Duke Energy acquired Westcoast Energy, a Canadian corporation, which owned Chatham, Ontario-based Union Gas, regulated under the 1998 Ontario Energy Board Act.
On December 29, 2006 Standard & Poor's added Spectra Energy Corp. to its S&P 500 Index, replacing Parametric Technology Corp. (NASDAQ: PMTC), a software company, which then moved to the S&P MidCap 400 list instead.[5] Spectra began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SE.
On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas business, including Westcoast Energy and Union Gas, to form Spectra Energy. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of Spectra Energy for every 2 shares of Duke Energy.
By early August 2007, the S&P 500 breached its first 10% correction in over four years, and the shares of Spectra Energy Corp. sunk to their lowest point since trading had begun in December 2006, after the company announced that second quarter earnings had dropped 39 percent.[6]
In 2009, the company's financial performance had improved and had a total shareholder return of 38.3 percent.
In 2011, Spectra Energy achieved record net income and surpassed its earnings target by more than 7 percent. And, in 2011, the company increased its annual dividend to $1.12, representing a nearly 8 percent increase.[citation needed]
On February 27, 2017, Spectra Energy merged with Enbridge, forming North America's largest energy infrastructure company.
Environmental record[edit]
For 2010, Spectra Energy was listed in the Newsweek green rankings, with a ranking of 280 out of the 500 largest publicly traded corporations in America. The listing was based on environmental impacts, green policies, and a reputation survey.[7]
Despite those high rankings, Spectra Energy's environmental record is not without incidents or government imposed penalties.[8] Since 2006, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reports twenty-five separate incidents at Spectra's Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline ranging from equipment failure to incorrect operations to pipe corrosion. Combined, those incidents caused $12,036,495 in property damage, and the US federal government fined Spectra a total of $403,100 over that period.[9] The most recent incident for that pipeline occurred on May 31, 2015 when a piece of the pipeline in the Arkansas River near Little Rock, Arkansas ruptured.[10] Similarly the US federal government has imposed $154,700 in penalties since 2007 at Spectra's Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline for a single incident from 2010.[11] An incident in 2010 from Spectra's Southeast Supply Header Pipeline did $561,563 in property damage, which led to it being fined a total of $201,300 by the US federal government.[12]
Spectra Energy may be considered the single largest private-sector source of greenhouse gases in British Columbia.[13] Since it co-owned DCP Midstream Partners with ConocoPhillips, Spectra Energy was reported in 2005 to emit 19,746 tons of nitrogen oxides and 9,286 tons of volatile organic compounds per year.[14] As of August 2015, Canada's National Energy Board has fined Spectra's subsidiary Westcoast Energy a total of $122,300 for violations.[15]

Enbridge increases dividend by 10%
1:28 p.m. Jan. 5, 2017
					  - By Claudia Assis
		  
Enbridge increases dividend by 10%Enbridge Inc.   said late Thursday its board of directors has authorized a 10% dividend increase, setting the dividend at 58.3 cents a share and payable March 1 to shareholders of record Feb. 15. The increase is independent of the company's planned acquisition of Spectra Energy Corp.   and as previously announced Enbridge expects to increase its dividend by about 15% once the deal closes, the company said. "The merger with Spectra Energy brings together the highest quality liquids and natural gas infrastructure franchises in North America with the largest and most diversified growth projects in the industry," CEO Al Monaco said in a statement. "The strength of this opportunity set gives us confidence that, following a 15 percent increase in 2017, we will be able to extend our industry leading dividend growth rate of 10-12 percent per annum through 2024." Enbridge and Spectra Energy announced their intention to merge in September, and the deal is expected to close in the first quarter.

Spectra Energy Corp, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operates in three key areas of the natural gas industry: transmission and storage, distribution, and gathering and processing. Spectra was formed in late 2006 from the spin-off from Duke Energy. Spectra owns the Texas Eastern Pipeline (TETCo), a major natural gas pipeline which brings gas from the Gulf of Mexico coast in Texas to the New York City area. It is one of the largest pipeline systems in the United States.[3] Spectra also operates three oil pipelines.[4]

History[edit]
In 2002, Duke Energy acquired Westcoast Energy, a Canadian corporation, which owned Chatham, Ontario-based Union Gas, regulated under the 1998 Ontario Energy Board Act.
On December 29, 2006 Standard & Poor's added Spectra Energy Corp. to its S&P 500 Index, replacing Parametric Technology Corp. (NASDAQ: PMTC), a software company, which then moved to the S&P MidCap 400 list instead.[5] Spectra began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SE.
On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas business, including Westcoast Energy and Union Gas, to form Spectra Energy. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of Spectra Energy for every 2 shares of Duke Energy.
By early August 2007, the S&P 500 breached its first 10% correction in over four years, and the shares of Spectra Energy Corp. sunk to their lowest point since trading had begun in December 2006, after the company announced that second quarter earnings had dropped 39 percent.[6]
In 2009, the company's financial performance had improved and had a total shareholder return of 38.3 percent.
In 2011, Spectra Energy achieved record net income and surpassed its earnings target by more than 7 percent. And, in 2011, the company increased its annual dividend to $1.12, representing a nearly 8 percent increase.[citation needed]
On February 27, 2017, Spectra Energy merged with Enbridge, forming North America's largest energy infrastructure company.
Environmental record[edit]
For 2010, Spectra Energy was listed in the Newsweek green rankings, with a ranking of 280 out of the 500 largest publicly traded corporations in America. The listing was based on environmental impacts, green policies, and a reputation survey.[7]
Despite those high rankings, Spectra Energy's environmental record is not without incidents or government imposed penalties.[8] Since 2006, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reports twenty-five separate incidents at Spectra's Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline ranging from equipment failure to incorrect operations to pipe corrosion. Combined, those incidents caused $12,036,495 in property damage, and the US federal government fined Spectra a total of $403,100 over that period.[9] The most recent incident for that pipeline occurred on May 31, 2015 when a piece of the pipeline in the Arkansas River near Little Rock, Arkansas ruptured.[10] Similarly the US federal government has imposed $154,700 in penalties since 2007 at Spectra's Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline for a single incident from 2010.[11] An incident in 2010 from Spectra's Southeast Supply Header Pipeline did $561,563 in property damage, which led to it being fined a total of $201,300 by the US federal government.[12]
Spectra Energy may be considered the single largest private-sector source of greenhouse gases in British Columbia.[13] Since it co-owned DCP Midstream Partners with ConocoPhillips, Spectra Energy was reported in 2005 to emit 19,746 tons of nitrogen oxides and 9,286 tons of volatile organic compounds per year.[14] As of August 2015, Canada's National Energy Board has fined Spectra's subsidiary Westcoast Energy a total of $122,300 for violations.[15]

Spectra Energy Corp, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operates in three key areas of the natural gas industry: transmission and storage, distribution, and gathering and processing. Spectra was formed in late 2006 from the spin-off from Duke Energy. Spectra owns the Texas Eastern Pipeline (TETCo), a major natural gas pipeline which brings gas from the Gulf of Mexico coast in Texas to the New York City area. It is one of the largest pipeline systems in the United States.[3] Spectra also operates three oil pipelines.[4]

History[edit]
In 2002, Duke Energy acquired Westcoast Energy, a Canadian corporation, which owned Chatham, Ontario-based Union Gas, regulated under the 1998 Ontario Energy Board Act.
On December 29, 2006 Standard & Poor's added Spectra Energy Corp. to its S&P 500 Index, replacing Parametric Technology Corp. (NASDAQ: PMTC), a software company, which then moved to the S&P MidCap 400 list instead.[5] Spectra began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SE.
On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas business, including Westcoast Energy and Union Gas, to form Spectra Energy. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of Spectra Energy for every 2 shares of Duke Energy.
By early August 2007, the S&P 500 breached its first 10% correction in over four years, and the shares of Spectra Energy Corp. sunk to their lowest point since trading had begun in December 2006, after the company announced that second quarter earnings had dropped 39 percent.[6]
In 2009, the company's financial performance had improved and had a total shareholder return of 38.3 percent.
In 2011, Spectra Energy achieved record net income and surpassed its earnings target by more than 7 percent. And, in 2011, the company increased its annual dividend to $1.12, representing a nearly 8 percent increase.[citation needed]
On February 27, 2017, Spectra Energy merged with Enbridge, forming North America's largest energy infrastructure company.
Environmental record[edit]
For 2010, Spectra Energy was listed in the Newsweek green rankings, with a ranking of 280 out of the 500 largest publicly traded corporations in America. The listing was based on environmental impacts, green policies, and a reputation survey.[7]
Despite those high rankings, Spectra Energy's environmental record is not without incidents or government imposed penalties.[8] Since 2006, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reports twenty-five separate incidents at Spectra's Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline ranging from equipment failure to incorrect operations to pipe corrosion. Combined, those incidents caused $12,036,495 in property damage, and the US federal government fined Spectra a total of $403,100 over that period.[9] The most recent incident for that pipeline occurred on May 31, 2015 when a piece of the pipeline in the Arkansas River near Little Rock, Arkansas ruptured.[10] Similarly the US federal government has imposed $154,700 in penalties since 2007 at Spectra's Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline for a single incident from 2010.[11] An incident in 2010 from Spectra's Southeast Supply Header Pipeline did $561,563 in property damage, which led to it being fined a total of $201,300 by the US federal government.[12]
Spectra Energy may be considered the single largest private-sector source of greenhouse gases in British Columbia.[13] Since it co-owned DCP Midstream Partners with ConocoPhillips, Spectra Energy was reported in 2005 to emit 19,746 tons of nitrogen oxides and 9,286 tons of volatile organic compounds per year.[14] As of August 2015, Canada's National Energy Board has fined Spectra's subsidiary Westcoast Energy a total of $122,300 for violations.[15]
Current natural gas pipelines[edit]

Southeast Supply Header Pipeline, a pipeline running through Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline
The Union Gas Pipeline System, a pipeline system in Ontario through Spectra Energy's subsidiary Union Gas.

Proposed natural gas pipelines[edit]

PennEast Pipeline, a pipeline to run through New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
NEXUS Gas Transmission Pipeline, a pipeline to run through Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario.
Sabal Trail Transmission Pipeline, a pipeline to run from central Alabama through southwest Georgia to Orange County, Florida. A minority stake in the venture is owned by NextEra Energy and Duke Energy.

Current oil pipelines[edit]

Express Pipeline, a pipeline running from Hardisty, Alberta, Canada to Casper, Wyoming.
Platte Pipeline, a pipeline running from Casper, Wyoming to Wood River, Illinois.
Sand Hills and Southern Hills Pipeline, a pipeline owned by DCP Midstream, Phillips 66, and Spectra Energy equally.

Merger with Enbridge[edit]
Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. on September 6, 2016, agreed to buy Houston’s Spectra Energy Corp. in an all-stock deal valued at about $28 billion, creating a North American energy-infrastructure giant.[16]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Spectra Energy Becomes #146 Most Shorted S&P 500 Component, Replacing Tegna
The most recent short interest data has been released for the 10/14/2016 settlement date, and we here at Dividend Channel like to sift through this fresh data and order the underlying components of the S&P 500 by "days to cover." There are a number of ways to look at short data, for example the total number of shares short; but one metric that we find particularly useful is the "days to cover" metric because it considers both the total shares short and the average daily volume of shares typically traded. The number of shares short is then compared to the average daily volume, in order to calculate the total number of trading days it would take to close out all of the open short positions if every share traded represented a short position being closed.

Spectra Energy Corp, headquartered in Houston, Texas, operates in three key areas of the natural gas industry: transmission and storage, distribution, and gathering and processing. Spectra was formed in late 2006 from the spin-off from Duke Energy. Spectra owns the Texas Eastern Pipeline (TETCo), a major natural gas pipeline which brings gas from the Gulf of Mexico coast in Texas to the New York City area. It is one of the largest pipeline systems in the United States.[3] Spectra also operates three oil pipelines.[4]

History[edit]
In 2002, Duke Energy acquired Westcoast Energy, a Canadian corporation, which owned Chatham, Ontario-based Union Gas, regulated under the 1998 Ontario Energy Board Act.
On December 29, 2006 Standard & Poor's added Spectra Energy Corp. to its S&P 500 Index, replacing Parametric Technology Corp. (NASDAQ: PMTC), a software company, which then moved to the S&P MidCap 400 list instead.[5] Spectra began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol SE.
On January 3, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its natural gas business, including Westcoast Energy and Union Gas, to form Spectra Energy. Duke Energy shareholders received 1 share of Spectra Energy for every 2 shares of Duke Energy.
By early August 2007, the S&P 500 breached its first 10% correction in over four years, and the shares of Spectra Energy Corp. sunk to their lowest point since trading had begun in December 2006, after the company announced that second quarter earnings had dropped 39 percent.[6]
In 2009, the company's financial performance had improved and had a total shareholder return of 38.3 percent.
In 2011, Spectra Energy achieved record net income and surpassed its earnings target by more than 7 percent. And, in 2011, the company increased its annual dividend to $1.12, representing a nearly 8 percent increase.[citation needed]
On February 27, 2017, Spectra Energy merged with Enbridge, forming North America's largest energy infrastructure company.
Environmental record[edit]
For 2010, Spectra Energy was listed in the Newsweek green rankings, with a ranking of 280 out of the 500 largest publicly traded corporations in America. The listing was based on environmental impacts, green policies, and a reputation survey.[7]
Despite those high rankings, Spectra Energy's environmental record is not without incidents or government imposed penalties.[8] Since 2006, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration reports twenty-five separate incidents at Spectra's Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline ranging from equipment failure to incorrect operations to pipe corrosion. Combined, those incidents caused $12,036,495 in property damage, and the US federal government fined Spectra a total of $403,100 over that period.[9] The most recent incident for that pipeline occurred on May 31, 2015 when a piece of the pipeline in the Arkansas River near Little Rock, Arkansas ruptured.[10] Similarly the US federal government has imposed $154,700 in penalties since 2007 at Spectra's Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline for a single incident from 2010.[11] An incident in 2010 from Spectra's Southeast Supply Header Pipeline did $561,563 in property damage, which led to it being fined a total of $201,300 by the US federal government.[12]
Spectra Energy may be considered the single largest private-sector source of greenhouse gases in British Columbia.[13] Since it co-owned DCP Midstream Partners with ConocoPhillips, Spectra Energy was reported in 2005 to emit 19,746 tons of nitrogen oxides and 9,286 tons of volatile organic compounds per year.[14] As of August 2015, Canada's National Energy Board has fined Spectra's subsidiary Westcoast Energy a total of $122,300 for violations.[15]

Merger with Enbridge[edit]
