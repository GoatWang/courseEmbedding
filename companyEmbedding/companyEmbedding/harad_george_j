      ■ George J. Harad advanced through the corporate structure at Boise
      Cascade, a major paper and wood products manufacturer, to become the
      company's chairman and chief executive officer in 1995. After
      earning an MBA with honors from Harvard Business School, Harad joined the
      company with an interest in pursuing a career in real estate and finance.
      His career path at Boise led him to several executive positions, including
      chief financial officer, chief operating officer, and president before he
      assumed the top leadership position with the company. Harad restructured
      Boise's management and focused the company's sales efforts
      on distribution rather than manufacturing.
    

      A LONG WAY FROM PHILADELPHIA
    

      Harad grew up in Philadelphia, where he played sandlot baseball as a
      youngster. He remained an active baseball player when he enrolled at
      Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He earned a
      bachelor's degree in government in 1965 and graduated 
      
        magna cum laude
      
      . Harad was initially attracted to government as a career and enrolled at
      the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University with the
      intention of earning a Ph.D. in political science.
    

      Harad's plans changed while he was at Harvard, however, and he
      switched from his Ph.D. program to the master's program in business
      administration at Harvard Business School. While he was in business
      school, he was elected a George Baker Scholar, the highest honor given to
      a Harvard student prior to graduation. Harad received his MBA in 1971.
      While he was still enrolled at Harvard, he worked as a staff consultant at
      the Boston Consulting Group from 1970 to 1971.
    

      A DIFFERENT BUSINESS CLIMATE
    

      Harad's primary interest when he graduated from Harvard was real
      estate and finance. He took a closer look at Boise Cascade because the
      company had an opening in its real estate subsidiary. "The company
      did everything from build single-family homes to develop high-rise
      buildings and resorts," Harad told 
      
        PaperAge Magazine
      
       in 2001. "The fact that the subsidiary was based in Palo Alto,
      California, and I had endured six winters in Boston also may have had
      something to do with my decision [to join the company]" (
      
        PaperAge Magazine
      
      , March 2001).
    

      Harad first became an administrative assistant to the senior vice
      president for housing after he joined Boise Cascade. He worked in a
      variety of positions over the next 20 years. He became a finance manager
      for Boise's Reality Group in 1972 and held the position until 1976.
      That year he moved to Boise, Idaho to become the company's manager
      of corporate development. In 1980 he was appointed director of retirement
      funds and risk management. Two years later he became one
       of Boise's vice presidents. He continued to advance in the
      corporation in 1984, when he was appointed senior vice president and chief
      financial officer. Harad added the title of executive vice president to
      his resume in 1989. In 1990 he was promoted to executive vice president in
      the company's paper division, which accounted for about 60 percent
      of the company's total sales.
    

      BOISE CASCADE'S NEW PRESIDENT
    

      Boise Cascade named Harad as its president and chief operating officer in
      1991. He assumed responsibility for each of the company's
      operations that involved paper and paper products, office supplies, and
      building products. He also oversaw Boise's timber resources branch.
      "George Harad is one of the most capable and talented executives I
      know," said John B. Fery, at that time the chairman and chief
      executive officer of Boise Cascade. "He has succeeded notably in
      each of the many and varied assignments he's had in 20 years with
      our company. He's precisely the caliber of executive that Boise
      Cascade needs as its chief operating officer" (PR Newswire,
      December 13, 1991).
    

      Harad and his corporation endured three difficult years between 1991 and
      1994. During that time, the paper industry, which had developed a
      reputation for instability over the years, experienced another downturn.
      The company reported combined losses of nearly a half billion dollars
      during those three years. Harad, however, stood his ground. "Both
      our wood products manufacturing business and our paper business are highly
      volatile, and that's only one of the challenges the businesses
      present," Harad said. "But I like a challenge. From a
      manager's perspective, volatility can be attractive because it
      creates as many opportunities as problems" (
      
        PaperAge Magazine
      
      , March 2001).
    

      CEO AND CHAIRMAN
    

      Fery retired from Boise in 1994 after 37 years with the company.
      Harad's impressive performance as president and COO led to his
      promotion to president and chief executive officer of the company. He
      became the chairman and CEO of Boise in 1995. After becoming
      Boise's chairman, Harad initiated a series of changes in the
      company's management structure. "My business school training
      and my early career were focused on finance, and I brought that
      perspective with me when I became CEO," Harad said in 2001.
      "It seemed clear that if Boise Cascade—and our industry as a
      whole—were going to survive, we had to do a better job at earning
      our cost of capital" (
      
        PaperAge Magazine
      
      , March 2001).
    

      Harad's next move was to build Boise's distribution business
      to the extent that the company was earning more from distribution than
      from manufacturing. Sales continued to increase. Boise became one of the
      first paper products companies to embrace e-business, with customers
      placing as many as 11,000 orders through the company's Web site by
      2001. Harad's performance at Boise earned him an award from 
      
        PaperAge Magazine
      
       as Executive Papermaker of the Year in both 2001 and 2004.
    

      As the American economy weakened during the early 2000s, however, the
      paper industry declined along with many others. Boise, which had
      officially dropped the word "Cascade" from its name in 2002,
      also suffered attacks from environmentalists on the basis of its timber
      policies. Harad was himself the target of much of the criticism since he
      was the company's CEO. He rebuffed the critics by pointing out
      repeatedly that the company adhered to environmental regulations.
      "Frankly they can't win on facts, so they use smear
      tactics," Harad said of these opponents (
      
        Idaho Statesman
      
      , November 22, 2002).
    

      In addition to Harad's duties at Boise, he was active in numerous
      professional and civic associations, including the American Forest and
      Paper Association, the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement,
      the Nature Conservancy of Idaho, the Idaho Business Council, the Boise
      Council for Gifted/Talented Students, the Boise Public Schools Education
      Foundation, and the Community Youth Connection.

■ George J. Harad advanced through the corporate structure at Boise Cascade, a major paper and wood products manufacturer, to become the company's chairman and chief executive officer in 1995. After earning an MBA with honors from Harvard Business School, Harad joined the company with an interest in pursuing a career in real estate and finance. His career path at Boise led him to several executive positions, including chief financial officer, chief operating officer, and president before he assumed the top leadership position with the company. Harad restructured Boise's management and focused the company's sales efforts on distribution rather than manufacturing.
A LONG WAY FROM PHILADELPHIA


Harad grew up in Philadelphia, where he played sandlot baseball as a youngster. He remained an active baseball player when he enrolled at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He earned a bachelor's degree in government in 1965 and graduated magna cum laude. Harad was initially attracted to government as a career and enrolled at the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University with the intention of earning a Ph.D. in political science.
Harad's plans changed while he was at Harvard, however, and he switched from his Ph.D. program to the master's program in business administration at Harvard Business School. While he was in business school, he was elected a George Baker Scholar, the highest honor given to a Harvard student prior to graduation. Harad received his MBA in 1971. While he was still enrolled at Harvard, he worked as a staff consultant at the Boston Consulting Group from 1970 to 1971.
A DIFFERENT BUSINESS CLIMATE
Harad's primary interest when he graduated from Harvard was real estate and finance. He took a closer look at Boise Cascade because the company had an opening in its real estate subsidiary. "The company did everything from build single-family homes to develop high-rise buildings and resorts," Harad told PaperAge Magazine in 2001. "The fact that the subsidiary was based in Palo Alto, California, and I had endured six winters in Boston also may have had something to do with my decision [to join the company]" (PaperAge Magazine, March 2001).
Harad first became an administrative assistant to the senior vice president for housing after he joined Boise Cascade. He worked in a variety of positions over the next 20 years. He became a finance manager for Boise's Reality Group in 1972 and held the position until 1976. That year he moved to Boise, Idaho to become the company's manager of corporate development. In 1980 he was appointed director of retirement funds and risk management. Two years later he became one of Boise's vice presidents. He continued to advance in the corporation in 1984, when he was appointed senior vice president and chief financial officer. Harad added the title of executive vice president to his resume in 1989. In 1990 he was promoted to executive vice president in the company's paper division, which accounted for about 60 percent of the company's total sales.
BOISE CASCADE'S NEW PRESIDENT
Boise Cascade named Harad as its president and chief operating officer in 1991. He assumed responsibility for each of the company's operations that involved paper and paper products, office supplies, and building products. He also oversaw Boise's timber resources branch. "George Harad is one of the most capable and talented executives I know," said John B. Fery, at that time the chairman and chief executive officer of Boise Cascade. "He has succeeded notably in each of the many and varied assignments he's had in 20 years with our company. He's precisely the caliber of executive that Boise Cascade needs as its chief operating officer" (PR Newswire, December 13, 1991).
Harad and his corporation endured three difficult years between 1991 and 1994. During that time, the paper industry, which had developed a reputation for instability over the years, experienced another downturn. The company reported combined losses of nearly a half billion dollars during those three years. Harad, however, stood his ground. "Both our wood products manufacturing business and our paper business are highly volatile, and that's only one of the challenges the businesses present," Harad said. "But I like a challenge. From a manager's perspective, volatility can be attractive because it creates as many opportunities as problems" (PaperAge Magazine, March 2001).
CEO AND CHAIRMAN
Fery retired from Boise in 1994 after 37 years with the company. Harad's impressive performance as president and COO led to his promotion to president and chief executive officer of the company. He became the chairman and CEO of Boise in 1995. After becoming Boise's chairman, Harad initiated a series of changes in the company's management structure. "My business school training and my early career were focused on finance, and I brought that perspective with me when I became CEO," Harad said in 2001. "It seemed clear that if Boise Cascade—and our industry as a whole—were going to survive, we had to do a better job at earning our cost of capital" (PaperAge Magazine, March 2001).
Harad's next move was to build Boise's distribution business to the extent that the company was earning more from distribution than from manufacturing. Sales continued to increase. Boise became one of the first paper products companies to embrace e-business, with customers placing as many as 11,000 orders through the company's Web site by 2001. Harad's performance at Boise earned him an award from PaperAge Magazine as Executive Papermaker of the Year in both 2001 and 2004.
As the American economy weakened during the early 2000s, however, the paper industry declined along with many others. Boise, which had officially dropped the word "Cascade" from its name in 2002, also suffered attacks from environmentalists on the basis of its timber policies. Harad was himself the target of much of the criticism since he was the company's CEO. He rebuffed the critics by pointing out repeatedly that the company adhered to environmental regulations. "Frankly they can't win on facts, so they use smear tactics," Harad said of these opponents (Idaho Statesman, November 22, 2002).


In addition to Harad's duties at Boise, he was active in numerous professional and civic associations, including the American Forest and Paper Association, the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, the Nature Conservancy of Idaho, the Idaho Business Council, the Boise Council for Gifted/Talented Students, the Boise Public Schools Education Foundation, and the Community Youth Connection.

									Encyclopedia.com gives you the ability to cite reference entries and articles according to common styles from the Modern Language Association (MLA), The Chicago Manual of Style, and the American Psychological Association (APA).
								

									Within the “Cite this article” tool, pick a style to see how all available information looks when formatted according to that style.  Then, copy and paste the text into your bibliography or works cited list.
								

									Because each style has its own formatting nuances that evolve over time and not all information is available for every reference entry or article, Encyclopedia.com cannot guarantee each citation it generates.  Therefore, it’s best to use Encyclopedia.com citations as a starting point before checking the style against your school or publication’s requirements and the most-recent information available at these sites:

The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.

Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.

See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."
