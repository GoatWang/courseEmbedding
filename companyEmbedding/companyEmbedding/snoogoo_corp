Snoogoo - Tour
























What is Snoogoo?
Take the Tour




Search

                The best of three worlds: Snoogoo brings Google, Bing, and Yahoo together under one roof. Use all three, 
                or choose your favourite search engine to find what you need, when you need it.
            





Clips

                Clip the useful information, trash the rest. Drag and drop information you need to your clipboard and keep it 
                for as long as you want! Snoogoo helps you keep the information you need, stop letting valuable searches and 
                time slip through the cracks.
            





Organize

                Now it’s time to do a little bit of work (only a little, we promise). Move your tags into Projects and decide if 
                you want to keep the information to yourself, hide it from the world, or share with the community. Keep your projects 
                organized by putting them in folders to keep track of all your vital searches.
            





Share

                When you publish your projects on Snoogoo, the Images, Videos, Webpages and discussions you have created are visible 
                to the entire community, but only if you want them to be public. Allow others to add to your project and multiply your 
                search power by harnessing the power of others with common interests.
            





Collaborate

                Private and hidden projects are hidden from the prying eyes of others. By inviting others to collaborate you can work 
                on secure (private projects) for corporate, academic or just personal research with colleagues, co-workers and friends. 
                Working on hidden projects you can prepare a project to perfection before you take it public, or keep it hidden, it’s all 
                up to you.
            





Go Viral

                We’re all looking for something. It might be a cute kitten, or the next piece of statistical data regarding crude oil futures. 
                Share your research with others, and who knows where it will go. 
            





Publish

                Snoogoo isn’t just a search site, it’s something new. A Place where you can store your searches, and discuss them. Its 
                flexibility and social features makes it the place to learn what’s going on, not just around you but in all the subjects 
                you’re interested in. 
            





Go Mobile

                Tired of leaving your bookmarks at home? Can’t find what you searched for at the office? Don’t worry, we have you covered. 
                Go mobile with our iPad app, or keep what you found on Snoogoo its available on any computer! Keep your eyes peeled 
                for our iPhone and Android applications coming soon.
