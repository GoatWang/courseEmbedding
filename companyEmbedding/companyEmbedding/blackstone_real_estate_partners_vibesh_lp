Real Estate
 





Who We Are
We are the largest real estate private equity firm in the world today with $104 billion of assets under management. We operate around the globe with investments and people in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. We seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors across cycles and over the long term. The Blackstone Real Estate platform encompasses investments across the risk spectrum from opportunistic to core+ to debt. 

We seek to acquire high quality investments at discounts to replacement cost. We then improve the properties through hands-on management and targeted value-add initiatives. Our efforts result in solid returns for investors and strong economic assets for communities. Blackstone’s real estate portfolio includes office, retail, hotel, industrial and residential properties. Major holdings include Hilton Worldwide, Invitation Homes (single family homes), Logicor (pan-European logistics), SCPG (Chinese shopping malls), and prime office buildings in the world’s major cities. Blackstone real estate also operates one of the leading real estate finance platforms, including management of the publicly traded Blackstone Mortgage Trust (NYSE:BXMT).









				A Message from Jon Gray, Global Head of Real Estate
			






















 $104b of
Investor Capital
Blackstone’s proprietary data enables it to target specific themes with conviction and deploy significant amounts of discretionary capital. Blackstone Real Estate deployed more than $69.9b of discretionary capital since the global financial crisis.




 
Approximately $200b
Value of Gross Assets

The breadth of Blackstone Real Estate’s portfolio provides valuable real-time proprietary market data. We believe this information enables Blackstone to identify mispriced and/or out-of-favor asset classes more rapidly than its competitors.






 451+ Real Estate
Professionals

The team consists of over 451 real estate professionals in 12 offices around the globe. We believe this breadth enables Blackstone to identify and evaluate opportunities worldwide.






$104billion
Total Assets Under Management




“ “By investing in real estate assets around the globe, we’re helping to build a secure financial future for millions of employees, retirees, schools, non-profit organizations and others. We’re enhancing the value of properties that anchor communities and create good jobs.”   - Jonathan D. Gray Global Head of Real Estate   








 
 
Opportunistic 
 Buy it, Fix it, Sell it. Our opportunistic platform employs a straightforward investment strategy. We seek to acquire high quality, well located assets at discounts to replacement cost, address any property or business issues through aggressive asset management, and sell the assets once Blackstone Real Estate’s objectives are accomplished.


 




 
 
Core+

Blackstone Real Estate’s Core+ business seeks to leverage Blackstone’s “buy it, fix it” strategy to deliver compelling risk-adjusted returns in the core+ space. We target high quality assets in gateway cities with a more modest risk profile, longer hold periods, and a significant current income component. 
 




 
 
Debt 

With over $41 billion of loans made or acquired since its inception in 2008, Blackstone Real Estate’s debt strategies group has established itself as a leading platform providing creative lending solutions.

Willis Tower is a 3.8 million square foot, 110-story mixed use tower in downtown Chicago. The iconic property is the second tallest office building in the U.S, and its SkyDeck/Ledge is the most popular tourist attraction in the city. Blackstone Real Estate has embarked on an extensive renovation plan that includes a comprehensive repositioning of the building’s retail space, state-of-the-art amenities, and new entertainment options that we believe will complement and enhance the building’s standing as one of Chicago’s premier tourist destinations.

Residential

145,000 multifamily units

                Major investor across the U.S. and globally

* As of June 30, 2017
















Stuyvesant Town / Peter Cooper Village is an irreplaceable apartment community totaling 11,200 units in 56 buildings on 80 acres in Manhattan’s East Village. The community was developed to provide affordable housing for returning World War II veterans and has been an important part of New York City ever since. Blackstone Real Estate leveraged its relationships and ability to transact in scale with speed and certainty to acquire the property at a highly compelling basis. The most important aspect of the transaction was Blackstone’s partnership with the City of New York to protect 5,000 affordable apartments for 20 years – the most units preserved for affordability ever at one time in the city’s history. Our agreement also limited rent increases on an additional 1,400 units that otherwise would have lost rent protection in 2020.
