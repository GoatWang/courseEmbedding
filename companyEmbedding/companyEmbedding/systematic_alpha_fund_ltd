Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.25% for A Shares, 1.75% for C Shares, 1.00% for I Shares and 0.75% for R6 Shares of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through 2/28/2018 for A Shares, 2/28/2018 for C Shares, 2/28/2018 for I Shares and 2/28/2018 for R6 Shares, at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The BofA Merrill Lynch 3-Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index is comprised of a single issue purchased at the beginning of the month and held for a full month. The index is rebalanced monthly and the issue selected is the outstanding Treasury Bill that matures closest to, but not beyond 3 months from the rebalancing date. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. Alternative investment strategies use a variety of complicated investment techniques and involve complex securities transactions that include risks in addition to those risks with direct investments in securities described in the prospectus. The value of investments in mortgage-related and asset-backed securities will be influenced by the factors affecting the housing market and the assets underlying such securities. The securities may decline in value, face valuation difficulties, become more volatile and/or become illiquid. They are also subject to prepayment risk, which occurs when mortgage holders refinance or otherwise repay their loans sooner than expected, creating an early return of principal to holders of the loans.Total return assumes reinvestment of income.

Systematic Alpha joins Alphametrix Global Marketplace

Articles and Features











The Systematic Alpha Futures program, managed by the New York-based CTA Systematic Alpha Management (SAM), has been listed on the AlphaMetrix Global Marketplace, the fastest growing hedge fund marketplace in the US.
AlphaMetrix offers investors the option of allocating to hedge funds via separately managed accounts (SMAs), pooled managed accounts (PMAs) and a new product, Transparent Funds. The latter funds, introduced in May 2011, enable managers to retain their existing hedge fund structure, while AlphaMetrix provides intraday portfolio prices, risk analytics and reports to investors.
AlphaMetrix provides users with sophisticated analytics, portfolio construction tools, due diligence and risk reporting, risk monitoring and background checks on managers. The platform was initially focused on CTAs, the most liquid segment of the hedge fund market, and began offering non-CTA hedge fund strategies in 2010.
The marketplace currently has over USD6bn invested in hedge funds. The Systematic Alpha Futures Fund, Ltd will join other transparent funds on the platform and will be accessible to qualified investors.
“We are excited that our flagship fund is now available on the AlphaMetrix Global Marketplace,” says Peter Kambolin (pictured), CEO of Systematic Alpha. “We are certain that the Marketplace’s users will welcome access to SAM’s contrarian, systematic approach.  We look forward to working with AlphaMetrix’s investors in creating their own, bespoke portfolios. ”
Mikus Kins, Executive Director, Head of Business Development for AlphaMetrix, says:  “We are pleased to welcome Systematic Alpha to AlphaMetrix and are confident that their strategy will be valued by our customers. We look forward to a significant and long term partnership.”
Systematic Alpha Management is a short-term systematic CTA which uses advanced methods of statistical analysis of high frequency market data to develop its models.

PerformanceOur strategies have generated positive average rates of return with attractive risk-adjusted performance over long periods of time through varying market environments and economic cycles. The strategies exhibit low or negative correlation to equities, fixed income and alternative investment indices.
ExperienceThe team has extensive experience and expertise in both developing and implementing short-term systematic trading strategies. The principals average over 20 years of relevant experience and most team members have been with the firm for more than 5 years.
LiquidityAll our investment programs are highly liquid. They only trade the most liquid exchange-traded futures contracts. The Systematic Alpha Intraday Program has no open positions over-night, therefore all profits and losses in the broker statement are realized. Although the Systematic Alpha Futures Program does take some positions over-night, it has an average holding time of about one trading day, allowing for almost daily liquidity.
