Whether you’re anchoring at your favorite shoreline, setting up to fish, or ending a day back at the dock, let Overton’s furnish your anchor, mooring, and docking needs! Anchors for both freshwater and saltwater in a variety of styles are available from brands like Overton’s, Greenfield, Kwik Tek, Fortress, and Lewmar, so your boat is anchored easily and securely. We also have top-quality, reliable anchor line, rodes, ropes, and dock line from companies like Dockmate and Dock Edge. Taylor Made and Dockmate provide long-lasting boat fenders for protection around the pier or dock. And we’ve got lots of convenient fender hangers and locks that make it easy to moor your boat to the pier. You can also outfit your dock with the very best dock profiles, dock cushions, corner dock wheels, and post and straight bumpers. We even have dock hardware for the do-it-yourselfer to build a floating dock or stationary dock. Superior quality dock ladders from Dockmate, Dock Edge, and Tie Down make it easy to access your dock from the boat or the water. Wide comfortable steps on flip-up dock ladders, lift dock ladders, and floating dock ladders make it easy to climb. For more permanent mooring applications, look no further than our selection of mooring whips, ranging from economy to ultimate models. Our boat lifts from Lunmar and Doozie Boat Lifts are excellent choices for customized applications. Plus, our Jim Buoy and Taylor Made marker buoys are completely designed to weather the elements. Increase storage space and free your dock from clutter with our incredible dock storage boxes in a wide range of sizes. Keep your docking area just as tidy with our weed eradicators and rakes. Every dock needs affordable dock lighting, and our choice of solar dock lights from Dock Edge, Lake Lite, and Sunforce are great additions to any dock. Load up on other important docking accessories such as cleats, safety and privacy signs, and utility hooks. We have everything you need to make your dock or pier the perfect home for your boat.

Avid boaters know that it is important to keep your boat trailer in top shape. At Overton's, you'll find a huge selection of trailering accessories from trailer jacks and electric and manual winches to trailer rollers and trailer hardware. We offer quality trailer parts from big brand names like Fulton Marine, Attwood, Dutton-Lainson, and Powerwinch. Both LED and incandescent trailer lights from Optronics and Wesbar are important for safe trailering. Choose individual replacement marker and clearance lights, shop for trailer wiring and adapters, or just purchase one of our many trailer light kits to get started. Every boat trailer needs a set of boat guides, and we offer bunkboard-style, roller, and post guide-ons from Tie Down, Fulton, C.E. Smith, and ShoreLand'r. But before your boat is safely onboard, you need to be sure it's riding on dependable, long-lasting trailer tires and rims. We have Loadstar, Goodyear, and Carlisle tires, rims, and accessories that will keep you rolling. Plus our trailer brakes and trailer hubs help ensure safe stops along the way. Our wide array of trailer tie-downs, cables, and locks from Trimax and McGard keep your boat trailer and boat secure until you reach your destination. We also have outboard stabilizer clips, bow scuff guards, and brackets available to help with your towing. And Pyle's specially designed rearview back-up cameras increase safety when hitching your trailer to your vehicle. Once you're ready to hit the road, don't forget our other convenient products for your SUV or truck, including battery jumper cables, running boards, cargo liners, and floor mats, all of which ease the work of traveling with boating gear.

Leadership


"A company is created by its people.  Its culture and ethics are created by its leaders."

The backgrounds of our leaders directly inform our mission as a firm. Start-up culture is great. But how do large organizations and experienced managers do innovation? A t-shirt and a pair of jeans?
We believe that creating scalable, world-class ventures is serious business.  Serious business requires serious leaders.

Labelling, brand and our key


What is a SplashMap?A SplashMap is a map printed onto a fabric, and like its inspiration (the escape and evasion silk maps used in the second WW and distributed around the continent in Monopoly boxes) they are light-weight, durable, washable, wearable and ideal for the "real" outdoors of mud, wind, snow and rain... all the conditions that paper is not "cut-out" for. This is a fresh new market offering, never done before; uniquely based upon the best Ordnance Survey data and other Open Data Sources.  We are able to tailor these maps to be the most usable outdoor maps ever for walking, riding, cycling, eventing or anything you could do in the real outdoors.Where did the idea come from?Fed up with Paper maps that became mush every time it rained, and not wanting to use laminated maps which are just too heavy and still need to be folded to perfection, I wanted to start a business that put the mapping information into people's hands as easily as possible.Where did it go from there?My friends and I set about making prototypes using Ordnance Survey Explorer range images.  We were getting somewhere, but were then informed by the mapping agency that the image was not permitted to be printed onto anything but paper.  This was a shock as we were headed for the walking season of 2012 for our launch.By mid Summer, OS had changed their minds and said we could print on fabrics!  Hurray (!).  Season half finished... but perhaps we could just produce a few......But, hidden in this revised printing license there lived a "merchandising clause" prohibiting the use of any printed map material from being used as clothing!Give up?No.  Just because we can't use the traditional walking map is no reason to give up.  Besides, as I road tested the prototypes with the NewForce Mountain Bike club it became clear there is too much clutter and too little distance covered on the usual 1:25 000 scale maps.  And the 1: 50 000 didn't have enough detail!  There was plenty of scope to make a much better map!We decided to make our own unique map, based upon open data sources (which saves having to deal with the awful licensing agreements our civil servants dream-up).  Because we were then making our own maps we could choose the ideal scales!  For walkers, riders (bikes/ horses), sailors or anyone who covers a reasonable distance, 1:40 000 was the sweet-spot!We combined OpenStreetMap volunteer data and the Ordnance Survey's Open Data to craft this unique map and developed a design whilst working with Kite and Sports clothing experts for materials.It's a first!Fabric maps have been around for centuries, but no-one has attempted to make one for todays hobbies.  Probably most manufacturers believe GPS is taking over, but our research shows that people are tired of breakages on their GPS's.  Our map needs no batteries, no expensive fixtures to fit it on your bike and can just be tied around your neck or stuffed in your shorts when not being read.What's unique is that this is the first commercial solid-state map demonstration of how Open Data can unlock innovation; providing much easier ways of tailoring solutions and making ideal products for your target market.


NewForce mountain bike leader marks route onto washable map


Responses to the prototypes by Mountain Bikers, Horse Riders, Walkers and Retailers have all grown in enthusiasm as we close-in on a final design!What are we doing?We are developing the flowline for aggregating open data sources at our office and homes in Hampshire (that's in the UK).  Printing and finishing of the product is also through UK businesses based in Hampshire and one other based in Lancashire.  We've worked with these businesses to develop the best printing processes onto the most user friendly materials designed for outdoor use.  Their specialism stems from the production of detailed design on kites and weatherproof sports clothing. 


Our newest prototype on a waterproof polyester


This project will help us get the map to a production stage for selected areas, set-up our on-line retail and energise our many and varied routes to market.





Risks and challenges
Significant challenges still exist;
1) Manufacturing costs limit margins - I am working with printers based in this country as we perfect the combination of colour pallet and material. For larger production runs we are already engaged with printers in Eastern Europe and China to mitigate this effect.
2) Funding - Cash-flow is an issue when starting up as the development has involved considerable sunk cost and the initial print runs are high cost.  Your contribution is greatly appreciated!

Labelling, brand and our key


What is a SplashMap?A SplashMap is a map printed onto a fabric, and like its inspiration (the escape and evasion silk maps used in the second WW and distributed around the continent in Monopoly boxes) they are light-weight, durable, washable, wearable and ideal for the "real" outdoors of mud, wind, snow and rain... all the conditions that paper is not "cut-out" for. This is a fresh new market offering, never done before; uniquely based upon the best Ordnance Survey data and other Open Data Sources.  We are able to tailor these maps to be the most usable outdoor maps ever for walking, riding, cycling, eventing or anything you could do in the real outdoors.Where did the idea come from?Fed up with Paper maps that became mush every time it rained, and not wanting to use laminated maps which are just too heavy and still need to be folded to perfection, I wanted to start a business that put the mapping information into people's hands as easily as possible.Where did it go from there?My friends and I set about making prototypes using Ordnance Survey Explorer range images.  We were getting somewhere, but were then informed by the mapping agency that the image was not permitted to be printed onto anything but paper.  This was a shock as we were headed for the walking season of 2012 for our launch.By mid Summer, OS had changed their minds and said we could print on fabrics!  Hurray (!).  Season half finished... but perhaps we could just produce a few......But, hidden in this revised printing license there lived a "merchandising clause" prohibiting the use of any printed map material from being used as clothing!Give up?No.  Just because we can't use the traditional walking map is no reason to give up.  Besides, as I road tested the prototypes with the NewForce Mountain Bike club it became clear there is too much clutter and too little distance covered on the usual 1:25 000 scale maps.  And the 1: 50 000 didn't have enough detail!  There was plenty of scope to make a much better map!We decided to make our own unique map, based upon open data sources (which saves having to deal with the awful licensing agreements our civil servants dream-up).  Because we were then making our own maps we could choose the ideal scales!  For walkers, riders (bikes/ horses), sailors or anyone who covers a reasonable distance, 1:40 000 was the sweet-spot!We combined OpenStreetMap volunteer data and the Ordnance Survey's Open Data to craft this unique map and developed a design whilst working with Kite and Sports clothing experts for materials.It's a first!Fabric maps have been around for centuries, but no-one has attempted to make one for todays hobbies.  Probably most manufacturers believe GPS is taking over, but our research shows that people are tired of breakages on their GPS's.  Our map needs no batteries, no expensive fixtures to fit it on your bike and can just be tied around your neck or stuffed in your shorts when not being read.What's unique is that this is the first commercial solid-state map demonstration of how Open Data can unlock innovation; providing much easier ways of tailoring solutions and making ideal products for your target market.


NewForce mountain bike leader marks route onto washable map


Responses to the prototypes by Mountain Bikers, Horse Riders, Walkers and Retailers have all grown in enthusiasm as we close-in on a final design!What are we doing?We are developing the flowline for aggregating open data sources at our office and homes in Hampshire (that's in the UK).  Printing and finishing of the product is also through UK businesses based in Hampshire and one other based in Lancashire.  We've worked with these businesses to develop the best printing processes onto the most user friendly materials designed for outdoor use.  Their specialism stems from the production of detailed design on kites and weatherproof sports clothing. 


Our newest prototype on a waterproof polyester


This project will help us get the map to a production stage for selected areas, set-up our on-line retail and energise our many and varied routes to market.





Risks and challenges
Significant challenges still exist;
1) Manufacturing costs limit margins - I am working with printers based in this country as we perfect the combination of colour pallet and material. For larger production runs we are already engaged with printers in Eastern Europe and China to mitigate this effect.
2) Funding - Cash-flow is an issue when starting up as the development has involved considerable sunk cost and the initial print runs are high cost.  Your contribution is greatly appreciated!

Cheesecake Factory CEO David Overton On Obamacare: 'It Will Be Very Costly'






By Bonnie Kavoussi

Big changes are on their way for most American businesses, courtesy of Obamacare, according to the CEO of the Cheesecake Factory. 
"It will be very costly," David Overton told CBS This Morning on Monday. "I believe most people will have to do that [raise prices] or cheapen their product." Nearly two-thirds of employers say they will have to pay more for health benefits under Obamacare, according to a recent survey by Mercer.
Overton said he doesn't know whether his own company will need to raise prices, since he already provides health insurance to all employees that work 25 hours or more per week. That's fewer hours than required under Obamacare, which will force companies with 50 or more full-time employees to provide employees working at least 30 hours per week with health care coverage or face penalties.
"For those businesses that don't cover their employees, they'll be in for a very expensive situation," Overton told CBS This Morning.  Some, such as the CEO of Papa John's and a Denny's franchisee, have claimed they will need to pass on those additional costs to customers. Others, such as an Applebee's franchisee, say the health care overhaul will limit their ability to hire more employees.

Avid boaters know that it is important to keep your boat trailer in top shape. At Overton's, you'll find a huge selection of trailering accessories from trailer jacks and electric and manual winches to trailer rollers and trailer hardware. We offer quality trailer parts from big brand names like Fulton Marine, Attwood, Dutton-Lainson, and Powerwinch. Both LED and incandescent trailer lights from Optronics and Wesbar are important for safe trailering. Choose individual replacement marker and clearance lights, shop for trailer wiring and adapters, or just purchase one of our many trailer light kits to get started. Every boat trailer needs a set of boat guides, and we offer bunkboard-style, roller, and post guide-ons from Tie Down, Fulton, C.E. Smith, and ShoreLand'r. But before your boat is safely onboard, you need to be sure it's riding on dependable, long-lasting trailer tires and rims. We have Loadstar, Goodyear, and Carlisle tires, rims, and accessories that will keep you rolling. Plus our trailer brakes and trailer hubs help ensure safe stops along the way. Our wide array of trailer tie-downs, cables, and locks from Trimax and McGard keep your boat trailer and boat secure until you reach your destination. We also have outboard stabilizer clips, bow scuff guards, and brackets available to help with your towing. And Pyle's specially designed rearview back-up cameras increase safety when hitching your trailer to your vehicle. Once you're ready to hit the road, don't forget our other convenient products for your SUV or truck, including battery jumper cables, running boards, cargo liners, and floor mats, all of which ease the work of traveling with boating gear.

Whether you’re anchoring at your favorite shoreline, setting up to fish, or ending a day back at the dock, let Overton’s furnish your anchor, mooring, and docking needs! Anchors for both freshwater and saltwater in a variety of styles are available from brands like Overton’s, Greenfield, Kwik Tek, Fortress, and Lewmar, so your boat is anchored easily and securely. We also have top-quality, reliable anchor line, rodes, ropes, and dock line from companies like Dockmate and Dock Edge. Taylor Made and Dockmate provide long-lasting boat fenders for protection around the pier or dock. And we’ve got lots of convenient fender hangers and locks that make it easy to moor your boat to the pier. You can also outfit your dock with the very best dock profiles, dock cushions, corner dock wheels, and post and straight bumpers. We even have dock hardware for the do-it-yourselfer to build a floating dock or stationary dock. Superior quality dock ladders from Dockmate, Dock Edge, and Tie Down make it easy to access your dock from the boat or the water.
