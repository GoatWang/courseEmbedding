History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Kevin Mandia, CEO and Board Director of FireEye at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California


In 2004, Ashar Aziz, a Pakistani American, founded FireEye with venture capital provided by Sequoia Capital.[5] Aziz, formerly of Sun Microsystems, is the original inventor of the core set of technologies behind the company's main product line, the FireEye Malware Protection System.[6] In 2006, FireEye launched its first product—a switch-based network access control appliance.[7] Major investors include Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Icon Ventures, SVB Capital,[8] DAG Ventures, Juniper Networks, and In-Q-Tel.[9]
In June 2012, former CEO and President of McAfee, Dave DeWalt, joined FireEye as chairman.[10] DeWalt was appointed CEO in November 2012.[10][11]
Expansion and IPO[edit]
On September 20, 2013 the company went public on NASDAQ.[12] On December 30, 2013, FireEye acquired Mandiant in a stock and cash deal worth in excess of $1 billion.[13] On May 8, 2014, FireEye acquired company nPulse Technologies[14] for approximately $60 million. nPulse is intended to build on FireEye's ability to detect intrusions in a company's network by making it easier to track the intrusion and better understand its effect on the network.[15]
In May 2015, the company raised its revenue forecast for the year to be between $615 million and $635 million.[16] On January 20, 2016, FireEye announced the acquisition of iSIGHT Partners, a threat intelligence company.[17]
In May 2016, it was announced that Dave DeWalt would step down from his position as CEO and become executive chairman on June 15, 2016. DeWalt is replaced by the company's president, Kevin Mandia.[18] Mandia came on board with the acquisition of Mandiant in 2013.
Products and services[edit]
Central Management System[edit]
The Central Management System (CMS) consolidates the management, reporting, and data sharing of Web MPS, Email MPS, File MPS, and Malware Analysis System (MAS) into a single network-based appliance by acting as a distribution hub for malware security intelligence.[19]
Dynamic Threat Intelligence[edit]
The FireEye Cloud crowd-sources Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) detected by individual FireEye MPS appliances, and automatically distributes this time sensitive zero-day intelligence globally to all subscribed customers in frequent updates. Content Updates include a combination of DTI and FireEye Labs generated intelligence identified through Research efforts.
Cyber actions[edit]
2008[edit]

FireEye was involved in the forensic investigation against the Srizbi botnet in 2008.[20][21]

2009[edit]

In October/November 2009, FireEye participated in an effort to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok).[22]

2011[edit]

On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through an action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington.[23]

2012[edit]

In July 2012, FireEye was involved in analysis[24] of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.

2014[edit]

In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities – CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113 – as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows Kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in their October 2014 Security Bulletin.[25]


In 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies, and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.[26]


In 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.[27]

2015[edit]

In 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router’s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim’s network.[28]


In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.[29]


In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015-2545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015-2546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a resume. The combination of these two exploits grant fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.[30]


In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.[31]

2016[edit]

In 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the “Vendetta Brothers.” The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace “Vendetta World.”[32]


In mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that neither government would “conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property” for an economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.[33]


In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware – dubbed IRONGATE – crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.[34]


On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability in just four days later.[35]


In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user “radio”, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim’s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.[36]


In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cyber criminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off with millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.[37]

2017[edit]

In 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinate public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.[38]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Kevin Mandia, CEO and Board Director of FireEye at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California


In 2004, Ashar Aziz, a Pakistani American, founded FireEye with venture capital provided by Sequoia Capital.[5] Aziz, formerly of Sun Microsystems, is the original inventor of the core set of technologies behind the company's main product line, the FireEye Malware Protection System.[6] In 2006, FireEye launched its first product—a switch-based network access control appliance.[7] Major investors include Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Icon Ventures, SVB Capital,[8] DAG Ventures, Juniper Networks, and In-Q-Tel.[9]
In June 2012, former CEO and President of McAfee, Dave DeWalt, joined FireEye as chairman.[10] DeWalt was appointed CEO in November 2012.[10][11]
Expansion and IPO[edit]
On September 20, 2013 the company went public on NASDAQ.[12] On December 30, 2013, FireEye acquired Mandiant in a stock and cash deal worth in excess of $1 billion.[13] On May 8, 2014, FireEye acquired company nPulse Technologies[14] for approximately $60 million. nPulse is intended to build on FireEye's ability to detect intrusions in a company's network by making it easier to track the intrusion and better understand its effect on the network.[15]
In May 2015, the company raised its revenue forecast for the year to be between $615 million and $635 million.[16] On January 20, 2016, FireEye announced the acquisition of iSIGHT Partners, a threat intelligence company.[17]
In May 2016, it was announced that Dave DeWalt would step down from his position as CEO and become executive chairman on June 15, 2016. DeWalt is replaced by the company's president, Kevin Mandia.[18] Mandia came on board with the acquisition of Mandiant in 2013.
Products and services[edit]
Central Management System[edit]
The Central Management System (CMS) consolidates the management, reporting, and data sharing of Web MPS, Email MPS, File MPS, and Malware Analysis System (MAS) into a single network-based appliance by acting as a distribution hub for malware security intelligence.[19]
Dynamic Threat Intelligence[edit]
The FireEye Cloud crowd-sources Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) detected by individual FireEye MPS appliances, and automatically distributes this time sensitive zero-day intelligence globally to all subscribed customers in frequent updates. Content Updates include a combination of DTI and FireEye Labs generated intelligence identified through Research efforts.
Cyber actions[edit]
2008[edit]

FireEye was involved in the forensic investigation against the Srizbi botnet in 2008.[20][21]

2009[edit]

In October/November 2009, FireEye participated in an effort to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok).[22]

2011[edit]

On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through an action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington.[23]

2012[edit]

In July 2012, FireEye was involved in analysis[24] of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.

2014[edit]

In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities – CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113 – as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows Kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in their October 2014 Security Bulletin.[25]


In 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies, and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.[26]


In 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.[27]

2015[edit]

In 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router’s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim’s network.[28]


In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.[29]


In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015-2545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015-2546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a resume. The combination of these two exploits grant fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.[30]


In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.[31]

2016[edit]

In 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the “Vendetta Brothers.” The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace “Vendetta World.”[32]


In mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that neither government would “conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property” for an economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.[33]


In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware – dubbed IRONGATE – crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.[34]


On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability in just four days later.[35]


In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user “radio”, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim’s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.[36]


In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cyber criminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off with millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.[37]

2017[edit]

In 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinate public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.[38]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Kevin Mandia, CEO and Board Director of FireEye at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California


In 2004, Ashar Aziz, a Pakistani American, founded FireEye with venture capital provided by Sequoia Capital.[5] Aziz, formerly of Sun Microsystems, is the original inventor of the core set of technologies behind the company's main product line, the FireEye Malware Protection System.[6] In 2006, FireEye launched its first product—a switch-based network access control appliance.[7] Major investors include Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Icon Ventures, SVB Capital,[8] DAG Ventures, Juniper Networks, and In-Q-Tel.[9]
In June 2012, former CEO and President of McAfee, Dave DeWalt, joined FireEye as chairman.[10] DeWalt was appointed CEO in November 2012.[10][11]
Expansion and IPO[edit]
On September 20, 2013 the company went public on NASDAQ.[12] On December 30, 2013, FireEye acquired Mandiant in a stock and cash deal worth in excess of $1 billion.[13] On May 8, 2014, FireEye acquired company nPulse Technologies[14] for approximately $60 million. nPulse is intended to build on FireEye's ability to detect intrusions in a company's network by making it easier to track the intrusion and better understand its effect on the network.[15]
In May 2015, the company raised its revenue forecast for the year to be between $615 million and $635 million.[16] On January 20, 2016, FireEye announced the acquisition of iSIGHT Partners, a threat intelligence company.[17]
In May 2016, it was announced that Dave DeWalt would step down from his position as CEO and become executive chairman on June 15, 2016. DeWalt is replaced by the company's president, Kevin Mandia.[18] Mandia came on board with the acquisition of Mandiant in 2013.
Products and services[edit]
Central Management System[edit]
The Central Management System (CMS) consolidates the management, reporting, and data sharing of Web MPS, Email MPS, File MPS, and Malware Analysis System (MAS) into a single network-based appliance by acting as a distribution hub for malware security intelligence.[19]
Dynamic Threat Intelligence[edit]
The FireEye Cloud crowd-sources Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) detected by individual FireEye MPS appliances, and automatically distributes this time sensitive zero-day intelligence globally to all subscribed customers in frequent updates. Content Updates include a combination of DTI and FireEye Labs generated intelligence identified through Research efforts.
Cyber actions[edit]
2008[edit]

FireEye was involved in the forensic investigation against the Srizbi botnet in 2008.[20][21]

2009[edit]

In October/November 2009, FireEye participated in an effort to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok).[22]

2011[edit]

On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through an action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington.[23]

2012[edit]

In July 2012, FireEye was involved in analysis[24] of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.

2014[edit]

In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities – CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113 – as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows Kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in their October 2014 Security Bulletin.[25]


In 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies, and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.[26]


In 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.[27]

2015[edit]

In 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router’s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim’s network.[28]


In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.[29]


In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015-2545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015-2546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a resume. The combination of these two exploits grant fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.[30]


In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.[31]

2016[edit]

In 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the “Vendetta Brothers.” The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace “Vendetta World.”[32]


In mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that neither government would “conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property” for an economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.[33]


In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware – dubbed IRONGATE – crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.[34]


On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability in just four days later.[35]


In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user “radio”, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim’s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.[36]


In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cyber criminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off with millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.[37]

2017[edit]

In 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinate public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.[38]

In June 2012, former CEO and President of McAfee, Dave DeWalt, joined FireEye as chairman.[10] DeWalt was appointed CEO in November 2012.[10][11]
Expansion and IPO[edit]
On September 20, 2013 the company went public on NASDAQ.[12] On December 30, 2013, FireEye acquired Mandiant in a stock and cash deal worth in excess of $1 billion.[13] On May 8, 2014, FireEye acquired company nPulse Technologies[14] for approximately $60 million. nPulse is intended to build on FireEye's ability to detect intrusions in a company's network by making it easier to track the intrusion and better understand its effect on the network.[15]
In May 2015, the company raised its revenue forecast for the year to be between $615 million and $635 million.[16] On January 20, 2016, FireEye announced the acquisition of iSIGHT Partners, a threat intelligence company.[17]
In May 2016, it was announced that Dave DeWalt would step down from his position as CEO and become executive chairman on June 15, 2016. DeWalt is replaced by the company's president, Kevin Mandia.[18] Mandia came on board with the acquisition of Mandiant in 2013.
Products and services[edit]
Central Management System[edit]
The Central Management System (CMS) consolidates the management, reporting, and data sharing of Web MPS, Email MPS, File MPS, and Malware Analysis System (MAS) into a single network-based appliance by acting as a distribution hub for malware security intelligence.[19]
Dynamic Threat Intelligence[edit]
The FireEye Cloud crowd-sources Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) detected by individual FireEye MPS appliances, and automatically distributes this time sensitive zero-day intelligence globally to all subscribed customers in frequent updates. Content Updates include a combination of DTI and FireEye Labs generated intelligence identified through Research efforts.
Cyber actions[edit]
2008[edit]

FireEye was involved in the forensic investigation against the Srizbi botnet in 2008.[20][21]

2009[edit]

In October/November 2009, FireEye participated in an effort to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok).[22]

2011[edit]

On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through an action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington.[23]

2012[edit]

In July 2012, FireEye was involved in analysis[24] of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.

2014[edit]

In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities – CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113 – as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows Kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in their October 2014 Security Bulletin.[25]


In 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies, and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.[26]


In 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.[27]

2015[edit]

In 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router’s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim’s network.[28]


In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.[29]


In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015-2545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015-2546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a resume. The combination of these two exploits grant fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.[30]


In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.[31]

2016[edit]

In 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the “Vendetta Brothers.” The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace “Vendetta World.”[32]


In mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that neither government would “conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property” for an economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.[33]


In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware – dubbed IRONGATE – crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.[34]


On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability in just four days later.[35]


In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user “radio”, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim’s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.[36]


In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cyber criminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off with millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.[37]

2017[edit]

In 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinate public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.[38]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Kevin Mandia, CEO and Board Director of FireEye at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California


In 2004, Ashar Aziz, a Pakistani American, founded FireEye with venture capital provided by Sequoia Capital.[5] Aziz, formerly of Sun Microsystems, is the original inventor of the core set of technologies behind the company's main product line, the FireEye Malware Protection System.[6] In 2006, FireEye launched its first product—a switch-based network access control appliance.[7] Major investors include Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Icon Ventures, SVB Capital,[8] DAG Ventures, Juniper Networks, and In-Q-Tel.[9]
In June 2012, former CEO and President of McAfee, Dave DeWalt, joined FireEye as chairman.[10] DeWalt was appointed CEO in November 2012.[10][11]
Expansion and IPO[edit]
On September 20, 2013 the company went public on NASDAQ.[12] On December 30, 2013, FireEye acquired Mandiant in a stock and cash deal worth in excess of $1 billion.[13] On May 8, 2014, FireEye acquired company nPulse Technologies[14] for approximately $60 million. nPulse is intended to build on FireEye's ability to detect intrusions in a company's network by making it easier to track the intrusion and better understand its effect on the network.[15]
In May 2015, the company raised its revenue forecast for the year to be between $615 million and $635 million.[16] On January 20, 2016, FireEye announced the acquisition of iSIGHT Partners, a threat intelligence company.[17]
In May 2016, it was announced that Dave DeWalt would step down from his position as CEO and become executive chairman on June 15, 2016. DeWalt is replaced by the company's president, Kevin Mandia.[18] Mandia came on board with the acquisition of Mandiant in 2013.
Products and services[edit]
Central Management System[edit]
The Central Management System (CMS) consolidates the management, reporting, and data sharing of Web MPS, Email MPS, File MPS, and Malware Analysis System (MAS) into a single network-based appliance by acting as a distribution hub for malware security intelligence.[19]
Dynamic Threat Intelligence[edit]
The FireEye Cloud crowd-sources Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) detected by individual FireEye MPS appliances, and automatically distributes this time sensitive zero-day intelligence globally to all subscribed customers in frequent updates. Content Updates include a combination of DTI and FireEye Labs generated intelligence identified through Research efforts.
Cyber actions[edit]
2008[edit]

FireEye was involved in the forensic investigation against the Srizbi botnet in 2008.[20][21]

2009[edit]

In October/November 2009, FireEye participated in an effort to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok).[22]

2011[edit]

On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through an action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington.[23]

2012[edit]

In July 2012, FireEye was involved in analysis[24] of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.

2014[edit]

In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities – CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113 – as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows Kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in their October 2014 Security Bulletin.[25]


In 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies, and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.[26]


In 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.[27]

2015[edit]

In 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router’s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim’s network.[28]


In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.[29]


In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015-2545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015-2546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a resume. The combination of these two exploits grant fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.[30]


In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.[31]

2016[edit]

In 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the “Vendetta Brothers.” The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace “Vendetta World.”[32]


In mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that neither government would “conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property” for an economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.[33]


In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware – dubbed IRONGATE – crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.[34]


On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability in just four days later.[35]


In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user “radio”, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim’s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.[36]


In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cyber criminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off with millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.[37]

2017[edit]

In 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinate public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.[38]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Kevin Mandia, CEO and Board Director of FireEye at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California


In 2004, Ashar Aziz, a Pakistani American, founded FireEye with venture capital provided by Sequoia Capital.[5] Aziz, formerly of Sun Microsystems, is the original inventor of the core set of technologies behind the company's main product line, the FireEye Malware Protection System.[6] In 2006, FireEye launched its first product—a switch-based network access control appliance.[7] Major investors include Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Icon Ventures, SVB Capital,[8] DAG Ventures, Juniper Networks, and In-Q-Tel.[9]
In June 2012, former CEO and President of McAfee, Dave DeWalt, joined FireEye as chairman.[10] DeWalt was appointed CEO in November 2012.[10][11]
Expansion and IPO[edit]
On September 20, 2013 the company went public on NASDAQ.[12] On December 30, 2013, FireEye acquired Mandiant in a stock and cash deal worth in excess of $1 billion.[13] On May 8, 2014, FireEye acquired company nPulse Technologies[14] for approximately $60 million. nPulse is intended to build on FireEye's ability to detect intrusions in a company's network by making it easier to track the intrusion and better understand its effect on the network.[15]

FireEye was involved in the forensic investigation against the Srizbi botnet in 2008.[20][21]

In October/November 2009, FireEye participated in an effort to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok).[22]

2011[edit]

On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through an action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington.[23]

2012[edit]

In July 2012, FireEye was involved in analysis[24] of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.

2014[edit]

In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities – CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113 – as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows Kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in their October 2014 Security Bulletin.[25]


In 2014, FireEye provided information on a threat group it calls FIN4. FIN4 appears to conduct intrusions that are focused on a single objective: obtaining access to insider information capable of making or breaking the stock prices of public companies. The group has targeted hundreds of companies, and specifically targets the emails of C-level executives, legal counsel, regulatory, risk, and compliance personnel, and other individuals who would regularly discuss confidential, market-moving information.[26]


In 2014, FireEye released a report focused on a threat group it refers to as APT28. APT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government. Specifically, FireEye found that since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government.[27]

2015[edit]

In 2015, FireEye confirmed the existence of at least 14 router implants spread across four different countries: Ukraine, Philippines, Mexico, and India. Referred to as SYNful Knock, the implant is a stealthy modification of the router’s firmware image that can be used to maintain persistence within a victim’s network.[28]


In September 2015, FireEye obtained an injunction against a security researcher attempting to report vulnerabilities in FireEye Malware Protection System.[29]


In 2015, FireEye uncovered an attack exploiting two previously unknown vulnerabilities, one in Microsoft Office (CVE-2015-2545) and another in Windows (CVE-2015-2546). The attackers hid the exploit within a Microsoft Word document (.docx) that appeared to be a resume. The combination of these two exploits grant fully privileged remote code execution. Both vulnerabilities were patched by Microsoft.[30]


In 2015, the FireEye as a Service team in Singapore uncovered a phishing campaign exploiting an Adobe Flash Player zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2015-3113). Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability with an out-of-band security bulletin. FireEye attributed the activity to a China-based threat group it tracks as APT3.[31]

2016[edit]

In 2016, FireEye announced that it has been tracking a pair of cybercriminals referred to as the “Vendetta Brothers.” The company said that the enterprising duo uses various strategies to compromise point-of-sale systems, steal payment card information and sell it on their underground marketplace “Vendetta World.”[32]


In mid-2016, FireEye released a report on the impact of the 2015 agreement between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping that neither government would “conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property” for an economic advantage. The security firm reviewed the activity of 72 groups that it suspects are operating in China or otherwise support Chinese state interests and determined that, as of mid-2014, there was an overall decrease in successful network compromises by China-based groups against organizations in the U.S. and 25 other countries.[33]


In 2016, FireEye announced that it had identified several versions of an ICS-focused malware – dubbed IRONGATE – crafted to manipulate a specific industrial process running within a simulated Siemens control system environment. Although Siemens Product Computer Emergency Readiness Team (ProductCERT) confirmed to FireEye that IRONGATE is not viable against operational Siemens control systems and that IRONGATE does not exploit any vulnerabilities in Siemens products, the security firm said that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet.[34]


On May 8, 2016, FireEye detected an attack exploiting a previously unknown vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2016-4117). The security firm reported the issue to the Adobe Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) and Adobe released a patch for the vulnerability in just four days later.[35]


In 2016, FireEye discovered a widespread vulnerability affecting Android devices that permits local privilege escalation to the built-in user “radio”, making it so an attacker can potentially perform activities such as viewing the victim’s SMS database and phone history. FireEye reached out to Qualcomm in January 2016 and subsequently worked with the Qualcomm Product Security Team to address the issue.[36]


In 2016, FireEye provided details on FIN6, a cyber criminal group that steals payment card data for monetization from targets predominately in the hospitality and retail sectors. The group was observed aggressively targeting and compromising point-of-sale (POS) systems, and making off with millions of payment card numbers that were later sold on an underground marketplace.[37]

2017[edit]

In 2017, FireEye detected malicious Microsoft Office RTF documents leveraging a previously undisclosed vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199. This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to download and execute a Visual Basic script containing PowerShell commands when a user opens a document containing an embedded exploit. FireEye shared the details of the vulnerability with Microsoft and coordinate public disclosure timed with the release of a patch by Microsoft to address the vulnerability.[38]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]




Kevin Mandia, CEO and Board Director of FireEye at the Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit at Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 8, 2014 in San Francisco, California


In 2004, Ashar Aziz, a Pakistani American, founded FireEye with venture capital provided by Sequoia Capital.[5] Aziz, formerly of Sun Microsystems, is the original inventor of the core set of technologies behind the company's main product line, the FireEye Malware Protection System.[6] In 2006, FireEye launched its first product—a switch-based network access control appliance.[7] Major investors include Sequoia Capital, Norwest Venture Partners, Icon Ventures, SVB Capital,[8] DAG Ventures, Juniper Networks, and In-Q-Tel.[9]
In June 2012, former CEO and President of McAfee, Dave DeWalt, joined FireEye as chairman.[10] DeWalt was appointed CEO in November 2012.[10][11]
Expansion and IPO[edit]
On September 20, 2013 the company went public on NASDAQ.[12] On December 30, 2013, FireEye acquired Mandiant in a stock and cash deal worth in excess of $1 billion.[13] On May 8, 2014, FireEye acquired company nPulse Technologies[14] for approximately $60 million. nPulse is intended to build on FireEye's ability to detect intrusions in a company's network by making it easier to track the intrusion and better understand its effect on the network.[15]
In May 2015, the company raised its revenue forecast for the year to be between $615 million and $635 million.[16] On January 20, 2016, FireEye announced the acquisition of iSIGHT Partners, a threat intelligence company.[17]
In May 2016, it was announced that Dave DeWalt would step down from his position as CEO and become executive chairman on June 15, 2016. DeWalt is replaced by the company's president, Kevin Mandia.[18] Mandia came on board with the acquisition of Mandiant in 2013.
Products and services[edit]
Central Management System[edit]
The Central Management System (CMS) consolidates the management, reporting, and data sharing of Web MPS, Email MPS, File MPS, and Malware Analysis System (MAS) into a single network-based appliance by acting as a distribution hub for malware security intelligence.[19]
Dynamic Threat Intelligence[edit]
The FireEye Cloud crowd-sources Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) detected by individual FireEye MPS appliances, and automatically distributes this time sensitive zero-day intelligence globally to all subscribed customers in frequent updates. Content Updates include a combination of DTI and FireEye Labs generated intelligence identified through Research efforts.
Cyber actions[edit]
2008[edit]

FireEye was involved in the forensic investigation against the Srizbi botnet in 2008.[20][21]

2009[edit]

In October/November 2009, FireEye participated in an effort to take down the Mega-D botnet (also known as Ozdok).[22]

2011[edit]

On March 16, 2011, the Rustock botnet was taken down through an action by Microsoft, US federal law enforcement agents, FireEye, and the University of Washington.[23]

2012[edit]

In July 2012, FireEye was involved in analysis[24] of the Grum botnet's command and control servers located in the Netherlands, Panama, and Russia.

2014[edit]

In 2014, the FireEye Labs team identified two new zero-day vulnerabilities – CVE-2014-4148 and CVE-2014-4113 – as part of limited, targeted attacks against major corporations. Both zero-days exploit the Windows Kernel. Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities in their October 2014 Security Bulletin.[25]

FireEye Inc. in 5 Charts
Visualizing the cybersecurity company's struggles with achieving profitable sales growth.











                Demitrios Kalogeropoulos
            

                (TMFSigma)



            
            Jun 21, 2017 at 10:34PM
            
            





Cybersecurity software specialist FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) has big plans for 2017. Despite sharply slowing sales growth, the company aims to reach operating profitability while generating positive cash flow this year.
Below, we'll take a closer look at these business trends and how they fit into FireEye's rebound plan.

FEYE Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts.
Sales growth
FireEye's sales growth pace has been slowing significantly, and that's likely the single biggest driver behind the stock's dramatic underperformance. Its expansion pace peaked in 2014 at 163% before plunging to 46% in fiscal 2015 and hitting 15% last year. Revenue gains even dipped into negative territory at one point, but have rebounded slightly.
CEO Kevin Mandia and his executive team are forecasting near-zero growth in the second quarter before a more substantial acceleration comes in the second half of the year.

FEYE Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.
Gross margin
FireEye's profitability is ultimately a function of how well its next-gen security solutions can stand out against the competition, especially those large rivals with the resources to offer lower-priced security products as part of a more comprehensive IT management solution. These pressures have resulted in lower selling prices lately, as gross profit margin fell to near 60% of sales from a peak of 75% of sales. Rival Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) is enjoying consistently higher results.
The key to improvement on this metric is that FireEye must continually introduce new product and subscription offerings, like its recent iSIGHT analytics platform, that better meet the needs of its customers.

FEYE Operating Margin (TTM) data by YCharts.





Operating margin
As it grapples with the new reality of slowing sales gains, FireEye has turned its attention to slicing costs. It has made good progress on this score, with operating expenses falling to 81% of sales last quarter from 114% a year ago. FireEye has a tight balance to strike here, though, as it sharply reduces spending on sales and marketing and on research and development. It's important that it brings costs in line with its growth forecast, but executives don't want to cut so deeply that they threaten the company's long-term competitive position.

Management is targeting reaching positive non-GAAP operating income for the first time by the fourth quarter of 2017. FireEye's margin was a negative 7% in the first quarter and is projected to worsen slightly, falling to negative 9% in Q2.

FEYE Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts.
Cash flow
Besides achieving positive operating margin, FireEye's other major financial goal this year is to begin generating -- rather than burning through -- cash. Its cash flow trend improved at a faster pace than management expected last quarter, rising to negative $17 million compared to negative $23 million in the prior year. That success has kept FireEye on pace to show positive cash flow for the year, assuming management's industry outlook plays out roughly as expected over the next few quarters.

FEYE Current Deferred Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts.





Deferred revenue
FireEye's deferred revenue represents invoiced but not yet booked contracts. Since this metric includes the company's software billings, it is a key predictor of future sales. Deferred revenue growth has slowed to a crawl recently, and last quarter it declined for the first time in over two years. Palo Alto Networks, by contrast, booked a 51% spike in deferred revenue last quarter and is projecting sales gains of as much as 23% in the current quarter.
FireEye believes it will manage a rebound in the second half of the year, though, and that's why billings will be a critical number to watch over the coming quarters. The company's best shot at improving its growth pace is in adding new customers, ideally through larger contracts of $1 million or more in revenue.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

25SU5 Flame Controller



Absolute commitment to quality products & solutions for flame safety.
In the 1930s, Fireye® offered the first commercial/industrial electronic flame safeguard control, a photoelectric device designed to detect the presence of an oil flame in less than a second.
As high technology won acceptance in boiler rooms and plants across the country, Fireye® expanded its product capabilities. During World War II and after, Fireye® developed a wide variety of sensor technologies that found their way into innovative flame safeguard devices. By the early 1950s, Fireye® products had become an integral part of modern controlled combustion systems.
Fireye's pioneering tradition includes development of infrared scanners that monitors both gas and oil flames, scanners that discriminate between signals from adjacent burners, and the creation of a completely solid-state programming control. Fireye® set new standards recently with a micro-processor-based, auto diagnostics program that communicates in five different languages.
Continuing its history of innovation, Fireye® has introduced the next generation of industrial multi-burner flame scanners. Based on a built-in microprocessor, the revolutionary Signature Scannerâ˘ series collects data about flames in three dimensions.

25SU5 Flame Controller



Absolute commitment to quality products & solutions for flame safety.
In the 1930s, Fireye® offered the first commercial/industrial electronic flame safeguard control, a photoelectric device designed to detect the presence of an oil flame in less than a second.
As high technology won acceptance in boiler rooms and plants across the country, Fireye® expanded its product capabilities. During World War II and after, Fireye® developed a wide variety of sensor technologies that found their way into innovative flame safeguard devices. By the early 1950s, Fireye® products had become an integral part of modern controlled combustion systems.
Fireye's pioneering tradition includes development of infrared scanners that monitors both gas and oil flames, scanners that discriminate between signals from adjacent burners, and the creation of a completely solid-state programming control. Fireye® set new standards recently with a micro-processor-based, auto diagnostics program that communicates in five different languages.
Continuing its history of innovation, Fireye® has introduced the next generation of industrial multi-burner flame scanners. Based on a built-in microprocessor, the revolutionary Signature Scannerâ˘ series collects data about flames in three dimensions.

This Could be FireEye Inc.'s Most Important Product
The cybersecurity firm's growth could depend on its success in transforming into a security-as-a-service company.











                Sam Mattera
            

                (TMFMattera)



            
            May 4, 2016 at 7:42PM
            
            





Source: FireEye
FireEye (NASDAQ: FEYE) is embracing a service-based business model.
The cybersecurity firm offers its customers a wide variety of different products, mostly physical and cloud-based appliances, and subscription services designed to be used in conjunction with them. A customer might purchase one of FireEye's NX boxes, for example, then pair it with FireEye's Dynamic Threat Intelligence Cloud subscription service. Demand for FireEye's products and services has risen rapidly in recent years, and fueled the company's growth.
But FireEye's future could center on a different sort of offering. FireEye-as-a-service (FaaS) offers the core functions of its security platform in a more flexible way. In recent quarters, demand for FaaS has accelerated tremendously, and management is optimistic about its long-term potential. 
FaaS is boosting stand-alone subscription revenueFireEye announced FaaS in the fall of 2014. "By blending FireEye's technology, intelligence and expertise into a single on-demand offering, FireEye as a Service simplifies and consolidates the disparate patchwork of products and services organizations must piece together to defend themselves," CEO Dave DeWalt said.
Since then, FaaS has emerged as a key driver for the company. "[I]n 2015 we built [FaaS] into a $100 million business in less than 18 months, grew it at over 100%, and scaled to hundreds of customers," DeWalt said on the company's February earnings call. In fiscal 2015, FireEye generated platform billings of $540 million, about 26% of which came from the sale of what FireEye terms "stand-alone product subscriptions." FaaS falls into that category, along with its email threat prevention solution. Management expects that figure to rise to 35% this year as its platform billings exceed $655 million.





Source: FireEye.
The company's management believes FaaS is attractive to customers for several reasons. There's the issue of accounting: With FaaS, enterprise customers can record the cost as operating expense, rather than a capital expense, on their books. They have more flexibility in terms of deployment, so they are able to more easily scale up or scale down to meet their needs. And FaaS taps FireEye's network of security experts, who provide additional security oversight. 
Lofty growth targetsFireEye has been a volatile stock since it entered the public markets in the fall of 2013. The company hasn't been profitable, nor does it expect to be in the near future. Rather, investors have been betting on the prospect of tremendous future growth. During the February earnings call, DeWalt quantified the company's long-term potential, stating that the future of FireEye would center around providing security-as-a-service.

We're building out a platform. We have a security-as-a-service. I see every other tangential market that had this kind of condition eventually ended up with an as-a-service model, and you think about the WorkDays and the SalesForces and the ServiceNows, security has thousands of vendors. Most clients have hundreds of vendors, millions of alerts. If we can make that simple and deliver it, the value of this company will be a lot greater than it is today.

FireEye made that point again during its analyst day in March, when it showed this slide:

Over time, FireEye hopes to deliver FaaS from the cloud using only software, eliminating the need for on-site hardware entirely. That would improve margins, and reduce the amount of time it takes to bring an additional customer on board (right now it takes around 40 days).





On Thursday, FireEye will turn in its first-quarter earnings. Investors should watch the growth of FaaS closely.

Company: FireEye, Inc., Milpitas, CA
	Company Description: FireEye is the leading provider of next- generation threat protection focused on combating advanced malware, zero-day and targeted APT attacks. FireEye's solutions supplement security defenses such as traditional and next-generation firewalls, IPS, antivirus and Web gateways, which can't stop advanced malware. These technologies leave significant security holes in the majority of corporat

Nomination Title: FireEye’s Email Malware Protection System

Tell the story about this nominated product or service (up to 500 words). Describe its function, features, benefits, and performance to date.

FireEye’s Email Malware Protection System (MPS) defeats the next-generation of spear phishing attacks that aggressively evade signature-based defenses and compromise the majority of today’s corporate networks. FireEye’s solution blocks known malware and its outbound transmissions, and then utilizes the most sophisticated virtual execution environment in the world to detect and block advanced malware. Dynamic analysis of zero-day attacks within our virtual environment yields real-time malware security content to protect the local network, intelligence that can be shared to all subscribers of the FireEye Malware Protection Cloud. The MPS also has near-zero false positive rates and is plug-and-play, deploying within 30 minutes for a rapid security ROI.

The FireEye MPS is the industry's first solution that accurately detects advanced malware stopping zero-day and targeted APT attacks as well as their outbound callbacks. FireEye blocks the 90% of advanced threats that conventional defenses miss. It features near-zero false positive rates for a rapid security ROI.

The Malware Protection System features both inbound and outbound protection and a signature-less analysis engine that utilizes the most sophisticated virtual execution environment in the world to stop advanced threats that attack over Web and email. The FireEye MPS is the industry's first solution that accurately detects advanced malware stopping zero-day and targeted APT attacks as well as their outbound callbacks. FireEye blocks the 90% of advanced threats that conventional defenses miss. It features near-zero false positive rates for a rapid security ROI. FireEye MPS appliances feature the Virtual Execution (VX) engine and Callback filter to detect and block zero-day attacks and stop APT transmissions. With the FireEye Malware Protection Cloud network, customers receive global security intelligence to protect their local network. Zero-day, targeted malware enable advanced, persistent threats (APTs) to breach IT security, steal/alter/destroy sensitive data, and exploit network resources.

FireEye offers a new generation of network security threat protection that is being used by leading enterprises, government agencies, and higher education institutions.

By utilizing FireEye’s MPS with its cutting edge technology customers save the thousands or millions of dollars by avoiding downtime and/or network security breaches that might be caused by a malware attack. FireEye customers benefit from the combination of next-generation malware protection and an extensive malware intelligence network to enhance their overall cyber security infrastructure. FireEye's network security appliances deploy quickly filling the security gaps in traditional antivirus, intrusion detection and secure Web gateways to protect against targeted attacks.
