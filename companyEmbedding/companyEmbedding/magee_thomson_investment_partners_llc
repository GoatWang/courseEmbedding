Analytical Advantage
                  Our firm is dedicated to identifying attractive growth investments for our clients.  Our research process and experience evaluating growth stocks provides us with an analytical advantage.  We combine street research coverage and proprietary quantitative systems with our internal fundamental research to assess the probability of a company’s future growth potential. 

Strategic Advantage
                      The decisions we make based on our research determines our success.  The disciplined implementation of our investment strategy has contributed to our performance achievements. Our investment strategy combines with our portfolio construction methods to provide us with a performance advantage. 

Small firms beat large firms
                    As a small firm we have more liquidity to efficiently execute trades.  Our size also provides us with a more efficient organizational structure than our larger, more bureaucratic peers resulting in timely decision making. 

Objectives Aligned with Client
                    Smaller firms like ours are more focused on a single investment strategy.  Therefore, our professional’s financial incentives are closely aligned with our client’s objectives of achieving performance excellence through growth stock investing.

 One Man's 9-Minute Secret to Retiring Rich  by Investing Daily Staff - May 1, 2017     Years ago Jim Fink knew he’d need to make a change if he was ever going to retire.
It's a similar problem a lot of Americans are dealing with as they approach retirement.
He had a good job, was squirreling away money in his IRA, and investing in stocks—but wasn’t really getting anywhere.
The piddly returns he was making that way seemed like a waste of time. He needed something better.
Luckily Jim worked at an office building in Chicago, close to the financial district.
One day he ran into a "trader" who shared an approach that would go on to change Jim's life forever.
So Jim started experimenting with the approach he learned...
Before long he was generating extra monthly income like $1,200, $1,800, and $2,100... and all in a matter of weeks!
His nest egg began to grow exponentially, and before long he had turned a mere $50,000 into a massive $5.3 million.
Now, years later, Jim trades full-time—and lets independent-minded investors follow the exact approach he's now perfected.
It’s an easy, step-by-step process that takes just 9 minutes to per week.
Best of all, unlike many risky approaches to making money, there's a built-in safety net unique to his strategy that can make it safer than traditional investing.
In fact, safety-loving Warren Buffett pulled in $4.7 billion following this exact approach not too long ago.
The full story behind how Jim makes his trades is right here.
