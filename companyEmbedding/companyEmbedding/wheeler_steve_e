Current Activities
We seek to understand the effects that impact the strength and geometry of non-covalent interactions involving aromatic rings (π-stacking 
              interactions, anion-π interactions, etc.) through the application of computational quantum chemistry and to quantify the role of these non-covalent 
              interactions in organic chemistry, materials science, and molecular biology. To this end, we employ computational chemistry methods spanning the 
              full gamut of techniques, ranging from high-accuracy ab initio methods [MP2, CCSD(T), etc] and density functional theory (DFT) to classical molecular 
              dynamics simulations. One of our primary aims is the development of computational and conceptual tools for the rational design of asymmetric 
              organocatalysts and organic electronic materials. To this end, a hallmark of our work is the emphasis on building predictive physical models that are 
              of great utility for chemists.
