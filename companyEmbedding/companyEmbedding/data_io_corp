            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.source> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11x1gf2m6>  .

<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.rate> 4.5 .
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm>  <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage>  .


If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV
License: CC-BY

2 GB gzip8 GB uncompressed

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Products
 
In order
        to accommodate the expanding variety and quantities of programmable devices being
        manufactured today, Data I/O offers multiple solutions for the numerous types of device mix
        and volume usage by our customers in the various market segments and applications. We work
        closely with leading manufacturers of programmable devices to develop our products to meet
        the requirements of a particular device.
 
Data
        I/O’s line of programming systems includes a broad range of products, systems,
        modules, and accessories, which we group into two general categories: automated programming
        systems and non-automated programming systems. We provide automated programming systems in
        three categories: off-line, in-line, and on-board (also known as In-system Programming). In
        addition, we provide device support and service on all of our products. Device support is a
        critical aspect of our business and consists of writing software algorithms for devices and
        developing socket adapters to hold and connect to the device for programming.
 
Within
        the categories of automated solutions and non-automated systems, Data I/O targets specific
        solutions at specific market segments. Data I/O optimizes the solution based on the
        customer’s device, process and business needs. Data I/O’s flagship programming
        platform, FlashCORE™, has the speed and pricing to provide the best value in the
        industry, making it the leading choice for high volume production. Data I/O technical teams
        work closely with semiconductor manufacturers to

actively plan for programming support of new devices and physical packages.
        The FlashCORE platform is used worldwide to program NOR Flash devices from all providers,
        including market leaders, Intel, Renesas, Spansion and Toshiba. Data I/O leads the industry
        in providing solutions for NAND flash programming from Hynix, Micron, Samsung, ST
        Microelectronics, Toshiba, msystems (SanDisk) DiskOnChip and others. The dynamics of the
        flash market are changing, blurring the distinction of NAND and NOR technologies and the
        emergence of converged offerings, including Samsung’s OneNAND and Spansion’s
        ORNAND, also supported on FlashCORE systems. Data I/O’s strong partnerships with
        leading semiconductor companies greatly enhance our ability to serve our mutual
        customers.
Target
        customers include OEMs and EMSs of electronic consumer products, like the fast-growing
        portable/wireless devices, cellular handsets and smart appliances. These applications are
        high volume users of programmable flash memory devices.
 
In
        portable electronics products, shrinking form factors are driving the shrinkage of device
        packages. Manual programming and handling of these tiny packages is increasingly
        impractical due to quality issues. This trend toward small packages should drive demand for
        Data I/O’s automated programming systems.

Applications targeted for these tiny devices include automotive, consumer
        appliances, remote controls, medical devices, portable/personal electronics, PC
        peripherals, hand-held and wearable PCs, GPS systems, telecommunications including phones
        and pagers, security alarms and sensors.

TaskLink® for Windows provides a universal job set-up tool that
        intuitively guides users in preparing product data files for programming. TaskLink is also
        a key element of our Connected Strategy. Leveraging network connectivity, Data I/O’s
        TaskLink provides monitoring and control over programming systems anywhere on the network
        – providing global companies with greater visibility and control over remote
        production lines or contract manufacturing processes. In late 2006, Data I/O provided a
        number of application specific software products and related hardware that were developed
        in response to customer requirements. The value of our application-software further
        differentiates Data I/O from other providers.

Automated Programming Solutions
 
Data
        I/O provides our manufacturing and programming center customers with automated programming
        systems solutions that include robotic handlers, a variety of programmers, input and output
        media handling (such as tray stackers, tubes, loaders or taping), and marking solutions.
        Our ProLINE-RoadRunner™ is a unique in-line programming system with programming speed
        capability, which approaches the speed at which Flash devices can currently accept data.
        Many of our customers need to program Flash and microcontroller devices in large quantities
        and very quickly. ProLINE-RoadRunner mounts directly on the assembly machine in the
        production line (Siemens, Fuji, Universal, Panasonic and Assembleon machines) and delivers
        programmed parts from reels of blank devices to the production line in a just-in-time
        fashion. Our ProLINE-RoadRunner eliminates production bottlenecks associated with
        high-density Flash and microcontroller devices, allowing last minute firmware changes and
        eliminating programmed part inventories, ultimately streamlining and reducing the
        customer’s production and process costs. ProLINE-RoadRunner enables customers to
        implement lean processes and is a key element in Data I/O’s Connected Strategy,
        allowing customers and partners to more effectively manage their firmware supply chain.
        ProLINE-RoadRunner currently retails from $74,750 to $130,950, depending on programming
        capability.
Data
        I/O’s PS family of automated programming solutions offers highly flexible solutions
        for off-line batch programming. Data I/O can configure PS systems to support not only Flash
        devices, but also a wide variety of other devices, such as microcontrollers. These systems
        provide a number of marking, labeling, and input/output options. Most importantly,
        customers can make changeovers extremely fast. This feature allows the customer to rapidly
        respond to diverse demands with very little downtime. Customers can optimize the PS family
        systems for any job to maximize throughput and, when combined with fast changeover times
        and high reliability, provide the highest levels of output during a production shift. Our
        PS588 integrates the same FlashCORE programmer we use in our PS288, PS300 FlashCORE,
        ProLINE-RoadRunner and FlashPAK™ and builds on our Connected Strategy and common
        architecture. The PS588 significantly improves throughput and lowers the cost per
        programmed part. The PS family products range in price from approximately $153,200 to
        $498,000.
 
Data
        I/O’s automated solutions also include the FLX500, our desktop automated programming
        and handling system. The FLX500 sets a new standard in the user experience for automation
        programming systems. Its graphical user interface eliminates the issue of language usage
        for the operator. It was designed for “plug and play” operation and is based on
        a highly modular architectural design. The FLX500 significantly reduces the entry point for
        users seeking the benefits of automation without the previously assumed need for high
        volume part consumption. The FLX500 family ranges in price from approximately $76,000 to
        $92,000.
 
During
        the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company introduced the Flash Media Duplicator (FLX-FMD).
        The Flash Media Duplicator is a solution designed to support flash media that uses the SD
        and MMC file formats for managed NAND, including small format portable media cards, as well
        as BGA package versions of this technology. Flash Media Duplicator is for OEM users of
        flash media, either in embedded applications or for duplication of in-box flash cards. The
        FLX-FMD ranges in price from approximately $79,000 to $110,000.

Non-Automated Programming Systems
 
Our line
        of non-automated programming systems provides solutions for both engineering and low to
        medium-volume manufacturing customers. Non-automated programming systems require a user to
        physically handle the devices being programmed. These types of programmers are also
        sometimes referred to as “manual” or “desktop” programmers. We have
        three families of non-automated programmers: Sprint, UniSystem and FlashPAK.
 

Engineering customers typically use single-site programming systems during
        the prototype phase of a new design, and may purchase inexpensive systems for limited
        volume device needs or more expensive systems to support more complex devices or a large
        variety of device packages. Single-site programming systems can perform programming on only
        one programmable device at a time.
 
Data I/O
        offers refurbished universal single socket manual programming solutions through our
        UniSystem family of programming systems. Our UniSite and 3980xpi programming systems offer
        the highest levels of signal integrity, which ensure the highest programming standards.
        Popular in military, aerospace, telecommunications and other mission critical applications,
        the systems range from approximately $7,795 to $24,000.
 
For more
        cost constrained or higher volume applications, the Sprint family of products offers
        excellent value for the money and versatility. The Sprint Quad and Octal programming
        systems offer 4 and 8 socket universal programming configurations for higher volume
        applications. The Sprint family of products range in price from under $1,000 to $20,000 for
        the multiple socket solutions.
 
Our
        highest volume manual programmer, the FlashPAK, leverages the high-speed proprietary
        FlashCORE programming technology in the ProLINE-RoadRunner system. We believe FlashPAK,
        starting at approximately $8,700, is the world’s fastest programming architecture,
        limited today only by the speed at which Flash devices can accept data. FlashPAK is another
        key element of Data I/O’s connected strategy, providing OEMs and new product
        introduction facilities with a high performance Flash programming system that can be used
        to validate designs before moving down the firmware supply chain. For manufacturing
        applications, the FlashPAK, a high speed, multi-socket, small footprint desktop solution,
        provides manual programming operations with the highest level of flexibility at the lowest
        cost per part. Manufacturers that use manual programming because of lower labor costs in
        areas like Asia find FlashPAK an attractive solution.
 
Data I/O
        supports and completes our product offering with a full range of software and device update
        products and worldwide service and repair capability.

We work closely with leading manufacturers of programmable devices to develop our products to meet the requirements of a particular device. 
 
Data I/Os line of programming systems includes a broad range of products, systems, modules, and accessories, which we group into two general categories: automated programming systems and non-automated programming systems.  We provide automated programming systems in three categories: off-line, in-line, and on-board (also known as In-system Programming). In addition, we provide device support and service on all of our products. Device support is a critical aspect of our business and consists of writing software algorithms for devices and developing socket adapters to hold and connect to the device for programming.
 
Within the categories of automated solutions and non-automated systems, Data I/O targets specific solutions at specific market segments. Data I/O optimizes the solution based on the customers device, process and business needs. Data I/Os flagship programming platform, FlashCORE, has the speed and pricing to provide the best value in the industry, making it the leading choice for high volume production. Data I/O technical teams work closely with semiconductor manufacturers to actively plan for programming support of new devices and physical packages. The FlashCORE platform is used worldwide to program NOR Flash devices from all providers, including market leaders, Intel, Renesas, Spansion and Toshiba. Data I/O leads the industry in providing solutions for NAND flash programming from Hynix, Micron, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, Toshiba, msystems (SanDisk) DiskOnChip and others. The dynamics
of the flash market are changing, blurring the distinction of NAND and NOR technologies and the emergence of converged offerings, including Samsungs OneNAND and Spansions ORNAND, also supported on FlashCORE systems. Data I/Os strong partnerships with leading semiconductor companies greatly enhance our ability to serve our mutual customers. 
Target customers include OEMs and EMSs of electronic consumer products, like the fast-growing portable/wireless devices, cellular handsets and smart appliances.  These applications are high volume users of programmable flash memory devices. 
 
In portable electronics products, shrinking form factors are driving the shrinkage of device packages. Manual programming and handling of these tiny packages is increasingly impractical due to quality issues. This trend toward small packages should drive demand for Data I/Os automated programming systems in 2007.

Applications targeted for these tiny devices include automotive, consumer appliances, remote controls, medical devices, portable/personal electronics, PC peripherals, hand-held and wearable PCs, telecommunications including phones and pagers, security alarms and sensors.
TaskLink® for Windows provides a universal job set-up tool that intuitively guides users in preparing product data files for programming.   TaskLink is also a key element of our Connected Strategy. Leveraging network connectivity, Data I/Os TaskLink provides monitoring and control over programming systems anywhere on the network  providing global companies with greater visibility and control over remote production lines or contract manufacturing processes. In late 2006, Data I/O began to provide a number of application specific software products and related hardware that were developed in response to customer requirements.  The value of our application-software further differentiates Data I/O from other providers.
Automated Programming Solutions
 
Data I/O provides our manufacturing and programming center customers with automated programming systems solutions that include robotic handlers, a variety of programmers, input and output media handling (such as tray stackers, tubes, loaders or taping), and marking solutions. Our ProLINE-RoadRunner is a unique in-line programming system with programming speed capability, which approaches the speed at which Flash devices can currently accept data. Many of our customers need to program Flash and microcontroller devices in large quantities and very quickly. ProLINE-RoadRunner mounts directly on the assembly machine in the production line (Siemens, Fuji, Universal, Panasonic and Assembleon machines) and delivers programmed parts from reels of blank devices to the production line in a just-in-time fashion. Our ProLINE-RoadRunner eliminates production
bottlenecks associated with high-density Flash and microcontroller devices, allowing last minute firmware changes and eliminating programmed part inventories, ultimately streamlining and reducing the customers production and process costs. ProLINE-RoadRunner enables customers to implement lean processes and is a key element in Data I/Os Connected Strategy, allowing customers and partners to more effectively manage their firmware supply chain. ProLINE-RoadRunner currently retails from $72,500 to $118,000, depending on programming capability. 
Data I/Os PS family of automated programming solutions offers highly flexible solutions for off-line batch programming.  Data I/O can configure PS systems to support not only Flash devices, but also a wide variety of other devices, such as microcontrollers. These systems provide a number of marking, labeling, and input/output options. Most importantly, customers can make changeovers extremely fast. This feature allows the customer to rapidly respond to diverse demands with very little downtime. Customers can optimize the PS family systems for any job to maximize throughput and, when combined with fast changeover times and high reliability, provide the highest levels of output during a production shift. Our PS588 integrates the same FlashCORE programmer we use in our PS288, PS300 FlashCORE, ProLINE-RoadRunner and FlashPAK and builds on our Connected Strategy and common architecture. The PS588
significantly improves throughput and lowers the cost per programmed part. The PS family products range in price from approximately $149,200 to $430,000.
 
In the last quarter of 2006, the Company began shipping the FLX500, the industrys first desktop automated programming and handling system. The FLX500 sets a new standard in the user experience for automation programming systems. Its graphical user interface eliminates the issue of language usage for the operator. It was designed for plug and play operation and is based on a highly modular architectural design. The FLX500 significantly reduces the entry point for users seeking the benefits of automation without the previously assumed need for high volume part consumption. The FLX500 family ranges in price from approximately $76,000 to $100,000.
 
Data I/Os ImageWriter-200 and ImageWriter-300 are our solutions for in-systems programming of programmable microcontrollers and serial memory mounted on the printed circuit board.  These solutions are designed to be integrated into the line generally in a test fixture. The primary markets for ImageWriter are microcontroller applications in automotive electronics, industrial automation and consumer electronics. Pricing for the ImageWriter starts at approximately $2,000 for the first unit with most installations requiring multiple units. 
 
Non-Automated Programming Systems
 
Our line of non-automated programming systems provides solutions for both engineering and low to medium-volume manufacturing customers. Non-automated programming systems require a user to physically handle the devices being programmed. These types of programmers are also sometimes referred to as manual or desktop programmers. We now have three families of non-automated programmers: Sprint, UniSystem and FlashPAK.
 
Engineering customers typically use single-site programming systems during the prototype phase of a new design, and may purchase inexpensive systems for limited volume device needs or more expensive systems to support more complex devices or a large variety of device packages. Single-site programming systems can perform programming on only one programmable device at a time. 
 
Data I/O offers a range of high quality, universal single socket manual programming solutions through our UniSystem family

of programming systems. Our UniSite and 3980xpi programming systems offer the highest levels of signal integrity, which ensure the highest programming standards. Popular in military, aerospace, telecommunications and other mission critical applications, the systems range from approximately $15,000 to $35,000.
 
For more cost constrained or higher volume applications, the Sprint family of products offers excellent value for the money and versatility. The Sprint Quad and Octal programming systems offer 4 and 8 socket universal programming configurations for higher volume applications. The Sprint family of products range in price from under $1,000 to $20,000 for the multiple socket solutions.
 
Our highest volume manual programmer, the FlashPAK, leverages the high-speed proprietary FlashCORE programming technology in the ProLINE-RoadRunner system. We believe FlashPAK, starting at approximately $7,500, is the worlds fastest programming architecture, limited today only by the speed at which Flash devices can accept data. FlashPAK is another key element of Data I/Os connected strategy, providing OEMs and new product introduction facilities with a high performance Flash programming system that can be used to validate designs before moving down the firmware supply chain. For manufacturing applications, the FlashPAK, a high speed, multi-socket, small footprint desktop solution, provides manual programming operations with the highest level of flexibility at the lowest cost per part. Manufacturers that use manual programming because of lower labor costs in areas like Asia find FlashPAK an
attractive solution.
 
Data I/O supports and completes our product offering with a full range of software and device update products and worldwide service and repair capability.

History[edit]
Data I/O was incorporated in 1969.[2] Before the IBM PC was introduced, the company developed equipment that allowed electronic designers to program the non-volatile semiconductor devices with data stored on punched cards or ASCII-encoded (eight-level) punched paper tape. Over the next three decades the company rode the non-volatile technology wave as Bipolar, EPROM, EEPROM, NOR FLASH, Antifuse, FRAM and most recently, NAND FLASH devices were introduced by semiconductor vendors.
While not manufacturing semiconductors itself, Data I/O's business is the design and manufacture of equipment that transfers data into various non-volatile semiconductor devices. These devices commonly are Flash Memory, Microcontroller devices and Programmable Logic Devices.
Products[edit]
Current[edit]
Introduced in 2000, Data I/O FlashCORE technology is optimized for programming of NAND and NOR based flash devices and Flash microcontrollers and is sold in FlashPAK, PS-System, FLX500, and ProLINE-RoadRunner programmer models spanning engineering to high-volume offline and inline "just-in-time" manufacturing. Data I/O provides Tasklink for Windows software to set up FlashCORE programmers and specify data sources. In addition, they develop software that manages automated and remote programming, secures data and manages device serialization. Many of these work with TaskLink, while others are independent software packages.
Data I/O manufactures two device programmers that can accommodate DIP (through-hole) devices, the Plus-48 and the Optima. Both are aimed at the small, (relatively) low-cost, desktop programmer (engineering) market.
Legacy[edit]




Data I/O Model 29B Universal Programmer with a UniPak 2


Model 1[edit]
One of their first attempts at a 'Universal' programmer was the Model 1, Model 5 (TTL-Sequencer based), Model 9 (Microprocessor based),and the System 19 (introduced in the late 1970s). It utilized interchangeable device sockets and configuration plug-in printed-circuit cards, consisting mainly of resistors, diodes and jumpers, to allow reading and programming of a variety of memory devices.
System 29[edit]
In the early 1980s the System 29 series emerged. The first model, the 29A, added user RAM, and eliminated the need for configuration cards by offering keypad-programmable 'Family' and 'Pinout' codes to configure the programmer. Introduced along with the 29A was the 'Unipak,' a large plug-in adapter that featured multiple sizes of ZIF sockets to reduce the need for changing socket modules. Since the Unipak was limited to dealing with memory devices, an additional accessory series, called the 'LogicPak,' was introduced to handle programmable logic devices (PALs, GALs, etc.)
Later models featured a series of fixed sockets and an interchangeable socket module in one housing. Memory devices up to 40 pins in size could be read or programmed with the simple installation of the appropriate socket module. The 29B chassis could accommodate up to 1MB of user RAM.
Unifamily[edit]
Around 1987, Data I/O introduced the first of the 'Unifamily' programmers in the form of the 'Unisite.' This was their first engineering programmer to feature software-programmable pin drivers, a technology that allows any pin of the device socket to be configured, through software, for power, ground or nearly any type of programming waveform.
The first model in this line, the Unisite-40, featured a removable module with a single 40-pin DIP ZIF socket, called the SITE-40 and space to install optional programming adapters to the right of this DIP module. Such modules included the 'SetSite,' a module containing eight 40-pin ZIF sockets to allow gang programming of up to eight identical memory devices, and the 'ChipSite,' an early multi-socket module accommodating several sizes of PLCC and SOIC DIP packages with 'clamshell' ZIF sockets.
The final successor to the ChipSite unit was the PinSite. This featured a universal programming base which could accept a variety of socket adapters, including those for chips packaged in PGA, QFP, TSOP, and many others. There was even a special connection module made available which could, through the Pinsite's base, allow the Unisite to serve as the programming source in automated device handlers in factory floor environments.
The Unifamily was the first series of Data I/O's programmers to feature a built-in user menu. All the programmer required for basic operation was a dumb terminal, hooked up via an RS-232 serial port. Facilities were also provided for computer-based remote control via a second serial port.
The early Unifamily all booted and ran from software stored on 720k floppy diskettes (in the case of the Unisite) or on 1.44MB floppies (in the case of other Unifamily members). This software consists of the operator's menu system, self-test routines and device algorithms. Later in production, an option for installation of a miniature hard drive was provided (See MSM, or Mass Storage Module, below). The Unisite is the only programmer that still requires true 720k floppies for non-MSM operation, or updating the MSM's software without the aid of external PC-based software.
The Unisite was the flagship model of the Unifamily line, selling for over $35,000 in a typical configuration and staying in active production for at least 20 years. Data I/O, in an effort to make the Unifamily line more attractive to companies with tighter budgets, introduced several other programmers utilizing the same pin-driver technology as the Unisite, all selling for (typically) under $10,000. These included the model 2900, 3900, 3980, and 3980XPi. These units varied in capability, primarily in terms of the number of pin drivers. The basic 2900 featured 44 drivers, while the 39xx series all had 88. Data I/O developed a proprietary multiplexing scheme which allowed Unifamily programmers, equipped with their maximum number of hardware pin drivers, to handle devices with up to 240 pins.
Other differences in the series are minor. Models share a common base design and feature the ability to boot and run from floppy diskettes and provide an internal menu.
The differences are primarily in features. The Unisite, less than a year of entering production, was revised in the form of a new DIP module, referred to as the 'Site48.' This adapter had 48 pins in its DIP socket, and remained the standard for many years. Its successor, the Site48-HS, is functionally identical, but utilizes solid-state switching for the socket pins instead of the electromechanical relays in earlier adapters such as the 2900 and 39xx series.
The Unisites featured 512K of user RAM, standard. Field-installable upgrade kits, consisting of a separate memory board, an appropriate number of 30-pin SIMMs, a mounting bracket and interconnecting cable, were made available to upgrade these early units to 1MB or 8MB. The price for the 8MB upgrade kit was around $495 in the mid-1990s. These early kits required considerable labor to install, including extensive disassembly of the programmer, as the memory board was designed to mount under the main circuit board.
In response to these difficulties, as well as improvements in available technology, the Unisite's main circuit board soon received major revisions. These included the removal of most of the DIP-based DRAM chips, and the addition of two 30-pin memory module sockets on the main board. With these changes, upgrading the programmer's available RAM became much easier, requiring only the removal of the top cover, installation of two SIMMs, and replacing one PAL chip.
Mass Storage Module[edit]
The revisions to the UniSite main board were done to support a new option. Data I/O created the Mass Storage Module (MSM). This consisted of an additional circuit board containing a miniature hard disk drive (either a 2.5 inch PATA/IDE device or a PCMCIA Type III card drive, depending on revision level) and appropriate interface circuitry. All the programmer's operating software and device algorithms could be transferred to the MSM's drive in less than a half-hour, obsoleting floppy diskettes.
The latest revision is entirely solid-state, consisting of a single large FPGA chip as the board's glue logic, an SPROM (Serial Programmable Read-Only Memory) chip, containing the FPGA's operating code, a few SRAM chips for buffering and a solid-state or 'Flash' drive.
The MSM remains an optional, field-installable module for the 3900 and Unisite. Unisite programmers require 8MB of user RAM and controller board revision 701-2313-00 or higher to utilize this option. In addition, the MSM requires operating software revisions of 6.6 or above.
All 3900 series programmers are MSM-compatible at the hardware level. Successful installation of the MSM in a 3900 programmer automatically turns it into the model 3980.
MSM adds another option, a high-speed parallel port interface that supplements the programmer's serial port. In conjunction with a Windows-based PC, and Data I/O's TaskLink software, the parallel port greatly enhances the speed of data transfers to and from the programmer. As one example, a 1MB data file takes at least two minutes to be transferred into or out of a Unifamily programmer via the serial port at its highest available speed (19200 baud). The same file, transferred with the parallel port's help, takes around 30–40 seconds.
Any Unifamily programmer with 'XPi' after its name (Unisite-XPi, 3980-XPi) already has the MSM and parallel port options installed as standard equipment. These programmers represent the end of the Unifamily line and, although no longer in production, are fully supported.

This featured a universal programming base which could accept a variety of socket adapters, including those for chips packaged in PGA, QFP, TSOP, and many others. There was even a special connection module made available which could, through the Pinsite's base, allow the Unisite to serve as the programming source in automated device handlers in factory floor environments.
The Unifamily was the first series of Data I/O's programmers to feature a built-in user menu. All the programmer required for basic operation was a dumb terminal, hooked up via an RS-232 serial port. Facilities were also provided for computer-based remote control via a second serial port.
The early Unifamily all booted and ran from software stored on 720k floppy diskettes (in the case of the Unisite) or on 1.44MB floppies (in the case of other Unifamily members). This software consists of the operator's menu system, self-test routines and device algorithms. Later in production, an option for installation of a miniature hard drive was provided (See MSM, or Mass Storage Module, below). The Unisite is the only programmer that still requires true 720k floppies for non-MSM operation, or updating the MSM's software without the aid of external PC-based software.
The Unisite was the flagship model of the Unifamily line, selling for over $35,000 in a typical configuration and staying in active production for at least 20 years. Data I/O, in an effort to make the Unifamily line more attractive to companies with tighter budgets, introduced several other programmers utilizing the same pin-driver technology as the Unisite, all selling for (typically) under $10,000. These included the model 2900, 3900, 3980, and 3980XPi. These units varied in capability, primarily in terms of the number of pin drivers. The basic 2900 featured 44 drivers, while the 39xx series all had 88. Data I/O developed a proprietary multiplexing scheme which allowed Unifamily programmers, equipped with their maximum number of hardware pin drivers, to handle devices with up to 240 pins.
Other differences in the series are minor. Models share a common base design and feature the ability to boot and run from floppy diskettes and provide an internal menu.
The differences are primarily in features. The Unisite, less than a year of entering production, was revised in the form of a new DIP module, referred to as the 'Site48.' This adapter had 48 pins in its DIP socket, and remained the standard for many years. Its successor, the Site48-HS, is functionally identical, but utilizes solid-state switching for the socket pins instead of the electromechanical relays in earlier adapters such as the 2900 and 39xx series.
The Unisites featured 512K of user RAM, standard. Field-installable upgrade kits, consisting of a separate memory board, an appropriate number of 30-pin SIMMs, a mounting bracket and interconnecting cable, were made available to upgrade these early units to 1MB or 8MB. The price for the 8MB upgrade kit was around $495 in the mid-1990s. These early kits required considerable labor to install, including extensive disassembly of the programmer, as the memory board was designed to mount under the main circuit board.
In response to these difficulties, as well as improvements in available technology, the Unisite's main circuit board soon received major revisions. These included the removal of most of the DIP-based DRAM chips, and the addition of two 30-pin memory module sockets on the main board. With these changes, upgrading the programmer's available RAM became much easier, requiring only the removal of the top cover, installation of two SIMMs, and replacing one PAL chip.
Mass Storage Module[edit]
The revisions to the UniSite main board were done to support a new option. Data I/O created the Mass Storage Module (MSM). This consisted of an additional circuit board containing a miniature hard disk drive (either a 2.5 inch PATA/IDE device or a PCMCIA Type III card drive, depending on revision level) and appropriate interface circuitry. All the programmer's operating software and device algorithms could be transferred to the MSM's drive in less than a half-hour, obsoleting floppy diskettes.
The latest revision is entirely solid-state, consisting of a single large FPGA chip as the board's glue logic, an SPROM (Serial Programmable Read-Only Memory) chip, containing the FPGA's operating code, a few SRAM chips for buffering and a solid-state or 'Flash' drive.
The MSM remains an optional, field-installable module for the 3900 and Unisite. Unisite programmers require 8MB of user RAM and controller board revision 701-2313-00 or higher to utilize this option. In addition, the MSM requires operating software revisions of 6.6 or above.
All 3900 series programmers are MSM-compatible at the hardware level. Successful installation of the MSM in a 3900 programmer automatically turns it into the model 3980.
MSM adds another option, a high-speed parallel port interface that supplements the programmer's serial port. In conjunction with a Windows-based PC, and Data I/O's TaskLink software, the parallel port greatly enhances the speed of data transfers to and from the programmer. As one example, a 1MB data file takes at least two minutes to be transferred into or out of a Unifamily programmer via the serial port at its highest available speed (19200 baud). The same file, transferred with the parallel port's help, takes around 30–40 seconds.
Any Unifamily programmer with 'XPi' after its name (Unisite-XPi, 3980-XPi) already has the MSM and parallel port options installed as standard equipment. These programmers represent the end of the Unifamily line and, although no longer in production, are fully supported.

History[edit]
Data I/O was incorporated in 1969.[2] Before the IBM PC was introduced, the company developed equipment that allowed electronic designers to program the non-volatile semiconductor devices with data stored on punched cards or ASCII-encoded (eight-level) punched paper tape. Over the next three decades the company rode the non-volatile technology wave as Bipolar, EPROM, EEPROM, NOR FLASH, Antifuse, FRAM and most recently, NAND FLASH devices were introduced by semiconductor vendors.
While not manufacturing semiconductors itself, Data I/O's business is the design and manufacture of equipment that transfers data into various non-volatile semiconductor devices. These devices commonly are Flash Memory, Microcontroller devices and Programmable Logic Devices.
Products[edit]
Current[edit]
Introduced in 2000, Data I/O FlashCORE technology is optimized for programming of NAND and NOR based flash devices and Flash microcontrollers and is sold in FlashPAK, PS-System, FLX500, and ProLINE-RoadRunner programmer models spanning engineering to high-volume offline and inline "just-in-time" manufacturing. Data I/O provides Tasklink for Windows software to set up FlashCORE programmers and specify data sources. In addition, they develop software that manages automated and remote programming, secures data and manages device serialization. Many of these work with TaskLink, while others are independent software packages.
Data I/O manufactures two device programmers that can accommodate DIP (through-hole) devices, the Plus-48 and the Optima. Both are aimed at the small, (relatively) low-cost, desktop programmer (engineering) market.
Legacy[edit]




Data I/O Model 29B Universal Programmer with a UniPak 2


Model 1[edit]
One of their first attempts at a 'Universal' programmer was the Model 1, Model 5 (TTL-Sequencer based), Model 9 (Microprocessor based),and the System 19 (introduced in the late 1970s). It utilized interchangeable device sockets and configuration plug-in printed-circuit cards, consisting mainly of resistors, diodes and jumpers, to allow reading and programming of a variety of memory devices.
System 29[edit]
In the early 1980s the System 29 series emerged. The first model, the 29A, added user RAM, and eliminated the need for configuration cards by offering keypad-programmable 'Family' and 'Pinout' codes to configure the programmer. Introduced along with the 29A was the 'Unipak,' a large plug-in adapter that featured multiple sizes of ZIF sockets to reduce the need for changing socket modules. Since the Unipak was limited to dealing with memory devices, an additional accessory series, called the 'LogicPak,' was introduced to handle programmable logic devices (PALs, GALs, etc.)
Later models featured a series of fixed sockets and an interchangeable socket module in one housing. Memory devices up to 40 pins in size could be read or programmed with the simple installation of the appropriate socket module. The 29B chassis could accommodate up to 1MB of user RAM.
Unifamily[edit]
Around 1987, Data I/O introduced the first of the 'Unifamily' programmers in the form of the 'Unisite.' This was their first engineering programmer to feature software-programmable pin drivers, a technology that allows any pin of the device socket to be configured, through software, for power, ground or nearly any type of programming waveform.
The first model in this line, the Unisite-40, featured a removable module with a single 40-pin DIP ZIF socket, called the SITE-40 and space to install optional programming adapters to the right of this DIP module. Such modules included the 'SetSite,' a module containing eight 40-pin ZIF sockets to allow gang programming of up to eight identical memory devices, and the 'ChipSite,' an early multi-socket module accommodating several sizes of PLCC and SOIC DIP packages with 'clamshell' ZIF sockets.
The final successor to the ChipSite unit was the PinSite. This featured a universal programming base which could accept a variety of socket adapters, including those for chips packaged in PGA, QFP, TSOP, and many others. There was even a special connection module made available which could, through the Pinsite's base, allow the Unisite to serve as the programming source in automated device handlers in factory floor environments.
The Unifamily was the first series of Data I/O's programmers to feature a built-in user menu. All the programmer required for basic operation was a dumb terminal, hooked up via an RS-232 serial port. Facilities were also provided for computer-based remote control via a second serial port.
The early Unifamily all booted and ran from software stored on 720k floppy diskettes (in the case of the Unisite) or on 1.44MB floppies (in the case of other Unifamily members). This software consists of the operator's menu system, self-test routines and device algorithms. Later in production, an option for installation of a miniature hard drive was provided (See MSM, or Mass Storage Module, below). The Unisite is the only programmer that still requires true 720k floppies for non-MSM operation, or updating the MSM's software without the aid of external PC-based software.
The Unisite was the flagship model of the Unifamily line, selling for over $35,000 in a typical configuration and staying in active production for at least 20 years. Data I/O, in an effort to make the Unifamily line more attractive to companies with tighter budgets, introduced several other programmers utilizing the same pin-driver technology as the Unisite, all selling for (typically) under $10,000. These included the model 2900, 3900, 3980, and 3980XPi. These units varied in capability, primarily in terms of the number of pin drivers. The basic 2900 featured 44 drivers, while the 39xx series all had 88. Data I/O developed a proprietary multiplexing scheme which allowed Unifamily programmers, equipped with their maximum number of hardware pin drivers, to handle devices with up to 240 pins.
Other differences in the series are minor. Models share a common base design and feature the ability to boot and run from floppy diskettes and provide an internal menu.
The differences are primarily in features. The Unisite, less than a year of entering production, was revised in the form of a new DIP module, referred to as the 'Site48.' This adapter had 48 pins in its DIP socket, and remained the standard for many years. Its successor, the Site48-HS, is functionally identical, but utilizes solid-state switching for the socket pins instead of the electromechanical relays in earlier adapters such as the 2900 and 39xx series.
The Unisites featured 512K of user RAM, standard. Field-installable upgrade kits, consisting of a separate memory board, an appropriate number of 30-pin SIMMs, a mounting bracket and interconnecting cable, were made available to upgrade these early units to 1MB or 8MB. The price for the 8MB upgrade kit was around $495 in the mid-1990s. These early kits required considerable labor to install, including extensive disassembly of the programmer, as the memory board was designed to mount under the main circuit board.
In response to these difficulties, as well as improvements in available technology, the Unisite's main circuit board soon received major revisions. These included the removal of most of the DIP-based DRAM chips, and the addition of two 30-pin memory module sockets on the main board. With these changes, upgrading the programmer's available RAM became much easier, requiring only the removal of the top cover, installation of two SIMMs, and replacing one PAL chip.
Mass Storage Module[edit]
The revisions to the UniSite main board were done to support a new option. Data I/O created the Mass Storage Module (MSM). This consisted of an additional circuit board containing a miniature hard disk drive (either a 2.5 inch PATA/IDE device or a PCMCIA Type III card drive, depending on revision level) and appropriate interface circuitry. All the programmer's operating software and device algorithms could be transferred to the MSM's drive in less than a half-hour, obsoleting floppy diskettes.
The latest revision is entirely solid-state, consisting of a single large FPGA chip as the board's glue logic, an SPROM (Serial Programmable Read-Only Memory) chip, containing the FPGA's operating code, a few SRAM chips for buffering and a solid-state or 'Flash' drive.
The MSM remains an optional, field-installable module for the 3900 and Unisite. Unisite programmers require 8MB of user RAM and controller board revision 701-2313-00 or higher to utilize this option. In addition, the MSM requires operating software revisions of 6.6 or above.
All 3900 series programmers are MSM-compatible at the hardware level. Successful installation of the MSM in a 3900 programmer automatically turns it into the model 3980.
MSM adds another option, a high-speed parallel port interface that supplements the programmer's serial port. In conjunction with a Windows-based PC, and Data I/O's TaskLink software, the parallel port greatly enhances the speed of data transfers to and from the programmer. As one example, a 1MB data file takes at least two minutes to be transferred into or out of a Unifamily programmer via the serial port at its highest available speed (19200 baud). The same file, transferred with the parallel port's help, takes around 30–40 seconds.
Any Unifamily programmer with 'XPi' after its name (Unisite-XPi, 3980-XPi) already has the MSM and parallel port options installed as standard equipment. These programmers represent the end of the Unifamily line and, although no longer in production, are fully supported.
